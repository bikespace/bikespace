This bill is explicit in its ignorance to the value of the environment as a service that provides some climate change regulation, flood mitigation, carbon dioxide catchment, and species safety. Ontario has recently created a full natural area from Lake Ontario to the Oak Ridges Morraine, and this is crucial for species, and water management and regulation.
I foresee that this bill would allow future, extremely detrimental development on sensitive lands. This directly threatens our clean water with inevitable waste breaches (oil spills, residue from machinery). Walkerton can be recalled as an example for the necessity of protecting our water.
The Rogue Valley park was just deemed the first national park in an urban area. Developments in close surrounding areas will bring the value of this park down.

We should not, as citizens of Ontario, be sacrificing our natural capital to pad the pockets of developers and industries. We only get one chance - once the green space is gone, and the rivers and lakes polluted it can't be undone.
In addition, the proposal to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act must be a joke. Are we really considering making it easier to pollute so Ontario can be more competitive as a place to do business? This is a trade off that we are willing to make? Why aren't we focusing on making Ontario more competitive to businesses and industry that DON'T pollute? Bring in some incentive programs to draw clean industries into our province - create jobs AND protect the environment! You can have it both ways!

And not only the Greenbelt, it threatens hard fought for and valued protections for Clean Water, Great Lakes, Lake Simcoe and the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Government has a sacred responsibility to protect the places we love and the vital resources we need.
The Premier plans to break this sacred trust.
Reducing regulatory costs should not be an excuse to pave over farmland and remove protections for our water.
Candidate Ford backtracked on his plan to open the Greenbelt for development. Premier Ford is breaking that promise and putting his deep pocketed developers and donors before the people of Ontario and the places we love.
The Premier is mistaken in assuming we need to open up our environmentally sensitive areas. The Greenbelt is not driving up the cost of business.
Ford’s plan to pave over farmland and wetlands will cost billions in damages due to flooding from extreme weather events.
According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, severe weather such as floods, wildfires, droughts and ice storms caused $4.9 billion in insurable damage in 2016. The costs in the first six months of this year alone is $350 per household.
These costs will only grow if the Premier paves over sensitive green space that is needed to absorb water from climate induced extreme weather events.

The next generations are entitled to grow up with the same quality and diversity of life that we have enjoyed.
2.  Placing economic gain ahead of child care, increasing the number of babies being cared for by caregivers for dollars.
3. Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 and underlying regulations in 2021.   This legislation was enacted to reduce toxic substances through legislation, education and incentive programs.
4.  Repeal of the Wireless Services Agreements Act, 2013.  This legislation was enacted to protected consumers ensuring plain language contracts and administrative cost caps.
5.  Mashing all these different amendments into one bill without thorough public consultation.

As a new mom I know it's daunting to leave a child in the care of someone else and I have been experiencing how difficult it is to find a daycare. However, I would not wish to increase the amount of children per caregiver. Quality care is far more important. Having more licensed care providers and affordable daycares is what is truly needed. Infants and young children require a lot of attention to help them develop and to keep them safe. I think any parent would agree with that.
I am also concerned with the changes to the Toxics Reduction Act. Canada has such a beautiful and rich environment. It's one of the things that attracts people to the country in the first place. We should not be sacrificing the health of our citizens and our land for businesses who could care less and only wish to make a quick dollar at our expense. I do not want my fellow citizens exposed to more toxins and ending up with devastating health effects just so a business can make some money. The way of the future is investing in eco friendly solutions to preserve our land and protect our future generations.
With regards to the Employment Standards Act, it was created to protect employees from being taken advantage of by employers. With the changes proposed, employees will be left open for abuse by employers with regards to hours and overtime. If you think that no employer would abuse the work hours to avoid hiring additional staff, you're living in a fantasy land. We have seen the implications of excess work hours in other countries. It has lead to higher rates of suicide and illness. Family life is also impacted when parents work long hours.
These changes proposed will not help the people of the country only businesses at our expense. Jobs shouldn't come at the expense of health, wellbeing, our children and the environment. Without health we can't work. Without more safe, licensed and affordable care for our children we can't work. Without our clean environment we will have lost everything for our future generations.

14094,/comment/14094,"Proposed changes to home-based childcare regulations fail to truly address the need for affordable quality childcare spaces in Ontario. I believe that these changes will not have the intended effect.
The public reporting aspect of the Ontario Toxics Reduction Program empowers consumers to make informed purchasing decisions in relation to substances of concern. Making this documentation available on the internet is not redundant concerning the Federal Chemicals Management Plan and should therefore not be repealed with the intent of reducing redundancy. Furthermore, other aspects of the program, such as those empowering provincial officers to inspect facilities and acts relating specifically to Ontario's interests (particularly involving clean water), are safeguards not provided by the Federal Chemicals Management Plan for which repealing has no established purpose. These safeguards allow the province to make decisions regarding the safe or reduced use of toxic substances more quickly than the federal government is able to and on a scale most relevant to Ontario residents, ensuring that environmental protections are maintained in an ever-changing commercial world. Finally, the generation of internal reports on toxic substances provide an opportunity for employees to educate themselves on the substances with which they work and the risks they pose to the environment. Employees who do not understand regulations are more likely to see them as hampering their work and are less likely to obey them. Internal reporting also forces businesses, though they may ignore the recommendations they make, to consider methods of reducing the production of toxic substances. If I were to approve the repealing of this regulation, I would like to see evidence that internal reporting has no significant effect on businesses choices regarding reducing the production of toxic materials.
Regarding Municipal Affairs and Housing, I am loathe to allow any loopholes in acts intended to protect the single greatest resource that Ontario has to offer: fresh water. The short-term benefits of allowing municipalities to circumvent the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Act, and the protections surrounding the Green Belt and Oak Ridges Moraine are far outweighed by the potential for long-term consequences of damaging water reservoirs and the environment surrounding them. Unless provided with strict policies ensuring that water will still be protected sufficiently despite construction interests, I cannot approve of the proposed open-for-business planning tool.

I am very concerned that passing this bill will put people in danger. While most would agree cutting “red tape” in a general sense is smart, what that actually means to people and to this government can be very different.
I and worried about losening regulations on daycares. The amount of trust a parent has to put into a daycare is extreme and the government should be providing peace of mind that these facilities are well regulated and are able to handle the immense responsibility put in them. Increasing the number of children an unlicensed daycare provider can care for does not add peace of mind in my view.
Secondly, I am very opposed to the bylaw changes for municipalities to allow for exemptions or bypassing of criticality important environmental and planning standards. Paving the way for major development of green spaces, tainting our water supplies and the Great Lakes cannot be offered to developers who are only guided by profits. Not developing the green belt was also a campaign issue when The now premier had to backtrack and pledge to NOT open the green belt to development. This bill goes back on that promise.
These regulations and planning requirements were put in place to protect us and our natural resources and the government should take that responsibility seriously. Once an area is developed, we can never get it back.
I hope you reconsider the immense changes you are proposing and fully realize the potential consequences of opening up invaluable land to commercial or industrial development.

So if young families need to burden the costs of higher childcare fees, where would the worker force come from when mom and dads stay home to take care of their infant/toddler rather than work because the wages are lower than uncapped childcare fees?
Also, the wireless service agreement act was due to fine prints that wireless companies were using to literally con citizens when they sign for a new phone. There’s no “open for business” for outright false claims in wireless contracts. If that’s the case, people will go back to buying devices outright rather than being pushed around by wireless carriers. Since this regulation was enacted by the previous government, wireless plans have gone down in pricing, which means more competitiveness in the market. What PC government is doing is anti-capitalism and does not serve in the interest of competition and making Ontario open for business.
Last thing is regulation on water safety. Retracting from rules set after the Walkerton crisis will diminish the oversight water agencies perform on their drinking water supply. The reason why they were there is to protect the people and put more diligence on the water agencies. There is no reason to reduce the criteria for safety of water and consider that to open up the market to private companies like OWCA.

In this day and age of increasing awareness and fear about climate change and its effects, and increasing awareness of the relationship between our actions/ industries to environmental damage and climate change- we should be more than ever concerned about protecting the environment and drinking water. So creating a bill to remove protection from toxic chemicals for Ontario residents, threaten drinking water supply, and advance developmental proposals in formerly protected areas (as per ""Environmental Defence"") is exactly what you should NOT be doing.
Ontario needs to promote small businesses but NOT at the expense of the health of Ontarians, and, since environmental damage does not know provincial or federal boundries - threaten the world.
There are many historical examples of big business holding governments of Canada to ransom by suggesting that legislation surrounding health and safety and against environmental damage by toxins will cause business to fail and result in job loss. My research suggest the threat of job loss is overblown and exaggerated by businesses many of which are non Canadian.
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has recently criticized the UN migration pact on basis that it could lead to erosion of Canada’s sovereign authority  to make decisions over immigration and gives influence  over Canada’s immigration system to  foreign entities.
“Canada and Canada alone should make decisions on who comes into our country and under what circumstances”
Well this pertains to our environment also - Canada / Ontario alone should make decisions on the environmental safety of our country/ province. This should NOT be left up to big business - Canadian or other.
This is the time for action against climate change. The very health and welfare of our children and future generations depends on our acting responsibly and aggressively. Bill 66 is not responsible and is not the right thing at this critical time. One has to wonder why Mr Ford's government is so lacking in concern for the younger generations who will be most affected by climate change. Does the younger generation not matter to the Mr Ford's Conservative party ? Easing daycare ratios for the youngest children without appropriate consultation - also in Bill 66, further suggests lack of concern for the younger generation. (Childcare access can be improved by other means than those proposed).
There are some examples of legal challenges to governments who are not responding appropriately to the critical issue of climate change. I hope this increases.

14195,/comment/14195,"Though I am very comfortable looking closely at our government processes to remove excess regulation and to cut regulation that does accomplishing anything meaningful, after reading the article and watching the news, I am very concerned that this Bill has a very different intent.
I am very concerned that we are giving municipalities permission to avoid scrutiny and consultation around planning decisions with respect to clean water and the government’s planned use of the water and land of the Oak Ridges Moraine.  I do not believe that any number of new jobs or private profit are worth jeopardizing the safety of our drinking water and pollution free land.  I likewise am concerned that laws specifically created to protect our lake water, our groundwater, our watersheds, our farmland and our pollution free lands are being thrown asunder so that we can create more jobs and increase the profits of manufacturing companies.  Though there must always be balance in the creation of policy, creating a law that simply allows municipalities and by extension, companies, to ignore Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Toxic Reductions Act and the Greenbelt Act seems a complete abandonment of our stewardship of these resources.
I believe that government policies should be sensible, non-ideological and look to minimize the burden of needless regulation.  Bill 66 does not appear to fulfil in this mandate.   I am very concerned that many aspects of this Bill are blunt, ham-fisted and were created with ideological and reckless intent.   I expect more from my government.

The obvious fact is that Ontario has always been open for business. Safe drinking water, environmental protection and consumer and worker protections are far more important and necessary than rhetorical lip service to industries that are thriving in Ontario.
This new legislation will make unlicensed home child care facilities more dangerous for the children in their care. The legislation will allow large scale public institutions to skirt using Unionised contractors to build infrastructure projects. We have seen In Ontario the results of employers using cut rate labour. Every year there are injuries and death due to this reckless behavior.

The proposed changes would fundamentally change who we are as Ontario and what we value. What makes me proud to live in Ontario and Canada in general, is our ability to be successful and business-forward while taking a stand for critical issues such as the environment, worker safety, and protecting democracy. This is what distinguishes us from other countries and makes Ontario an attractive place to live and work - just look at the tech boom happening in Toronto and Waterloo.
What we need to remember is that our existing legislation didn't just come out of nowhere - it came from real life experiences like when we had workers injured for working too many hours, children who had died due to lack of childcare regulation, community members who had died from drinking water with e-coli. To revoke these protections for the sake of ""removing red tape"" is absurd.

14268,/comment/14268,"I disagree with the move to reduce environmental and workplace safety regulations. The improvement to the Ontario economy should not come at the cost of environmental awareness and the safety of labourers.
I disapprove of the Toxic Reductions Act, 2009 being repealed on December 31, 2021, as well as the revocation of its associated regulations.
I also disapprove of the proposed Non-application of listed provision under the Planning Act. This is because they would not hold municipal open for business bylaws accountable to environmental protection regulations.
The Greenbelt is the anchor of smart land-use in southern Ontario and protects almost 2 million acres of farms, natural areas and water sources. Opening it to development will set free rampant land speculation by developers, resulting in a loss of farmland and the disruption of farm communities. And, it will undermine smart growth planning that’s aimed at increasing density to facilitate affordable housing and public transit access.
The Walkerton tragedy occurred due to a lack of protections for our sources of drinking water. Seven people lost their lives. To make sure it never happened again, we developed source water protections but this Bill will give developers a pass on keeping drinking water safe.
New developments would be exempt from drinking water source protection plans, and could be built regardless of their risk to water.  They’d be able to do the same for rules that protect our Great Lakes and Lake Simcoe from environmental damage.
Finally, the implementation of the Toxics Reduction Act will be suspended and the law will be later repealed. This Act was enacted in 2009 to prevent pollution by reducing the use of toxic chemicals in industrial sectors, and to help inform Canadians about the presence of toxic substances by labelling consumer products.
The Ontario government has promised early in its mandate to “come down heavy” on polluters. Removing the key law that was designed to help companies reduce their pollution sends the wrong signal to big polluters to continue to dump toxic chemicals into our environment.
I disapprove of the amendment to the Employment Standards Act, 2000
Section 2, in which employers are no longer required to post the poster in the workplace. These regulations ensure that employees are aware of their rights to a healthy and safe work environment.

14337,/comment/14337,"Hello,
I'd like to share my thoughts and concerns on Bill 66:
-Schedule 3: home daycares are typically unlicensed and the number of children allowed in these care situations were reduced due to horrific circumstances where some children were killed/died from neglect. Having access to affordable childcare is only worthwhile if that childcare is safe. You should consider increasing subsidies for daycare instead. I can tell you with certainty that if I'm choosing between childcare where I know my child will have proper supervision vs. where they may not, I would choose proper supervision even to the detriment of my bank account.
-Schedule 5: reducing environmental and pollution restrictions on business is not a solution. If anything this has the potential to improve business OVER THE SHORT TERM, while irrevocably destroying our environment over the long term. This will negatively impact our environment and will have detrimental impacts on the health of Ontarians into the future.
-Schedule 7: I seriously question whether repealing the Wireless Services Agreement will draw business to Ontario. If anything, this will make it harder for smaller companies to compete and will force consumers into longer, more expensive agreements (reducing their consumer spending elsewhere, which has been proven to negatively impact economies)
-Schedule 9: I'm not even sure where to start on this one, but we are absolutely not in a position to put the rights of businesses over the rights of citizens & workers in Ontario. Reducing employment standards is not a solution nor should it even be a consideration. If the goal of the Ontario government is reduce the quality of life for people living & working here, then you will succeed. But these changes put our provinces most vulnerable at even greater risk.
Overall, from what I can see changes are being recommended and positioned that will make things easier and more profitable for businesses (and by extension some of the most wealthy in the province), but what these changes will also do is put the most vulnerable in the province at even greater risk. Increasing the number of children per private daycare worker will not make affordable childcare accessible to people, it will put them in a position of needing to choose between the safest option for their child and the more affordable option. It will put tiny children at risk of injury or death. Stopping employers from needing to post employment standards posters will not make people aware of their rights and of the obligations of their employer; it will simply make it easier for companies and businesses to abuse their people. This will put the blue-collar Ontario workers that you vowed to protect at a greater risk of serious injury or death. Reducing environmental standards for companies will mean that we don't have an Ontario to look forward to. This isn't a choice that should be made, you should be holding companies to a higher standard to protect the environment for future generations. What benefit is there to having free healthcare or education if we can't go outside?

I cannot think of anything more important than protecting our water sources (apart, perhaps, from protecting the air we all breathe), and given what happened in Walkerton, this seems like a very dangerous area in which to relax regulation. Exemptions to the Greenbelt Act are also highly alarming, especially in light of Doug Ford's campaign promise to maintain protections for that unique ecological and agricultural resource. What a betrayal of the promise he made to the people who elected his government. Given the sweeping nature of changes proposed in this Act, it seems like it would be more appropriate to break it down into a series of distinct, smaller bills so that the changes can each be given the debate and deliberation they deserve. I do not support the Act in its current form and the fact that these massive changes are trying to be put through as one bill does not give me confidence in this government's commitment to the principal of democracy.

The most cost-effective over time, the most liveable and the most attractive cities are those where people can live work and play, where there are multi-modal types of transit options, where good planning ensures there are many kinds of housing choices and amenities are nearby.
Bill 66 promotes sprawl — the antithesis of good planning. It puts our few remaining natural spaces and our ever-shrinking foodlands in jeopardy. As well, will wipe out all the invaluable green infrastructure benefits that these lands provide. Congestion in the GTA is already worse than any other area in North America. Adding transit-unfriendly sprawl will make congestion unbearable and will kill economic growth.
Bill 66 bypasses the sound environmental protection and human health Acts that were put in place for a reason. Need I remind you that Ontario’s citizens died because their right to clean drinking water was compromised. We need the Clean Water Act. Your government must be aware that 40 million people depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. You cannot allow. The Great Lakes Protection Act to be bypassed. Seven municipalities get their drinking water from Lake Simcoe, a lake that generates over $200 million per year in the local economy, 80% of which is connected to ice fishing. Drinking water, local biodiversity and recreational and commercial fishing in Lake Simcoe must be protected.
The Planning Act, Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act and The Places to Grow Act, among others that could be impacted by this Bill, are all essential to the well-being and long-term prosperity of this Province. Governments must act with long-term benefits of all in mind, not the short-term benefits of developers.
This Bill isn’t even needed for the purpose that’s proposed. More than 125,000 hectares of developable land currently exists within urban boundaries as the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the Neptis Foundation have proved. Not only is green field land available within current urban boundaries but there are thousands of hectares of abandoned industrial lands and low-rise sprawl along main urban transportation corridors desperately in need of redevelopment.
To add insult to injury, this Bill would allow development projects to proceed without a single public meeting. How quickly this government “for the people” has moved to disallow their voices altogether.
Also, how quickly has Premier Ford forgotten his promise not to touch the Greenbelt.
I live in Conservative MPP Sam Oosterhoff’s riding, in a community committed to agricultural excellence, and in an area of Niagara where our wineries, our farms, the beauty of the escarpment and the lake are central to our economy.

We all of have fond memories of hiking, camping, canoeing, and countless other activities that would not be possible without firm provincial protection. Considering that he vowed to protect the Greenbelt on the campaign trail, after being caught telling developers that he would remove protections, I hope the Ford governement seriously reconsiders this move. Construction should never be made at the expense of environmental protection. Moreover, it is morally reprehensible to repeal measures put in place after the loss of lives, disrespecting their names and the safety of our citizens.

Sadly, this particular government, has disproven this expectation quite a bit over the duration that they have been in power, and no more so than when promoting cutbacks to protections that are vital to the wellbeing of Canadian citizens.
I don't know what exactly entailed the process, but coming to the conclusion that reducing the protections regarding labour regulation, child protection, clean water safeguards, and the greenbelt for ease of creating business is a blatant disregard of human rights and an irresponsible use of power. Not only does this show that the government prioritizes Capitalism and financial gains over the health and safety of children, it also proves that they have no regard for the health of future generations by reducing workplace protections and climate change protocols. This opens up vulnerable populations to a decrease in quality of life and care through negligence, abuse, subpar filtration, caregiver burnout, etc., and honestly, I don't know how to emphasize this enough, but this bill is a terrible idea.

If attracting businesses to Ontario was this government's concern, one of its first moves in office would not have been to cancel billions of dollars worth of green energy initiatives. One of those initiatives involved Tesla whose CEO just this morning stated that he was interested in purchasing the recently closed GM plants. Do you think he'll consider Oshawa after personally witnessing this government's commitment to contracts?  This government's political interference and instability was also cited as the cause of the collapse of the Hydro One-Avista deal. These do not look like the actions of a government that is interested in attracting business to Ontario.  Just the opposite, in fact.
The regulations that Bill 66 will overturn are not ""inefficient, inflexible or out of date"". They are merely inconvenient to a government whose displays of cronyism already foreshadow the plans for our Greenbelt. This government has already demonstrated its commitment to the environment by firing Ontario's Chief Science Officer, cancelling Ontario's cap and trade program, getting rid of environmental oversight and, until recently, having absolutely no plan in place to respond to the global climate crisis.  Based on the above and on the quality of the plan released last week, it is clear to me that the best interests of the land and its inhabitants is not a concern for this government.
What I find most telling about this government's plan to attract businesses is that it is a plan that debases the province, that ceases to protect her or even hold her up as something that should be treated with care, or pride.  This government appears to think so little of this province that it believes putting her at risk is the only way to attract business.

Loosening restrictions on drinking water protection and allowing for more to be taken, and to allow development to occur in areas of recharge and filtering and such, is not the way to protect our valuable resource - our water quality is something that the US and other countries eye enviously - we should protect it and not threaten it.
Similarly, our green belt is an important piece of habitat; it is so critical to protect our few remaining natural areas, especially those that provide wildlife corridors and protection to a diversity of species.  The value of nature is not just to a few nature lovers - it has been shown that exposure to nature and greenspaces decreases crime, mental health issues, and increases physical health and recovery times and concentration and so much more.  Nature also helps to keep our air and water clean, helps to sequester carbon, and so much more.  We should be trying to increase our amount of protected lands, and not start cutting holes in it.  There are already holes in it from current existing development and infrastructure - we can't afford to lose any more of it for short-term gain.  Look at the brownfield and in-fill development opportunities first!  We have areas of cities that are empty - fill them up before expanding out into the greenbelt.  The farmland that is there is also critical to protect - we need to fill the bellies of the increasing population, and can't rely on imports to do so, especially with future costs for transportation and environmental hazards and impacts on crops around the world.

14482,/comment/14482,"I take specific offence to modifications proposed to Schedules 3, 5 and 10. As an elected government, it is your duty to act in the best interest of the public that you serve. Removing restrictions on home-based childcare providers (Schedule 3, Ministry of Education) to, allow additional children MAY make it easier for parents to find affordable child care, but what impact will it have on the quality of the childcare that these parents are accessing? This bill creates a dichotomous system where low-income parents will have access to crowded, lower-quality home childcare. The quality of care of our children should be of paramount importance, and removing restrictions put in place to increase the quality of that care is negligent. I have two young children and I directly feel the burden of finding and paying for affordable childcare; I do not support Schedule 3 of Bill 66, and any person purporting to represent the best public interest should not support it either.
With respect to Schedule 5 (MOECP), reducing requirements for adherence to toxic substances guidelines is never a good idea. To imply that this is merely a duplication of paperwork with federal requirements is negligent. Toxic substance use and reporting requirements were put in place to assure public safety, and safety should never be compromised for the sake of expediency and cutting red-tape. As an elected government, it is your duty to act in the best interest of the public that you serve and Schedule 5 of Bill 66 fails to do this.
With respect to Schedule 10 (MMAH), the proposed changes are is stark contrast to election promises to protect the Greenbelt. Removing adherence requirements for Official Plan and Zoning, removing the ability to use density bonusing and holding by-law provisions is short-sighted and fly’s in the face of decades of thoughtful municipal planning initiatives. Removal of current public consultation requirements and instead making this OPTIONAL is removing the RIGHT TO KNOW from the public. Notification after a by-law is passed is unacceptable, the VOTING PUBLIC has a right to know what their municipal governments are planning, with whom they are striking development deals and to be held accountable publicly. The condition that decisions are final and cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (but allow the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to intervene before the by-law comes into effect, 20 days after its passing) is unacceptable; the voting public has a right to appeal decisions and removal of this opportunity is a violation of our rights. Removal of the requirement for decisions to strictly adhere to provincial policies and provincial plans serves ONLY to benefit big-businesses that want to push through development projects without doing their due-diligence in environmental work as required under the Planning Act. Species at Risk considerations, Sensitive Natural features, Significant Wildlife Habitat considerations would all be impacted and this is completely unacceptable to me. As a steward of the earth, I believe that we MUST preserve what little natural heritage remains and not allow the profits of big-business usurp the rights of our children. Using OPEN-FOR-BUSINESS rules to remove the stringent protections put in place by the Clean Water Act is negligent and abhorrent. The Walkerton tragedy was an eye-opening, gut-wrenching result of lax rules and poor oversight; the Clean Water Act brought in changes that are now studies as Best Management Practices across the globe. That is the kind of province I want to live in, where public safety is paramount and is lauded as an example for the rest of the world. Doug Ford and the conservatives should be ashamed of themselves for proposing these changes, As an elected government, it is your duty to act in the best interest of the public that you serve and you are failing to do so.

This legislation encourages municipalities to ignore existing environmental and planning policies including The Greenbelt Act, The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, The Clean Water Act, and The Great Lakes Protection Act. These acts were all created to protect environmentally sensitive lands and waterways and in turn protect the health and well-being of Ontario citizens.
Bill 66 allows municipalities to create “open for business” zoning bylaws. Industrial buildings would be eligible for this type of fast track development. Industrial buildings that degrade the environment and pollute waterways would be encouraged to locate their operations in “Open for Business” zones.
The Provincial Government is so intent on pushing through development as fast as possible that Municipalities will not be required to inform the public when development under Bill 66 gets approved. Not only is the health and well-being of our communities threatened but we won’t even get a say in how they are shaped.
Bill 66 is a real threat to Ontario and specifically to the GTA.

Premier Ford,
During the election campaign, the Conservative party proudly issued a document titled “ For the People, A Plan for Ontario “.
   In it, you committed that, if elected, you would “  Increase the supply of affordable housing across the GTA while protecting the Greenbelt in its entirety. “
I live in the Hamlet of Glen Williams (located in Halton Hills). The citizens have invested significant efforts over the years to ensure new developments respect and maintain the heritage nature and natural environment of our area.
The Hamlet is bordered by the Greenbelt on three sides, therefore the potential for exposing these areas to poorly planned development presents a real risk to the quality of life of all Hamlet residents.  In addition, the protection of the Credit River, the historic driver of our community, will be severely weakened.
It appears obvious that a number of the changes contained in the proposed Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018) could quickly erode the improvements in development planning established through years of citizen efforts. I.e.:
1.	It can result in good planning practices being overridden in response to financial desires and objectives of developers.
2.	Municipalities will be tempted by financial considerations to choose poorly regulated increased development and housing density in order to secure an increased tax base.
3.	It will facilitate the loss of green space that is fundamental to our environmental health and erode the ability of citizens to maintain the heritage character of small towns and rural areas.
The Bill, as currently drafted, will give municipalities the power to override existing legislation that they may view as impeding economic development i.e. by passing an “open for business” planning bylaw.
     Most of the legislation that can be rolled back under Bill 66 was specifically put in place to protect the health and safety of the people of Ontario, such as:
•	The Clean Water Act (adopted after the Walkerton tragedy)
•	The Greenbelt Act
•	The Places to Grow Act (Growth Plan)
•	etc.
As per my understanding of Bill 66 provisions, these special bylaws could be passed without public notice, without a public meeting, and without any opportunity for appeal i.e. it erodes traditional citizen rights.
It is difficult to believe that any government would impose such draconian changes in the face of critical and increasing environmental risks. Unless Bill 66 is altered, the government slogan of “Open for Business” will become a masked message to corporations (national and international) for “Come on In, no pesky regulations here.”
I wish to unequivocally register my significant concerns and total disagreement with changes related to the Greenbelt that are being proposed under Bill 66.
    I would note that this does not have to be an either/or decision; with thoughtful intelligent policies it is possible to meet both promises.
With respect,

14610,/comment/14610,"As an entrepreneur and successful small-business owner in Kitchener, I would have hoped that I would be happy with a bill entitled ""Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness""; however, this bill does little to support businesses and instead takes a huge bite into environmental protections that support the creation of businesses and the well-being of Ontarians. Bill 66 opens the door for municipalities to be granted permission to clear-cut forests while bypassing significant chunks of legislation: major water-protection acts (the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, and Lake Simcoe Proctection Plan Act) and recent solid-waste-management law (2016’s Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act). In order for businesses to prosper in the long term, we require a strong natural environment and a government that understands this. The economy and the environment are linked. Bill 66 is a travesty as it equates cutting red tape with cutting the environment. Please reverse your detrimental policy as mayors and city counsels along southwestern Ontario are already commenting that they will do all within their power to reverse this legislation if passed. Please stop trying to create problems with nature - Ontarians need nature, nature doesn't need us.

Additionally, removing restrictions on private daycare and lowering the age limits is quite frankly a lazy and dangerous approach. Instead of the government funding new spaces and doing real work, this plan is the equivalent of throwing up pies hands and looking the other way. It’s disgusting and legislators should be ashamed.

14733,/comment/14733,"Hello,
I'm deeply troubled, and frankly, gobsmacked by this Bill. Specifically, I'd like to zero in on the changes to the Planning Act which gives municipalities the right to let developers build in our most cherished and environmentally sensitive areas. I know the Premier keeps saying publicly that this bill actually ""protects"" the Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine, and how he uses mental gymnastics to claim that is a sight to behold for sure, but it's CLEARLY not true. A quick read of the Bill shows that these pieces of legislation, which were put into place to protect not just the environment but all Ontarians' health, are meant to be bypassed in the spirit of speeding up development in these areas.
I suppose 18 years is along time and it's easy to forget things like an E.coli breakout that killed 7 people and sickened countless in others in Walkerton, ON but I'm happy to refresh the Province's memory. I mean, I was only 15 at the time, Doug was considerably older but those money signs flashing in his eyes seem to have wiped away all memory. Acts like the Clean Water Act were put into place specifically to avoid catastrophes like Walkerton in the future and yet here we are, looking at a Bill designed to curtail this all to make us more ""competitive"". What a cruel, cruel joke. Maybe the Premier only drinks Fiji water but the vast majority of us Ontarians drink water supplied from places like the Oak Ridge Moraine.
I'm sure why we can only be competitive by degrading some of the most important and environmentally significant land we have in Ontario but my guess is that this bill is designed to appease Ford's developer buddies. Those poor millionaires who have too long been denied the right to mess with our environmental protection and safety. You've sold us out...
I'm officially registering my huge disappointment and disapproval. I hope you guys wake up and realize what you're doing but I honestly don't expect much from Ford and his clapping seals.

14758,/comment/14758,"Hi there,
I oppose Bill-66 on many fronts but most importantly due to it's actions on the Planning Act.
I am a Master's of Planning Student in Toronto and I believe strongly in the existing Provincial Policies and Plans, such as the Provincial Policy Statement of 2014, The Growth Plan, the Green Belt Act, and so many others. These plans have protect our environment, curb urban sprawl, and help create communities where everyone can enjoy the goods and services they need and enjoy happy lives.
The Growth Plan is among some of the most forward thinking documents in North America and its requirements should be more strongly enforced, rather than creating a loophole around it. People's needs are changing and people now want to live in urban centres, take public transit, walk to work, and enjoy public spaces - this all goes in opposition to living in suburbs, driving everywhere, commuting in traffic to work, and then only being able to enjoy your own private space.
I grew up in Oshawa and I had to be driven everywhere. My grandparents still reside there and they are restricted in what they can do without a car. My nieces are also restricted in where they can go since walking in Oshawa can be dangerous as it is a car-only neighbourhood. How is promoting more urban sprawl good ""for the people"" of Ontario?
Many regular ""folks"" do not know of the planning act so I find this small inclusion into a larger bill is a way to hide it and allow to go through unopposed. I will however let you know that I will oppose this and so will many other future and current planning professionals.
The current Government of Ontario needs to stop living in the past and thinking that less regulations equals more business. The days of manufacturing jobs and suburban homes are gone and the future lies in urbanized cities with brain economy jobs. These brain economy jobs rely on a new generation of workers, workers that care about sustainability, who want to bike/walk to work, that want to enjoy fun public spaces, and who may not care as much about owning a care or even ever owning a house.
Please, please, do not let this bill pass. It will surely make my future way worse off. I am still young and have many years to live and I want to ensure that I can work towards making healthy and complete communities in Ontario, to make Ontario a place that everyone looks to as the place of the future, not one admiring and mimicking the past.
Our politicians are from a different age and they NEED to start listening to the youth. I don't want to clean up their mistakes for the rest of my life.

The protection of our current and future drinking water sources is critical.  If this program is bypassed, it has the potential of harming the health and safety of people and animals of today and into the future. Without legislation in place to protect these sources there will be a gap in proper protection. The Clean Water Act was put together by industry experts using scientific based research. Ontario is leading the way in water treatment. This didn’t happen by chance. It was the unfortunate events in Walkerton that did. Now that we are getting to a point where we are world leaders, let’s not forget why we are here. We need to stand tall and proud and stand up for the safety of our drinking water sources. It was only 18 short years ago. It would be an embarrassment to take away restrictions from large industry simply for profits, knowing full-well control at the source is our best chance. And furthermore, they have the resources to put proper controls in place. These risk management plans are not asking for major investments in most cases. It is the fact of being away of the risks and being more cognizant of what is being done to keep them from entering our water systems. At this point, most of these plans are already in place or will be in a short time.  Going forward it will be maintenance of these plans, ensuring any changes to the risks are dealt with accordingly.

Allowing municipalities to apply to the province for permission to pass what the bill calls “open-for-business” bylaws, thus meaning they are to be exempt from a list of laws, including sections of the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and the Greenbelt Act  - this is a major threat to Ontario's green belt.

14931,/comment/14931,"I have several concerns with proposed Bill 66:
- What details will be provided to demonstrate that a business who will be creating 50 jobs will actually do so? How will the tool be able to safeguard from those companies who wish to bypass the planning process but then fail to deliver the required number of jobs?
- Section 3(5) of the Planning Act. The PPS would be bypassed, including hazard lands. Thus, development could theoretically locate in a floodplain. This is a terrible idea. Other hazards that are of concern are areas adjacent unstable slopes, dynamic beach hazards and erosion hazards. Other aspects of the PPS that could be bypassed include:
the proper care and treatment of stormwater management before it enters Ontario's waterways;
the requirement for a development to prove it has a long-term stable water quality and quantity supply for a development and that there would be no negative impacts as a result of this new development on the local supply;
the requirement for development to be compact, efficient and make use of existing services. Furthering sprawl is inherently more costly to the Ontario taxpayer.
- Section 24 of the Planning Act. Local OPs could be bypassed. Many local people are involved in the preparation of these plans. The whole planning system is predicated on long-term planning for the future. With the ability to bypass a local OP, situations could arise in which inappropriate land uses locate adjacent sensitive land uses.
- Subsections 34 (10.0.0.1) to (34) of the Planning Act. Planning notification would be able to be bypassed. A cornerstone of democracy is the ability to consult and notify populations who may have concerns regarding development. Suppose the provincial government wanted to enact Bill 66 without any regard for public consultation through the ERO? That is not the world we live in. Democracy and the ability to voice concerns underpins everything we do as a nation.
- Section 39 of the Clean Water Act. This is one of the most terrifying proposals of Bill 66. If permitted, this would allow for the bypassing of source protection areas. Proposals could forego conforming with a significant threat policy or regarding source protection plan policies. It even appears to opt out prescribed instruments from conforming to source protection plans. This should not be included in any Bill 66. Source water is a critically important component of rural Ontario. Majority of rural residents rely on private drinking water wells. Should a proposal bypass this Act and contamination of a local groundwater supply occur, the Province would be liable for passing this type of legislation.
- Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act. Bypassing this section of the Act would violate a campaign promise of the PC Party, and specifically Premier Doug Ford.
- Section 6 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act. Bypassing this would appear to allow for deterioration in ecological health of Lake Simcoe.
- Regarding the changes to site plan control and Section 41 of the Planning Act. This appears to water down the power of site plan control.

14956,/comment/14956,"I wish to address the repeal propsed in section 5.  The environmental toxins that have been banned in 2009 have been a critical and Canada leading change in horticulture which has assisted in us avoiding some of the expensive and lengthy court battles occuring in the states regarding workplace safety, good heath, and environmental damage.   As a horticultural business owner I can guarantee you that in my experience customers are prone to looking for quick solutions that actually cause greater damage to property and health over the longterm.  The Ontario changes aiming for total elimination of these toxins by 2021 aid customer decisions and have been an essential component in ultimately reclaiming our farming diversity and meeting certain health standards that are now under contention where accountants may think there is greater competition.   If you wait this one out, You, the Ontario Conservative Government can be deemed a leader and innovator in management allowing the horticultural market to continue its strategies towards a non toxic free market.  By repealing this, you will be paradoxically interfering with this free market strategizing which I know you do not support.   And, unfortunately,  the Canadian Federal government has been unhelpful with this type of regulation as it is deemed a provincial responsibility. You cannot and should not pass the buck to a federal government that has very little action in its policy making.

14996,/comment/14996,"My primary comment is that Schedule 10 is bad for the residents of Ontario.  Allowing special employment zones that can potentially ignore the requirements of the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Metrolinx Act, et al., will be a step backwards for the province.  What is the point of those acts if we are creating workarounds to allow ourselves to break the requirements of those acts?  We aren't living in North Korea or some other third world country where they create special economic zones for the purpose of creating jobs, even though those zones end up costing the country more money in the long term which negates the benefits of the increased employment.  Why are we trying third world strategies to create employment when the unemployment rate in Ontario is near 5-year lows?  The only explanation i can think of is that the government is pandering to business interests that are looking for cheap land to build on.  Luckily this legislation would require local municipalities to apply to create these business zones and i suspect that doing so would be deeply unpopular, so i doubt many (if any) would be created.  At which point I ask, what's the point?
I don't fully understand the repeal of the pawnbrokers act?  Pawn shops typically deal with people in vulnerable situations.  I'd prefer to know that pawn shops aren't just run willy-nilly by potentially unscrupulous people.  Regulation can provide some protections to vulnerable people.  If there's concern that the regulation isn't working, step up inspections of shops and enforcement.

14998,/comment/14998,"I find the government's proposal to create Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, both troubling and suspicious.
To say that this announcement was a surprise would be an understatement. With employment at an all time high, the one issue that Ontario does not seem to have is a lack of competitiveness. The problems that it does have are high food prices, a lack of affordable housing and a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
The new government decided that Ontario was awash in red tape and this was hindering us from reaching our full potential. And so, the government in its great wisdom decided that it needed to ""relax"" existing protective environmental legislation to promote business interests.
In other words the government feels that business should take precedence over the safety and well-being of its citizens. It obviously believes that such legislation as the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Water Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act, the Places to Grow Act or the Lake Simcoe Protection Act are trivialities that should be ignored in 2019.
What is really shocking is the fact that the Provincial government proposes to have the municipalities do the ""heavy lifting"" to bring about these changes. It will be their task to ignore all environmental protection as they award local developers, who promise the creation of new jobs, an open door policy. The Provincial government will simply provide the automatic rubber stamp of approval.
What is so troublesome is that a municipality can then agree to a new development in secret, with no public input or discussion. Once done, and the Minister has applied his rubber stamp, there is no recourse. It cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT). It will be a fait accompli; the approval will be final. The municipality will then make the decision known to the public within 30 days in any manner it sees fit.
Now, one has to ask the obvious question: Who gains by the enacting of Bill 66? It definitely is not the people of Ontario! The individuals who stand to gain immensely are the speculators, particularly those that purchased land many years ago which subsequently became designated environmentally protected. They have been sitting on this land with no hope of ever developing it, at least until now. These rich and powerful speculators potentially just got a whole lot richer!
Of course, the key to developing any of this land lies with individual municipal councillors for it will be them who will make the decision to by-pass the current environmental protection statutes. I foresee each of them having a very busy lunch schedule in the coming months.
Contrary to what Premier Ford said prior to the recent election, he is prepared to decimate the Greenbelt and allow new development on environmentally protected land. He has misled the people of Ontario. His explanations ring hollow and the perception is that he is bending to the will of a small but powerful lobby. Shame on him and shame on his government for proposing Bill 66.
What I don't think Mister Ford has yet given thought to is the fact the people of Ontario are simply not going to allow him to pursue this course of action.

15005,/comment/15005,"Please bring your attention to 34.1(6) (6) of this bill which excludes ""open for business by laws"" from the ""red tape"" found in section 39 of the Clean Water Act (2002).  This bit of red tape was put in place at the recommendation of a judge after a lengthy hearing and inquiry regarding the drinking water tragedy in Walkerton, ON.
The red tape of section 39 of the Clean Water Act requires that land use decisions conform to source protection plans when there is a significant threat.  If there is not a significant threat land use decisions need only ""have regard"".    This bears repeating: the Clean Water Act only limits land use decisions that create and significant threat to DRINKING WATER sources.  This is the sort of red tape that protects not just ""the taxpayers"" but also ""the people"" of Ontario.  Please reconsider the implications of this; don't excuse yourself by reasoning that you've just allowed municipalities to make independent decisions.

During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66.

Wetlands and flood plains must remain unpaved so that excess storm water does not cost taxpayers and insurance companies millions in damages. Ecosystem services save huge investments into infrastructure that could only inefficiently mimic what nature is doing for free.

3. Schedule 9: Stop requiring employers to post the Employment Standards Act (ESA) poster in the workplace, but retain the requirement that they provide the poster to employees.
Having a poster in the workplace allows the workers to quickly reference the ESA when there are non-compliance practices. As long as the businesses are compliant, posting a poster does not put additional burden on the business operation and therefore this clause serves no purpose.
With the removal of the poster, businesses may be non-compliant and workers will be less accessible to the information and ways to report on the non-compliance.

15107,/comment/15107,"I strongly and vehemently oppose The Province of Ontario’s proposed Bill 66 allows for provincial intervention to remove or weaken protections on safe drinking water, agricultural lands, and democratic consultation.
For example, in 1989, toxic chemicals were found in the groundwater underneath the Uniroyal Chemical site in Elmira. Experts say it will be decades before Elmira's water is safe to drink again. Bill 66 would allow the Province to override the Region of Waterloo’s Official Plan policies that were established to prevent similar toxic destruction of our drinking water. Limiting sprawl is of particular importance in Waterloo Region, where 75% of drinking water comes from aquifers located just beyond the Countryside Line.
Today, more than half of the Region's growth comes from building in existing urban areas. This investment in our urban centres means we can keep growing while preserving the rural communities and farms that make Waterloo Region unique.
Planning exemptions granted under Bill 66 would not require notification or consultation with residents. These proposed changes fly in the face of good governance.
I reject Bill 66’s implicit suggestion that to grow the economy and add jobs we must accept environmental degradation, pave over farms, and risk the health of our families.
I request that the Province on Ontario, Councils of the Region of Waterloo and Ontario municipalities pass resolutions that reaffirm their commitment to smart growth and meaningful public consultations, and that they reject the use of the “open-for-business planning by-law” proposed by Bill 66.
Sincerely,

15118,/comment/15118,"Dear Staff,
I have been following Bill 66 with great interest.
Bill 66 would pave the way for a municipal council to pass “open for business” by-laws. As proposed, these by-laws would allow industrial or large commercial developments, which would employee 50 or more people, to bypass sections of several legislative Acts.
The bypassing of the Planning Act and Clean Water Act, appear to be particularly problematic in both the short term and long term.
Regarding the Planning Act, it appears these “open for business” by-laws would allow a local council to approve a development without the required public consultation process. In addition, a council could also bypass the Provincial Policy Statements for which all development in Ontario is required to adhere.
Regarding the Clean Water Act, it appears these by-laws would potentially allow for a municipal council to not have regard for source water protection.
Please think of out next generations.
Thank you for your time and your continued service.
Sincerely,
YL

15123,/comment/15123,"Bill 66 and the open-for-business planning bylaw is of paramount interest to me because I am an environmental activist, environmental technologist alumni, a concerned resident and a proud Anishinabek. This issue directly impacts the health of: our ecosystems; Ontarians; and indirectly – reconciliation.
I am primarily concerned about the potential risks to the health and safety of the people of Ontario by giving municipalities the power to override legislation such as the Clean Water Act, The Greenbelt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Act, and the Places to Grow Act. These acts have been put in place to protect us from harmful threats, especially concerning our drinking water and if Bill 66 is passed, the risk to our health will increase significantly due to the lack of standards that come with the open-for-business planning bylaw.
Threats to our ecosystems are imminent if Bill 66 passes, which is also impacts the physical and mental health of Ontarians. Protection of our green spaces and wildlife is important for our mental wellbeing.
Individuals have less mental distress, less anxiety and depression, greater wellbeing and healthier cortisol profiles when living in urban areas with more greenspace compared with less greenspace. Large differences in disease prevalence are reported when comparing residents of very green and less green settings, even after controlling for socioeconomic status (Maas et al, 2009). Quantity of nearby greenspace buffers life stresses – a finding demonstrated across ages and cultures, having been observed both in an adult population from the Netherlands and in a childhood population from rural upstate New York, USA (Wells & Evans, 2003; van den Berg et al, 2010).
Other aspects of this same issue affect reconciliation between the Canadian government and Canada’s First Nations. Passing Bill 66 is blatant disregard for the renewal and rebuilding of the relationship of indigenous peoples and the Canadian government. Yes, reconciliation is primarily about helping the families affected by the IRS; however, it is also about respecting the culture and opinions of Canadian Aboriginals and our opinion is that we care about the earth, water, and sky.
The very acts that Bill 66 is planning to disregard state clearly that nothing in the act shall be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada as recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. So how can it be okay to create a bylaw that is obviously ignoring this very specific standard? How can the relationship be restored if the Canadian government can’t even respect the land that the people they are trying to reconcile with care deeply about? How can reconciliation be achieved if you can’t even regard our basic rights to clean water?
I understand the need to grow economically, however, I fear that this effort will contribute to the regression of everything we as Canadian’s have fought for.
Thank you for your consideration of my viewpoint on this matter. I believe it is an important issue, and would like to see the legislation fail to ensure the health of our people, ecosystems and the relationship between nations.

15128,/comment/15128,"There are so many destructive parts of this bill, but I will focus my comments on Section 10 which irresponsibly risks our drinking water, farm land, and smart growth development.
Drinking water protections were added after the Walkerton Tragedy that took the lives of Ontarians and left others with long-term illnesses. In my home of Waterloo Region, Elmira still cannot drink its own water because of industrial damages in the 80s. 75% of our drinking water comes from the ground and our official plan strongly protects source water because of past crises.
Farming represents a $500 million industry in Waterloo Region and an important part of our heritage.
Smart Growth: The Region of Waterloo has experienced over $3 billion in urban development along its new light rail transit route since it was announced. Since the Region's growth plan implemented source water protections and a hard countryside line the unemployment rate has dropped from 5.9% to 5.1%. The economy doesn't need the provisions of Bill 66.
Perhaps most concerning is the provision that permits a by-law to be passed and approved under Section 10 without any public notice, consultation, or appeal. This goes against the core values of Canadian democracy and means that a residents first notice may be the bulldozer. This is not acceptable and must change. Residents spend time contributing to official plans and other planning documents and the fact that all of this can be disregarded without going back to those same residents is really concerning.
Waterloo Region has a multi-tier government that works well together but this bill would allow a township or city to override the policies that all the municipalities agreed on and formed together. This will create longterm controversy that is bad for the health of our Region.
I do not support Section 10 of Bill 66. I do not believe that it can be amended sufficiently to make it acceptable, and instead the entire section must be discarded. Section 10 is bad or Ontario.

- Under Schedule 5 I am concerned about the potential environmental harms and health consequences that may occur if the Toxics Reduction Act is repealed.
- Under Schedule 9 I feel that employers should still be required to post this poster or at the very least, provide the information to employees upon hiring. I am also concerned about the potential loss of union representation for employees who are currently represented by the construction industry.
- Under Schedule 10 I do not believe that municipalities should be able to bypass acts or to undertake developments without public consultation. I am also concerned about the possibility of some developments being exempted from the Clean Water Act and Greenbelt protections. This will only lead to environmental damages and possibly serious health consequences for Ontarians. ""Red tape"" is not in place as a nuisance, it is there for a reason and should not be removed for ease of developers at the expense of residents.

This would allow municipalities to circumvent both the Clean Water Act and the Green Belt Act (in addition to numerous other planning Acts). This cannot stand. These are extremely important planning acts for our province's quality of life and safety of our citizens. To see this be eliminated would be a shame indeed.

15254,/comment/15254,"As a concerned citizen and voter in Ontario I must share my serious concern with Bill 66, particularly with the effect it will have upon our and your environmental safety if the current government chooses to pass it.
The (government’s) legislation will allow commercial development to bypass several long-standing laws meant to protect the natural environment and the health of your residents, including the Clean Water Act that was put in place following the Walkerton tragedy.  Giving developers and existing corporations free reign to pollute our drinking water sources…..puts ALL our lives in danger. Grassy Narrows, Walkerton and more……. Is there no learning here from our history?
The Great Lakes, housing one fifth of the world’s freshwater will be threatened with harmful pollutants, toxic chemicals, and greater wetlands loss, making them less swimmable, drinkable, and fishable. These and other Lakes and endless Rivers, Creeks, Streams, throughout Ontario will also be at significant risk….they are all linked.
The UN has declared CLEAN WATER as a Human Right.  Are Ontarians denied this right?  Canada, a nation of nearly unlimited fresh water of which Ontario has a huge amount ----should Ontario not be demonstrating some world leadership in this area?  Defaulting to a federal ‘Management System’ indicates your government’s willingness to forfeit its sovereignty in this domain. Will there be others?
The Greenbelt development:  2 million acres of pristine, protected land that grows our food and provides critical habitat for wildlife.  Sadly, damage and destruction to this area is a predictable outcome of this abhorrent proposed Bill.
The ‘Open for Business By-law’ approach is an affront to every citizen and taxpayer.  Bill 66 expressly provides that no advance notice to the public of an open for business by-law is required before being passed.  Where is our democracy in all of this?
I appeal to the government: members and their families who enjoy Ontario’s Nature, to fight for your constituents and families:  TO SAVE, TO PROTECT, TO RESPECT  our ENVIRONMENT and the very necessities of human life and wild life with which it honours us by withdrawing this damaging Bill.
Respectfully yours,

15264,/comment/15264,"Bill 66 can best be described as Premier Ford's reward to business interests.  Opening up the Green Belt to developers in a way that puts clean water and food production at risk just doesn't make sense.  Builders will continue to build homes on those lands that are out of reach of minimum pay wage earners, contribute to urban sprawl and reduce our ability to feed ourselves with produce grown in Ontario.  The worst part is not requiring consultation before allowing development and encouraging municipalities to ignore environmental legislation that was enacted after public consultation.  Add to that, Mr Ford did say hypocritically during his campaign that he would not touch the Green Belt because the public had spoken.  Normally I have respect for our elected representatives at Queens Park, but this bill is very transparent in its intent as a reward for Ford supporters.

Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66.

15323,/comment/15323,"I am highly opposed to Schedule 10 of Bill 66 for the following reasons:
1. It removes the requirement for public consultation if the open for business zoning by-law (OFB-ZBL) is passed by a Municipality. The community deserves a right to provide comments on a potential zoning change that may affect them, and may even put their health and environment at risk. This bill should be revised to require public meetings if a municipality proposes to enact an OFB-ZBL.
2. An OFB-ZBL should be able to be appealed to the LPAT.
3. An OFB-ZBL should conform to the provincial policy statements. These policies protect people and property from natural hazards, and preserve important natural heritage features. If you see this as ""red tape"" to creating new jobs, then give certain exclusions based on a case-by-case basis (e.g. demonstrating the impacts and addressing them to the greatest extent feasible and allow exemptions where appropriate measures, mitigation, or compensation can occur) but do not give a blanket approval to development to avoid conformity with the provincial policy statements.
4. Significant threat policies are extremely important to prevent things like spills that could enter into drinking water and kill people. The OFB-ZBL must not allow industrial or other uses with the potential to threaten drinking water within the well head protection areas or intake protection zones.  This is literally a terrible idea, puts humans at risk, and no doubt low income or marginalized persons will be the ones put at risk most because these potential future developments wont be going in rich peoples' backyards.
5.  The OFB-ZBL puts the Oak Ridges Moraine at risk. The Oak Ridges Moraine is a source of drinking water to many communities and also is a source of coldwater for the coldwater fisheries. Allowing development within this area may severely impact water resources. Any OFB-ZBL should have to comply with the Oak Ridges Moraine Act. There is absolutely no reason to allow any type of large development within the Oak Ridges Moraine when there are many other suitable locations around the Province.
6.  The OFB-ZBL should not be permitted within the Greenbelt. This is contrary to what the Premier promised during his election.
My greatest fear is that this OFB-ZBL will be used by sneaky developers to re-zone a bunch of land and build something on it, and then later come back and re-zone it to residential as all the features on it that would have required protection (wetlands, watercourses, woodlands, fish habitat, etc.) have already been removed. Please make sure there are restrictions in place so that this OFB-ZBL is not manipulated in the future to allow for residential development and sprawl in these rural areas, particularly in the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine.
My other fear is that this gives municipalities too much power to put in development in areas where it should not go. Many Mayors and Councillors are linked to the development industry now in some way, either through investments, real estate, etc.  or they are under tremendous pressure to accept development to balance their budgets. It appears as though there is no way to stop them from allowing this OFB-ZBL to go forward. The public should have the right to stop an OFB-ZBL from being approved, or a method to appeal this based on health and safety concerns or impacts to the environment. Development should occur in a manner that benefits everyone but does not put public health and safety at risk or the environment.
Instead of enacting Schedule 10 of Bill 66, please review other Municipalities methods for encouraging development, such as Mississauga's pre-zoning lands to attract business. No one is opposed to bringing jobs to Ontario, but it should be done in a fair, transparent, and balanced way that still affords protection to people's health and welfare and the environment.

Why can't your government appreciate the significance of this? My husband and I grew up near the Oak Ridges Moraine, and have memories more than we can count of utilizing that space for recreation, exploring, skiing, fruit-picking, visits to farms, and getting us into and enjoying nature.

15483,/comment/15483,"Bill 66 leaves me with grave concerns about the impact it will have on the environment and human health!
Bill 66 exempts developers from rules that are crucial to protecting human health. For example, it undermines the Clean Water Act, which protects people from tragedies like the one that happened in Walkerton, where water contamination led to 7 deaths and thousands of cases of severe illness. The bill threatens vital water sources for Ontarians, including Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes. It also repeals the Toxics Reduction Act meant to reduce pollution by preventing industrial uses of certain toxic chemicals.
The Greenbelt has the capacity to store as much carbon dioxide as would be emitted by 33 million cars a year. Interfering with that crucial ecosystem means missing out on a chance to reduce our emissions and meet climate targets! This is an urgent consideration for the survival of the planet and the human species.
The Greenbelt is also economically important. It provides $3.2B annually in services to the region, such as recreational activities and flood protection. It was created in 2005 to deliberately limit the rapid urban sprawl that was encroaching on land that is both environmentally and economically significant.
Please reconsider and put the health and well-being of the people and the planet before profits!
Thank you for your sincere consideration of my concerns and the concerns of many who care about the future health of the planet.

15516,/comment/15516,"I am strongly opposed to this legislation for a multitude of reasons.
First, I feel that Doug Ford is not holding to his ""Promises Made, Promises Kept"" slogan of protecting the Greenbelt. I feel that this act is not in the interest of Ontarians but rather serves private developer interests.
Secondly, the farmland in the Greenbelt is important for providing food security for the GTHA, and opening up this land to development will not only hamper that, but will put Ontario further away from meeting it's climate change goals by housing commuters further and further away from downtown cores, without transit oriented development.
Thirdly, and most importantly, the last time the government ""cut red tape"" surrounding water legislation, seven people died and almost half the population of Walkerton fell ill.
I voice these concerns as a Civil Engineering student at the University of Toronto, who has studied Water and Wastewater Treatment as well as urban transportation systems and transportation planning.
If the public outcry was enough for Doug Ford to promise not to do *exactly* what he is doing now during the campaign, his government should be aware that breaking this promise will lead to a considerable lack of faith in his party. It also very directly fits into the narrative of Ontario's PC Party caring more about wealthy donors and friends that the interests of citizens at large.

15518,/comment/15518,"Bill 66 is an omnibus bill that will impact other provincial legislation, which has been developed over years to protect the environment.
Consider the implications of Bill 66 (such as Schedule 10)  in conjunction with the new Ontario Environment Plan … because Bill 66 seems to contradict the glowing aspirations of the government’s Environment Plan. In its totality, Bill 66 appears to represent a sweeping set of repeals of various provincial acts, leading to a withdrawal of government responsibility over the public sphere.  Government is supposed to provide a well-reasoned  interface between the private and public domains through democratic representation, leading to the betterment of society in general. Corporations have their legal departments and lobbyists, and some have demonstrated progressive thinking in terms of positive benefits, while others remained mired in short-sighted self-interest. The public is supposed to have reliable public service and representation through government oversight. That is why the terms ‘government’ and ‘public service’ are used interchangeably. One is supposed to equal the other.
Specifically, the Ontario Environment Plan promises to protect the environment for future generations, while Bill 66 seeks to diminish environmental protections by encouraging new Open For Business by-laws at the municipal level, thereby directing municipalities to exempt new developments from aspects of key pieces of protective legislation, including, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act, the Clean Waters Act, The Lake Simcoe Protection Act, and other protective provincial legislation.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 expressly states that public notification and consultation are NOT required, unless the municipality wishes to inform citizens in some preferred manner.
While thinking about Bill 66, review the pictures in the new Ontario Environment Plan. The photos are very appealing, but they do not show the vast scope of  Ontario’s existing dense suburban, industrial and commercial/retail developments, nor plans for its continued widening and expansion.  These photos certainly don’t imply how these remaining picturesque locations are threatened by Bill 66.
Together, Bill 66 and the Ontario Environment Plan under-estimate the growing problems of expansive (and expanding) compacted non-porous surfaces in urban and suburban areas, which create ideal conditions for excessive flooding … even during normal rainfall.  The clearing and levelling of more landscape in preparation for continued paving and dense development suggests flooding is written right into development policy at the Ministry of Housing and Development.  In March 2018, the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) stated, “Flooding is the new fire” in Ontario. https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/03/05/water-is-the-new-fire-sa…
The IBC’s statement acknowledged the cause of flooding, juxtaposing it with  all the out-of-control wildfires in Fort McMurray and more recently in B.C. and even Ontario … and placed the blame on patterns of new development that have almost  eradicated natural systems in the blinkered human focus on clearing, levelling, piping and paving for more new developments. Patterns of human activities are exacerbating feedback systems linked to global climate change.
I recommend the province consider recent research about the causes of flooding in southern Ontario, specificially  in the Toronto area, published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Vo. 174 (2018) p. 1929 to 1641, entitled Assessing Urban Areas Vulnerability to Pluvial Flooding using GIS applications and Bayesian Belief Network Model. available through
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617327245?via…
Engineers from the  University of British Columbia, and the University of Windsor, collaborated on this research.  Their study concluded the main cause for flooding could be attributed to on-going dense ever-widening contiguous developments, plus all the associated paved or impermeable surfaces.  Rainfall has nowhere to go when it races off paved surfaces.  Efforts to channel rainfall by building more culverts to carry the water away do not solve the problem of poorly-designed communities.
Normally, natural floodplains spread water out, thereby slowing its progress. Stands of mature trees absorb about 36% of rainfall with which they have contact. The deep and massive root systems of trees and forests perform an essential function when it comes to flood control. For example, one mature eastern white pine will absorb about 100 gallons/day. A fully mature Oak may absorb twice that amount.  Minimally disturbed landscapes sound like pretty good bulwarks against flooding within resilient well-planned communities .. and they do the job for free.
Instead of recognizing the protective resilience of such natural systems,  many  natural channels have been cleared and straightened, and lined with concrete, followed by expansion of nearby developments – result: faster water and even more flooding downstream.  Paved channels do not prevent flooding – quite the opposite.  Since development now intrudes into floodplains (by government decree, both past and present), these natural systems are defeated.  Consider all the pavement in Vaughan and how water always moves from higher to lower levels.  I suspect flooding in Toronto’s west end is exacerabated by water racing ‘downhill’ from Vaughan’s vast paved areas, adding to the woes of Toronto’s own extensive impermeable surfaces. This is just how a watershed works – or DOESN’T, especially when it is excessively paved to the detriment of its natural function.
The Ontario Environment Plan includes absolutely NO pictures of the regular flooding emergencies experienced in Toronto and other towns. Why not? In her December 2017 report, Ontario’s Auditor General, Bonnie Lysek, had some tough words for the province about lack of preparedness for such emergencies.
Where in the Ontario Environment Plan brochure are the photos of dense developments, increasingly cluttered right up to the edges of multi-laned roads, including Highway  400? What are these new residents going to do for fresh air?  We know about pollutants in exhaust fumes from cars and diesel-powered trucks, but the very real dangers posed by particulate matter seem to be ignored.  What about obvious respiratory and related health risks from airborne sub-micron sized particulate matter produced by the wear on (or mass lost from) brakes and tires on ALL roads? 50-70% of total ‘wear materials’ are released as airborne particles. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry shows average loss rates of tire and brake materials are 97 and 9 mg/vkm respectively. (vkm = vehicle kilometre) Tiny particles are inhaled deep into lungs, resulting in lung disease, including certain types of cancer. These particles are rich in certain transition metals (ie, zinc, copper, iron) adding to air toxicity. Heavier vehicles (such as  transport trucks) create more brake and tire wear particles than lighter vehicles. This is only ONE type of pollution common to Ontario. What is the government’s solution to mitigating against such pollution?
The government has decided to repeal the Toxic Reductions Act, 2009 and all associated regulations by Dec 31, 2021. Apparently, this will reduce unnecessary duplication and the burden on industry to comply with  provincial legislation. What ‘burden’ does it impose?  This act was supposed to prevent pollution and reduce the use and creation of toxic substances, while informing Ontarians about those substances. Industry was required to develop VOLUNTARY  toxic reduction plans, and report publicly each year. Since plans were voluntary, it is no surprise the Toxic Reduction Program did not achieve meaningful reductions. Instead of making such plans mandatory, the Ford government has decided to jettison the act.  The government claims it has replaced the provincial Toxic Reductions Act, 2009, with the federal Chemicals Management Plan, ,but this plan does NOT exempt Ontario’s participation.
Here’s what the federal plan states: “In Canada, every order of government plays a part in protecting against risks from chemical substances: municipalities, the provinces and territories, and the federal government. The Government of Canada makes regulations and develops guidelines and objectives that apply across the whole country.” Then, the federal government expects lower tiers of government to follow and ENACT those guidelines!  If Ontario’s Conservative government trusts the federal level regarding the management of chemicals, does it have enough faith in Ottawa  to withdraw its objections and legal challenge to the federal carbon tax?
At this unprecedented rate of repeal, it is difficult to tell what the government will be doing when it comes to serving the public.  I hope the government will take a pause from repeals and start public consultations on these topics.

15632,/comment/15632,"Historically, legislation such as the 14 Acts that will be amended by Bill 66 were enacted in order to protect Ontario’s human population. Many people were appalled when the previous Liberal government amended 19 Acts in order to force through and impose the Green Energy Act O. Reg. 359/09. That decision has proven to be disastrous imperilling human health and the environment for the financial benefit of mostly foreign interests. The Conservative government promised this would not happen under your watch… but Bill 66 is  much, much worse than anything the Liberal government enacted; especially with the proposed amendments to Section 39 of The Clean Water Act 2006 and Section 7 of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act.
Here is an example of what could, and likely will happen if Bill 66 is adopted.
The Province plans to sell off 243 surplus lands. One of those lands could be the 105.8 acre site of the decommissioned Millbrook correctional facility located on the Oak Ridges Moraine.  Infrastructure Ontario acknowledges the land, as well as a watercourse, are contaminated with a cocktail of VOCs (volatile organic compounds).  The land is adjacent to the aquifer that is the Millbrook municipal drinking water supply. The entire 105.8 acreage is located and governed under a Source Protection plan which Bill 66 will undermine. It is also acknowledged by Infrastructure Ontario that there already exists a possible threat to the municipal water supply by a plume of a specific VOC .
Under Bill 66, that acreage could be sold to a developer who promises 50 jobs. Under the implementation of  the Toxic Reductions Act  the developer could get the provincial go-ahead to develop in this off-limit sensitive area.   The municipality being cash-strapped or influenced by a developer then will enact an OFB By-law and will not be required to give notice or hold a public meeting prior to enacting the by-law. The OFB cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. That OFB  would not need to conform to significant threat policies or have any regard to policies set out in a drinking water source protection plan.
Because of Bill 66, this  will allow for development and further contamination on the already  contaminated site on the Oak Ridges Moraine, and the municipal water supply becomes contaminated as do many private wells in the area. The aquifer that supplies the municipal drinking water supply is already under enormous increased pressure because of rampant massive residential development. Then what will the government do when another Walkerton unfolds costing billions of dollars – way more than the promise of  ’50 jobs’ that are not guaranteed to be permanent?  This is only one example, but this will be repeated over and over if the protective essence of Greenbelt and the Clean Water Act is scrapped. The Oak Ridges Moraine is under special protection because it supplies clean drinking water for over a quarter million residents.
What possible benefit is there in amending legislation meant to protect the populace of Ontario by undermining safety protocols and opening up protected areas for unpredictable, likely temporary employment especially if the province’s watersheds become subject to unfettered permanent degradation that will imperil human lives for decades?

Use of this land cannot be ""offset"" with land that is less environmentally critical, and also anyone who is informed about the environment knows the importance of corridors and larger tracts of undisturbed land.
As well, it is very hard to believe that anyone would want a repeat of the Walkerton disaster, but that WILL happen, perhaps in multiple communities, without the safety measures this bill proposes to dismantle.

In 1989, toxic chemicals were found in the groundwater underneath the Uniroyal Chemical site in Elmira. Experts say it will be decades before Elmira's water is safe to drink again. Bill 66 would allow the Province to override the Region of Waterloo’s Official Plan policies that were established to prevent similar toxic destruction of our drinking water. Limiting sprawl is of particular importance in Waterloo Region, where 75% of drinking water comes from aquifers located just beyond the Countryside Line.

2. Schedule 3, of the Ministry of Education removing restrictions on home based child care providers may indeed, open up more childcare spaces, but these will most likely be unsafe ones. The restrictions on child care providers were originally put in place to prevent tragedies from happening to our most valuable assets - our children!  If there are reduced regulations, some will do whatever they can to make money and not consider the safety of the children under their care. Vulnerable young parents will put their children in these daycares out of desperation, fearing that they will not be safe environments.
3. Schedule #9 - Ministry of Labour. No longer requiring employers to get approval for excess hours of work and overtime is trampling on worker's rights. Loosening these regulations (not requiring approval) could open the door for employers to take advantage of their employees, requiring them to work extra hours with no limits.

If Bill 66 is confirmed, the Ontario provincial government will be putting the province’s greenbelt and City of Markham and Region of York at risk.
Has the PC government forgotten why the greenbelt was established?
Greenbelts were established in early 2005 by the provincial government. Agricultural protection is the primary element of the Greenbelt Legislation and the major focus is the protection of prime agricultural land, which is fast disappearing. Where does this government think our food will come from in the future ? From our good neighbours to the South, with their aquifer depletion issues ?
Greenbelts are a major step in protecting environmentally sensitive land, the habitat of many indigenous species Greenbelts curtail the sprawl of urban development threatening ecologically and hydrologically sensitive areas.
Current legislation prevents municipalities from re-zoning areas identified as prime agricultural land.
The greenbelt encompasses more than one million acres in Ontario and we are privileged to have one of the largest and most successful greenbelts in the world. Two greenbelt areas are especially important to southern Ontario and York Region – the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges Moraine. The Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve is one of 15 UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves in Canada (1990). The area is protected because of it’s many unique species and prime recreational land. In addition to being prime farm land, tourism associated with the escarpment, contributes $100 million to the local and regional economy.
The Oak Ridges Moraine is one of the most significant landforms in southern Ontario and covers about 1,900 kilometers of land, much of it is Markham and the Region of York. This area is home to much of the fertile farmland that feed our communities. It is an ecologically important geological landform in the Mixwood Plains, a hydrological system of streams, wetlands, kettle lakes and ponds and their catchment areas, seepage areas, springs and other recharge areas. The moraine gets its name from the rolling hills and valleys that extend more than 160 km from the Niagara Escarpment east to Rice Lake. The moraine is currently one of the most contested sites in Ontario because it stands in the way of major urban development.
The passage of Bill 66 will make greenbelt areas available for the run away sprawl that plaques the GTA area. The land in question is ecologically sensitive and allowing development jeopardizes not only the environment but also agriculture – our ability to produce the food that we need.
It is critical to remember that once the greenbelt is gone, it is gone forever.
I am strongly opposed to proposed Bill 66. It is the most unimaginative plan for making Ontario ""Open for Business"" Reducing environmental protections and freeing up land for more urban sprawl will have disastrous effects for future generations. Just for a little short term gain, really ?
I challenge the PC government to do the hard work of developing innovative solutions to the challenges that face Ontario. Remember, societies grow great when this generation plant trees knowing that we will never sit in their shade.

I am concerned that Bill 66 weakens the legislation in place that protects green space and curtails sprawl. Maintaining the Greenbelt is an important way for us to rein in GHG emissions and curb the impacts of climate change. There is still a lot of developable land in the GTA without opening up the Greenbelt, increasing development on the Oak Ridges or threatening Lake Simcoe and the wider watershed of our region.

I fail to see how repealing these two acts will make Ontario more competitive.

I could go into exactly how worried I am that the environment is secondary to ""open for business"".  But I'm not sure if it's worth the effort because it's hard to trust this government, and here's why:
In at least two public consultations so far, the government has completely dismissed the feedback.  In one instance they cited ""bias"" to dismiss fact that most people want the modern sex-education curriculum in our schools.  In another, they just plain ignored the will of the people (e.g., at least 10:1 against the Cap and Trade repeal act with over 11000 comments, assuming the e-mails were similar to the online comments).  In the latter instance, they only asked for feedback on the environmental registry because they were being sued for not following the law.  Furthermore, they passed the proposed Act well before they posted their decision on the environmental registry.  The response to comments didn't acknowledge that most people didn't want their  legislation.  What a farce.  The government has proceeded to inundate the environmental registry, perhaps relying on the fact that if people know they won't be listened to, why would they comment in the first place?
Please do not continue to make a farce of the Environmental Bill of Rights Environmental registry.  This is where the people of Ontario get to have a say on proposed policies, regulations, and legislation that are environmentally significant.

_____________________________
Archaeology is essential for understanding our province's past. Indigenous history is particularly at risk if  Bill 66 passes. There is little archival or built heritage available to understand pre-contact and contact-period indigenous societies which makes archaeological assessments of these potential sites extremely necessary.
As someone who has worked within Cultural Resource Management (CRM) archaeology, and now continues to work within the Heritage sector in a collections management capacity, I hold material culture to the highest value. The information gleaned from these assessments help to form a better understanding of the people that lived here from pre-contact to historical periods. The materials produced from these assessments can then be used for research, and/or for public education, particularly in the tourism & culture sector.
Since the 1980s, CRM archaeological assessment have become a standard and necessary step in the development process, and it should stay. Canada is a young nation with so much archaeological knowledge left to learn from. Amend Bill 66.

Giving developers free reign and ignoring safeguards that were put in place after much consultation and deliberation does not make Ontario ""open for business"". It is an attempt to take what little of our natural world we have left to make a few wealthy developers even wealthier.
While I cannot speak to the entirety of Bill 66, which is trying to plow through a myriad of issues with little or no debate, Section 10 is a blatant disregard of what is good and just. It cannot and must not be passed!

Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened.

16979,/comment/16979,"My comment concerns Schedule 10 of Bill 66: The 'Open for Business Bylaw'.  The difficulty in land use planning is to resolve competing interests centered on a given property. Existing homes, businesses and industry will have aligned, neutral or conflicting interests to a proposed 'new-use' in the neighbourhood in a whole variety of matters, from water-use to effluent, from sound and light creation to the effect on traffic, from building height, footprint, building setbacks and the aesthetic of the neighbourhood to stormwater management and flood control. Currently a municipality receives a site plan application and sends it to its own Planners who review it, and send it onwards to other concerned agencies for further comment. There are many results to this process. Sometimes the application is rejected, sometimes bylaw amendments are sought and then are granted or rejected, sometimes the application must be reworked and resubmitted. In that process, local businesses, industry and citizens also have the right to stand up and make written or verbal comment. In some cases, where interests conflict, groups will advocate for or challenge the approval of a bylaw amendment or other such approval. With the switch from the OMB to the LPAT, every attempt is now made to resolve things in the municipality without using expensive and time-intensive processes such as the OMB. It is a delicate balance and I can see wanting to make it 'less exhaustive' and more conducive to business. But what this proposed planning tool may do is to entirely circumvent the ability of any adjacent interests, be they citizenry or businesses, farms or industry, to have any say in the matter. Another truth is that our municipalities are governed by humans, and humans make mistakes: they may not personally have any stake in the proposal or surrounding area and may not take the duty of care to observe all the salient details. With your law, public consultation with regards to the proposal is not required and as a result, there may be no oversight by concerned parties. Involved is only the proponent, the municipal politicians and planner, some county officials and your Ministry. Except for the proponent, nobody else inside the process has a personal vested interest in it and therefore, there is no-one to look at it with a critical eye. If you want to make Ontario open for business, there are other ways to do it than a crass work-around. The respect for the rights of all stakeholders are the reason we like to call Ontario and Canada home.

It is extremely important to  remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66 for the following reasons:
The Greenbelt:
* preserves farmland and greenspace which naturally filters water and prevents flooding,
* provides critical habitat for many of Ontario’s endangered species. It also
* helps to combat climate change by storing 86.6 million tonnes of carbon.
* It provides approximately $2.6 billion annually in environmental services.
* Food and farming in the Greater Golden Horseshoe contributes $12.3 billion to the economy and creates 212,000 jobs.
* Over 7,000 farms are found in the Greenbelt, including half of Ontario’s fruit farms and one fifth of our vegetable farms
*
* It is our biggest defence against climate change
* Natural greenspace absorbs flood water and
* It reduces the impact of extreme storms on our infrastructure and stormwater management systems.
Thank you.

I am deeply concerned about the impact Bill 66 will have on the safety of our water, on the integrity of our local agriculture community, on the health of our green spaces, and on the sustainability of our communities.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 overrides protections for the health and well-being of Ontario's citizens, including those established under the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Clean Water Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act, and the Places to Grow Act. Protecting Lake Simcoe is not red tape!!
It seems that what happened during the Mike Harris years has been mostly forgotten, the financial gutting of the environmental ministries, education and health, and the lack of oversight, transparency and accountability, as well as public input.
And now Premier Ford, you are repeating the same behavior as your predecessor and calling it Ontario’s Government for the People! This government is being run totally undemocratic and not at all about engaging and protecting the taxpayers or our precious environment, but in supporting the wealthy land developers and big business corporate sector.
Do you want to repeat the Mike Harris Red Tape Commission which caused the deaths of 7 people in 1999? There will surely be more Walkertons and much worse if Bill 66 gets passed!
Colin Perkel tells it in his book, Well of Lies, “the Conservative government of Premier Mike Harris, with its pro-business approach and antipathy towards red tape, had made it abundantly clear that aggressive enforcement and prosecutions would not be the order of the day. Besides, the government’s severe downsizing of the ministry had effectively hobbled its ability to police environmental violations.”
For the full story, here’s a link to the e-book version of Well of Lies:
www.amazon.ca/Well-Lies-Walkerton-Water-Tragedy-ebook/dp/B01IZTCFQY/ref…
It seems there’s a cycle to these things. Lessons learned in the aftermath of tragedy are forgotten and we’re now galloping full-tilt down the sorry path of regulatory gaps, inadequate oversight and monitoring, and responsibilities downloaded to entities unwilling or unable to discharge them. Simplistic solutions and glib reassurances are rewarded. It’s all too chillingly familiar for those of us who remember Walkerton.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 must be stopped!

As for all proposals concerning the opening of our environment for business with limited restrictions is ridiculous.

Under the guise of ""Restoring Competitiveness"" it is now possible for municipalities to circumvent regulations put in place to protect; farm land, water sources, and the Great Lakes. Apart from the fact that damaging the Great Lakes could cause an international incident, we need to extend more protection to water sources especially moraines such as the Galt-Paris Moraine and continue to protect the Oak Ridges Moraine in its entirety. Many towns and cities in Ontario depend on ground water for their drinking water and given the current trade wars we can absolutely not afford to lose farmland if the citizens of Ontario are going to be able to afford to eat safe wholesome food. The developers of this province have barely made a dent in the land available for them outside of the green belt. Any argument that green belt land is needed for ""affordable homes"" is utterly bogus, the homes built there would be premium top of the market mansions rather than affordable. But small towns are cash strapped and easy prey for deep pocketed developers who might offer inducements for prime real estate and when the green belt gets nibbled away we will hear claims like ""it was the will of the people"", ""the province doesn't want to get in the way of creating jobs and homes"" etc.. But here's an idea, instead of sacrificing irreplaceable  green space and fouling water sources, why not make it easier to develop ""Brown Field"" lands and former industrial places? There is land to spare in this category, much of it available for a song. Sell it off for $1.00 per hectare but with the understanding that the developer is entirely responsible for the remediation of the soil and any water courses that travel through or find their source on that land, subject, of course, to government inspection.
The Premier backed away from messing with the Green Belt before because he saw the reaction of the public the vast majority of whom see it and the water sources protected by it as a sacred trust. Nothing has changed and Ontarians have long memories when they feel that they have been betrayed.

Clean water, air and soil are necessary for our survival but the current Ontario government is not taking this seriously. Premier Ford is reneging on his promise not to develop Ontario's Greenbelt. It would be a selfish and irresponsible action to threaten the Greenbelt that  protects the most basic needs of the general public.
Clean water and air are not to be taken for granted. Are we to end up like the Chinese having to wear masks due to heavy air pollution? Will there be more deaths due to unsafe drinking water which has already happened in Ontario's recent past in Walkerton? It would be a huge mistake to assume that these necessities will simply come from somewhere else. Clean air and fresh drinkable water are not ubiquitous anymore. Recent studies concerning Lake Ontario have revealed that pollution levels are much worse than previously thought. From micro-plastics to invasive species, our major source of drinking water in Ontario is fragile and under great pressure due to ill treatment as a result of human activity.
We need to alter our behavior in order to respect and protect our basic resources in Ontario. The Oak Ridges Moraine and every other wetland body left in our province is necessary to help provide clean water to the greater Toronto area. Developing it would be a critical mistake and probably an irreversible one too. Why is it so difficult for us to understand that without a good stock of natural resources, humans will suffer? It is rudimentary geography.
If Premier Ford passes Bill 66 as is, people may not have what they need to survive comfortably in the near future. Even if he denies that Climate Change is happening right now (where's winter??) and that the effect of Climate Change may sour our fresh water supply much faster than ever thought possible, we still need clean water and air and soil to drink, breath and grow food. A shortage of any one of these basic human needs would be a major unaffordable crisis for Ontario and Canada. This Bill is nothing short of wreckless.
Please come to your senses and protect these basic natural resources that our survival depends upon. We certainly can live with a little less greed and competition in the race to develop every bit of our land. In Ontario, we have already drained too many wetlands, paved too much rich agricultural soil, and pump too many toxins into our atmosphere. We need to save what's left -- this is vitally important for Ontario's population needs.

regulation. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has an ongoing interest in this process
given our experience and roles as:
•	A regulator under Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act;
•	A public commenting body under the Planning Act and the Environmental Assessment Act;
•	A resource management agency operating on a local watershed basis;
•	A body with delegated authority in plan review to represent the provincial interest for natural hazards;
•	One of the largest landowners (18,000 hectares) in the Toronto Region; and
•	A source protection authority (SPA) under the Clean Water Act.
It is our understanding that Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation involves changes to the Planning Act
to create a new economic development tool, the open-for-business planning by-law (OFBPBL). The OFBPBL would be available to all local municipalities to ensure they can act quickly to attract businesses seeking to advance proposals on development sites. In circumstances where there are employment and economic growth opportunities, municipalities could request to use an OFBPBL, provided certain criteria were satisfied. The regulation containing these criteria is not yet written but would include details on the new major employment use, identify the uses of land, buildings or structures that may be authorized by the tool, and prescribe how notice is to be given to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing following the passing of an OFBPBL.
Our understanding of the intent of Bill 66, and Schedule 10 in particular, is that an approved OFBPBL would have the effect of exempting applications under the Planning Act from having to be consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (2014). It would also exempt applications from having to conform to policies in a number of other Provincial Acts, such as the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Greenbelt Act and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, among others. Additionally, an OFBPBL is only available to authorize uses of land for “prescribed purposes” (job creation), which have not yet been defined and are to be prescribed by regulation at a later date.
TRCA offers the following comments for your consideration in finalizing the regulations and associated documents.
General Comments
The Provincial Policy Statement, the Acts listed above, and their associated policies and/or plans are vital to the long-term sustainability, health, and safety of the people of Ontario and to fulfilling TRCA’s mandate under the CA Act. The PPS guides land use planning to serve the public interest and deliver development that balances economic, environmental and social objectives. Without consideration of the PPS and area specific Acts and Plans that have been promulgated over the last two decades to address areas of public concern, the proposed OFBPBL tool could result in economic considerations outweighing of equally important or more important public interests.
As currently proposed, these changes to the Planning Act significantly diminish our ability to achieve our mandate particularly within our jurisdiction where growth pressures are significant, and the need to protect drinking water, sensitive lands, and aquatic and natural heritage resources is great. At present, it is unclear what criteria municipalities would have to meet before seeking approval to adopt this new economic development tool. The proposed authorization for an OFBPBL uses only the single test of present day job creation (50 or 100 jobs per population of less or greater than 250,000, and the types of jobs are not defined) as the rationale for waiving an assessment that includes other equally important considerations. Without the comprehensive tests afforded by the various pieces of identified legislation and regulations, there could be inadvertent and undesirable impacts on the site itself, as well as to adjacent and downstream properties, in the short term or over time. These impacts may include flooding, ground and surface water contamination, loss of critical habitat function or linkages, and the loss of productive agricultural lands that provide important environmental functions.
TRCA recommends that the province amend the draft Bill and regulations to require municipalities to maintain the conformity/consistency requirements of the PPS, the Clean Water Act, and area specific Plans such as the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Greenbelt Plan.
The Clean Water Act and Source Protection Planning
Several pieces of provincial legislation including the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, and the Clean Water Act are in place to protect some of the most hydrologically sensitive lands in Ontario. These lands capture, infiltrate and clean rainwater and snowmelt for storage in natural underground aquifers, which, along with surface water sources, then provide drinking water to hundreds of thousands of residents and their communities that rely on ground and surface water. The Clean Water Act, which provides the legislative basis for Source Protection Plans and their associated policies, alongside the Great Lakes Protection Act, is an essential tool necessary to avoid another tragic contaminated water incident such as what occurred in Walkerton in 2000, which led to multiple deaths and long-term illnesses for many hundreds of people.
Bill 66 proposes to override the need to conform to significant drinking water threat policies, which were mandated and approved by the Province in Source Protection Plans under the Clean Water Act. Eliminating the ability to guide land use planning decisions that protect clean, safe drinking water sources creates risks of more contaminated water illnesses and in a worst case scenario loss of life. Further, Bill 66 is inconsistent with the Province’s recently proposed Made in Ontario Environment Plan, put forward by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. The plan states, ""We will protect these critical systems by using water more sustainably and keeping our water and air clean while growing our economy.""
TRCA recommends reinserting the requirement for compliance with the Clean Water Act and the other Area Specific Acts noted above, to avoid risks to public health from contamination and overuse impacts to groundwater aquifers and surface water, relied upon for drinking water and ecosystem health.
Natural Hazard Risks from Flooding and Erosion
TRCA is a commenting agency under both the Planning Act and the Environmental Assessment Act, and a regulatory agency under the Conservation Authorities Act. The Conservation Authorities Act provides the legal basis for TRCA’s mandate to undertake watershed planning and management programs that prevent, eliminate, or reduce the risk to life and property from flood hazards and erosion hazards, as well as encourage the conservation and restoration of natural resources. TRCA also has a delegated responsibility to represent the provincial interest on natural hazards under Section 3.1 of the Provincial Policy Statement.
All new development has the potential to increase the risk of hazards to life and property from flooding and erosion, and add to downstream cumulative impacts. Bill 66 with its employment focus would benefit from recognizing the importance of the management of stormwater from increased impervious surfaces. Historically, employment lands have increased impervious surfaces on up to 90% or more of a site, requiring significant stormwater management infrastructure to minimize impacts from flooding and erosion. Ensuring new development or redevelopment is not at risk from flooding or erosion is essential, and must remain a basic principle in determining the feasibility of new development. Without proper evaluation of these potential impacts, maintenance and operation costs will be uncertain creating risk. Furthermore, downstream residential areas could face increasing flood risks, with the attendant costs and liabilities attributed to the Province and municipalities involved in their review and approval. TRCA has useful mapping tools and hydrology models to aid municipalities in evaluating these risks, managing them with effective mitigation strategies and helping to decide on strategic locations where an OFBPBL could be best utilized. TRCA has successfully worked with municipalities and the proponent to facilitate development of major employment uses within tight timeframes including the Costco, Fed Ex, Canadian Tire, and Home Depot distribution centres within the current planning framework outside of the Canadian Tire distribution centre in Caledon where a Minister’s Zoning Order approach was applied. Very recently TRCA has worked with municipalities to facilitate major employment uses on urban redevelopment sites which provided retrofitting and restoration opportunities. Without a specific need to consider important PPS and area specific plan requirements remediation and restoration opportunities that address important matters of public safety and hazards could be missed resulting in costly impacts.
TRCA recommends that Bill 66 and the implementing regulation require municipalities to work closely with their local Conservation Authority and to obtain their sign off on the proposed conditions and requirements to mitigate risks and protect downstream communities from flooding and erosion hazards.
TRCA further recommends that any proposal only be considered by the Minister if it is at a minimum consistent with Section 3.1 of the current 2014 PPS so as to protect public safety and to minimize risk.
Consultation and Due Planning Process
Bill 66 proposes that an OFBPBL is not required to be subject to any public process, including the holding of a public meeting / hearing or the ability to appeal decisions to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT). Additionally, site plan approval by a municipality is not required, although similar conditions may be imposed. A municipal council must first pass a resolution requesting that the Minister of Municipal Affairs approve an OFBPBL. The Minister has the power to impose conditions on an approval, but a municipality is not required to give public notice or hold a public meeting prior to the passing of an OFBPBL. Only after passing the OFBPBL is the municipality required to give public notice within 30 days, even though the by-law comes into force within 20 days after passing.
TRCA supports broad consultation and stakeholder engagement throughout the planning and development process. In particular, conservation authorities (CAs) have long-established close working relationships with local municipalities, and local municipalities regularly consult with CA staff, especially where development occurs within a CA’s regulated area. The approach of providing notice after the fact creates a troubling precedent whereby municipal councils can bypass normal public notice requirements, creating a situation where public and other private interests may not be given adequate consideration.
From a development review perspective, removing site plan approval by a municipality presents serious concerns. The site plan stage is the time when approval agencies receive confirmation that the promises, commitments and conceptual designs made during early stage discussions (stormwater management, grading outside the natural heritage system, hazard land impacts, etc.) are shown that they can be achieved. The site planning process is the time when development feasibility of the proposal on the site needs to be proven. Sites with physical constraints need to be designed appropriately to meet technical standards for public health and safety. Many recent applications proposed a development footprint within site constraints, and benefit from a thorough site plan review process. Without site plan approval, design proposals made at earlier stages will potentially not be followed through to construction and implementation. Further, if the development is not required to obtain site plan approval from the municipality, there will be the potential for confusion, as site plans will be required by CAs for final permits, where development is within lands regulated by a CA.
The bill and future regulation need to incorporate a municipal pre-screening process involving the CAs to confirm development limits, water management and the ability to appropriately address physical site constraints in keeping with provincial standards.
Removing the ability to appeal an OFBPBL to the LPAT undermines the principle of due process within the land use planning system in Ontario. A key purpose of the LPAT (formerly the Ontario Municipal Board, or OMB) is to ensure that all parties’ interests are adequately and fairly considered, including those of the proponent, municipalities, agencies, and community members. Removing appeal mechanisms limits the ability of municipalities and planning agencies to ensure the development will not have negative impacts on the surrounding public, property, or environment.
Interestingly in some of our recent experiences involving employment lands it has been litigation between opposing private interests, e.g., landowners opposing landowners to ensure previous landowner agreements are upheld, or to ensure cooperation on servicing arrangements, cost sharing, equitable allocation of community uses, etc. in addition to public interests that have characterized approval processes. Currently, in our jurisdiction most landowners, where there is serviceable land, are part of cost sharing and servicing arrangements premised linked to established Planning Act processes. The notice and approval requirements allow landowners to self-police to allow equitable and orderly development of communities and fair cost sharing. One unintended consequence of this legislation may be to create a situation that would allow one private interest to benefit at the expense of other private interests resulting in an inequitable approach to land development. There is a concern that this situation might result in an individual landowner trying to shirk previous commitments around environmental conditions involving the Conservation Authority and the landowner group.
As currently proposed, by removing or restricting the appeal process, Bill 66 removes the ability for the voice of local communities and private interests to be heard. As the Bill is proposing that consultation with the public is not required, and that the public only have a very limited amount of time to voice their opinion during which time the OFBPBL can be passed, the public and private interests nearby, including landowners, has been effectively removed from the process.
TRCA recommends that an administrative tribunal appeal process remain, even in an altered manner, in order to give agencies, private interests and members of the public adequate channels to be engaged in the protection of public health and safety matters and the shaping of their communities.
It is unclear how the OFBPBL tool will operate in the context of the current planning framework. Municipalities have approved official plans with identified and designated employment lands based on full servicing. Municipal, TRCA and private interests are also currently engaged in the Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR) processes in our jurisdiction to identify the next generation of employment (and residential) lands to accommodate growth and development to the 2041 planning horizon.
Accordingly, official plans have identified certain lands, based on public consultation, where other community values take precedence, to identify areas that are not suitable for employment lands. Bill 66 and the OFBPBL seems to be able to override these approved plans to potentially site new employment opportunities in unsuitable areas. The OFBPBL tool could be adjusted in scope to be used wisely to be able to accelerate development approvals for employment lands, while respecting past planning decisions.
TRCA recommends that the Act and regulation clarify that an accelerated approvals process only be allowed to occur on lands currently serviced and designated for employment in municipal official plans.
Recommendations
1.	The consideration of use of an OFBPBL should be geographically limited to existing designated employment lands with access to full municipal sewer and water services and proximity to 400 series highways and/or other major transportation corridors.
2.	The province should require consistency with the PPS, Clean Water Act, and area specific plans in the proposed regulation to ensure the CA mandate for protection from natural hazards is implemented through an OFBPBL application, a process that has been developed over decades of consultation and application of legislation to minimize risk to people, life and property in Ontario.
3.	If the recommendation above is not pursued in full, TRCA recommends including in the regulation of “prescribed criteria” for an OFBPBL application, the following minimum requirements to demonstrate that public health and safety issues will be addressed:
•	Drinking water supplies and designated vulnerable areas are protected;
•	Appropriate considerations are incorporated to development and redevelopment decisions, to ensure new natural hazards from flooding and erosion are not created and existing hazards not aggravated, including review and sign off by the local CA prior to Ministerial endorsement;
•	Include requirements that no development or site alterations take place within a 30 metre setback from Key Natural Heritage Features and Key Hydrologic Features; and
•	That sites be pre-screened by a municipality, with approval from the local CA, to ensure the development feasibility of the proposal in relation to the physical characteristics of the site, so that public health, safety and natural hazard technical issues can be addressed appropriately on the site to meet provincial standards.
4.	Where an OFBPBL is to be considered for lands outside of existing designated and serviced employment lands that only employment uses that are agriculture related or on-farm diversified uses should be permitted. This measure will help to maintain the integrity of rural and agricultural land uses in the Greenbelt and on the Oak Ridges Moraine.
5.	The future regulation needs to include additional specific details to provide clarity on:
•	The types of employment uses that are permitted to use this fast-tracked process; and
•	A shortened, but open and transparent regime of notice and public consultation under the established Planning Act process.

1) Increase tax burdens for the populations of Ontario. It has already been shown that sprawling new developments costs cities more in service expansion than infill projects. infill project mean better utilization of existing infrastructure
2) This land isn't needed for developments. Government own data shows that there is more than enough land designated for development within existing cities and towns to accommodate the expected population growth until 2041.
3) Developments on the edge of cities will not improve transit or commute times in the province of Ontario, it will make them worse. We need infill project so that tax dollars can be invest in new transit projects.
4) These new communities will not provide desperately needed low-income or affordable housing projects for the Province of Ontario. Even if they were included, any money saved to these families would then have to be spend on affording a car.
5) This sprawl will be taking away local producers and farmers. The Province of Ontario will have to rely more on outside of Province Producers, why would we not want to support Canadian Farmers.
There are many other reasons why this Bill should not be passed, but at the heart of it this Bill will not make Ontario stronger, it will make it weaker.

Municipalities are a 'creature' of the Province.  They do not necessarily have the best interest of the Province in mind when making decisions.  It is imperative that Ontario asserts it's constitutional right to protect the air land and water in the Province on behalf of all Ontarians.

17121,/comment/17121,"To Our Duly Elected Officials in the City of Vaughan:
Bill 66 is one of the most ill-conceived and short sighted pieces of legislation to come out of the Provincial Government to date. This legislation encourages municipalities to ignore existing environmental and planning policies including The Greenbelt Act, The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, The Clean Water Act, and The Great Lakes Protection Act. These acts were all created to protect environmentally sensitive lands and waterways and in turn protect the health and well-being of Ontario citizens.
Bill 66 allows municipalities to create “open for business” zoning bylaws. Industrial buildings would be eligible for this type of fast track development. Industrial buildings that degrade the environment and pollute waterways would be encouraged to locate their operations in “Open for Business” zones.
The Provincial Government is so intent on pushing through development as fast as possible that Municipalities will not be required to inform the public when development under Bill 66 gets approved. Not only is the health and well-being of our communities threatened but we won’t even get a say in how they are shaped.
Bill 66 is a real threat to Vaughan. Vaughan is home to where the Greenbelt, the Oak Ridges Moraine and the headwaters of major watersheds all intersect. There are thousands of Vaughan residents who are located close to Greenbelt lands and downstream form major watershed tributaries. This policy has the potential to do real harm to residents of Vaughan and the environment.
Doug Ford emphatically promised during the election that he would not touch the Greenbelt. Our communities are not red tape, our rivers and streams are not red tape, and the future health and well-being of our children is not red tape. Please listen to your constituents and reject Bill 66. We did not vote for this dangerous legislation!

17123,/comment/17123,"We understand the need to reduce excessive obstacles to economic development and job creation.
As longstanding conservative supporters, we endorse many aspects of Bill 66.
We also strongly believe that the Bill public acceptability would be enhanced by substantive modifications in relation to the relaxation of Greenbelt and Water quality protections.
For example, in order to gain approval for a new industrial venture and location that requires Ministerial approval, it should be necessary to demonstrate that there is no viable alternative site that does not violate prior protections, that claimed job creation is not speculative, and that enduring approval is conditional upon actual realization of the anticipated job creation.
The essence of the required adjustment is that relaxation of hard-won protections  that are fundamental to our quality of life and to the essential nature of Ontario as an enviable place to live and work must be, and be seen to be, prudent, progressive and robust against political, administrative or legal attempts at subversion.
We would consider meaningful modifications that satisfy these objectives to be an important, effective and laudable step, in keeping with the standards we expect from a Conservative good governance.

ERO Number 013-4125: PROPOSED OPEN-FOR-BUSINESS PLANNING TOOL
ERO Number 013-4239: NEW REGULATION UNDER THE PLANNING ACT FOR OPEN-FOR-BUSINESS PLANNING TOOL
Save Our Water, a Centre Wellington residents group concerned with protecting groundwater OPPOSES THE PROPOSALS UNDER BILL 66 SCHEDULE 10.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, Schedule 10 is a full-scale assault on Ontario’s environmental policies and legislation, specifically the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Water Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act, the Places to Grow Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Provincial Policy Statement and Official Plans.  All of these acts and policies could be circumvented in 2019 by the proposed new category of municipal zoning powers called the “open-for-business planning by-law.”
The proposed planning by-law would allow municipalities to fast track industrial and employment development without adhering to municipal zoning by-laws. Source water protection zones are one critical example. Elected municipal officials should never be put in a position of deciding to by-pass legislation put in place to protect the environment and future health of Ontarians. This is an enormous step backwards. It puts the future of Ontarians at risk!!!
Ontario’s Clean Water Act was established in 2006 following the Walkerton tragedy in order to prevent threats to drinking water sources and to protect Ontario residents from such dire errors in municipal management from every happening again.
Premier Ford is prepared to decimate environmental protection and jeopardize the safety of our groundwater supplies by allowing industrial development on land with zoning restrictions and in jurisdictions where drinking water sources are at risk.  Further, he plans to download responsibility to the municipalities to administer the changes. Under his new scheme, a municipality can potentially agree to a new development with no public input or discussion, and it can ignore environmental protection practises while developers and industry proponents are systematically rewarded.
The Provincial government then will simply provide the automatic rubber stamp of approval. Once approved, there is no recourse. It cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).
Who gains by the enacting of Bill 66? Definitely not the people of Ontario.
Premier Ford has misled Ontarians. Ontarians do not want factories and subdivisions built on the sensitive farmland, forests and moraines that recharge the aquifers needed for our drinking water. Premier Ford has obviously not given thought to the fact that the people of Ontario will not allow him to pursue this course of action. Already the cities of Burlington and Hamilton have indicated that they will not be a party to the destruction of Ontario's hard won fight for meaningful environmental protections.
Legislation aimed at boosting our economy should not trump regulations explicitly created to safeguard our common resources (including our groundwater) and the well-being of Ontarians. Rather than leading our province as “A Government for the People”, this legislation makes it apparent that the current government is shamelessly prioritizing business interests at all costs.
Save Our Water OPPOSES Bill 66 and the proposed open-for-business planning by-law.

17135,/comment/17135,"Bill 66 constitutes a risk to Ontarian's in multiple ways, with the only true benefits going to businesses which are being courted by the current provincial government.
Regulations are in place for reasons - often very serious immediates ones that can completely impact on lives.
Planning laws do cause delays - they safeguard people and their communities, while ensuring businesses do not profit at the expense of indivdual citizens who often have no knowledge of changes or the risks involved until it is too late.  Exempting anyone from planning and environmental laws is clearly not intended to protect Ontario, it's current population or the future of the province, but instead will only benefit a chosen few, in the moment.
The current rhetoric from the government in power is concerning on multiple levels, but specifically with regards to environmental concerns, and in-place legislative protections for the very public who are the taxpayers, or in truth, the employers of those currently running the province.  Only someone who is looking to benefit financially and politically would consider sacrificing the Greenbelt, limit environmental protections, and setting the stage to endanger citizens by way of less regulation for drinking water, for example, by limiting the Clean Water Act - and all without public consultation.
If this govenment is interested in being transparent and responsible, stop blaming past governments for existing situations, deal with the as they are now, while also consulting with the public and interested parties that include those who don't expect a profit but instead want life to be good and getting better.  Consult - and don't then when presented with results that aren't what was wanted, attempt to diminish the voice of the people by claiming special interest groups and such.

17152,/comment/17152,"During the election, Doug Ford promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment. However, your ""Open For Business"" planning tool clearly places Ontario's Greenbelt in danger of development and environmental degradation.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66.

17158,/comment/17158,"I live in Paris Ontario.  We moved here 20 years ago - because of the picturesque landscape - - the river, the hills, the trees, surrounding forests.  In the past few years - this is continually being destroyed.  Entire swaths of forest have been cut down for subdivisions.  The gorgeous area in a loop of the river, known as ""Barker's Bush"" is supposedly going to have all it's corn fields (which lie circled within the woods) built into a subdivision.  Prime area along the river near downtown - which could have been made into park / walking area something like in Stratford Ontario - keeps popping up more townhouses and real estate.  Beside our beloved cenotaph - which has remained treasured and the same for decades - a beautiful old theatre has been torn down for ugly modern condos.  I am an Ontarian that does NOT WANT more businesses, jobs, real estate, housing, people moving into small town rural areas!  There are a tonne of deer and other wild life that are continually getting displaced.  I care about the bees, butterflies, wildlife and trees much more than money and businesses!  Why do trees have to be cut down?  Why do you have to ruin these beautiful areas?  Money should be spent on enhancing them!  Make the river side a beautiful place in nature to enjoy!  That would bring tourists to our little shops more than real estate!  You're ruining one of the ""loveliest little towns in Canada"".  I am not happy.  The environment matters to me.  I voted Liberal because of that.  Do not assume that everyone wants water resources, green spaces and farmland changed into subdivisions and businesses.  I DO NOT.  There are lots of urban places to do that in.  The places of nature need to be kept and at any chance possible - worked into any building up - not destroyed.  The north end of Paris with the ugly new subdivision going in looks horrendous!  It looks like Mississauga or Kitchener (another area that is having all its farmland and woods destroyed for ugly subdivisions).  And the south end where they mowed down the pine forest and every little farm around that area, looks equally as ugly. Paris was a beautiful little small town that is quickly being ruined while real estate big shots rub their greedy hands together on making a buck over ever square inch of land around here.  I don't want it.  My voice matters too.  I want to see forests and rural areas for as long as I live here & I don't want to have to move away to find it.  I drove down to Washington DC last summer - how come all their highways and towns are surrounded by trees??  Why can they keep things looking green?  Ontario loves nothing more than to chop down trees.  This area also has a high Six Nations history and culture - where nature is held sacred.  This has to be taken into consideration.  In 20 years, I've come to know a lot of people in my town - and they hate all the subdivisions coming up and the trees being cut down.  Please stop.

Do politicians never learn from previous mistakes?

The PC’s campaigned hard against Kathleen Wynn and Dalton McGuinty’s foray into renewable energy that was an economic disaster that accomplished nothing for the environment and was riddled with unintended consequences.  Now Doug Ford and company have come up with this scheme that makes it easier for developers to expand urban sprawl into our natural resource that is equivalent to an ‘endangered species’.

As an Ontario resident I am worried that the proposed Bill will produce harmful effects for both our Province's natural environment and the health of our fellow Ontarians. As a consulting archaeologist I am disturbed by the potential for Bill 66 to allow developers to literally bulldoze away Ontario's rich history spanning more than 10,000 years.
The proposed bill will allow for the development and degradation of environmentally sensitive and ecologically beneficial areas such as the Ontario Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine, in addition to numerous Source Water Protection Areas and formerly protected areas within the Lake Simcoe Watershed. These natural areas offer significant environmental benefits. The Greenbelt alone saves the province $2.6 billion a year in essential services such as providing fresh drinking water and clean air. The proposed bill also undermines and the Clean Water Act less than 20 years after the Walkerton disaster, putting both the health of Ontario residents and the ecological health of our Great Lakes at risk. As Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care I hope this would be of concern for you.
Additionally, Bill 66 threatens our province's cultural heritage. Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years.

1)	Breaking open the covenants of the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, and the Clean Water Act: We cannot go back once this occurs. The need to continue to protect these lands and our sources of water will only become greater in the years to come, as populations increase, and changes in the climate intensify.
2)	Ascribing so much power to the Minister: The Minister is a political appointment and cannot possibly have the expertise required to fully assess the implications of situating a new business opportunity in any given location. The government would be putting itself in a position where it appears to be beholden to private interests. Some future government could also use this power to slow the entire approval process down, which I do not believe is the intention of this Bill.
3)	Stepping outside of the Growth Plan:  Starting with the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act in 2001, efforts have been undertaken to develop the Greater Golden Horseshoe in a cohesive, cost-efficient, organized manner while protecting the lands which clean our air, filter our drinking water and grow our food. The various Acts reflect the work of successive governments, and much consultation with citizens, municipalities, businesses and the development industry. Infrastructure such as sewage, public transit, and roads is a long-term game, and areas have already been identified where new businesses would best be situated. Stepping outside these plans seems a duplication, and could add significant costs borne by a municipality to service a given site. Has the government fully consulted with municipalities about the barriers they are facing to promote employment opportunities? Are there more finely honed ways of addressing some of these barriers?
4)	The fact that public consultation is not required: many potential issues can be clarified and addressed through public consultation processes, leading to a plan more suited to an individual site and neighbouring interests, and reducing the potential for harm to public health and safety.
5)	The rushed process of introducing this Bill: The comment period is short. Details needed to make a fully informed decision about the merits of the Bill, such as the “prescribed criteria” have not been provided. ""50 jobs"" is mentioned - are these full time? Part time?
I suggest the comment period should be extended, public consultation absolutely must be mandatory, more specific and less invasive ways of addressing red tape should be sought. Consult with municipalities and townships to identify specific issues and more appropriate solutions.

Landscapes where this aquifer groundwater bubbles up to the surface, and other floodplains that form the headwaters of rivers which provide important drainage through agricultural and urban areas, need to be protected from development and other perturbations.
Landscapes which provide important watershed ecosystem habitats upstream of urban areas whose water supply is drawn from lakes that are fed by those watersheds, need to be protected from development and other perturbations.
All legal instruments and government policy aimed at opening Ontario up for business by local municipalities, must be diligently reviewed and comprehensive checks and balances included to protect the water supply from local development, to assure that all Ontarians have safe and sustainable water supply for generations to come. If we perturb our water-producing and water-filtering watershed landscapes, we will also compromise all downstream cities and communities that rely on lake water for drinking water.
The Gov of Ontario should be aware that southwest and central Ontario is really a single watershed & great lake system, and that development in one landscape can have impact on the water supply hundreds of kilometers away.
Don't permit opening up municipal development decision-making on the ""Greenbelt"" headwater-watershed ecosystems, since there is simply no safe way to prevent further permanent damage to our water supply. For this reason, I believe the Gov of Ontario should also rethink the Places to Grow legislation, to restrict growth in areas that are dependent on groundwater from aquifers, as some of the current population targets will ultimately serve to permanently deplete the groundwater and turn our current agricultural lands into a desert that won't be able to support any of us (and that is definitely NOT good for business)!

In their greed they are willing to sacrifice what is the world's largest protected area. And this government, by presenting this bill, is supporting this avarice.
This Bill must be defeated. This government is not about the people but about making a few wealthy people even richer. Protect our Greenbelt and stop this foolhardy and callous bill in its tracks.

On the matter of the green belt:
I share with just about every citizen of the  province who is not a land developer or a would-be land developer, the need to control and protect this amazing resource.  Once it falls to development it will never come back and if local municipalities open some currently protected land for development it will put incredible pressure on the rest of the land.  I am very disappointed in the new government for even proposing this.  The reaction of government officials interviewed on the local television was an insult to every thinking Ontarian.  Their reaction demonstrated that they did not support this proposal while doing their duty as team players. Please remove this misguided proposal from the bill.  I suspect that many Ontarians will not forgive the government for allowing municipalities to open up greenbelt land to development.

17246,/comment/17246,"I am writing this review with great concern about a number of proposed revisions to the following:
1) Schedule 5: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks
Repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 by 2021, remove the toxics reduction plan in 2019 and rely on the robust and science-based Federal Chemicals Management Plan
See ""Repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 and all associated regulations by December 31, 2021"" (ERO # 013-4234) and
See ""Planning and reporting changes under the toxics reduction program and Ontario Regulation 455/09"" (ERO # 013-4235)
In the last few decades, we have seen a substantial rise in chronic and terminal illnesses caused by overload of toxic substances in our environment. From increasing number of food and environmental sensitives/allergies to chronic illnesses like lupus to cancer. The increase has been alarming. Witness to this are many new food and medical industries that have emerge into the mainstream acceptance. It would be highly irresponsible to remove or even lessen the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009.
=================================================================================
What is needed is to broaden the reach which regulations that are enforced, include substances that are still widely used and considered safe despite scientific indication of their harmful effects on human health, suspend use of substances that have not been 100% proved to have NO harmful effect on human, animal, insect and plant life until proven safe. Current system puts greater value on business profitability then on well-being of people and this plant.  THIS NEEDS TO END NOW!
==================================================================================
2) Schedule 10: Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing
Introduce a new economic development tool and remove planning barriers to expedite major business investments and speed up approvals by about two years.
This portion is conveniently vague with no details available online, so I am going to go on with the flavor of ""remove planning barriers to expedite major business investments "".  This is an instant red flag as it makes no reference to well-being and health of population, which all governmental organizations should have as a top priority as they are paid and mandated as ""public service"". The planning barriers could constitute anything from environmental assessments to protection of lands and water. The vagueness of this statement is making this proposal dangerous and largely unconstitutional as it is open to individual interpretation and manipulation by businesses for the sole gain of profit at the expense of common good.

I want to re-iterate here: GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC not a materialistic gain of corporations.

Removing the toxic substance reduction legislation is inappropriate without replacing necessary parts to do with monitoring and reporting; even if amounts are not reduced, there are other parts of the legislation that need to be retained - and we _should_ be working towards reducing use of, and emissions of, toxic substances where we can. For one thing, a less healthy environment will mean an increased burden on the health system, in ways that are very costly to treat.

These natural areas offer significant environmental benefits. The Greenbelt alone saves the province $2.6 billion a year in essential services such as providing fresh drinking water and clean air. The proposed bill also undermines the Clean Water Act less than 20 years after the Walkerton disaster, putting both the health of Ontario residents and the ecological health of our Great Lakes at risk.

17302,/comment/17302,"I believe that the Bill 66 legislation has several negative provisions and as such is ill-considered.
The proposed amendments to the Planning Act undermine a fundamental reason for its existence - protecting the environment. And part of environmental protection in Ontario is the Greenbelt. If the desire is to speed-up development, a much more thoughtful approach to overall planning and Greenbelt protection is required. What is proposed will require future governments to do what they can to repair damage already done, damage that will in many cases be irreparable. Jobs are important. However, with nearly full employment now, alongside decent environmental protection measures, there is no justification for changes proposed in Bill 66 that impose huge costs on future generations.
The same can be said for the proposed changes to the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act. The changes to the Clean Water Act for example, are likely to present the present government with a repeat of the tragic Walkerton situation.
My remark about current high rates of employment also call into question the need for proposed roll-backs of protections of workers in Employment Standards. They are not balanced since they give employers the upper hand.

Allowing contractors to build in the Greenbelt will cause repercussions on the volume and quality of drinking water it provides thus apparently disregarding the Clean Water Act. In addition, this has mass potential to negatively affect farmlands in the area and the goods they are able to produce which has impact on both the economy and the health of those relying on what they are able to produce. Aside from this, Ontario boasts it's natural parks and greenery and the Greenbelt, and other areas that this bill threatens, contribute to the tourism industry and residents' quality of life, as it is important to have green spaces which scientifically prove to be beneficial to both mental and physical health.
In addition to considering the well being of the people, it is equally important to do the same with the wildlife. It is more important than ever to consider the environmental impact on our environment as deforestation at alarming rates is causing the deaths and endangerment of thousands of fauna. Lastly, the clearing of forests also affects the air quality, increasing the amount of co2, a heat-trapping gas, in the air, which contributes to the greenhouse effect causing global warming - an issue that needs to be taken far more seriously.

Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened.

Bill 66 would allow the Province to override the Region of Waterloo’s Official Plan policies that were established to prevent similar toxic destruction of our drinking water. Limiting sprawl is of particular importance in Waterloo Region, where 75% of drinking water comes from aquifers located just beyond the Countryside Line.
Today, more than half of the Region's growth comes from building in existing urban areas. This investment in our urban centres means we can keep growing while preserving the rural communities and farms that make Waterloo Region unique.
Planning exemptions granted under Bill 66 would not require notification or consultation with residents. These proposed changes fly in the face of good governance.
I reject Bill 66’s implicit suggestion that to grow the economy and add jobs we must accept environmental degradation, pave over farms, and risk the health of our families.

17327,/comment/17327,"I see no reason for the proposed legislation as the Province currently has sufficient powers under a Ministers Zoning Order to do just this.  This is the PC's idea that the planning system fails in Ontario when it doesn't.  The system is failing because employment providers aren't willing to take a financial cut and do the right thing.   I work as a land use planner and I can tell you that this is a non issue and that if developers are complaining about the length of time or the cost then they have not done their own appropriate business case and plan to make this happen.  They are more concerned with padding their own pockets than ensuring Ontario is prosperous.  I can tell you its the same case for affordable house.  I've been in the room with many developers when it comes to building affordable housing or building a new industry and the planning process isn't the impediment. Its the cost of construction, the value of the land, the challenges in finding employment or freeing up their own business capital at the right time.  Go back to the drawing board on this one. I would never recommend to my Council that they pass this by-law and I can almost guarantee that no local Council wants to circumvent the entrenched planning process to land a employment opportunity, if they hope they will ever get re-elected.  Its a waste of ministry resources and the government time. Here's an idea, why doesn't the government fund more staff in order to get applications through.  I can almost bet that its the workload of municipal employees that takes the time as the Province regardless of which party in powers feels its important to be constantly changing the rules.   We can't keep up with the burden of change that the Provincial government is doing.  Let us do our jobs without the distraction of whatever new ""great idea"" inexperienced and uniformed politicians think will work.   The system works... let it!
PS.  I could have been doing actual planning work on private developers files if the PC's hadn't continuously changed the rules and regulations.  I was too busy trying to make a recommendation to my Council on the new retail cannabis rules only to have them change again in mid December. This is my example of what  the Province needs to end this and let us get back to doing business!

Good decision making and consultation takes time. Bill 66 is dangerous and doesn’t look ahead for future generations. It doesn’t support democracy.  It doesn’t support sustainability or smart economic growth.  It is a tool for corporations to bully their way into communities without ensuring public safety, assessing the environmental impact or social impacts.  Job creation doesn’t have to be pitted against the people and environment.  This tool does just that. The province has a responsibility to act on behalf of the people not corporations and lobbyists.  Rushing through giving unweilding power to the munipalities to support corporations and ‘business’ prevents various stake holders from having a voice and does not represent the people of Ontario.  No Ontarian  I know wants to see a bulldozer in the green belt, wetlands or old growth forests.  I don’t know anyone who would approve of a new factory on a river without public consultation and wanting a lot of assurances that it will comply with strict environmental regulations.  There are lots of examples of past mistakes to guide us into the future and many examples of the importance of talking time consulting with environmental organizations and the public.  We need to continue to have democratic process.  Tools for blindsiding the public are a disgrace.  No to Bill 66 and the ‘open for business’ planning tool!

17331,/comment/17331,"I have several concerns with Bill 66.
First, the possibility of provincial intervention to advance development proposals in previously protected areas, including the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, within Source Water Protection Areas, and within the Lake Simcoe Watershed is concerning.  These areas are protected because they are of prime importance to drinking water recharge, for farmland, wildlife corridors, and ultimately the health and well being of Ontario's citizens.
Protecting groundwater is especially important because contamination is very difficult to remediate. In my undergraduate degree in Environmental Engineering in Nova Scotia I learned about the leaching of toxic chemicals from the Uniroyal Chemical site in Elmira into the local groundwater table.  I have also worked on other contaminated sites and understand the importance of strong protections to prevent pollutants from entering our drinking water.
I am also concerned that planning exemptions granted under Bill 66 would not require notification or consultation with residents.
Agriculture is important to Ontario's economy, and I am concerned that this bill will reduce the ability of farmers to produce local, healthy food profitibly.  For example, Mark Reusser of the Waterloo Federation of Agriculture indicates that “The agricultural sector contributes over a half billion dollars to our local economy every year”   Farmland is a finite resource - soil that is taken out of agricultural use can't be returned to agriculture.  Protection of farmland from development is important for our economy and food security.
I believe that the economy can grow the economy good jobs can be developed while still protecting our drinking water, allowing space for farms, and setting aside protected lands.  Smart growth with building in existing urban areas can allow our regions to grow while allowing rural communities and farms to also thrive.

This by-pass of the carefully thought out and developed rules and regulations of an Official Plan does not respect the community that the Official Plan serves.  The public have a right to know what is proposed and to voice their concerns if any about the proposed development.  It is prudent that the Ontario government show concern for the environmental impact of any initiative. We must preserve our environment for the future!

17335,/comment/17335,"Increasing the number of children allowed to be cared for by day care providers can only lead to further injuries and deaths among young children; something which has been an issue even recently.
Repealing the toxic substances act would allow dangerous chemicals to pose further hazards to Ontarian, increase pollution, which is a definite concern in our present age and will be a huge consideration in the future as well.
Repealing the TSSA Act, which protects consumers from allowing toxic substances into their homes without their knowledge or consent, is immoral and does not give any consideration to the consumer, since it would open the door for companies to manufacture toys and household items using toxic substances without having to label them.
Repealing the wireless services act which protects consumers regarding transactions for services, disclosing information accurately to customers and advertising including all inclusive costs at fixed terms, would again, harm the consumer and allow companies to exploit the consumer. Getting rid of this would cause many people to enter into agreements with wireless companies which the would otherwise not agree to simply because they do not understand the terms of service. Such a circumstance could not be viewed as the fault of the consumer in this instance, since the provisions which cause wireless companies to spell out their terms in plain English, free of loopholes would be taken away.
Again, opening up the Greenbelt for development takes away the protection of our environment which is necessary for the lives of ourselves, our future generations and all of the wildlife living within it. Ontario has become overrun with development in the last decades and there are very few measures left in place to protect what little we have left. Developing this area would once again be protecting companies and not citizens and exploiting the interests of people and the environment for consumerism and profit alone.
Amending the employment standards act so that employers no longer have to post information about the employment standards act would also cause problems Newcomers to the workforce and immigrants are not always immediately  aware of the laws and rights they have as workers. This opens up employers ability to take advantage of people once again. The other changes proposed within this bill would further take advantage of the rights of workers since it proposes to:
change the way they average the over time pay to benefit the employer
get rid of trade unions for city workers in construction industry, benefiting the employer
allow building on unstable land, contaminated, sensitive water areas, areas with protected drinking water, marshy land, etc, would be terrible for the environment and just seems like a bad idea over all.
building within protected land and significant archaeological sights would exploit the environment and historical sites for profit.
Repealing the Pawnbrokers Act would lead to many problems for the consumer and opens up the ability for businesses to take advantage of consumers.
I hope that serious consideration will be taken before the proposed changes will be made and sincerely hope that Bill 66 does not get passed. I see little to no benefit for the well being of people or the environment here. The citizens of Ontario and the environment which we live in and have a responsibility to protect, should far outweigh the concerns or benefits of corporations.

17338,/comment/17338,"I am deeply concerned about several aspects of this bill.
Firstly, repealing the requirement that employers are required  to post posters about the Employment Standards Act in their workplaces is petty. It should remain the obligation of employers to inform their employees about their rights under the Employment Standards Act, and to make sure those employees remain aware of these rights. ""Providing a poster"" when an employee first joins an organization is an excellent way to ensure that employees stay ignorant of their rights, since these posters will be forgotten in the deluge of new information an employee receives.
Secondly, repealing the Pawnbroker's Act seems bizarre, especially since there appear to be no replacement rules for pawnbrokers. I do not what is motivating this change, but I think the intent of the 2018 amendments to ensure that pawnshops report usage to the police is sound. What rules will govern pawnshops now.
The changes in Schedule 10 have received the most press, and I share these concerns. This bill purports to ""cut unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date"", but it is not clear to me that the Oak Ridge Moraine Act, the Clean Water Act, the Places to Grow Act or the Greenbelt Act are unnecessary, inefficient or out of date. They may be inflexible, but that is by design -- the more flexibility they have the greater the chance that powerful interests will pressure municipalities to bend the rules.
This section of the bill is a disaster. It is a cowardly move to allow development in supposedly-protected areas (something the current government promised it would not allow) via a back door, because the government is too cowardly to repeal the legislation outright.
There have been two recent news events that make this even more worrisome. Developers have a lot of power in this province, and without strong legislation to curtail that power they will have their way with municipalities. First, there is the story of how the former mayor of Caledon was bullied and pressured by a developer, as reported here: https://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/papa-pump-and-the-small-town-sha… . What protections will there be to ensure that municipalities are not coerced by developers into bypassing legislation? Even putting aside the overtly illegal actions documented in the episode, there was enough borderline-legal pressure to make me worried that municipalities that would prefer to resist development will not be able to do so.
Secondly, it has come out that political pressure group ""Ontario Proud"" (which took a strong pro-OPC stance during the election) was funded largely by developers: https://www.canadalandshow.com/ontario-proud-mostly-funded-by-developer… . The Ontario government should be passing legislation in the best interests of Ontarians, not in the best interests of those groups who help get the current government elected. It is not fair play to bring this up, but it is a reality of the political environment in which we live.

17340,/comment/17340,"As a citizen of Ontario I have a few deep concerns with the amendments that are being made in this bill. It doesn't seem to take into account the safety and security of the citizens of our province but make it so that business' can turn a quick profit while allowing them to take advantage of municipalities and citizens all the same. Especially troubling are the unspoken long term effects of the decisions that are being made and their potential impact to future generations, as well as the impacts on the environment which this government has made clear it has no regard for.
Schedule 2 will allow the rise of individuals to go forth for personal gain and allow those who typically use the services of pawnbrokers to be taken advantage of allowing further negative financial implications to some of the lowest paid workers in Ontario. This is not good business to allow what should be basic consumer protections to fall by the wayside so easily.
Schedule 3 is deeply concerning due to the understanding as an involved parent that there is a lot of work, patience, and vigilance that goes into ensuring the safety and security of those who are the most vulnerable. Increasing the number of children that ECE providers would be allowed to watch would at best have a marginally positive impact on the average individual in allowing greater access to childcare, which is at the detriment of safety of the children who are being cared for. We have rules in schools for this reason and it has been proven over and over again that increasing the number of children that a single individual can watch has negative psychological implications for the child due to the need to personalised support in early development.
Schedule 5 is not only scary but deeply immoral, as an elected government it should be the duty of each and every individual to protect the citizens health, well being and safety. It is already understood that implications of using toxic substances around protected water/sources of groundwater for human consumption??? the individual who is responsible for wavering these protections should be held liable for any and all negative impacts for the indefinite future. To commit to repealing these rules while ensuring that citizens are uninformed prior to decisions being made that have enormous environmental and health implications is wrong, the future of our province is our people not our profits.
Schedule 7 is baffling considering that we are going to allow stuffed and upholstered articles that are going to be unregulated. Wavering basic protections that make the products that we might give to our infants and children who had a propensity to put things in their mouths safe, I simply cannot understand. Additionally all products should be held to a standard that offers protections to all citizens ensuring that regardless of what it is, it is safe to handle. The repealing of the wireless services agreement would mark a very sad day in the history of consumer protections considering that a good majority of the concessions that are in this agreement are meant to protect consumers of all ages (especially those of the older generations who may not understand technology), by requiring that providers provide and enter agreements only upon the condition that said agreements are fair and easily understood by the consumer. The idea of favouring corporations over citizens is something that I don't understand considering we are in a democratic society and your government was elected by the people
Schedule 9 is something that should never be followed through with considering that the concessions that are being made are ONLY hurting the employees that you are hoping that these business' will utilise. Taking away what should be basic rights of the worker is immoral and has shown historically as being detrimental to overall operations, ""you can't build a building without a good foundation"" and employees are that foundation. Taking away information that should be easily accessible to all employees will be to the detriment to a vast majority of new employees and employees who are new to the country alike. All protections should be afforded to everyone regardless of your understanding of the rules, and given that we as humans naturally take advantage of one another for personal gain. Not allowing unionisation of certain employees will open doors to allow less skilled individuals who may not be updated on the rules/safety standards that are required to work in a specific profession, allowing anyone who may claim to be able to take on said profession this might be led to be paid for by human lives. Stripping current employees of their current protections is in itself immoral considering that those who have jobs are the ones who have money to spend and drive the consumer economy which is at an all time low. Protect the workers not the companies!
Schedule 10 is truly saddening. The protections that are in place in regards to building regulations and the bylaws within should not be able to be wavered by municipalities. Given the long term impact that these decisions could have on future populations, the environment, the flora and fauna that we have forced to work so hard to live along side the human activities that have progressively take away the natural environments that they once thrived in. It can be understood that this is an attempt at making it easier for business' to conduct business by allowing them to build in sensitive areas but this is a rash decision and it doesn't seem like this was done with any consultation considering the promise that our premier (who I might add went back on his original policy of protecting the greenbelt) made to Ontarians upon his run up to his election. Opening up all the land across this vast and beautiful province is incredibly dangerous, and damaging to the fragile ecosystems that are within it.
This bill shows all Ontarians loudly and clearly that this government is for the corporations and not ""for the people"" as they would have us believe. The amendments that are being made in this bill will possibly increase profitability for a few corporations but it has been already shown that giving concessions to companies simply allows profits to be higher and does not ensure the benefit to any single citizen who does not call themselves an executive. The amendments are not only incredibly damaging to the environment, but can lead to and most likely will be paid in human lives. The people of Ontario are not merely pawns in a game who's propose is to ensure that business' can continue to take advantage of citizens/the environment without accountability. If this bill is passed it would be a step backwards in this political system that we call a democracy (I won't open that can of worms). We are a democratic society and it is time that our government started actually listening to the people who's taxes keep the wheels spinning. If this government took the time to speak to average Ontarians (not only those who are in the upper echelons and can afford to buy their way out of trouble) about the amendments being made by this bill I'm certain that few would agree fully that this is a good thing. This government should do the right thing ""for the people"" and not pass this bill and instead research into the full impact of the amendments made within. A strong building starts with a strong foundation and Ontario's foundation are it's people.

To Michael Helfinger
Senior Policy Advisor
Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade
Dear Mr. Helfinger,
We are writing to express our strenuous opposition to Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, and most specifically Schedule 10. Many other sections of this proposed Act give enough cause for concern that we believe the entire Bill should be scrapped.
Schedule 10 is a direct assault on the ever-diminishing natural world that gives us life. It undermines the work of so many Ontarians and successive governments to protect our water, our green spaces, our farm land, our wildlife and, in the end, our quality of life... indeed, the things that bring business investment and skilled workers to Ontario in the first place.
Schedule 10 would allow municipalities, with the permission of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, to proceed with developments that otherwise would contravene some of the most important environmental protection laws we have in Ontario, including:
Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, 2006.
Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015.
Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act, 2005.
Section 6 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008.
Section 7 of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001.
Section 13 of the Ontario Planning and Development Act, 1994.
Subsection 14 (1) of the Places to Grow Act, 2005.
Section 12 of the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016.
Making matters worse, the proposed legislation specifies that no notice or hearing is required prior to the passing of an open-for-business planning by-law. This is undemocratic and underhanded, and not in keeping with the Ontario we know and love, and the Ontario our ancestors fought for.
We cannot let untrammeled development in the pursuit of profit destroy the very systems that provide for life. It is illogical. And we are not anti-development or anti-business. Development and business can adapt. Development and business can build up on brownfield sites, for example; many Ontario towns and cities would love to have more development in their inner cores. Why not create policies, including transit and inter-city transportation, to support that?
For the sake of ourselves and future generations, please revoke Bill 66 and start again with new policies where they make sense.

17353,/comment/17353,"Dear Mr. Helfinger,
I want to express my concern with various parts of the proposed Bill 66. To begin, I want to express that I find in concerning that so many important proposed changes are included in this big Bill, making it more difficult for the Ontario public to be well informed about what changes are being proposed.
While the current government has stated that the purpose of this Bill is to reduce “red tape” and eliminate “unnecessary costs for businesses”, I am concerned at what cost the government wants to help business put profits over the wellbeing of Ontario citizens.
I do not consider regulations that prevent pollution, reduce the use and creation of toxic substances, require monitoring and annual reporting of toxic substances, and informing Ontarians about toxic substances to be “unnecessary red tape”. We know that business will try to eliminate costs and will pollute as much as they are allowed to. Strong regulations that protect our environment, keeping our air and water free from contamination and toxic substances are essential, not “unnecessary red tape”.
In addition, I am concerned about other rollbacks of environment protections in this Bill. Letting businesses ignore rules outlined in the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act, as well as opening up the Greenbelt for development, poses a threat to our land, water, and air.
Safe water is critical to public health. 80% of Ontarians get our drinking water from the Great Lakes. Bill 66 threatens the health of the Great Lakes by opening them up to greater development.
The Greenbelt protects Ontario farmland, forests, and nature. It provides habitat for wildlife and productive farmland that supports rural jobs, and a strong agricultural business sector. Ontarians do not want the Greenbelt open for development.
The Ontario government under Ford promised to protect the Greenbelt. The recently released “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan also makes commitments that would be impossible if Bill 66 becomes law.
I am sure that the Ontario government can find a way to support healthy and sustainable businesses, without it being at the expense of our drinking water, our clean air, or our protected nature areas.
Please advise the Ministers responsible that the people of Ontario are concerned, and that everyone, including business owners and Conservative voters, need clean water and air. We need a government that will protect these essentials for everyone’s health and wellbeing!

I am concerned with the section of Bill 66 that allows Municipalities to forgo zoning restrictions.  My main concern is what restrictions, if any, are in place to prevent Urban and Industrial Sprawl into the Greenbelt.
I believe this is an important issue for a lot of Ontarian's living in southern Ontario as the Greenbelt allows for farmland protection; giving Toronto and GTA communities access to locally sourced products, as well as benefiting small business owners and family farms in the agricultural industry.  It allows protection to our forests; the Greenbelt is a massive carbon sink and provides Toronto and the GTA with clean air, which reduces healthcare expenses.  It allows protection for wetlands; which is a sustainable and cost efficient water filtration system to provide Ontarian's access to clean water, as well as flood protection for families and businesses.
There are numerous environmental and economic benefits to protecting the Greenbelt.  All Ontarian's will benefit from the Greenbelt, whereas only developers will profit from the development of these areas.
What steps has the Ontario Government taken to ensure the protection of the Greenbelt?
Thank you.

Additionally, any further reduction in our environment's capacity to absorb extreme rainfall would be a liability not an investment, as recent flooding events have shown.  I must register opposition to any aspects of the Bill that could weaken the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Reductions Act, the Greenbelt Act, or the Great Lakes Protection Act.

17357,/comment/17357,"Re: Section 5 : Wow the Toxics Reduction Act is confusing. The concept is good and I agree with the goals of reducing toxins to the environment. The province should create incentives for industry to reduce toxins for greener technology and provide CLEAR guidance on what is expected by industry. It would benefit us to know an inventory of toxins and byproducts that are created, recycled, destroyed, released, disposed, transferred off site or contained in a product. Labeling of toxins in a product should be mandatory. The destruction and disposal of PCB's seemed to work and may be a good example for those toxins that the government wants to phase out completely.
Re: Section 10: I believe that it is important to create good jobs in Ontario and would encourage all governments to seek healthy means to build our economy. I agree statutes should be streamlined and harmonized to simplify legislation. However, I do not believe that the Ontario government under Bill 66, Section 10, has adequately considered action which will protect the health of its citizens and the environment while attracting new jobs and investment to Ontario communities. What can be more important to the public interest than clean air, safe drinking water, healthy food and a stable climate? The environment and the economy must be given equal consideration to truly ensure a healthy community. Last time the Conservative government was “open for business” Ontario communities were put at serious health risks as evidenced by the Walkerton tragedy. Let’s not repeat that kind of scenario under your government's ""open for business"" legislation. Economic investment in our province is a priority, but not at the expense of the environment and health of its citizens.
I would appreciate if you could provide me a response to explain how Bill 66 S.10 will attract new economic investment in Ontario, regain our competitive advantage and strengthen enforcement action to protect our lakes, waterways and groundwater from pollution.
What is the real purpose of Bill 66 S. 10? It seems to be death of the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt by 1000 cuts.
Bill 66 S. 10 exempts large-scale development from a number of Acts meant to protect the environment and health of Ontarians. These are the concerns I have if this Bill is adopted. I have identified the piece of legislation affected at the beginning of each bullet point:
•	As you must know, under Bill 66 S. 10, a municipality may pass an open-for-business planning bylaw only if it has received approval to do so in writing by the Minister and if criteria as may be prescribed are satisfied. This seems like a piecemeal approach to large scale economic developments vs. a clear standardized approach for all. How will a level playing field be assured for competitiveness under this haphazard approach? I think municipalities will be pitted against each other and level playing fields will be ""out the door"" with potential backroom deals. Companies in one municipality will potentially have an unfair advantage over a company in another municipality.
•	Planning Act: Through Official Plans and careful consideration, municipalities have already identified employment lands that may be developed. For example, currently Simcoe County’s development land has increased from 2341 hectares in 2010 to 2918 hectares. What is the purpose of allowing development outside of these areas?
•	Planning Act: Bill 66 S.10 removes requirements for public notice, hearings, and appeals process as well as other planning requirements including but not limited to density, storm water management, natural heritage and water features protection, natural or man-made hazards, active transportation and elimination of the “holding” requirement. By allowing this, community interests are being ignored, timing for development is not considered to accommodate infrastructure and local municipal benefits cannot be acquired to offset non-compliance with height or density developments. By removing the required municipal and public consultation outlined by the Planning Act, feedback on developments by local experts is being terminated and effectively eliminates third party review. Public consultation provides the government with forward thinking strategies of complex issues such as the Parkway Belt West Plan created 1978 which designates and protects “land needed for linear regional infrastructure such as transit, utility and electric power facility corridors.”( Parkway Belt West Plan) Why is your government denying an appeals process for those with legitimate complaints and eliminating public consultation?
•	Clean Water Act: By getting rid of “red tape” that allows large-scale economic development in source protection areas you are threatening our surface and groundwater resources which could negatively impact drinking water and aquatic organisms. The Clean Drinking Water Act was a result of the previous Conservative government’s cuts to government staff to accommodate the “open-for-business” approach. This led to Canada’ s worst-ever outbreak of E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni bacteria contamination, sickening more than 2,000 people and resulting in 7 deaths . Abandoned wells continue to be a potential source of contaminants to ground water. Protecting drinking water sources and aquatic biodiversity needs to be a collaborative effort between provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities and the public. Clean drinking water should be a priority for all governments. What is your government doing to protect Ontario’s water resources and what steps are you taking to prevent risks to our drinking water?
•	The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan (LSPP) is a watershed based plan where, according to their website “the well-being of diverse life forms – fish, wildlife, plants and human beings are enhanced” and “where we protect our natural environment for future generations.” By adopting open for business policies long term environmental issues including the immediate threat of excessive phosphorus and emerging threats of invasive species, road salts, and climate change will be overlooked. This plan has improved Lake Simcoe water quality over time. Why is your government putting our water resources at risk?
•	The Greenbelt Plan: If this Bill is approved you will put at risk 2 million acres of farmland and natural areas including specialty crops in the Niagara Region and the Holland Marsh. Under our changing climate, food resources may be put at risk. Why is your government threatening the small amount of arable land Ontario has?As Christine Elliott has pointed out (Dec 18, 2018) in disapproval, ""For the past 15 years, the Liberal government has carved into the Greenbelt over 17 times.."" I hope your government will not allow further carving of the greenbelt.
•	The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act: The moraine supplies drinking water for over 200,000 residents, feeds into 65 river systems, cleans the air, keeps natural habitats intact, supports species at risk, fights climate change, and provides an opportunity for people to get closer to nature. ORM protections reduce contaminants entering critical groundwater sources, maintain forests which control flooding as well as erosion and also preserve agricultural lands providing local foods. By overlooking the protections provided by this Act, the government overlooks the vital role the moraine plays on the health of the communities that rely on it. Again, why is your government intent on threatening the environment and health and well-being of Ontario citizens? The previous Conservative government made serious mistakes by not adequately reviewing the programs it was slashing. Please consider the ramifications of your actions.
I hope your government will review and consider the commitments identified under the original Places to Grow Act 2005 preamble:
“The Government of Ontario recognizes that in order to accommodate future population growth, support economic prosperity and achieve a high quality of life for all Ontarians, planning must occur in a rational and strategic way.
The Government of Ontario recognizes that building complete and strong communities, making efficient use of existing infrastructure and preserving natural and agricultural resources will contribute to maximizing the benefits, and minimizing the costs, of growth.
The Government of Ontario recognizes that identifying where and how growth should occur will support improved global competitiveness, sustain the natural environment and provide clarity for the purpose of determining priority of infrastructure investments.
The Government of Ontario recognizes that an integrated and co-ordinated approach to making decisions about growth across all levels of government will contribute to maximizing the value of public investments.”
These values need to be strengthened with clear guidance for developers as opposed to eliminating statutes which protect the environment and health and safety of its citizens. We are at a tipping point in the evolution of our planet. No longer is dilution the solution to pollution. CO2 is at the highest level it's been for over 10,000 years, global temperatures are at a record high, pharmaceuticals such as beta blockers, estrogen and antipsychotics are in our lakes and rivers and we are eating pesticides and herbicides in our food supply. The decisions we make today will have significant impact on our children. I hope you have their best interests at heart.

1. The historical record clearly illustrates the destructive consequences of undermining Ontario’s environmental protections.  In 2000, the retrograde policies of Mike Harris’s Conservative government resulted in the Walkerton tragedy.   Six individuals died, more than 2,000 were sickened, and others were left with permanent disabilities.  Do not put the public health of Ontarians at risk with the proposed Bill 66.
2.  The proposed Bill 66 is a stealthy attempt to subvert Ontario’s greenbelt protections.  The Ontario public fully supports the current preservation of the greenbelt.  Doug Ford previously felt the lash of the public’s anger at his promise to open up these lands for development.  I advise Doug Ford and his Conservative government to cease fighting the will of the Ontario people and to stop pandering to the insatiable greed of the development industry and corporate Ontario.  Environmental protection and public health must always take precedence over crass business interests.
3.  Bill 66 would encourage the environmental degradation of Ontario’s waterways and the Great Lakes. There must be no diminishment of current defenses to protect the ecology of these natural treasures from toxins, pollutants and other dangerous chemicals harmful to humans and wildlife.
I recommend that Bill 66 be dropped from the Conservative government’s agenda and that current environmental regulations be maintained or even strengthened.

17387,/comment/17387,"RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
We, the Ingersoll District Nature Club, in Oxford County, strongly oppose several aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. We disagree with the Government of Ontario’s contention that Bill 66 cuts “unnecessary” and “out of date” regulations (ERO posting 013-4293). This is patently not true in the case of Schedule 10 which introduces “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical requirements under several laws that are designed to protect water, natural heritage and human health and well-being and to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in land-use decisions.
We outline our concerns below and trust that they will be considered with respect to all three relevant ERO postings (i.e., 013-4293, 013-4125, 013-4239).
Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent fundamental protections for environmental and human health:
The Government of Ontario claims that Bill 66 will “make Ontario more competitive by cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date” (ERO 013-4293). To this end it intends to allow municipalities to pass open-for-business by-laws so that they can permit land-uses “without having to strictly adhere to existing local requirements (e.g., official plan and zoning)” (ERO 013-4125). Both government statements are misleading. The laws, plans and policies that will be sidestepped through open-for-business by-laws are neither unnecessary nor out of date. Nor are they simply “local requirements.” As outlined below, Open-for-business by-laws would override requirements to be consistent with many of Ontario’s key planning laws and policies recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation.
Key requirements that will be overridden in seven of the ten laws listed in Schedule 10:
Planning Act, Subsection 3 (5)	This section requires the decisions of municipalities and others (boards, ministers, government agencies) to be consistent with policy statements and provincial plans. This includes Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) requirements regarding natural heritage protection, water features protection, active transportation, climate resiliency etc.
Planning Act, Section 24	This section requires public works and by-laws to be consistent with municipal official plans.	Municipal official plans are to be reviewed at least every five years, with community consultation.
Planning Act, Subsections 34 (10.0.0.1) to (34)	These subsections set out requirements for public engagement in order to amend a zoning by-law, including public notice, public consultation and opportunities for appeal.
Clean Water Act, 2006, Section 39  	This section requires land-use planning decisions (municipal, provincial and others) to conform to the significant threat policies and Great Lakes policies adopted in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water. It also requires public works, municipal by-laws and provincial approvals to be consistent with the significant threat policies. 	Since the law came into effect in 2007, communities across Ontario have been developing source protection plans, with public input required.
Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, Section 20	This section requires planning decisions to conform with designated policies in “geographically focused initiatives,” a tool that allows communities to solve complex problems to protect or restore the ecological health of the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River basin.	The law was passed in October 2015.
Greenbelt Act, 2005, section 7	This section requires that planning decisions conform to the Greenbelt Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the Greenbelt Plan.	The Greenbelt Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Section 6	This section requires that planning decisions conform with designated policies of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan. It requires that in cases where policies in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan conflict with other provincial plans or policies, that which provides the greatest level of protection for the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed will prevail.	The law was passed in 2008.
Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, section 7 - This section requires that planning decisions conform with the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the plan.	The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Places to Grow Act, 2005, Subsection 14 (1)	This section requires that planning decisions comply with the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario.	The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
The potential negative impact of open-for-business by-laws is far-reaching and profound. In each case they would override key operative provisions in the laws listed in Schedule 10, undermining fair and consistent application of laws and policies designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage, farmland and watershed health across Ontario, and leaving communities open to unchecked development. For example, policies that would not apply in open-for-business by-law areas include:
•	Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems);
•	Those protecting provincially significant wetlands, woodlands and valley lands and habitat of species at risk;
•	Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency;
•	Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
•	Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
•	Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed;
•	Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water.
Open-for-business by-laws would eliminate opportunities for public input on planning decisions.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, open-for-business by-laws would bypass legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act) designed to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land-use decisions in our communities. Open-for-business by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
Further, Bill 66 would allow Cabinet (not the Legislature) to add other legal provisions to the list of those in Schedule 10 to be circumvented by open-for-business by-laws, an approach which limits opportunities for transparent public consideration and debate.
Finally, we question whether there is demand from municipalities for open-for-business by-laws, ostensibly proposed by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 at Queen’s Park many municipalities indicated that they have a surplus of employment lands and would like to see these repurposed for residential. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal leaders (e.g., in Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about open-for-business by-laws and the circumvention of laws that protect drinking water, farmlands and natural areas and ensure public input and transparency in decision-making.
Concluding remarks:
From Kenora to Toronto and Ottawa to Windsor, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. Open-for-business by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely. Bill 66 would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment and the health of our communities. Ontarians do not want another disaster like Walkerton, when over 2,000 people fell ill and seven died as a result of a failure to safeguard the local water system. Environmental deregulation, budget cuts and staffing reductions were all identified as major contributing factors in that tragedy.
We urge the government to avoid similar mistakes and to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.

17388,/comment/17388,"Hold the Line, Smart Growth Waterloo Region, and the Waterloo Federation of Agriculture are calling on the councils of the Region of Waterloo and area municipalities to pass resolutions to reaffirm their commitment to smart growth and meaningful public consultations, and to reject the use of Bill 66.
The Province of Ontario’s proposed Bill 66 threatens Waterloo Region’s water quality and supply, agricultural and rural communities, natural ecosystems, and the continued smart growth of its urban cores. The bill would permit municipalities to allow business developments that don't follow laws that protect our water, agriculture, and community development plans.
While the government's bill claims to be an attempt to support business, it undermines one of Waterloo Region's main industries. “The agricultural sector contributes over a half billion dollars to our local economy every year,” said Mark Reusser of the Waterloo Federation of Agriculture. “If developers can bypass agricultural protections, as Bill 66 would allow, it threatens our economy and our food supply.”
“The truth is that smart growth is key to our region's prosperity,” added Kevin Thomason of Smart Growth Waterloo Region. “Since the Region of Waterloo adopted its smart growth approach in 2003, our unemployment rate has decreased from 5.9% to 5.1%, beating the national rate. More efficient use of infrastructure benefits everyone.”
All three organizations are especially alarmed that Bill 66 removes the requirement for public notice and public meetings with opportunity for community input, as well as the opportunity to appeal the decision.
“Our citizens expect communications and public meetings as well the having the ability to appeal bad decisions,” said Sam Nabi of Hold the Line. “But if Bill 66 becomes law, the only notice residents would receive of an impending development is when the first bulldozer arrives - with no opportunity for recourse or appeal. Our region keeps growing and we welcome that growth. But how and where this growth takes place must be a decision that we make intentionally and democratically together.”

As an Ontario resident I am worried that the proposed Bill will result in harm done to both our Province's natural environment and the health of our fellow Ontarians. I am also disturbed by the potential for Bill 66 to allow developers to literally bulldoze away Ontario's rich history spanning more than 10,000 years.
The proposed bill will allow for the development and degradation of environmentally sensitive and ecologically beneficial areas such as the Ontario Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine, in addition to numerous Source Water Protection Areas and formerly protected areas within the Lake Simcoe Watershed. These natural areas offer significant environmental benefits. The Greenbelt alone saves the province $2.6 billion a year in essential services such as providing fresh drinking water and clean air. The proposed bill also undermines the Clean Water Act less than 20 years after the Walkerton disaster, putting both the health of Ontario residents and the ecological health of our Great Lakes at risk.
Additionally, Bill 66 threatens our province's cultural heritage. Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years.

We don’t need to develop the Greenbelt in order to have places to build new factories and homes. Government data shows that there is more than enough land designated for development within existing cities and towns to accommodate the expected population growth until 2041. And building houses on farmland  in the Greenbelt doesn’t provide the affordable housing we need. Bill 66 also undermines the provincial housing consultation process underway by choosing to support  sprawl over creating affordable housing in our cities and suburbs where there is access to transit, shops and servicing.
Polls show that over 90 per cent of Ontario residents  love the Greenbelt. And it’s no wonder, its productive farmland supports rural jobs, a strong agricultural business sector and provide local fruits and vegetables and food security. Its forests soothe us after a stressful week and clean our air. Its soils filter our water and absorb carbon pollution. And trails and parks throughout the Greenbelt provide opportunities for hiking, bird watching and family outings. Bill 66 puts the future of the Greenbelt and our quality of life at risk.

17437,/comment/17437,"The consequences of this Bill could be devastating. Schedule 10 opens a back door to developing the Greenbelt, gutting hard-earned drinking water and environmental protections. It threatens drinking water and farmland across Ontario. It threatens species at risk and special habitats set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act. It overrides protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. It would override policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals by repealing the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in their operations.
No public consultation, notice or meetings are required under Bill 66. If a project is approved, there will be no appeal process allowed and no ability for recourse, no matter how flawed the original decision. Contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
Bill 66 is not acceptable. It threatens the health and safety of all Ontarians, while circumventing democratic processes designed to allow for public information and participation.

17438,/comment/17438,"Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers.
Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the archaeological assessments that are completed. Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.
Archaeology is significant in protecting and understanding Ontario's rich cultural history, particularly Indigenous cultural heritage. In 2019 and moving forward, engagement and inclusion of Indigenous communities is vital to creating a successful Province. Allowing municipalities to circumvent required archaeological assessments will destroy and directly impact Indigenous cultural heritage. This will negatively affect Indigenous relationships with developers, municipalities, and the Province, and in turn, will eventually end up stagnating future development.
Additionally, if Bill 66 is meant to restore Ontario's ""competitiveness"", allowing municipalities to circumvent these assessments will have a direct impact on working tax payers within the Province. Archaeologists are a hidden but surprisingly large workforce in Ontario, with many small and large consulting companies supporting environmental and archaeological assessments for development projects. Eliminating potential work for archaeologists and their respective companies will directly effect their ability to operate and this policy will wind up being the exact opposite of ""open-for-business"".

17443,/comment/17443,"Ontario Farmland Trust (OFT) is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to protect and preserve Ontario farmlands and associated agricultural, natural, and cultural features of the countryside. OFT achieves this through direct land securement, stewardship, policy research and education to benefit all Ontarians.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit feedback on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. OFT has played an active stakeholder role in the development of policies that support a prosperous, sustainable and permanent farm sector, including those contained in the Growth Plan, Greenbelt Plan, and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. In an effort to continue working with the Province to develop responsible planning policies that support the agri-food sector, OFT has detailed its concerns regarding Schedule 10 of the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018, in the following document.
Ontario’s agri-food sector is a major economic engine for the province. In terms of job creation and economic growth, a 2018 report confirmed that the agri-food sector contributes over $39 billion to Ontario’s GDP and employs more than 820,000 Ontarians in the supply chain [1]. This contribution is overwhelmingly significant in rural areas, where roughly 12% of the GDP and 10% of rural jobs are attributed to the farm sector [2]. Ontario is also positioned favourably to attract agricultural and manufacturing investment because it is a global leader in the agri-food industry and houses one of the largest agri-food hubs in North America. This, in turn, generates growth in employment and GDP.
OFT believes that, as currently written, the Open-for-Business Zoning By-law proposed within Schedule 10 of Bill 66 places the agri-food sector and its substantial economic benefits at an unacceptable level of risk. If adopted it will jeopardize the economic contributions of the agri-food sector and expose rural areas to greater economic vulnerability. As such, OFT recommends that Schedule 10 be removed from Bill 66. It is critical that all Acts that protect the permanency, health, productivity, and profitability of Ontario’s farmland and the agri-food sector are retained in full and without exception.
The following sections provide greater detail regarding Schedule 10’s threats to the farm sector and suggests alternative actions to improve the province’s business environment while attracting agri-food investment.
Threats to the Farm Sector
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 and the Open-for-Business Zoning By-law (OFB-ZBL) could open up for development farmland that is either currently protected (e.g. through the Greenbelt Plan) or is outside of projected municipal growth areas.
This negatively impacts the agricultural sector in a number of ways. Schedule 10 of Bill 66:
•	Threatens to pave over and permanently destroy productive farmland. Only 5% of the Canadian land base is prime agricultural land, the majority of which is in southern Ontario and contributes to the success of the Province’s agri-food sector. Ontario is already losing 175 acres of farmland every day, a rate that could increase under the proposed OFB-ZBL. The loss of this land to non-agricultural uses is irreversible and negatively impacts Ontario’s economy, food security, and agri-food investment potential.
•	Risks farmland fragmentation and the dismantling of the agricultural system. A successful agri-food sector relies on a healthy farm sector, which requires access to a contiguous agricultural land base with a system of supportive infrastructure, agricultural services, distributors, and processors. This requirement is recognized by, and is being addressed through, ongoing municipal-level processes to implement the Agricultural System for the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Development approvals outside of strategic growth areas that are delineated in Official Plans and in conformity with the Provincial Policy Statement, Growth Plan, Greenbelt Plan, etc. will fragment and destroy the systems required by the farm sector. As farmland and the agricultural system is fragmented by conflicting land uses, the viability of agricultural enterprises and the agri-food sector is reduced or eliminated.
•	Will dramatically inflate farmland prices as speculation and land banking increases and further reduce affordability for farmers. Sustaining large swaths of contiguous, affordable farmland is crucial because land ownership provides the long-term, land use certainty that is required for farmers to make investments in their property and business. This contributes to a stronger agri-food sector and more attractive investment environment.
•	Introduces conflicting land uses adjacent to land used for agricultural purposes. This disadvantages both producers and those on adjacent properties because of the nature of agricultural activity, which generates noise, odours, and dust, and involves the use of slow-moving farm machinery and hazardous materials. Ultimately, introducing incompatible land uses makes it more difficult for farmers to continue running financially sustainable farm businesses, can interrupt normal farm practices, and can create conflict with neighbors.
•	Re-introduces uncertainty around the permanent protection of land for agriculture and agribusiness. Uncertainty about the ongoing protection of land for agriculture discourages investment in agriculture and leads to a deterioration in the resource and the agricultural community associated with it. Given that the best agricultural land is largely located in areas experiencing growth pressures, this uncertainty and the resultant reluctance to invest in agribusiness, will weaken the agri-food sector. Furthermore, the lack of public consultation will result in farmers being unable to provide feedback, challenge decisions, and advocate for the ongoing viability of their business.
•	Increases the agricultural sector’s vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. Studies in Ontario indicate that the effects of climate change will be dramatically different across the province and that heat and water stress will likely have negative impacts on agricultural productivity [3,4]. The agricultural and natural lands threatened by the proposed OFB-ZBL help to offset these negative impacts by providing services including carbon storage and flood management. Re-introduced land use uncertainty would also reduce farmers’ incentive to invest in on-farm adaptive and mitigative technologies and practices.
Actions to Improve Ontario’s Business Environment
As currently proposed, the OFB-ZBL is unnecessary and does not appropriately solve the issues it seeks to address.
Numerous studies report that there is already enough employment land designated for growth out to 2031 and beyond, meaning the provisions within the OFB-ZBL meant to open up land previously unavailable for development are unnecessary. For example, a 2017 Neptis Report notes that 85% or 87,440 ha of Designated Greenfield Area in the Greater Golden Horseshoe is unbuilt [5], and a 2017 study from Simcoe County indicated that across its 16 municipalities, there were 1,514 ha of excess employment lands to accommodate anticipated growth out to 2031 [6]. These planning horizons can be extended well beyond 2031 when growth is managed through intensification [7].
Existing planning resources, including Official Plans, already allow municipalities to respond to employment opportunities on currently designated lands and direct growth in a strategic and appropriate manner. Municipal polices are developed based on substantive amounts of work supported by public consultation and should not be pre-empted by the OFB-ZBL.
The proposed OFB-ZBL disregards the importance and necessity of coordinated, comprehensive planning to maintain and protect the integrity of regional systems, including the agricultural system. Current provincial policies address strategic planning processes at a regional level and should not be bypassed or undermined under any condition.
While the OFT is opposed to the currently proposed Open-for-Business Zoning By-law we acknowledge that there are other actions that can be taken to improve the business environment in the province and attract investment in the agri-food sector, which include:
•	Coordinating the actions of provincial ministries so they work as a team to facilitate appropriate development
•	Adopting an online ‘single portal’ approach to planning applications, approvals, and communications between government agencies and applicants
•	Providing greater recognition and promotion of the agri-food sector as an economic engine in the province
•	Promoting job creation and investment opportunities that recognize and support agricultural business potential in rural areas. Farmland is rural employment land and employment in one sector should not place jobs at risk in another, which is the current reality of Schedule 10 given the risks it will create for agricultural viability.
•	Creating land-use certainty by using existing planning or policy tools to permanently protect critical sector resources including farmland and the agricultural system.
The OFT is eager to work with the provincial government to achieve this vision.
Thank you for this opportunity to share our recommendations and feedback on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. We believe that Ontario has an opportunity to position itself as a national and global leader in strategies that blend environmental/farmland protection and economic growth and is capable of setting an example of how economic prosperity need not be at the expense of the environment. We invite discussion and welcome any questions you might have regarding our submission. We look forward to working with you further.

17470,/comment/17470,"Friends of Muskoka (FOM) has serious concerns with two Schedules of proposed Bill 66 – Schedules 5 and 10 – which we believe will facilitate development that could cause irreparable damage to the environment that drives the economy in the District of Muskoka.
FOM is a not-for-profit corporation with approximately 4,000 supporters across the District of Muskoka, including year-round residents and seasonal residents. We are a volunteer organization, working to preserve and protect the natural environment and unique character of Muskoka by promoting responsible use and development of its land and lakes.
In Muskoka, the environment IS the economy since millions of people come to Muskoka and invest here because of its clean lakes, rivers, forests and natural character.  To emphasize the obvious, 90% of the District’s tax base is dependent on preserving Muskoka’s delicate environment.
Schedule 10 would facilitate development that ignores bylaws and policies in the official plans of the District of Muskoka and its 6 towns/townships, as well as the Provincial Policy Statement 2014, that have been carefully and thoughtfully developed over time in order to ensure sustainable and responsible development. Without these controls and an opportunity for all stakeholders to have input, developers would be free to plunder our environment in their pursuit of a return on investment without regard to good planning practices, and ignore environmental safeguards that currently protect Muskoka’s greatest asset - its lakes and shorelines.
We believe Schedules 5 and 10 as written represent short term thinking that could permanently damage a fragile environment, which would have irreversible negative longer term implications for Muskoka’s economy and jobs.
Public input on development proposals has been a key means of informing our governing councillors and planners about the impact of development proposals. We have witnessed this first-hand on numerous occasions where public input has informed Council in a manner that led them to make a different decision than initially recommended by their planning staff. By eliminating advance public notice of open-for-business development proposals, Schedule 10 is removing a valuable source of information for municipal government to consider in their decisions.
Muskoka’s environment is already under threat from unsustainable development, with an increasing number of toxic blue-green algae blooms in its lakes that make the lake water poisonous for drinking and swimming. Water filtration systems are ineffective at destroying the toxins. Last summer your government announced it was making $5 million investment to ensure the protection of the Muskoka watershed. This is very much in keeping with Conservative values of protecting our natural assets; however, Schedules 5 and 10 are inconsistent with these values.
Although we support cutting unnecessary government ‘red-tape’ and job creation, FOM believes that Schedules 5 and 10 are a short-sighted approach – allowing developers to ignore environmental protections will only hurt our economy that is driven by the environment.
FOM also has serious concerns with the negative implications of Schedules 5 and 10 on the water supply, farmland and greenspaces across Ontario generally, and the undemocratic manner in which they would permit municipal governments to exclude the public from development discussions.
The Ontario public cares deeply about clean air, clean water and our natural spaces. We expect no less from our government -- especially one that promised early in its mandate to ‘come down heavy’ on polluters.   Voters in Muskoka and Parry Sound have returned an Ontario Conservative MPP for the last 19 years and for 66 of the past 74 years (and a federal Conservative MP for the last 12 years).  An environmental problem tied to Bill 66 would put future Conservative success in jeopardy.
We urge you to remove Schedules 5 and 10 from Bill 66.

The province already has the power to override local planning rules to support local economic development called the Minister’s zoning order (MZO). By proposing the open for business bylaw implemented by municipalities the province is distancing itself from the scrutiny, criticism and accountability that would normally be directed at the province had they used the MZO. It also increases the number of likely development proposals that will come forward as the development industry is very influential and often funds election campaigns at the municipal level.
Breaking the promise not to open up the Greenbelt shows a disrespect to voters. It also puts the health of farmers and rural landowners at risk. The health of our region depends on valuing our farms, forests, clean water sources and nature and building robust and vibrant communities.

17483,/comment/17483,"Re: Response to Request for Comments for Bill 66, Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act, 2018 (ERO #013-4293)
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade circulation proposal for Bill 66.
I have been a member of the Quinte Region Source Protection Committee for the last 11 years, as well as a member of the City of Belleville Committee of Adjustment for the past 12 years.  I retired as a member (in good standing) of the Canadian Institute of Planners and also retired as a Registered Professional Planner.  Thus, I have a wide historical and ongoing interest in these initiatives given my experience and previous roles.
My comments to the proposed Bill 66 and, more specifically, to Schedule 10, are as follows:
1.	Bill 66 was introduced to speed up the approvals of enterprises which would create 50 to 100 jobs [how are jobs defined, e.g., above minimum wage with full benefits, full-time or seasonal or part-time?].  Apparently, the intention of the Province is to have all applications approved  within one year of submission [https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4239].  It is intended that the criteria regarding: number of employees; type of employees; length of tenure (seasonal vs. part-time vs. full time); wage rates; standards for the size and space of the zone; standards for decisions are to be defined in a new regulation - an instrument not subject to public consultation or to public scrutiny and subject to changes at the whim of a Minister.
2.	It is incomprehensible that the province, without the benefit of any published studies dealing with the length of time for planning approvals or a published provincial inventory of available serviced land, should provide a tool to reward recalcitrant municipalities that had taken no steps to develop fully serviced industrial parks or to designate and zone land for industrial or business enterprises to the detriment of municipalities that had done so.  An example would be the City of Belleville where an active economic development department has ensured that tracts of prezoned and serviced land are available for such purposes.  The private sector has also followed through with its own predesignated, zoned and serviced properties in Belleville.  Why should poor planning by municipalities be rewarded at the expense of more progressive municipalities through the use of new processes provided in Bill 66?
3.	Bill 66, Schedule 10, proposes to amend  the Planning Act by adding a new section 34.(1) ""Open For Business Planning By-law"" (OFBPB) which, among other things, lists provisions of other statutes which will not apply including Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, (CWA) 2006 and Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015.  Thus the OFBPB would remove the requirement that all decisions under the Planning Act would have to ... ""conform with significant threat policies and designated Great lakes Policies set out in the source protection plan""... and ""have regard to other policies set out in the source protection plan"".  CWA, section 39 (2) provides that when a conflict between a zoning by-law or Official Plan and a source protection plan occurs, the source protection plan prevails.  Section 39 (3) excludes the provisions of Section 39 from policy statements under section 3 of the Planning Act  or a minister's order under section 47 of the Planning Act.  At present, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing has the authority to override the provisions of Section 39 in two specific cases.  Why is it necessary to enact the provisions of Bill 66, schedule 10 pertaining to the CWA 2006 if the Crown already has such powers? There are other provisions in section 39 which pertain to infrastructure and works by other governments and agencies which will be removed.  Does the baby have to be thrown out with the bath water?
4.	In a well written document and argument, “Open-For-Business” Planning By-Laws, Drinking Water Safety, And The Lessons Of The Walkerton Tragedy: Legal Analysis Of Schedule 10 Of Ontario Bill 66"", Theresa McClenaghan and Rick Lindgren of the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) describe the history of the Walkerton tragedy and the resultant Inquiry and follow through, which lead to the CWA, 2006.  They provide the following observations, conclusions and recommendation:
1.	""...Schedule 10 of Bill 66 represents an unprecedented and unjustifiable rollback of current legal requirements that were specifically enacted under the CWA to prevent a recurrence of the Walkerton Tragedy.  By any objective standard, the well-founded requirements under section 39 of the CWA are not “red tape” or “burdensome regulations”, as implicitly suggested by the provincial government. To the contrary, section 39 is a vitally important safeguard that must remain in full force and effect across Ontario in order to protect drinking water safety and human health.""
2.	""...it is well-established that protecting drinking water sources against significant threats also makes considerable economic sense, particularly since source protection efforts help reduce the need for municipalities to add (or enhance) expensive treatment technologies, or attempt to restore or cleanup
contaminated drinking water sources, or build (or expand) drinking water infrastructure in order to draw supplies from alternative sources.""
3.	""In our view, the Ontario government should not sacrifice drinking water quality, or create needless public health risks, in the pursuit of economic development throughout the province. Accordingly, CELA strongly recommends that Schedule 10 be abandoned and withdrawn by the Ontario government before Bill 66 proceeds any further in the legislative process. ""
5.	The Quinte Region Source Protection Committee has observed  a number of examples of projects which were developed or which evolved during laissez faire administrations.  To be fair, there was a paucity of planning policies, regulations, and statutory powers when these enterprises were commenced.  Long-term environmental damages were created which linger on and now must be remediated or corrected at tremendous costs.  The Bakelite property in Belleville, Picton Terminals in Picton, landfills that became Zwicks Park in Belleville, the old gasification plant in Belleville are examples of projects from previous decades which require remediation now.  CELA estimates that the aggregate costs for the Walkerton Tragedy for ""...the public inquiry, remediation, compensation, healthcare and related matters ...to be $200 million."" (p.17)   Remediation of the above-noted local examples may reach similar costs in aggregate.
6.	Based on my previous work experiences and those that I gained with the Quinte Region Source Protection Committee in developing an approved Source Protection Plan, I conclude that a successful planning and approval approach should be based on: stated principles; goals and objectives; policies; up-to-date science-based assessment and sound engineering;  and geo-referenced data and information.  The precautionary approach which was taken was collaboratively driven, with full public consultation, and was supported by the local municipalities and the Province.   The Ontario approach to long-range planning and development at local, regional, watershed and provincial scales which commenced after World War II should not be ""trumped"" by a retrograde approach to re-institute site-specific spot zoning opportunism for the benefit of a few at the expense of many as the result of implementation of Bill 66.
7.	Page 14, of the proposed Preserving and Protecting our Environment for Future Generations: A Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan states, ""Ensure the knowledge gained through the drinking water source protection program helps inform our water management programs.""  This reinforces the position that Source Protection Plan policies should not be omitted from consideration during review of development proposals as is proposed in Bill 66.  How can one policy initiative so greatly conflict with another?  It is curious that one provincial ministry wants to halt the influence of Source Protection Plans on new development while the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks wants to use the knowledge gained from Source Protection Plans to better manage water as related to new development.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Withdraw Bill 66, the Planning Tool and the new regulation.
2.	Adopt the analysis, conclusions and positions developed by the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) found at   https://www.cela.ca/sites/cela.ca/files/CELAlegalanalysis-Bill66andCWA….
.
3	Provide Provincial funds to remediate and clean-up the failed and abandoned projects in the Quinte Source Protection Region such as the abandoned Bakelite property in Belleville, Zwicks Park landfill in Belleville, Picton Terminals, Belleville Coal Gas Plant and others.  These projects demonstrate that enterprises commenced without proper studies, planning or engineering and taking into account only the immediate impacts on the local neighbourhood as will occur if Bill 66 is enacted.  Eventually, failed  Bill 66 projects will result in large clean-up costs which must be borne by the province, conservation authority and/or municipality later in the long term.
4.	Bill 66 (and subsequent processes) will have a negative impact on all current statutory planning and management instruments, especially the Clean Water Act, 2006.  If Bill 66 must proceed, then I recommend that the requirement for compliance with the Clean Water Act, 2006 and the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015 remain in effect to avoid risks to public health from contamination impacts to surface, ground water, and aquifers relied upon for drinking water and ecosystem health.  This can be achieved by removing any reference to the Clean Water Act in Schedule 10.
5.	The Province should carry-out and publish studies dealing with the length of time taken for land-use planning approvals by municipalities and develop and publish a provincial inventory of available serviced land.

As climate disruption continues our natural resources will become ever more precious and will help us to become more self-sufficient. Areas such as California will lose their ability, through natural resource depletion (water in particular) to provide us with fresh fruits amd vegetables.
It is imperative that Ontario strengthens protections over natural resources. This bill will weaken them.

17496,/comment/17496,"Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers. Archaeology gives a voice to many who have
been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario

17499,/comment/17499,"My name is Laina and I live in Burlington ON. I strongly oppose Bill 66.
Doug Ford said he would not touch the Green Belt and has gone back on his promise. This bill is not about ""cutting red tape"" and making Ontario ""open for business""- it is about Doug Ford wanting his wallet to get bigger. He is a businessman and investor- allowing the land to be open for developers only benefits him.
The Green Belt is the largest protected green space in Ontario and it is what makes our province so special. Locals and tourists enjoy the hiking trails and the close escape from the city. It is also home to many protected species ONLY found in Ontario. Bill 66 also jeopardizes over 250 000 Ontario citizens drinking water. The Oak Ridges Moraine is the largest fresh water supply for Ontarian's and Doug Ford's Bill 66 compromises the safety of this watershed by allowing land development and eliminating acts that protect our major water supplies. If that watershed was polluted and something happened similar to the Walkerton crisis, there would be a massive health crisis in Ontario.
The cities in the Golden Horseshoe are growing at a rapid rate and our roads and cities cannot handle the growth. The roads are too congested causing air pollution and the QEW, 401, highway 6 and 403 cannot handle anymore traffic. I work in a school and see so many illnesses and health complications in children that are directly related to air pollution- my son being one of them, suffering from severe asthma that causes attacks when the air quality is poor.
If Doug Ford wants business to come back to Ontario he needs to focus on cities that used to be booming in business but are now struggling, such as the closure of the GM plant that resulted in thousands of employees losing jobs. Re-create new opportunities in these cities with the existing infrastructure. Building more factories and housing in the greenbelt is not going to help the job crisis in Ontario- it just allows more people in and there is not enough jobs to support everyone. The housing market will continue to soar and no one will want to live in Ontario because of how unaffordable it is. The government also needs to start cracking down on people working for cash. My partner has a renovation business and pays taxes but he cannot find jobs because people are advertising on Kijiji and other sites that they will work for cash for only 10$ an hour and do the same work. That takes away from local businesses and our economy.
Canada just met with other countries in the World and made a commitment to make environmental improvements to help stop climate change after the climate change report was released. By Ontario passing this Bill, we would be going back on our commitment and would cause massive environmental devastation.
I am scared for my child's future in Ontario and if this Bill passes, we will probably leave the province.

17506,/comment/17506,"As I scan the proposals being proposed by the Ontario Government it is very obvious to me that the chief beneficiaries of these changes are once again big business and land developers.  I don't see anything of substance that will benefit workers or their families.  In fact, quite the opposite.  With the removal of employer obligations to their employees, in the guise of eliminating ""red tape"", workers are having their workplace protections and their right to be informed of their worker rights by employers reduced even further.  If adopted, these proposals can only promote more employer control of the workplace and working conditions at the expense of a workforce that is doing it's best to survive in a business climate that unfairly demands more and more of the worker in return for ever dwindling wages and benefits at a time when the cost of living in our province is increasing unabated.  The obvious goal here is to once again increase business profits regardless of the implications for the workers, without whom, businesses would not exist.  With these proposals the government is abdicating it's sworn duty to act in the best interests of the people, choosing instead to placate the business community demands for fewer restricts to enable increased exploitation of their staff in the guise of reducing ""red tape"" which, not coincidentally, will result in these businesses adding to their profit margins.  By any measure, these proposed changes can only be seen as regressive in the extreme and one more indication of this government's determination to force wrong-headed draconian measures on the public at many levels.
At a time when the world is teetering on the brink of climate change disaster, I find it particularly egregious that this government is systematically removing the environmental protections, as scant as they were, that were put in place with the goal of mitigating the effects of global warming.  The Premier's decision to reverse any efforts in that direction not only flies in the face of all available evidence to the contrary, it is seen by many Ontarians as a crime against the welfare of the people and the environment.  As a long term economic policy these regressive actions reflect a fundamental failure of this government and Mr. Ford to recognize and accept scientific reality and act accordingly!  The economic costs of climate change in terms of property and infrastructure destruction in this province are already soaring and promise to increase substantially should global warming continue unabated.  Inevitably, these expenses will become unsustainable and Ontarians will have no option but to deal with the economic outcomes of climate change as best they can.  This scenario does not bode well for maintaining an orderly society in which law and order prevails and people have some sense of security and hope for a return to living conditions as we know them now.  Mr. Ford's dismantling of environmental protections in this province represents not only societal suicide, it fosters alarming doubt concerning his worthiness to occupy the highest political office in our province.  His willingness to ignore reality on many fronts will be the undoing of everything that once made Ontario the envy of many other jurisdictions in this country.
And now, his return to a scheme to turn the Green Belt over to vested private interests for exploitation completely beggars any sense that he feels any responsibility for the well being of the citizens who will be impacted, or any understanding of the ecological outcomes that will surely follow this regrettable decision.  The people of Ontario have clearly voiced their condemnation any such action in the Green Belt in the past.  But here we are again, forced to resist an option that is not in the best interests of the people nor the environment.  No means no, Mr. Premier, what part of that is giving you a problem?  Or is this just another device to placate the avaricious goals of developers and the business community to garner political support for your political agenda?  Is that your true hidden agenda, sir?  Because in view of all your irresponsible decisions since you've taken office and the abysmal lack of transparency in your governance, that's the only possible conclusion I can come to.  As with so many of your decisions, there is absolutely no logic involved with this one.  In years to come, if this ploy is successful, it will be seen as the thin edge of the wedge that enabled the destruction of the Green Belt in its entirety.  Because once they get a toehold, we all know that the developers will be back to the table again and again with alleged ""sound business reasons"" to continue the destruction that you began with your irresponsible decision to allow them to exploit the Green Belt, even on a limited basis!  These corporations have no allegiance to anything or anybody other than increased profits, so you can rest assured that they'll be back if you give them their way this time.  That is an undeniable fact with consideration the historical record of business exploitation of our natural resources in this province.
I understand the need for affordable housing, but at what cost to the environment and our economy?  The Green Belt is not only a sacred ecological space to be protected, it is also the generator of many millions of dollars of revenue every year and widely acknowledged as a major ""Bread Basket"" for the province; which helps us preserve the independence of our food supply, along with the price advantage we enjoy because the Green Belt reduces the necessity for Ontarians to pay premium prices for food imported from other areas of Canada, the U.S. and far away international countries.  Obviously, many of the productive  farms now operating in the Green Belt will need to be expropriated to accommodate this housing project, throwing a great many agricultural workers out of work along with the farm owners, some of whom have been tilling the land they inherited from their ancestors for generations.
This proposal makes no sense on an any level Mr. Premier!  Surely, there has to be a more sustainable solution to the affordable housing issue that doesn't involve the disastrous outcomes that exploitation of the Green Belt for business purposes will bring.  And, is it not the duty of government to do the hard work required to find those viable solutions on behalf of all the people of the province?  The negative impacts of this ill-conceived concept will become evident very quickly, but the long term repercussions will only been seen with the passage of time, some of them, long after we've all turned to dust.  Which side of history to you want to be on Mr. Premier?  And, if you've given it any thought at all, what do you want to leave behind as your Legacy for future generations?   You have an extraordinary opportunity here to do the honourable thing for Ontarians now living as well as for future generations of Ontarians!  I urge to to summon up the determination to find another solution to this housing issue that doesn't depend on this short term band-aid ""fix""to the problem.  The studies were concluded long ago and the evidence that this is a bad idea is clear.  There is a great deal riding on your decision on this matter for all of us.  I urge you to take a serious second look at this issue and do what's best for our environment, our economy and the people of Ontario.  Frankly, anything less will be seen as unacceptable by millions of Ontarians!  And I dare to remind you that that is not the pathway that leads to reelection for anyone in the political arena, regardless of how the facts are spun by Election Committees.  The electorate is becoming more and more aware that they are being endlessly manipulated by the people they put in power to protect them and, contrary to the popular belief of many politicians, they have a very long memory when it comes to fundamental decisions that were not made in the best interests of themselves and their families.  Politics is not a ""game"" to the public, it's the one the thing that affects almost every facet their lives and their future well being.  They're exhausted and impatient with an unjust status-quo that excludes them from a political decision process that is making personal progress almost unattainable.  They've come to expect much more openness and straight forward honesty from politicians at every level of government.  Any would-be office holder would be well advised to keep that in mind during his/her next run for a place in the halls of power.  The worm is beginning to turn!

Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66. I look forward to hearing about the revised Bill 66.

17524,/comment/17524,"I disagree with Bill 66, specifically Schedule 5 and Schedule 10.  It is undemocratic to repeal and eliminate safeguards found in various acts, calling them ""red tape"".  These acts were put into place to protect people, often after the fact to prevent various tragedies such as Walkerton from ever happening again.
1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66 allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These by-laws would take precedence over municipal official plans.  This is unacceptable.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.  This is unacceptable.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.  This is unacceptable.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.  This is unacceptable.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt. Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.  This is unacceptable.
6. It threatens fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.  This is unacceptable.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors.  This is unacceptable.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.  This is unacceptable.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in their operations.  This is unacceptable.
In a nutshell, Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. It would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely.

17525,/comment/17525,"This comment is to express strong disagreement with the proposed Bill 66.
The proposed legislation would reverse protections of the environment, viewscapes and rights of community members in areas where a so-called ""Open for Business"" By-Law may be passed by a municipality.
The proposed legislation is conceptually flawed. Creating opportunity for local parochial economic interests to allow development without adhering to the protections under the existing Oak Ridges Moraine, Clean Water, Lake Simcoe Protection and Planning (public notice and consultation) Acts is in conflict with balancing public, private and environmental interests that is at the core of our democratic system.
Additionally, the proposed legislation fails to describe how the Minister would evaluate and decide on a municipality's actions. Thus, the proposed legislation is also procedurally flawed.
Finally, the proposed legislation does not address how the provincial Crown and municipalities (who themselves can also be considered a Crown actor) will fulfill their Constitutionally compelled Duty to Consult to ensure section 35 Aboriginal Rights, interests and way of life are not adversely affected by a so-called ""open for business"" development. In short, the legislation is in conflict with Ontario's obligations under the Constitution Act, 1982 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
In short, the proposed Bill 66 reverses environmental, community and Aboriginal rights protections that have been long established and are an integral part of the high quality of life enjoyed by citizens in Ontario. It certainly does not demonstrate clear and balanced thinking is being used by the proponents of this legislation, no matter how earnest their desire to see economic development increased in Ontario.
Surely there are policies and supports that would be more effective at encouraging sustainable economic development, without the collateral damage this legislation promises to rend on values that are fundamental to Ontarians, namely: a healthy environment; open communication; community engagement; and importantly, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.
As an Ontario citizen, I strongly object to this misguided legislation.

17532,/comment/17532,"This bill concerns me for several reasons:
Schedule 10 would allow municipalities with the open for business zoning by-law to permit development in the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine without notice to the public. This is a serious threat to our democracy, compromises transparency and public engagement, leaving citizens with little recourse for appealing the by-law to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. And I suspect that this could open up the municipalities to lawsuits should developments negatively impact the public good. Following this logic, municipalities could be then be found liable and potentially be bankrupted. Would the province swoop in to the rescue if this is the case? Somehow I think not. Have the legal ramifications of this bill been clearly thought out? Really, this bill is just another form of downloading and passing the buck to the municipalities. It is a really terrible idea.
We have so much to be concerned about with climate change impacting our environment, the last thing we need to do is to permit development of our farmland (on what little we have left) leading to more sprawl. We have more than enough sprawl that is not paying for itself. This bill would only bankrupt future generations even more while threatening our food supply. That is soil we will never get back if it’s used for subdivisions instead.
I'm worried that OFB by-laws will threaten our drinking water supplies by overriding policies in approved source protection plans which are there to protect existing and future sources of drinking water against landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
Several aspects of this bill demonstrate extremely short-sighted thinking and are indicative of economic interests trumping human rights to both a healthy environment and a functioning democracy.  It would not be in the best interests of the people of Ontario for the legislature to pass this bill.

""In CELA’s view, there is no legal justification or compelling public policy rationale for allowing
open-for-business planning by-laws to circumvent or override significant threat policies in source
protection plans approved under the CWA. Accordingly, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 is a regressive,
unwarranted and potentially risky proposal that is inconsistent with the public interest, and that
does not adequately safeguard the health and safety of the people of Ontario
CELA concludes that Schedule 10 of Bill 66 represents an unjustifiable rollback of current legal
requirements that were specifically enacted under the CWA to prevent a recurrence of the
Walkerton Tragedy. Accordingly, CELA strongly recommends that Schedule 10 be immediately
abandoned or withdrawn by the Ontario government. ""

During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation, and clean our air.

17587,/comment/17587,"Do not move forward with Bill 66. Bill 66 would destroy all of the hard work the citizens of Ontario have put into protecting, conserving and restoring the natural lands of our province. The actions described in this bill and by the government in general demonstrate blatant disregard for our natural environment. Protecting the environment is not just a joke that can be made, or a liberal stance, or a fun side project to placate the environmentalists, the environment is where we live! If we destroy these lands, we cannot get them back. Our children won’t have green spaces to enjoy and clean air to breathe. As a 22-year-old I am incredibly concerned about what Ontario will look like 20 years from now.
Ontario citizens value and love the outdoor areas that the province provides (i.e. conservation areas, trails, cottage country). We clearly demonstrate that value with our wallets, by paying entry fees, travelling across the province in search of nature-based activities, spending money in surrounding towns (i.e. Dundas, Elora) and investing in real estate with large green spaces and waterbodies nearby. Allowing our green space to be further developed, without public consultation and government accountability, will anger Ontario citizens. Ontario voters will think twice before electing your government a second time. I have many friends who have already left Ontario in search of provinces with more outdoor opportunities and whose governments respect the natural lands that they are responsible for. These friends are intelligent, educated, capable individuals who now will not be contributing to Ontario’s economy. I love Ontario, we have green spaces I can enjoy regularly, we have job opportunities in my field, and we have a thriving economy. Yet, I cannot continue to enjoy living and working in a province with a provincial leadership that is destroying everything I love about it.
You say we need to be ‘open-for-business’ and develop these lands, well as usual there is a better solution. There is a solution that will lead a more sustainable way of life for everyone. Mixed use urban intensification is the key. We have underdeveloped land in the downtown cores of all of Ontario’s cities. Yes, encouraging people to move from a vehicle dependent suburban lifestyle to a biking/walking/transit city lifestyle will take time, but as our leaders you should be making decisions to encourage this process.
It is your responsibility to listen to the science and the future projections of what human societies need to look like in the future if we want to continue to live on this planet. It is your responsibility to protect the health and well-being of your citizens. It is your responsibility to listen to your constituents. NIX BILL 66.

1. The bill attempts to override the official plans that municipalities worked hard, over decades, to create. Chaotic results.  These official plans are designed to guide development to appropriate areas AND to protect water, natural heritage, farm land, and municipal authority in general. The province must not compel cities to break their own rules!
As well, these bylaws do not require public consultation, unlike the provincial laws they are supplanting. All this could happen in secret. This is undemocratic and underhanded.  Citizens would have NO RECOURSE to appeal the bylaws via local planning appeal tribunal.
2. Drinking water. What if, as a result of Bill 66, a municipality experienced a crisis on the scale of Walkerton. Downloading the responsibility to the local level (by requiring these bylaws) is unconscionable. The province has no right to download the risk and responsibility for the toxic crises it will create.
3. Sprawl and farm land. This bill amounts to a handout to sprawl builders and developers. Sprawl NEVER PAYS FOR ITSELF.

17748,/comment/17748,"There are many reasons why I am opposed to Bill 66.  In brief, these are outlined in a Region of Waterloo report, including the following:
·    Lack of prescribed consultation;
·    Risks to health, safety and the environment, including groundwater protection;
·    Non-applicability of Provincial and Municipal plans and policies…
Municipal councils in the Region of Waterloo have overwhelmingly stated their opposition to Bill 66 in its current form.
That opposition is based on the provision that a municipality can pass an Open for Business bylaw.  If such a bylaw is passed, there would be:
·       no need to follow planning documents that have been created over many years;
·       no requirements for public consultation;
·       no appeal could be made against any municipal act
The impact on the future of our cities, our countryside, our natural resources, and on cultural and natural heritage is clear. These are outlined below.
1. Impact on Planning
If a municipality passed an exemption under Bill 66, zoning by laws would not need to conform to any official plans.  Site plan approval would not be required.  There would be no protection to the natural or built environments.  Famous structures that attract tourists from around the globe could be flattened.  A municipality could demolish any building or cultural feature it wanted.  A bylaw could be passed that is exempt from all planning and environmental law such as the Planning Act, Places to Grow Act, and the Planning and Development Act.  The planning process is out the window and there is no appeal process.
2.  Impact on the Environment
Urban growth tends to be expansive rather than focused on the existing land that has already been developed in urban areas.  We need to resist that tendency to sprawl, thus putting our agricultural and forest resources at risk.
More than half of Waterloo Region's growth comes from building in existing urban areas. This investment in our urban centres means we can keep growing while preserving the rural communities and farms that make Waterloo Region unique.  This is not a short-term concern.  We need to protect farmland and natural areas from urban sprawl.  Farmland, cultural and natural landscapes provide urban dwellers with respite from stress.  Natural environments provide us with clean water and clean air.  These are qualities that have made Ontario a wonderful place to live, work and play.
3.  Impact on Heritage
The impact on built heritage and cultural landscapes is obvious since Bill 66 circumvents planning by municipal government.  There are many examples where protection of our built heritage has been put at risk despite good planning.  An Open for Business bylaw could bypass the Planning Act and Provincial Policy Statement.  The latter states clearly that ""Significant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes shall be conserved.""
The bill also impacts on archaeological heritage.  Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back at least 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers.
Archaeology gives a voice to many who have been written out of the history of our province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of the research that comes from excavations prior to construction.
The Ontario Archaeological Society has stated clearly: “Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent… the Provincial Policy Statement… and Official Plan requirements…. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.”
The Architectural Conservancy of Ontario has stated that Bill 66 would allow the development of major employment and economic growth opportunities.  We could see many more demolitions of heritage buildings.  In the past, demolitions have taken place despite protections, including Carnegie libraries, fire stations, city halls and other valuable buildings of historic and cultural significance.  Should a builder decide to demolish an historic building, under an Open for Business bylaw, there would be nothing anybody could do to protect it.
Under Bill 66, the lack of heritage protections would mean that we further write out of our history the richness of Indigenous Peoples as well as those settlers whose descendants form a majority of today’s population.
Bill 66 puts the cultural and natural landscapes of Ontario at risk.  I ask that you reject this bill in its current form.

Protection also makes financial sense. Food and farming in the Greater Golden Horseshoe contributes $12.3 billion to the economy and creates 212,000 jobs.  Over 7,000 of these farms are found in the Greenbelt, including half of Ontario’s fruit farms and one fifth of our vegetable farms.

The Schedule 11 proposed amendments to the Private Career Colleges Act is overly vague, though seems to imply a desire to make it easier for private sector colleges to compete with legitimate, public post-secondary institutions. This would result in an over saturated job market in which employers are unable or ill-prepared to differentiate between competent, credentialed graduates from legitimate public institutions and those from the private colleges, where education standards are far more lax and the quality of training is difficult to measure.
I sincerely hope that this act will not be passed into law, as these represent only some of the inherent flaws of the proposal. I also hope that the current government instead takes an evidence-based approach to any economic policies--as the currently proposed act would only be a detriment to Ontario's economy.

The intention of  the Greenbelt act is to ensure the ""green"" health and lifestyle of persons living now and in the future in Ontario. Usurping protected land for development is tantamount to slapping the future in the face and would be an act of criminal proportions. Once this protected space is developed, it is irretrievable.

The greenbelt serves an important role in propping up Ontario's agricultural and tourism industries, eliminating its protections will assuredly be to the detriment of those working in these sectors.  The development of protected greenbelt lands is in my opinion a threat to the food security, and therefore national security, of Canada as a nation.  Greenbelt lands represent the best croplands in Canada, and some of the only croplands capable of growing soft fruits.  For this valuable land to be destroyed for housing developments and industrial parks is not just economically short sighted, but is an attack on Canada's ability to provide its own food supply.  This would make Canadians even more dependent upon American and Mexican imports to put food on the table.  Greenbelt protections should be strengthened, not eliminated.  In my time living south of Lake Ontario I have seen what should have been protected farmland consumed by housing developments.  Developers have for too long been able to exploit greenbelt lands, knowing that they will more than make up for in profit what they lose in paying fines.

It would seem probable that billions of dollars of tourism income will be lost if the environmental regulations are relaxed to the extent this bill suggests and that this could reduce Ontario Provincial Government tax income by up to 5 billion per annum.  Note that the impacts will be felt quite strongly in parts of the province which have a greater proportion of their revenue from tourism and with a large number of jobs dependent upon tourism.
It is also worth  noting that environmental damage is often permanent - or costs far more to repair than the funds that were obtained from performing the damage in the first place.

During the election, The Premier of Ontario promised to protect the Greenbelt and your government recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities. This bill would threaten two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These by-laws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
Contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors. Community members would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in their operations.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66.

On this point, we note that Mr. Justice O’Connor’s report on the Walkerton Inquiry identified overzealous provincial deregulation, budget cuts and staffing reductions as major contributing factors that resulted in the deaths of seven persons (and serious illnesses in thousands of other residents) after drinking contaminated municipal tap water.
Significantly, the Clean Water Act was one of the statutes passed by the Ontario Legislature in response to Mr. Justice O’Connor’s recommendations, and the Act is intended to prevent the recurrence of the Walkerton Tragedy elsewhere in the province.

But what we are really losing under this bill is the protection of our clean water, clean air, the Greenbelt, farmland, wildlife, government transparency and the rights of municipalities to plan for their own unique needs.
 Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business planning by-laws” that will have the power to override vital regulations in the Ontario Planning and Development Act, the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Metrolinx Act and other foundational regulations that the citizens of Ontario have fought hard for over the decades.

Likewise here in Ontario only the richest and most privileged will benefit from Bill 66.  Once fast money is made, regular citizens will be left with all the problems that come from reckless development.
 Bill 66 will promote the kind of business that will destroy natural areas, threaten our local food supply, create gridlock, favour rich land speculators and increase our property taxes.
Bill 66 opens up Ontario’s Greenbelt for factory, retail and residential development, undermines drinking water protection rules and guts rules that help industry reduce the release of toxic chemicals.
The Ford government is abusing its powers.  Doug Ford promised in his campaign that the Greenbelt would be untouched by his government.  What happened to that promise?  Ontario citizens and taxpayers are tired of the rhetoric of smoke and mirrors.  Bill 66 exposes the true colours of the Ford government by creating a bill that will ignore many protections we hold dear, only to make the rich even richer and the poor even poorer.  If there is any integrity and decency in our political leaders then Bill 66 must not be passed!
This short-sighted push of making money as fast as possible is leading us toward the eventual breakdown of a civil society.  Just as deregulation was at the heart of the 2008 global financial crisis, Bill 66 is poised to hurt the taxpayers of Ontario.  Bill 66 is reckless and lacks a long-term view for Ontario. Bill 66 must be stopped!

He himself said “I don’t really know anything about the environment”, so why does he have any agency in the this decision that will be devastating to the hydrologic systems in the areas around greenbelts!  Southern ontario has already put up for development so much prime agricultural land, land that is so special on his continent and the planet as it is not often that farmland is in a climatological location that really doesnt have fear of longterm drought (as our prairies do for example).
As well, how can an educated adult such as Mr Ford not understand the preciousness of clean water. Even if one doesnt give a shit about the environment or your fellow humans, you must understand that business needs water and in the future clean water will be a great asset!

You're going to have neighbouring municipalities with a diverse patchwork of development.

17962,/comment/17962,"I have reviewed the Act, particularly Schedules 5 and 10. It is to these Schedules, as well as to the whole Act, that I wish to direct my comments.
Schedule 5 deals particularly with the Repealing the Toxics Reduction Act. This is an Act which has been particularly important to this area (Hamilton) because of the heavy industry which we enjoy. While this industry does provide many quality jobs to our area, there have been issues of the release of toxic substances into local environments. I would like to see this act continue, as a means of keeping these substances under control for the benefit of all our citizens.
Schedule 10 is more worrisome yet. It reduces the scope and power of many evironmental acts which have been of great benefit to all of us in this part of Southern Ontario. Specifically, the Greenbelt, along with Niagara Escarpment and other conservation acts, have been essential in the fight to keep our water supplies clean and free of contamination. And they have been helpful in maintaining sufficient agricultural lands that the people of this area might have some degree of self-sufficiency in food. As I read it, the Act loosens to a dangerous degree the regulations we rely on for proper maintenance of this land. It also restricts any appeal which the people have in response to actions taken against the Greenbelt. And, while in this Schedule it is up to the municipality to decide wheter to disrupt the good system now in place, we need provincial backup in maintaining a good and healthy environment. Jobs do not replace clean air or clean water in this respect.
While these are my main concerns, a (admittedly) brief review of the other Schedules suggests that, for me, the best path forward is to entirely rewrite this Act to maintain the safeguards we have in place.

1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

They are an enormous, far-reaching set of lungs that remove CO2 from our air, provide necessary habit for crowded out wildlife, and a safe haven for biodiversity, amongst hundreds of other benefits.
The Greenbelt has never, nor should it ever be, 'open for business.' I am honestly astounded this is even on the table, but I cannot say I am surprised. This came to light before Doug Ford was even elected, and should not have been ignored.

The reason people don't really value nature in Ontario is because there are very few wild spaces left to even access, and people prefer their home theatres and virtual worlds to reality. Our values are increasingly bankrupt. LESS is MORE. We can chose collective austerity and create a cyclical economy with metrics tied to scientifically sound and widely vetted sustainability measures, or we will have these limits imposed upon us as the quality of our air, water, natural environments, and social interactions continue to degrade, only to enrich the few beyond any sane need. GREED and DISPASSION is what Doug Ford really has Ontario open for.

We don't need less regulation. We need less unaccountable regulation with information unavailable from our 'democratic' governments. There is no indication that the Ford government has any intention of increasing accountability and transparency, so I remain opposed to this whole body of legislation as presented.
Please feel free to draft some legislation that will not only increase accountability and transparency, but will hold politicians and bureaucrats responsible for their decision making, usually done without public approval. Included in this truly democratic legislation will be whistle blower protections guaranteeing job safety and compensation. Preferably, the protections would also explicitly include improved mobility up the management ladder as a result of the whistle blowing.
It is very sad that democracy has not taken hold here in Canada nor Ontario, with first past the post elections allowing minority rule of majorities. Citizens cannot access important, necessary information necessary to actively participate in governance.
When the Ford government decides to create democracy, I will happily endorse accountable and transparent policy plans. As long as I keep hearing ""Open for Business"", I am confident Ontario is moving backwards.

The first one is obvious - the Greenbelt was set up for very good reasons and there is no argument for allowing any developments that would compromise any part of it.  It protects our forests, wetlands and water supply from pollution.
Regarding the Records of Site Condition - this process has become very onerous and does disservice to our developers - it can take upwards of 4 to 6 months on average to get approval.  The process is snarled by Utopian requirements by ministry hydrogeologists, such as the need to identify and delineate impacts from road salt used for de-icing and to actually compel proponents to remediate sites for such impacts to meet the Ontario standards for soils and groundwater.  Just imagine - road salt - which would still be deployed at a new development site during winters, is being considered a contaminant, whereas public roadways are excluded from this consideration by exemption under the Highway and Traffic Act.  In other words, one set of rules for private landowners and another for the public.  Your OPen For Business initiative is commendable, but it must reign in the MECP from overreach and strict control and power over development they now have, which is resulting in unreasonable delays and costs to developers and hampering residential developments which in turn affects housing prices and rentals.

""Repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 by 2021, remove the toxics reduction plan in 2019 and rely on the robust and science-based Federal Chemicals Management Plan""
This sounds good. However, it is similar language used by the George W. Bush administration (they used ""sound science""). The much repeated ""sound science"" phrase was really just a cover-up term for the administration to reject inconvenient facts. Any facts that hampered their ideological goals of business, development, the economy, the market were dismissed, with the reason being given ""they're not based on sound science"". Often they'd point to a think-tank or research group who were re-evaluating the ""old science""; but that research group was heavily weighted by industry insiders and lobbyists who would profit if they could cast doubt on the previous science.  It was the proverbial foxes guarding the hen houses.
In reality they ""old science"" was still quite sound, was backed up by scientific academies around the world. ""Sound science"" as used by the GWB administration became a  euphemism for ""my ideology trumps your facts"".
Given that history, and given that Ford has already displayed the naked greed that makes him an ideologue who puts short-term profits ahead of everything else (while in city council and now as premier), I strongly suspect he's using the GWB playbook of letting industry make decisions rather than independent regulatory bodies (under Harper we saw short-sighted harmful legislation being tabled that was nearly word for word bills written by oil and gas lobbyists; same in the US).
Let's try and avoid that again, please? Bill 66 just seems to have too many traps hidden among the pretty sounding words. It sounds too much like other bills that were supposed to improve the economy, bring back jobs, but in reality were just wish lists for developers, oil and gas and petrochemical industry who wanted to go back to a time when rules were much more lax (we are still paying for our fathers' and grandfathers' short-sighted decisions when it came to development, pollution control, protection of habitat, etc).
In summary, there is often a good reason regulations are in place. Bringing in consulting groups who stand to profit if those regulations is now just idiotic because we have ample evidence that this approach. DOES. NOT. WORK. to protect people and the environment. Please do better. Just because the only tool you have is a hammer does not mean everything you see can be treated like a nail.

18068,/comment/18068,"Bill C-66, Removing Schedule 10
It was over a considerable number of years, and untold hours, that former citizens of this Province spent putting together regulations to protect our communities, ecosystems, and human populations of Ontario.  There are a variety of requirements needed to sustain life her in the Province.  Our water, air, food supply, as well as our psychological health all rely on protected ecosystems.  These ecosystems are fragile and are reliant on a responsible and intelligent use of the remaining sanctuaries of undisturbed land.  The proposed, “Open for Business” narrative, in my mind anyway, only envisions an assemblage of the horrors’ of past collective endeavors’, many to this day, of the required use of citizen tax dollars to deal with the mitigation of the devastation, water and soil contamination and loss of biodiversity.
I think the C-66 Bill would be improved if we say “Ontario for Responsible Business Development” in regions were land has already been allocated for commercial and industrial purposes.  Opening of the Ontario’s Green Belt does not represent long-term prosperity for Ontarians (e.g. clean water, sustainable agriculture, natural areas of recreation); it only represents short-term gains for developers.
The implementation of Ontario’s Green Belt represents a great deal of forethought for the protection of Ontarian’s sources of clean water, avoidance of urban sprawl, along with protection of natural spaces and Ontario’s biodiversity.  It is an investment in the health and welfare of present and future Ontarians.  It would be a travesty to erase that forethought for protection, simply for the short-term gains of developers.  You have to ask yourself, what truly benefits Ontarian in the long journey.  I would encourage the government to read about the importance of green belts to the urban areas and large cities that have made the conservation of their green belt a priority, e.g. City of London, UK.
We have a sustainable planet to protect and we need to grow enhance Ontario’s economy in a way that benefit Ontarians in the long run, but we need to resist the approaches that we know will only provide short-term gain, but will have long-term consequences for the quality of Ontario’s communities, quality of life, and biodiversity.

We have seen development along lake ontario and other waterfront areas, do nothing for affordability or availability, but has only increased the bottom line for section of the population that doesn't need for the additional choice.

Lands were protected for a reason.. those reasons still exist, now more than ever.

While cutting “red tape” may be a benefit to increasing employment, it must not be done if the absence of robust oversight results in degradation of our waterways, agricultural lands , air and our natural environment.  Schedule 10 would allow developers, big business and property speculators to, through agreeable municipalities, override the provisions in the Greenbelt Act, the Clean Water Act, the Lake Simcoe Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act.  These municipalities, may, for short-term gain and without regard for long-term environmental consequences, allow development which could negatively affect the health and well-being of its residents and of residents farther afield, as pollution does not stay within the boundaries of a particular municipality.  In addition this legislation allows municipalities to act covertly, to skip the processes of public notice and public hearings. This lack of a democratic process cuts people out of having a say in their own health and well-being and that of their neighbours.  To defile procedures meant to protect us from opportunistic development by calling these procedures “red tape” is not in the best interest of all Ontarians.
I ask you to amend Bill 66 so that no municipality and no development can evade the protections provided by the Acts I named above and that no municipality can proceed with any development without first conducting democratically responsible public notice and public hearings.

Definitely, schedule 5 and schedule 10 need to be removed from Bill 66.  By all evidence, both scientific and experiential, we must do everything we can to protect our environment from devastating climate change.  Business, commerce, and lifestyle are killing us. It is not true that we ""cannot afford to save ourselves.""  We must reduce carbon emissions (including maintaining carbon storage in the earth), preserve species habitat,  maintain productive farmland and aggressively guard our water supplies.
If we don't do these things, any business that encroaches on these areas will be useless when climate change takes its toll in 15-25 years.  We dare not close our eyes until it is too late (which is almost now).
If we are smart and wise, the economy can flourish (not necessarily grow by leaps and bounds) without destroying the earth's breath that we all need to survive.  We must not think only now to the detriment of the future.  ""Open for Business"" is currently blind to what is best for business.

18257,/comment/18257,"I'm submitting this comment to voice my opposition to Bill 66.  My biggest opposition to the Bill is related to the inclusion of the proposed Schedule 10 of the plan, particularly the 'proposed open-for-business planning tool'.  I am deeply concerned about the ability of municipalities to adopt an open-for-business by-law which would allow the municipality to override provincial planning policies.  This is most troubling when it comes to the protection of the Greenbelt throughout Ontario.  The Greenbelt is a provincial planning document and would be under threat from municipalities is this Bill is adopted.  This government has already shown they are not-so secretly interested to free up this land for development, and are now using this tool to allow them to do so.  As stated in the sub points of the by-law proposal, municipalities could use the by-law to, I quote 'remove the requirement for decisions to strictly adhere to provincial policies and provincial plans'.  This means municipalities could overrule the Greenbelt plan and allow developers to build on the small amount of prime farmland we have left in Ontario.  This is something we should firmly stand against.
The Greenbelt was brought into place for many reasons, and almost all of them are good.  We should not risk threatening these lands by allowing municipalities to override the Greenbelt policies.  Throughout southern Ontario we already have a huge issue with inefficient and poorly developed cities with an unruly amount of sprawl.  Any urban planner would tell you this type of urban sprawl is bad for developing smart citites, bad for providing low-cost infrastructure, and bad for providing affordable public transit.  Any policy that would threaten the Greenbelt and lead to more sprawl must be stopped.  We need to smartly intensify our city, and this proposed by-law will simply allow developers to continue building cities in a way where urban sprawl is encouraged.
The Greenbelt is also vital for maintaining watersheds and having enough greenspace for water to be absorbed.  Throughout southern Ontario we have had huge issues with basement flooding in homes because there is not enough land to absorb water when it rains.  The Greenbelt helps to maintain green space and farmland so that there is more land to absorb water when it rains.  The proposed bill would allow for more sprawl on what is now vacant green space and farmland, which will only mean more headaches for homeowners as they are are more risk of flooding, and are likely to see their insurance claims increase as more homeowners put in flooding damage claims.
There are some parts of this Bill which are fine, but in its current state I think it should be stopped.  At a minimum, Schedule 10 should be removed to protect the Greenbelt.

18263,/comment/18263,"Dear Premier Ford;
I am writing on behalf of the 200+ members of a property owners’ association in eastern Ontario to voice our opposition to Schedule 10 of the government’s proposed Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act (Bill 66).
Our association is a strong advocate for the health and protection of the lakes, rivers, and surrounding lands in the region. In recent years we have pushed for shoreline restoration, fish habitat rehabilitation, and improved septic regulations.
Ontario lakes and ground water have been under increasing stress from development and shoreline land settlement, fewer forests and wetlands, and climate change, as well as invasive species like zebra mussels.
Now is not the time to bypass the acts and regulations that have been developed over the years to protect this most precious resource. Specifically, we oppose Schedule 10, which proposes an “open-for-business” planning bylaw allowing municipalities to approve development projects without conforming to the Clean Water Act and other protective acts developed after the Walkerton tragedy. This will lead to the degradation of the quality of drinking and bathing water, jeopardizing citizen health and safety once again. Furthermore, the bylaw abolishes public consultation and appeal processes on these development projects.
What you call “red tape” and “burdensome regulations” are in fact crucial protections developed through careful scientific study, grassroots consultation, and local oversight that help safeguard our lakes, rivers, and aquifers from the pressures of the future. We recognize the need to encourage economic growth but not at the expense of health and safety nor the future viability of our waterways. In addition to this unacceptable risk, the enormous economic benefits provided by Ontario’s lakes and rivers through recreational and tourism activities would be jeopardized.
A detailed legal analysis of the concerns raised by this bill is available in this report by the Canadian Environmental Law Association. http://www.cela.ca/sites/cela.ca/files/CELAlegalanalysis-Bill66andCWA.p…
We urge you to withdraw Schedule 10 in favour of a more thorough, balanced approach.

I support the concept that assigning land for development and assigning transfers of land between municipalities takes too long; this is causing serious delays to developing housing in a province where the lack of supply is driving up prices.
However, if the Bill or any plans put additional strain on water systems, then we must review and adjust any proposal. Our water systems are incredibly fragile and damage done is often permanent. All we need to do is look at the issues that First Nations communities are having when trying to get sustainable water for their communities. Water costs a lot to treat, to build treatment plants and distribution systems. If we damage the natural sources of water through development, the cost to provide water will go up and we may never be able to calculate how high those costs could get.
I want to see Ontario build more housing, but I do not want to see regulations that protect drinking water be undermined by a bill.

In particular to  “Remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, which allows municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act.”, is dangerous.
Humans as a species need to ultimately eat and drink in order to survive and if those resources are destroyed, it is unclear how the conservatives plan to provide for ALL the people in the province, not just the wealthy few whom you have crawled into bed with.
Also, my industry relies on natural spaces. People venture to my region for the freshwater lakes and green spaces. I am not too sure when the last time a Conservative MPP looked at a map or reviewed geographical concepts such as Watersheds -but as much as we might try to live our lives with separation, everything is actually connected. The rivers and streams in the Greenbelt areas connect to places like the Great Lakes Region, or the Saint Lawrence Seaway. If we allow factories and subdivisions into these areas, it is going to increase the risk of pollutants damaging our waterways.
My understanding that this will help get ""rid of the red tape"", well one of the reasons we have ""red tape"" is because people, unfortunately, make decisions either based on money or what they can get out of a situation. So businesses cannot be trusted to make the best environmental decisions. So we need regulations to help ensure that businesses are held accountable. What we need are more environmental incentives, more focus on developing sustainable and environmental solutions to our current problems. I think we can keep building, but where we have already built before rather than giving construction business blank cards in wide open spaces.
We as a civilization are at a critical time in the earth's history. We have little time to make life-saving changes for our environment. The conservative government should be striving to be a leader in this critical time, not setting it on fire faster.
The Greenbelt is home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage, we don't need that carved up with factories and subdivisions.

With the shortage of available farmland in Ontario, it behoves the Ford government to continue to protect major food sources for Ontarians.

18387,/comment/18387,"Hello,
I am the President of the Heron Park Community Association.  I shared the information on Bill 66 with membership of our community via a community meeting, e-mail and on our FaceBook page.  I did not receive any support for the proposal.  I did hear a lot of concern that the proposal short circuits local planning and zoning by-laws.
We are also members of the Federation of Community Associations. The membership of the FCA is also deeply concerned with the Bill.   We will also be urging our City Council to not request authority to access the provision of the Bill should it become law.
Below is a summary of concerns expressed.
-Short-circuiting the safeguards of the Planning Act, the Official Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement.
-Weakening of health, safety, and environmental protections.eg: the Walkerton Water crisis/tragedy from 2000-200.
Undermining core governance principles including:
o	(a) elimination of the requirement for public consultation, especially with respect to large, impactful, development proposals
o	(b) the loss of the right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal and from Ministerial decisions
o	(c) the creation of selective regulatory measures creating uncertainty for not only for prospective investors but for all Ontarians.
Bottomline:  The residents of Heron Park in Ottawa do not believe that Bill 66 is necessary to improve competitiveness in Ontario.  We believe that this Bill if it become law, threatens the quality of life and, undermines the key principles of responsible government of all residents in Ontario.  Bill 66 should be withdrawn.
Sincerely,
Linda Gama-Pinto

18392,/comment/18392,"It does not make any sense for a provincial government to cede control to municipalities for shared resources.  The whole point of environmental legislation being provincial is to allow unified standards across municipalities. If nothing else it contradicts the point of competition.  Competition requires a level playing field and not one where water and other shared resources can be utilized differently by different groups. Possible results could include cleanup costs to maintain access to a current resource or Walkerton type disasters.  If these are to avoided it will require increased taxes to support municipal coordination for something properly held under provincial control.  Or increased legal costs to fight detrimental actions by other municipalities in court.  None of this would improve competition long term.
Further, it makes no sense to change this type of law this way.  Individual municipalities should not be in the position where they can choose competition over the environment.  If environmental laws need revision then they should be revised in the context of environmental need and not municipal competition.  If you think the environmental laws are wrong you don't change them by passing responsibility to a lower level, less able level of government.  Govern responsibly by putting the changes you think are required up through a reasonable process.

Clean Water Act - it is inflexible for a reason.  If you are unsure why, google Walkerton. I will not say any more on this as it is an essential piece of legislation that needs to be protected at all costs
Planning Act and Provincial Policy Statement - The PPS, updated in 2014 includes Ontario's Indigenous communities for the first time.  This is a substantial movement forward for society and for the Indigenous peoples in Ontario, it is a recognition that they have traditionally lived in Ontario long before the Planning Act and the PC party.  To repeal the PPS is an insult to the Indigenous peoples of Ontario and needs to be further considered prior to just crumpling up the PPS and tossing in the trash bin.
Additionally, there are many municipalities in Ontario that are so far behind in meeting Ontario's Planning Act and PPS, they should already be considered ""open for business"". Rather, to the more savvy municipal planner, these municipalities are viewed as archaic backwaters of Ontario that have hindered their own progress and growth due to their lack of understanding of the PPS or general disregard.  Is that what we want for all of Ontario? My gut tells me that ignorance is not the way forward.
Additionally, the creation and institution of many pieces of legislation and policies and actually kept Ontario's economy growing.

18494,/comment/18494,"I am strongly opposed to Bill 66 particularly Schedule 10. Living close to the Oak Ridges Moraine for 36 years we have witness the destruction of natural land forms, kettle lakes, and Lake Simcoe  due to new sub division developments, industry, and infrastructure to support these developments.
Most development is not being built eco-friendly, nor are the roadways, and strip malls despite the existence of environmental technology and building methods - we know because we were determined to 'green' the improvements we made to our own property ( metal roof, on demand boiler operating in floor heat and hot water, reglazing windows rather than tossing into landfill, use of sustainable products including cork and bamboo flooring, switching to LED lights, low water toilets, european style appliances using less electricity and water, turning our yard into perennial gardens - mostly indigenous species to support insects and birds rather than grass, not paving the driveway, landscaping to retain rain water on site because our summers are increasingly drought like - none of our changes were subsidized by any level of government).
The provincial government needs to be responsible stewards and encourage citizens of Ontario to be as well. Unfortunately it seems the municipalities - the grass roots level of government is showing more responsible leadership lately in protecting the land, water and natural heritage. I am proud that my hometown of Aurora recently voted to not exercise the powers Schedule 10 of Bill 66 if passed will provide.
You will have no economy Mr. Ford if you continue to allow development where it will destroy more than it will support. Take a listen - can you hear the peepers (spring frogs) and bird song like we once use to? Can you see the stars at night through the light pollution? Does your glass of water taste like a spring fed creek? Does the air smell clean and crisp, or feel fresh on your skin?
Taking away the arable farmlands is tantamount to killing the soil, destroying woodlots, drying up ponds, rivers, and aquifers - causing increased cost of fresh local food which will be beyond the purchasing power of many citizens. This in turn will effect the health and welfare of citizens increasing health care costs. In fact it will affect all mammals, birds, reptiles, insects particularly the pollinators. Don't you remember learning about the food chain in elementary school Mr. Ford? Humans are at the top, but we are supported from below. Destroy the base and everything you supposedly say you care about comes tumbling down. Do better!!!!

The local Conservation Authorities, which monitor water flowing across municipal boundaries, must be given strengthened powers to decide issues in their jurisdictions, recognizing for example that wetlands are under major threat in the past few decades...given climate change concerns, they should err on the side of caution in any issue where there is increased chance of flooding from increasingly severe precipitation events.  Similarly, they must be responsible for species preservation within their watersheds, and may require improved tools to do this...genetic testing for species within flowing or wetland waters should be a priority.  Monitoring of pollutant chemicals within waterbodies should be supported by ample testing facilities for conservation authorities. Greenspace areas, such as the Greenbelt, cross Conservation Authority boundaries and hence require coordinated protection through provincial acts, such as listed in Schedule 10 of proposed Bill 66.

18512,/comment/18512,"The Green Belt legislation in Ontario (2005) is an inter-generational investment that transcends political terms of office and short term vested interests. It has its roots in the Progessive Conservative governments of the 1960s where the Design for Development programme introduced the Niagara Escarpment Planning Area and associated legislation, and the idea that the public has a legitimate interest in managing urbanization, suburban sprawl, costly low density residential development, scattered one-off commercial and other development, strip development, and related matters. The idea of a Parkway Belt and the so-called Zone 2 of a Toronto-Centred Region plan were adopted. Eventually, after nearly half a century Ontario brought in a Green Belt. The purpose of this is public benefit. Benefit through open space, secure farming foodlands, recreation spaces, relief from the pressures of a multi million population urban corridor (Bowmanville to Hamilton), deflection of growth opportunities to neighbouring urban complexes (e.g. KW-Cambridge-Guelph, Peterborough, Barrie-Orillia, Aurora-Newmarket), de-congesting the massive urban corridor, reducing highly inefficient and costly public infrastructure in low density development practices, enhancing the feasibility of high speed inter-urban transportation, protect precious headwaters, allow for alternative small town and rural settlement lifestyles, and many other benefits.
Any erosion of the Greenbelt is a public dis-benefit, a sad backward step in the progress of Ontario society. In this time of urgent action for climate change the last thing we should be doing is encouraging yet more urban sprawl, more car-based commuting, more concrete landscapes, more inefficient water and sewage infrastructure, and so on.To allow individual municipalities to incrementally erode this precious initiative is bordering on the criminally irresponsible.
Allowing private enterprise to put profit over public benefit is unconscionable. To assume that families in need of housing or other forms of accommodation can only get this by invading and consuming precious lands set aside for society's benefit is an insult, to them, and all of us. There is plenty of land set side for urban development in the Places to Grow Act (2005). There is plenty of land available in the designated cities and towns (e.g. Cambridge, Barrie). It has been demonstrated that millions of new Canadians and current citizens can be accommodated in the lands available  -  for the next 30 years, and more.
There is NO case whatsoever that says that reverting to the urban sprawl of the previous century is the only way to go. This proposed incremental destruction of the Greenbelt has no rational basis in evidence. As a specialist in area economic development for over 40 years I can confirm that it will do nothing for Ontario's competitiveness  -   nothing.
This is proposal is completely unacceptable.

Why is it that decisions that have dire ramifications for the environment, and future generations' access to and dependence on clean air, water and soil to produce nourishing food are couched in terminology that highlights what is presently ""good for business.""  Unfortunately, not long after the ""business"" benefits are squandered, the public and future generations are left to deal with the environmental legacies, many of which are toxic and long-lasting and worse yet, may be impossible to undo.  Considering the amount of input that has gone into quasi-""protection"" and how even that legislation is subject to repeated attempted and sometimes successful circumvention, we should be doing MORE to protect this earth's precious land, waters, rivers, watersheds, WETLANDS, soil, and air, not less.
Corporations, especially development corporations, are not PEOPLE.  Corporations know they will never have to account for what damage or destruction is done - they will forever PAVE PARADISE and PUT UP A PARKING LOT or HOUSES or whatever it is that they want to put up.
LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE, which is what the mandate of government is - to do the will of the people.  Disguised corporate donors to a political campaign should not have a voice that trumpets over the will of individual people, via a beholden government.  There are alternatives to providing increased housing and infrastructure on some of the best soils and protected land we have in this Province, that respect the rights of our fellow planet travellers, the myriad species at-risk or nearing extinction, for whom we the people, also must speak.  They don't have ""business"" interests and are thus run roughshod over or paid mere lip service, while we IRRETRIEVABLY lose species after species.
I hope that as many of my fellow constituents as can, take the time to make their voices heard.  It is not easy having to tackle governments, local or otherwise, that repeatedly, and over the din of protests, cave and cater to special interests and corporate bullying.  Let us learn from the mistakes of the past, and take a proactive, rather than reactive stance.  Protect what is there to protect, while it is still in its pristine natural state.
The roads to hell (California wildfire hell, Fort McMurray wildfire hell, and other hells, too numerous to mention) were contributed to by well-meaning but ill-advised ""OPEN FOR BUSINESS"" intentions.

EBR# 013-4293 input on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act
As a farm operator and forest landowner, I am writing to the Premier and Government of Ontario to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt, call back the Ontario legislature to work and introduce a new Bill 66 that stops the destructive and misguided attacks on the Greenbelt, Niagara Escarpment, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important farmlands, forests, wetlands and natural areas.
During the election campaign, you promised to protect the Ontario Greenbelt Plan and recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan making the same commitment to the people of Ontario. Bill 66 as proposed, related deregulation and Section 10 will undo the beneficial land use policies that guide smart and vibrant communities.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas with strategic marketing not urban sprawl. By building within existing towns and cities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in existing serviced communities while holding urban boundaries firm.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are being threatened with trade barriers. Farming and local food production is economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Urban sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farming communities.
Clean and abundant water is critical to both human and nature survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our environmental health, increases flooding, erosion problems and drought.
Forests, wetlands, natural areas and farmlands also provide healthy habitat for wildlife diversity, sequester carbon, mitigate the effects of climate change, provide open space and recreation opportunities and cleanse our air constantly and naturally.
Farmlands, forests, water and natural areas disappear forever in urban sprawl. Please keep your promise to serve Ontario with integrity and improve Bill 66.

18609,/comment/18609,"There is nothing to do with ""restoring competitiveness"" in the this bill at all. This is purely about de-regulating any and all development in the province. This bill bypasses virtually every environmental regulation in the province, which as a result, bypasses virtually every value citizens of Ontario hold dear with respect to the environment, in turn threatening our health, farmland, and natural spaces. For example
- The Greenbelt in place to protect valuable and productive farmland from development, so that it can continue contributing to Ontario's agriculture and grown-in-province food that we all enjoy. Ontario has some of the most productive farmland in Canada but is also losing it faster than anywhere else in the country. How is making it more vulnerable supposed to benefit the province? What happens if this happens everywhere? Without any kind of limit on development of agricultural land there's a very good possibility that we could lose our most valuable farmland. Not to mention arable land is being lost all over the world, so we would be absolutely insane to let such a valuable resource not be conserved. Bill 66 would completely undermine our ability to preserve the resource and all the social AND ECONOMIC  values it generates
- Drinking water protections would be bypassed, which would threaten the health of many Ontario residents. We have these in place to prevent contaminants that are difficult to treat in facilities from entering watersheds that we depend on for drinking water. Increased risk of contamination puts many communities health at risk and puts an even greater burden on our healthcare system. This could counteract any economic benefits accrued from development
- Communities value ecological features and green space, as well as the biodiversity contained within. Bill 66 would allow for protected areas to be opened up to development, threatening many species within the province. Once destroyed, these places and spaces will not be able to be replaced, and it threatens communities access to green space and nature areas. The government however sees no value in opportunities for outdoor recreation, nature appreciation, and the value of species to the ecosystem, and instead would rather see more unsustainable development be places haphazardly on the landscape. Elimination of habitat for species threatens many more of Ontario's species at risk blindly. There are plenty of reasonable places for development, there is no need to place them on habitat of species a risk that are important for their ecosystems, and valued by the people of Ontario. It also fails to consider the necessity of natural spaces for providing services to humans such as pollination, pest control, and keeping watersheds contaminant free at no cost to taxpayers.
The government seems to see considering these when planning development as ""inefficiencies"". What reasonable government considers the values of its citizens as ""inefficiencies""? Certainly not one that truly represents the people it governs. Therefore, I urge the government to reconsider bill 66 which will not improve Ontario in any substantial way. we already have robust policies to encourage the kind of business we want to grow in our economy, whilst also protect the ecological, cultural, and economic features on the landscape that we value. Instead, such a bill would only serve to benefit business, and not the people of Ontario, and would decrease our quality of life.

18612,/comment/18612,"To whom it may concern;
I have great concern about the proposed Bill 66.
The mere fact that this Bill directly attacks (yes, I'm using this term) the sections of the Clean Water Act(39) 2006, Greenbelt Act(7) 2005, Great lakes Protection Act(20) 2015 and thereby making them obsolete is a smack in the face of all the people and resources that went into making them. They were not created just to make development difficult, they were created with care and consideration of all parties involved, citizens present and future of this great Province. To have these provisions cast aside just to speed up development makes one head spin. Why? With unemployment at it's lowest in forty years, why try to speed up development at the cost of our natural environment? Has greed really taken us to this point?
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.
If you are truly a government ""for the people"", you will recall Bill 66.

I am writing you today to let you know that I am totally opposed to you weakening any environmental laws around the Greenbelt in Ontario. Any business development in the province has lots of options for land before taking over protected areas. The Greenbelt is currently home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage and needs further protection rather than any sort of development. We do not need it to be taken up with factories or further urban sprawl. We need to be creatively looking at further in fill of existing cities and towns as enough green space and farm land have been taken over. I believe that our communities, businesses and government have what it takes to develop and implement far more creative and sustainable solutions for development.

Additionally, the costs associated with the ecosystem services provided by the greenbelt, in particular water filtration by the Oak Ridges Moraine would be prohibitively costly to replace.  While I value the natural environment for its inherent value, it is also essential to note that these environments perform actions which we would have to replace with high tech infrastructure.

The Open for Business ByLaw (OfBB) will enable any municipality to forgo all regulations and Official Plans of Municipal, Regional and the Ontario governments.
The regulations, such as the Clean Water Act were enacted to protect the people of Ontario from another incident such as the Walkerton incident, where PEOPLE DIED. Other Ontario regulations have been instituted to protect the People and the Environment we all share, be it Air, Water or the Ground we grow food in. These regulations cannot be ignored nor by-passed at the whim of ANY government. They are there for the People of Ontario, ALL the PEOPLE!
REMOVE Schedule 10 and continue to protect the Ontario Environment and the People of Ontario.
Plans whether they be Official or not, whether they are Municipal, Regional or Provincial are the work of many government and non-government peoples who are focused on developing their respective lands in a manner that works for the community. One of the MANY benefits of OP's is in preventing conflicts between Commercial & Industrial (C&I) entities and the residents. It prevents C&I conflicts with institutions that are incompatible with operational aspects of C&I entities.
If Schedule 10 allows municipalities to ignore or bypass Official Plans, that can only result in generating conflicts and chaos within a community.
REMOVE Schedule 10 and continue to use the Official Plans (OP's) developed by thousands of hours of work to enable our communities to flourish in a cohesive manner.
SCHEDULE 5 - The Schedule amends the Toxics Reduction Act (TRA), 2009 to provide that the Act is repealed on December 31, 2021.
According to a Law Society of Upper Canada report: Given the high levels of release of toxic substances, carcinogens, and developmental/reproductive toxicants in the Ontario environment, and the failure of Ontario’s traditional pollution laws and CEPA 1999 to grapple effectively with that problem, which has had the effect of making the province one of the top emitters of such substances in North America, the expectation is that a law that focused primarily on reduction in the use and creation of such substances could improve environmental health in the province.
Under the “BENEFITS OF TOXICS REDUCTION""
• Based on the experience in other jurisdictions, the benefits of a toxics reduction regime in Ontario  include:
o Less pollution, leading to a cleaner environment and safer products;
o Reduction in public health risks, and contribution to safer and cleaner workplaces;
o Savings in money to companies through implementation of pollution  prevention plans;
o Promotion of cleaner, more innovative technologies and development of greener products;
o Lower compliance costs for companies and lower enforcement costs for government agencies; and
o Reduction in the need for further management of hazardous wastes.
Under CONCLUSIONS:
TRA focuses on pollution prevention, not pollution control as well as one that is information based, not command and control driven. The Act’s twin purposes of (1) preventing pollution and protecting human health and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances, and (2) informing Ontarians about toxic substances, is a story of success.
FROM MY EXPERIENCE:
This regulation was instrumental in moving the company I worked for, at the time, to eliminate several toxic substances from our process and site in general. Up until this regulation came into being, we were unmindful of specific toxins. As referred to above,  we were focused on emissions overall and emission controls, rather than looking at eliminating toxins at the source.
Lastly on TRA, the fact that the Auditor General of Ontario has chosen year in and year out, not to conduct an audit on the TRA, speaks to the efficiency/effectiveness of the Act.
Repealing this Act and it’s regulations is a significant step backward on reducing Toxic Emissions in Ontario, wherein we are the top emitter of Toxins in North America, as stated in the above submission by the Law Society of Upper Canada.
REMOVE Schedule 5.
SCHEDULE 2: The Schedule repeals the Pawnbrokers Act and makes a consequential amendment to the Personal Property Security Act.
Since the Pawnbrokers Act requires:
1) ALL items brought into a shop (even prior to an agreement to receive the item) is tracked and numbered.
2) employees to notify Police Services if they believe an item to be stolen.
Without such controls/requirements on Pawnbrokers, these establishments will be enabled to receive and sell stolen goods at will. Such an environment WILL result in increased burglaries, which will increase the workload for all Police Services of Ontario, including the Court Systems that support them in upholding the Laws of Theft.
There can be NO GOOD to come from repealing this Act.
REMOVE Schedule 2.
SCHEDULE 7:  Ministry of Government and Consumer Services - Technical Standards and Safety Act (TSSA), 2000
The TSSA is focused on ensuring Natural Gas, Propane and other fuel equipment is being operated and maintained in a responsible manner. It came to being following a massive explosion, which I cannot remember where. Mississauga?
My concerns with this Schedule are:
1) The removal of any application for the ""upholstered or stuffed articles” industry. There have been countless incidents of upholstered or stuffed articles causing deaths or exposures to toxic chemicals originating in jurisdictions that are not controlled by Ontario let alone Canada. It is this control that is gained by having such items covered under the TSSA.
2) The addition throughout the TSSA of the words “alternate rules”.
Allowing the Director of the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to develop an ""alternate rule"" for various parts of the Act. This weakens the Act, by allowing alternate rules to be put into effect without Legislative approval and circumvents the intent of the Act in the first place.

This is a shame. It is unforgivable to be leaving the next generation with a planet that is carved to pieces by industry.
On the contrary, at this point we must urgently respond to climate change in a global, systemic way. Not just for us, but for all other life on earth.
We need to intensify our cities, reduce our consumption as a species, protect as much of the remaining natural areas that we have left as possible, and much more. In terms of protection, this includes the greenbelt. Bill 66 must not pass.
Earth overshoot day last year was August - in 8 months we consumed more than the planet can replenish in a year. I will not write an essay here, but it must be entirely clear that this is a moral issue, and this is not an issue we can ignore. It is for all life that we must act on this however we can. We are certainly on the precipice of ecological collapse.
We need the natural systems upon which we depend, and that means curtailing growth. Do not open the greenbelt for business.

18709,/comment/18709,"I find so many issues with this bill. First of all, the bill summary states that they want to cut ""unnecessary regulations"". Why are regulations unnecessary? Note that many researchers have spent years developing methodology and careful data collection to put these regulations in place. How could a we just decide that those careful research projects are unnecessary? After all, government funds a lot of these projects because they found these regulations necessary at some point.
This bill can have big negative impacts on the biodiversity and the habitats in the area. Nature cannot argue back at the decisions made by this bill. That is why policies like the Provincial Policy Statement are in place. Without these, what is to stop us from overlooking environmental impacts for economical benefits? It seems as if this bill is taking us backwards. I do not need to remind the people of many human disasters that occurred due to the lack of regulations. We need to co-exist with the environment rather than trying to destroy it for money. We are extracting every bit we can from the environment at a rate that the environment cannot regenerate on. Human populations are growing at a fast rate, so I understand that we will need more landmass to survive. However, this can quickly turn into a slippery slope where we overlook the harm on the environment for the sake of our development. We will be known as the generation that decided human economy is more important than the environment we depend on.

18712,/comment/18712,"I am writing as an Ontario resident, I live in Toronto, and I am writing as someone who is really coming to know and experience more and more of Ontario’s Green Belt. Having watched the rate of urban development of Toronto and surrounding areas over the last 10 years, I am alarmed to hear of the proponents in this bill that would allow businesses to ignore rules outlined in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act.  And shocked to hear that this bill could allow the Greenbelt to be opened up for industrial development and urban sprawl.
The Greenbelt protects 2 million acres of Ontario farmland, forests, and nature.  It protect what are some of the places that make Ontario such the special place that it is on the planet.  Those spaces and getting to know those spaces is what makes me proud to be an Ontarian.  I don’t need to go to exotic places. Getting to be in those forests, I am filled with Awe.  I feel good.  I learn about the seasons, I learn about the plants that grow there, about trees.  I learn about the forces of water moving in a river.
Forest lands and Nature Spaces are so important. They have a huge value. As a resident of Ontario, I am telling you that I want my government to hold these spaces as important.
To be able to walk in those kinds of places, whether it’s Rattlesnake point, or the mono cliffs, or some other of the many places where animals, birds, and plants live in dynamic eco-systems.  Where other species have lived for thousands and thousands of years.  Where rocks hold the history of what came at the beginning.   I value the eco-systems and the species that live in those places.
In our day and age, I look to those spaces for sources of inspiration.  And I am moved to want to protect them.  And if this bill is pushed, I will fight it.
There are so few green spaces left, especially in Southern Ontario.  To think that this bill would put the little that is left in jeopardy, fills me with sadness and outrage.
It is a kind of madness that would allow those greenspaces to be lost, for money.  What will be lost would be far greater than any money could buy.   There are many other ways that business can be stimulated in Ontario communities, that don't involve irreparable damage to our greenspaces.

Not sure you've noticed, but we haven't had snow in Toronto for the past 4 years - no tobogganing and other winter joys. Expanding concrete, asphalt and carbon based industry will reduce one of Ontario's most prized possessions - nature!
Studies show that mental health of people surrounded by nature is statistically significantly better, which leads to more energy and better productivity.
This is not for the people, this law serves to better rich developers - please stop it!

The environment is under tremendous pressure at this time and humans as a species are contributing to environmental degradation at an alarming and unsustainable rate.  Reducing our carbon output and encouraging the growth of carbon absorbing plants and vegetation should be our priority.  To change any laws such as the Greenbelt Act is short sighted.  So called economic growth has to be measured against its environmental impact.  The environment is our most precious commodity.  It is what sustains us.  We should be strengthening the laws and preserving the natural environment.  There are many areas our all of our major urban centres that are neglected and under utilized and could be redeveloped for industry and urban growth.  It may cost more to develop these than building a subdivision in a corn field, but that is the price we should accept.  Air to breathe and food to sustain us and habitat for other species, this should be the priority.

Those provisions are there for a reason: to protect a valuable green belt that everyone - rich, poor, conservative, or liberal, needs to survive.

18829,/comment/18829,"Bill 66 is not a step forward but rather a leap backwards. ""Cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date."" is a joke to say the least - since when has the health of Canadians and the Canadian Environment (which we all depend on) become unnecessary to protect and properly manage? Everything depends on the environment and the resources we are able to obtain from it and this can be done in sustainable and safe ways. The current legislation that Bill 66 is proposed to override helps ensure just that. Inefficient and inflexible development of projects and urban development is something I am willing to live with if it ensures that drinking water, wetlands, woodlands, valley lands, species at risk habitat, green infrastructure, natural areas, the greenbelt, and entire watersheds are properly planned for sustainable living. Don't forget that all things in this world depend on the environment - if it is damaged, so too will the health of Canadians.

18835,/comment/18835,"I am strongly opposed to Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018).
I have two fundamental objections.
Firstly, Bill 66 is, in effect, a so called “omnibus bill”.  I am philosophically opposed to the passage of any omnibus bill. This bill will affect over a dozen disparate policy areas, including those as diverse and unrelated as pension legislation, environmental protection, and even the regulation of pawnbrokers as just a few examples.  Why, I ask myself, are all of these unrelated topics dealt with in a single bill?  What is the purpose?  The common thread?  The title of the bill mentions competitiveness, but I fail to understand how any changes to the regulation of pawnbrokers can possibly have any significant positive effect on Ontario’s competitiveness.  Maybe I am wrong and we will see new pawn shops opening up on every street corner once this legislation is passed.  But I doubt it.  No. This is simply an example of an omnibus bill intended to ram through policy change with as much camouflage and as little comment and understanding as possible.  Shame on this Government for proposing it.  Shame on any member of the Legislature who supports it.
I am even more concerned with Section 10 of this Bill which will allow local governments to pass bylaws which neuter important health, safety, and environmental protections provided by a host of other Acts currently in force.
Incredibly, this Bill will allow local governments to pass bylaws that allow commercial interests to supersede provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act – provisions that are in place solely to protect both the environment in general and human health in particular.  I am absolutely astonished and more than a little angry that this government is willing to forgo strict protection of clean water sources in order to satisfy commercial interests.  Clean water is not simply a nice to have.  It is essential.  The provisions of Bill 66 which enable an “Open for Business” bylaw to skate around legislation created specifically to protect our water supplies must not be enacted.
Maybe this Government has forgotten Walkerton?  I can assure you that the public has not.  Colour that one blue.  We remember whose watch that happened on.
Granted, Bill 66 does require that the Minister of Planning approve any “Open for Business” bylaw and it allows the Minister to impose conditions that might protect the environment or human health.  But I ask myself, why would I trust that the Minister will have protection of my health and the environment in mind when considering a proposed “Open for Business” bylaw?  The fact that the Bill even contemplates allowing commercial interests to escape the provisions of the Clean Water Act makes it obvious to me that the current Government has no such interest.  This is hugely concerning to me.
This Bill allows passage by a municipal government of legislation which would render the Greenbelt Act impotent, thereby threatening the preservation of a unique environmental resource in southern Ontario.  This does not improve Ontario’s competitiveness.  What jurisdiction is Ontario competing with for the Green Belt builders’ dollar? We aren’t.  This is all about helping developers, those with the resources to lobby politicians, to profit.
More generally, the bylaws contemplated by this bill will also allow development that runs in the face of approved development plans and zoning provisions.  What is the point of such plans and provisions if, with the stroke of a pen, they can be abrogated?  Why, if a proposed development is a good idea, would the local municipality not simply convene, openly discuss, and vote to change the plan and the zoning as needed?
Bill 66 provides the answer.  Deep within the bill are provisions which permit the passage of the “Open for Business Bylaw” without any prior public notice and without any consultation at all.  In other words, the bylaw can be crafted and enacted entirely in secret.  This is not efficiency.  It is not “government by the people.”  It is government behind closed doors.  The fact that the proposed legislation also gives the Minister of Planning the ability to unilaterally order changes to the “Open for Business” bylaw without public notification or consultation, changes which could easily be ordered to please the Minister’s “friends”, adds yet another layer of decision making secrecy.
Government in secret by is offensive.  I can see only one reason why my provincial Government would go out of its way to facilitate decision making behind closed doors.  Quite simply, it stinks of catering to special interests.  It will enable, and even encourage, lobbying by rich commercial interests who will use their financial might to overwhelm the broader public interest.  While the lobbying goes on, the public will be left in the dark until the damage is done.  This Bill creates a situation that is extremely vulnerable to graft.  It is tailor made to encourage and facilitate influence peddling.  And even if the Government is not actually caught selling influence, voters of all political stripes will simply assume that it goes on.   Why else would the Provincial Government want to pass such legislation?
To add icing to the cake, the proposed legislation provides that decisions are final and cannot be appealed.  What are we to think?
And to top it all off, the fine print of the proposed bill provides that should any other pieces of legislation be deemed “red tape” in the planning process, they can be added, again in secret, by Cabinet, to the list of laws that need not apply to an “Open for Business” bylaw. These additions need not pass through the legislature, need not be discussed in public, and cannot be appealed.  This is simply incredible.  It is a blatant attempt to give this Government a blank cheque.  It smacks of despotism.
So, in summary, we are faced with a Bill which:
•	Is crafted as an omnibus Bill which, because of its omnibus nature, discourages rational and open discussion of the proposed course of action by the public.
•	Gives those who can afford to lobby and “influence” municipal politicians for personal gain a tailor made ability to do so;
•	Allows them to do so behind closed doors;
•	Makes it simultaneously easier and more worthwhile (ie. profitable) for commercial interests to “influence” the Minister of Planning, also in secret;
•	Enables those “influenced” politicians to pass a bylaw to allow those commercial interests to silently skate around “inconvenient health, safety, environmental, and planning regulations;
•	Allows those politicians to do so in secret, without seeking any public input whatsoever from those whose health and way of life will be affected;
•	Allows those bylaws to be crafted and enacted in secret, without even informing the public that such a bylaw is contemplated; and
•	When the public finally finds out that their health and the welfare of their environment has been sacrificed on the altar of greed, allows those who have been “influenced” to simply say, “Sorry, it’s the law.  Can’t change things now.”
•	Allows the Government, without consultation or prior notice, to add any other existing law to the list of those which are deemed “inconvenient” for commercial interests and which therefore need not be complied with.
This is not government for the people.  It is government for the friends of politicians at the expense of the public. It is despicable.
The only competition Section 10 of Bill 66 is going to facilitate is developers’ competition for the ears of politicians.  It would have been more honest to call it “An Act to Keep Our Developer (and Pawnbroker) Friends Sweet and Promote the Financial Welfare of the Party in Power.”

Agriculture in the Greater Golden Horseshoe employs 38,000 people and gross output of farms is $11 billion, that’s $1.7 billion in tax revenue for all three levels of government. The Greenbelt provides $3.2B annually in services to the region, such as recreational activities and flood protection. It was created in 2005 to deliberately limit the rapid urban sprawl that was encroaching on land that is both environmentally and economically significant.
The Greenbelt has the capacity to store as much carbon dioxide as would be emitted by 33 million cars a year. Interfering with that crucial ecosystem means missing out on a chance to reduce our emissions and meet climate targets.
Greenbelt development is unnecessary for economic development. A recent Neptis Foundation study found more than 125,000 hectares of land in the GTA is currently available to accommodate growth through to 2031 and beyond.

There is no limit to the desires of developers to make money. That is why there is a role for government. Good governments use more than money to make responsible decisions. Good governments don't let drivers drive as fast as they want to. For the same reason good governments do not let developers make as much money as they want to.

18876,/comment/18876,"Dear Mr. Helfinger:
The Municipality of North Perth appreciates the opportunity to provide comment and contribute to the discussions regarding the ‘Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act’.
Staff has reviewed the legislation and it is our understanding that the tool would allow municipalities to reduce planning approvals for specific areas of land already allocated/identified by the municipality for new, major employment opportunities (e.g. 50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000 people).
The “Open for Business By-law” would eliminate the need for the employer to strictly adhere to existing local requirements (e.g., official plan and zoning), and remove the application of a separate approval process for site plan control.
This By-law is targeted to municipalities that have designated industrial/employment lands that have remained vacant/undeveloped, and if a large employer was interested in establishing operation there; a municipality that has activated the By-law may streamline the process and remove the ‘red tape’.
The Municipality has concern regarding the fairness of adopting the “Open for Business By-law” as it may give one municipality an advantage over another who has not adopted the By-law at the expense of health and safety (i.e. ensuring fire requirements, SWM, etc. are secured through site plan) and environmental regulations.
Municipalities are challenged with the task to decide whether to opt in and potentially remain competitive with a neighbouring municipality or maintain the current regulatory system that essentially has checks and balances.
The Province should maintain a uniform system for all 144 Ontario municipalities and not provide an opportunity for some to opt in, while other municipalities opt out. This will undoubtedly put municipalities in a tough situation when making a decision to adopt the Open for Business By-law.
The Province has not provided enough detail for municipalities to see any clear benefits to this legislation and have not allowed enough time for suitable feedback. Various stakeholder groups will undoubtedly pressure councils in different directions and this can have the effect of taking-up administrative time to research implications/benefits to municipalities, prepare reports, etc. The Province should implement additional review, outside of the commenting period.
Finally, we are concerned that if we decided to ‘opt out’, industries/employers may start short-listing municipalities based on whether or not they have Open for Business By-laws when seeking lands in municipalities.
If Bill 66 is enacted, the Province should initiate a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan to determine the success and failures of the legislation.
We do appreciate the opportunity to comment.

Dear Mr. Helfinger,
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
The Parry Sound Nature Club strongly opposes several aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. We disagree with the Government of Ontario’s contention that Bill 66 cuts “unnecessary” and “out of date” regulations (ERO posting 013-4293). This is patently not true in the case of Schedule 10 which introduces “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical requirements under several laws that are designed to protect water, natural heritage and human health and well-being and to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in land-use decisions.
We outline our concerns below and trust that they will be considered with respect to all three relevant ERO postings (i.e., 013-4293, 013-4125, 013-4239).
Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent fundamental protections for environmental and human health.
The Government of Ontario claims that Bill 66 will “make Ontario more competitive by cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date” (ERO 013-4293). To this end it intends to allow municipalities to pass open-for-business by-laws so that they can permit land-uses “without having to strictly adhere to existing local requirements (e.g., official plan and zoning)” (ERO 013-4125). Both government statements are misleading. The laws, plans and policies that will be sidestepped through open-for-business by-laws are neither unnecessary nor out of date. Nor are they simply “local requirements.” As outlined in the table below, open-for-business by-laws would override requirements to be consistent with many of Ontario’s key planning laws and policies recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation.
Key requirements that will be overridden in seven of the ten laws listed in Schedule 10
Law listed under Schedule 10 of Bill 66 	Requirements that would not apply to an open-for-business by-law	Timing of the passing or most recent revision of specific law, plan or policy
Planning Act, Subsection 3 (5)	This section requires the decisions of municipalities and others (boards, ministers, government agencies) to be consistent with policy statements and provincial plans. This includes Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) requirements regarding natural heritage protection, water features protection, active transportation, climate resiliency etc.	The Provincial Policy Statement was revised in 2014 following five years of in-depth public consultation.
Planning Act, Section 24	This section requires public works and by-laws to be consistent with municipal official plans.	Municipal official plans are to be reviewed at least every five years, with community consultation.
Planning Act, Subsections 34 (10.0.0.1) to (34)	These subsections set out requirements for public engagement in order to amend a zoning by-law, including public notice, public consultation and opportunities for appeal.
Clean Water Act, 2006, Section 39  	This section requires land-use planning decisions (municipal, provincial and others) to conform to the significant threat policies and Great Lakes policies adopted in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water. It also requires public works, municipal by-laws and provincial approvals to be consistent with the significant threat policies. 	Since the law came into effect in 2007, communities across Ontario have been developing source protection plans, with public input required.
Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, Section 20	This section requires planning decisions to conform with designated policies in “geographically focused initiatives,” a tool that allows communities to solve complex problems to protect or restore the ecological health of the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River basin.	The law was passed in October 2015.
Greenbelt Act, 2005, section 7	This section requires that planning decisions conform to the Greenbelt Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the Greenbelt Plan.	The Greenbelt Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Section 6	This section requires that planning decisions conform with designated policies of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan. It requires that in cases where policies in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan conflict with other provincial plans or policies, that which provides the greatest level of protection for the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed will prevail.	The law was passed in 2008.
Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, section 7	This section requires that planning decisions conform with the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the plan.	The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Places to Grow Act, 2005, Subsection 14 (1)	This section requires that planning decisions comply with the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario.	The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
The potential negative impact of open-for-business by-laws is far-reaching and profound. In each case they would override key operative provisions in the laws listed in Schedule 10, undermining fair and consistent application of laws and policies designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage, farmland and watershed health across Ontario, and leaving communities open to unchecked development. For example, policies that would not apply in open-for-business by-law areas include:
•	Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems);
•	Those protecting provincially significant wetlands, woodlands and valley lands and habitat of species at risk;
•	Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency;
•	Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
•	Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
•	Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed;
•	Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water.
Open-for-business by-laws would eliminate opportunities for public input on planning decisions.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, open-for-business by-laws would bypass legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act) designed to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land-use decisions in our communities. Open-for-business by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
Further, Bill 66 would allow Cabinet (not the Legislature) to add other legal provisions to the list of those in Schedule 10 to be circumvented by open-for-business by-laws, an approach which limits opportunities for transparent public consideration and debate.
Finally, we question whether there is demand from municipalities for open-for-business by-laws, ostensibly proposed by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 at Queen’s Park many municipalities indicated that they have a surplus of employment lands and would like to see these repurposed for residential. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal leaders (e.g., in Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about open-for-business by-laws and the circumvention of laws that protect drinking water, farmlands and natural areas and ensure public input and transparency in decision-making.
Concluding remarks
From Kenora to Toronto and Ottawa to Windsor, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. Open-for-business by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely. Bill 66 would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment and the health of our communities. Ontarians do not want another disaster like Walkerton, when over 2,000 people fell ill and seven died as a result of a failure to safeguard the local water system. Environmental deregulation, budget cuts and staffing reductions were all identified as major contributing factors in that tragedy.
We urge the government to avoid similar mistakes and to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.
Yours truly,

18883,/comment/18883,"I am deeply concerned about the contents of this bill with respect to the protection of Ontario's heritage.
Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers. Archaeology gives a voice to many who have been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.

Ornamental horticulture serves a variety of industries by growing and marketing plants: Floral industries, greenhouses, and turf industries rely on the continued work conducted by ornamental horticulturalists; golf courses and other landscaping industries for private and public spaces also rely heavily on these professionals. By amending the Agricultural Employees Protect Act (AEPA), the Government of Ontario is not only threatening the jobs of those who work in ornamental horticulture, but the Government is also threatening jobs in a multitude of other industries that rely on ornamental horticulture for survival.
Child care is one of the most difficult issues facing families today; however, reducing regulations on home-based child care providers and allowing for additional children is not the way to solve the problem of affordable child care in Ontario. Private home-based child care facilities have been more heavily regulated in recent years due to tragic events that have befallen children in their care. In 2013, 2 year-old Eva Ravikovich died under the supervision of a home daycare provider. The issue of unlicensed home child care providers is very alarming and ought to be restricted. In fact, University of Toronto researchers discovered a disproportionate number of deaths occurring in unlicensed home child care providers. The Government of Ontario should be taking the safety and security of children very seriously by ensuring that there is necessary oversight and possible restrictions placed on home child care providers--as opposed to offering incentives as a way to solve affordable child care in Ontario. If the Government is serious about tackling affordable child care in Ontario, then the Government has to bring in better legislation that caps or reduces the cost of child care and/or offer substantial government subsidies to families to ensure they can attain safe child care and not break the bank at the same time.
Employment standards are extremely important. I understand the need to keep business and companies happy in order to secure more job creation and growth. I fail to understand why posting the Employment Standards Act (ESA), would jeprodize that goal. The amendment to remove the posters seems trivial at best and worrisome for new employees who may not be clear on what the ESA entails. All employees have rights, and their rights need to be respected. Removing posters, which in turn removes the information available, is akin to limiting and/or potentially censoring that information that needs to be available to all employees. I also fail to understand why this is even an issue. Have businesses been terribly inconvenienced by having to post the ESA? Has their business declined since the installation of these posters? What is the real reason for this amendment? If I did not know any better, I would hazard to say that it is to ensure that employees are less aware of their rights thus allowing employers to act in ways that may be in contravention to the ESA.

18890,/comment/18890,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation. This correspondence only deals with Schedule 10 of Bill 66. I’m reviewing this from a perspective of a recently retired practising municipal planner who before his retirement actively participated in planning and development matters in Ontario since 1980.
I am uncertain as to the intent of Schedule 10. There is already a process in place for a Minister’s zoning order process (section 47 of the Planning Act) to deal with urgent business opportunities that may not quite align with all government rules and requirements. From past examples in Ontario, the process of implementation involves local municipal decision-makers. If there is something within this process that the provincial government finds problematic, I would urge modification to this existing legislation.
I find the proposal being put forward quite problematic for several reasons:
1) Developers need assurances on what is permissible to build in certain locales; uncertainties in the ‘development game’ such as revising development scenarios as being suggested here do not assist the situation.
2) Planning by its nature is a multi-jurisdictional and multi-stakeholder endeavour working in both local and regional conditions. This contemplated process puts various players potentially at odds with one another which can undermine trust  – local municipalities striving for increased assessment within their own borders; local government agencies  that will have differing planning/operating objectives at upper/lower tier circumstances as well as regional Public Health, Conservation Authority, Transportation  entities; the public who want to be a part of the process to develop their communities.
3) Definitions on terms such as population thresholds, employees generated, etc. appear to be quite arbitrary. Also mechanisms to implement employment jobs in a given area through planning rules is quite problematic, e.g., full/part time definitions, on- versus off-site jobs.
At its core, I’m unsure what the purpose of the proposed legislation is – it duplicates the existing minister’s order process and gives an impression to repudiate the purpose of other standing gov’t legislation in place, i.e., what is the purpose of other government air, water and land stewardship legislation if the proposal’s intent is to circumvent the protection of community living standards and environmental protections. Overall, this proposal leaves you with the impression that the government is governing in needless circles and simply adding to taxpayers’ expense.
To supplement my perspective, and without adding needless word duplication here, I would urge you to consider the positions of the following municipalities (reports under separate cover): Waterloo Region, January 8, 2019; City of Guelph, January 14, 2019.

It is unacceptable to consider allowing the Greenbelt to be opened up for industrial development and urban sprawl.
The Greenbelt protects 2 million acres of Ontario farmland, forests, and nature.  It protects many of the places that make Ontario such the special place that it is on the planet.  Having access to the recreational use of those spaces and knowing they are protected makes me proud to be an Ontarian.

The Kearney Watershed Environmental Foundation has a number of concerns regarding Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
This Bill proposes to make changes to provincial policy and law in a variety of administrative departments; many of which affect the future environmental sustainability of our province.
KWEF would like to comment on Schedule 10, #013-4239,  the Open for Business Bylaw, and Schedule 5,#013-4234 and #013-4235,  the changes to the Toxic Reductions Reporting Requirements
SCHEDULE 10 , 013-4239- Bill 66 : the Open for Business Bylaw under the Planning Act
The changes under this section of the Bill  lack specific guidelines and regulations. It is unwise for the legislation to be passed ; and for the specifics to be decided later.
According to the Association of Municipalities Ontario, this OFB Bylaw, Under Section 6 of Section 10:
“ would allow a municipal council to decide whether or not they wish to implement any of the environmental policies found in the following instruments in their OFB By-law
•	The Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and municipal Official Plans made pursuant to the Planning Act;
•	Drinking Water Source Protection Plans prepared under the Clean Water Act, 2006;
•	Great Lakes Protection Initiatives made pursuant to the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015;
•	The Green Belt Plan promulgated under the Greenbelt Act, 2005;
•	The Lake Simcoe Protection Plan promulgated under the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008;
•	The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan pursuant to the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001.
•	A Policy Statement made pursuant to the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016. “[1]
The AMO states that Bill 66 “ raises questions about achieving economic gains may result in long term environmental concerns”.  ( www.amo.on.ca)
.
Ontario is fortunate to have one of the most plentiful, safe water supplies in the world. The protections in place under the various pieces of legislation listed above help to ensure this and should be maintained intact.
A Municipality’s Official Plan is developed with much consultation with the public and reflects the intent of the Council and the populace it serves.  The proposal   to circumvent adherence to the Municipality’s Official Plan and to remove any recourse by the residents undermines the responsibility of elected officials to represent the voters, and the intent of an Official Plan.
Under Schedule 5, #013-4234 and #013-4235:
 The proposal to reduce, and in the case of certain facilities, to remove altogether the obligation to report toxic substances  in 2019 is based on the premise that the Federal Chemicals Management Plan will come into effect in 2021. This is premature and  is ill advised. Allowing facilities exemption from creating a toxic reporting and reduction plan whether they are reporting on a new toxic substance under an existing requirement, or are new to the program is folly. Making implementation of the plans voluntary negates the whole idea of reducing toxins.
Bill 66 , Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018  should not be hastily pushed through the legislature. The details should be carefully considered and clearly outlined BEFORE this wide-ranging legislation is passed, and the public response period should be extended to allow the public to respond once clear specific guidelines are developed.

Government needs to step up with an overall plan to develop these wastelands instead of allowing municipalities to act in silos, doing whatever they want.
Make the people move to jobs, instead of creating jobs on prime farmland and sensitive ecosystem areas.  Just because someone wants to live somewhere doesn't mean we should create a job for them there.

18943,/comment/18943,"Lambton Public Health respectfully does not support the passing of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario's Competiveness Act, 2018, as it will have potential adverse effects to public and environmental health in Ontario. Please accept the following comments regarding our concerns with this Bill.
Schedule 5: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks
Although there may be some overlap between the provincial Ontario's Toxic Reduction Plan and the federal Chemical Management Plan in toxic reductions, it appears that the provincial legislation was more advanced in its mandate. Concerns with repelling of the Toxic Reduction Act and its Regulations include:
•	There would no longer be new or reviewed plans for toxic substances reduction planners to provide necessary recommendations.
•	There would be an exemption for certain facilities from all future planning and reporting obligations for certain substances.
•	There would be less emphasis on reducing the use and the creation of prescribed toxic substances.
•	Public transparency would be lost. The Toxic Reduction Act had a more in depth reporting mechanism.
Schedule 10: Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing
The ""open-for-business planning bylaw"" will:
•	Allow different types of developments within previously protected areas, such as Source Water Protection Areas, which could threaten ground water and surface water resources.
•	Allow developments, such as industry, in or near sensitive land use areas (such as residential developments), which could have a negative impact on air quality.
•	Have a negative impact on the natural and built environment.
•	Decrease the preservation of greenspaces.
The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care published the Healthy Environments and Climate Change Guidelines under the Ontario Public Health Standards. This Guideline ""is intended to assist boards of health to develop approaches for promoting healthy built and natural environments to enhance population health and mitigate environmental health risks"". The proposed changes to Planning Act and the introduction of the ""Open-for Business"" by-law would hinder or make it more difficult for Public Health Units to collaborate with local municipalities in developing effective strategies to reduce exposure to health hazards and promote healthy built and natural environments when they are developing/reviewing their plans for infrastructure, zoning, land-use, etc.
Prior to amending the Planning Act, please consider what the health benefits of a well-designed community based on provincial policies which are:
•	Better air quality;
•	Protected drinking water supplies;
•	Availability of locally grown foods (food security);
•	Reduced urban heat island; etc.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment and your consideration of our feedback.
Please consider the impacts on the public health and safety of residents of Ontario prior to Bill 66 proceeding through the legislative process.

18945,/comment/18945,"I have reviewed the proposed legislative changes referred to as ‘Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act, 2018’ or Bill 66.  Of great concern to me are the changes which are detailed in:
Schedule 5 – Repealing legislation which (a) prevents pollution and protects human health and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and (b) informs Ontarians about toxic substances.
In my opinion, Ontario should try to attract businesses which are willing to abide by the Toxic Reduction Act, 2009, NOT the ones which want to circumvent this legislation.
Schedule 7 – Repealing legislation which protects consumers who enter into agreements with suppliers for wireless services accessed from a cellular phone, a smart phone or any other similar mobile device.
The Wireless Services Agreements Act, 2013 was passed as a result of the gouging and the penalties that the wireless service providers were imposing and the public outcry that resulted.  It provides additional protection to the federal legislation, including the capping of cancellation fees and the right to file class action lawsuits against wireless companies.  Ontario consumers want the additional protection that this act provides.
Schedule 9 – No longer requires employers to post information about the Employment Standards Act, 2000 describing rights of employees.
-	It repeals the 60 hour per week cap, allowing employees to work excessive hours, resulting in safety and health related issues.
-	It allows employers to average hours to avoid overtime pay without approval of the Director of Employment Standards
Ontario should be attracting employers who treat their employees with respect and do not try to circumvent the Employment Standards Act.  These legislative changes do not in any way improve the competitiveness of Ontario businesses.
Schedule 10 – Allows municipalities to pass a bylaw overriding policies to protect water, natural heritage, farmland, human health and well-being.
This is the scariest schedule in Bill 66 and it can be passed without public notice, behind closed doors.  Decades of work that has gone into protecting Ontarians will be overturned.  In addition, it would leave citizens without recourse.
It allows for urban sprawl everywhere in Ontario but also in the Green Belt.  These lands are intended to be used as farmland, providing food for Ontarians in the future.  Protection of these lands is of utmost importance.
Municipalities across Ontario are currently declaring that they will NOT be passing the ‘open-for-business’ bylaw.  But to have even one municipality pass the bylaw could easily affect all Ontarians in an extremely negative way.  If the Great Lakes waters are not protected, it will affect millions of Ontarians, as it is a major source of drinking water.
As far as I am concerned, schedule 10 in the legislation is NOT “FOR THE PEOPLE”, it only benefits developers.  It is legislation that is “FOR THE ELITE”.  Ontarians have worked hard to create all the legislation that is “FOR THE PEOPLE”, and we do not want this work to be in vain.

""The Greenbelt preserves farmland and greenspace essential for naturally filtering water and preventing flooding, not to mention critical habitat for many of Ontario’s endangered species. It also helps to combat climate change by storing 86.6 million tonnes of carbon. The Greenbelt provides approximately $2.6 billion annually in environmental services.
Protection also makes financial sense. Food and farming in the Greater Golden Horseshoe contributes $12.3 billion to the economy and creates 212,000 jobs.  Over 7,000 of these farms are found in the Greenbelt, including half of Ontario’s fruit farms and one fifth of our vegetable farms.

18957,/comment/18957,"I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 66 for a number of reasons. I might also add that the guile and haste with which it was introduced and then giving such a brief opportunity for submissions, is very objectionable.  I oppose this overarching bill for several reasons, not the least of which how it will impact our environment in profound ways, specifically Schedule 5 and Schedule 10.
•	It will threaten our drinking water
•	It will threaten that which Ontario is renowned for - its pristine landscape including the wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk
•	The ‘open for business’ bylaws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement which would no longer apply.
•	It threatens farmland which would lead to more urban sprawl.  Nobody wants to live, work or play in an ugly setting which could be determined by developers, but rather, a safe, planned community.  We can’t rely on them to preserve not only our heritage but our children’s, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren’s heritage.  Not only would the Provincial Policy Statement be overridden, but the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan would also be overridden by this Bill.  Once the decision has been made to develop a particular area, it’s permanent.  There’s no going back.
•	Transparency and public engagement would be compromised – even more so since the questionable decision of dismantling the Environmental Commission of Ontario.  Contrary to current legal requirements, the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors, further undermining the sacred checks and balances of our political system.
•	With the knowledge of how toxic chemicals have already compromised human health and the environment, i.e. mesothelioma and Grassy Narrows, it is completely untenable that this protective measure – the Toxics Reduction Act, would be repealed
•	The sentiment of Bill 66 seeks to encourage development in areas hitherto protected for the purpose of increased business, jobs and financial gain into the community and yet the requirements that developers must fill is extremely vague as to be meaningless.
I am not a professional or expert in this field.  Very few are.  But you – policy makers and politicians – have been entrusted with the task of protecting that which is very dear and essential to us – our heritage, and living in a safe, beautiful environment.  Think carefully and wisely before making a decision that will have a profound and permanent impact on our sacred, precious environment.

It seems like our government is trying to privilege the interests of large businesses and corporations above the people  of the province they should be serving. Our government is making a huge mistake in putting short term financial gain before environmental protection.
Within our province, Environment Hamilton & City Council of Guelph both oppose the bill, and I'm sure many other municipalities have concerns that Bill 66 is a huge threat to local water supply. I've been reading about the Walkerton tragedy which inspired the Clean Water Act, and it would be a mistake to backtrack on measures that were put in place after multiple deaths and thousands of people fell ill. The inevitable millions of dollars of damage that will result from the fallout of implementing Bill 66 hardly seem worth the supposed financial motivations behind the bill.
I'm also concerned about Ford once again inviting development into the Greenbelt, an area that should be protected for its supply of clean drinking water as well as its biodiversity. Doug Ford has promised to protect this 2 million acre area from development, by now this by-law will allow municipalities the option to pass previously prohibited developmental applications on the Greenbelt.

Bill 66 must be withdrawn.  The protection of the greenbelt lands within Southern Ontario is a sacred trust and represents forward thinking on the need to maintain high quality drinking water, farmland, and natural areas.
I view this bill as a betrayal of that trust and would offer my sincere displeasure at a government running on a platform of protection and then completely reversing its direction.
I have come across no evidence that Ontario's economy is hampered by the greenbelt and all efforts must be made to curb urban sprawl.
Ample lands exist outside the greenbelt to provide sufficient economic development for decades to come.  The priority of the government should be on focused redevelopment of underused existing urban areas and enhancing protections for drinking water protection, natural areas, and the environment.

18996,/comment/18996,"Re: Bill 66
Object to this bill, especially Schedule 10.  This bill has been described as an MZO on steroids.  Question why any Provincial government would give any municipality the option/chance to override fundamentally important protections for the citizens of Ontario.  Source Water Protection should never be negotiable.  This bill does not give governments ""tools"" for planning, but rather opens the door to increasing interference with and eroding of regulatory protection.  Once one concession occurs, it is a slippery slope to more.  This can be seem now with amendments to Official Plans and past OMB hearings.  Future proponents claim precedence.  It would be chipping away vital protections.  The Greenbelt Act protects from this happening.  The argument that room is needed for growth is also a non-starter as there are ample white lands available.  Any specific complaints about existing approval processes with NEC etc. could be addressed and remedied, rather than be swept up in a nebulous, omnibus bill with such sinister undertones.  Some municipalities were not sure if the ""opted out"" whether the Province could override their decision.  Also, even if a current government ""opted out"" there was nothing to stop future ones from implementing Bill 66, or from a future turned down proponent appealing directly to the province.  The bill subverts regional government and puts too much power in the hands of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.
The Greenbelt has been described as the heart and lungs of southern Ontario.  Along with the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Lake Simcoe watershed hundreds of thousands of people rely on it for their drinking water.  It is a source of vast tourist, recreation and farm income for municipalities and by extension, the province.  It mitigates climate extremes, protecting against flooding and drought.
Governments of all levels should also bear in mind that in the late 1990's, cutbacks in the name of efficiency and red tape reduction produced one of the greatest tragedies Ontario has seen; Walkerton.  The Conservative Mike Harris government was blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing guidelines put in place after water testing was privatized in October 1996 to save money and reduce regulation.  Key recommendations of the Walkerton Commission were Source Water Protection and a multi barrier approach.  The Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, The Greenbelt Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act can all be considered a legacy of that tragedy.  Make no mistake, Bill 66 is a direct threat to these safeguards.
The final problem with Bill 66 is the total lack of transparency and public consultation.  The public has no right, and no say in any matter passed under this bill.  One would only find out after the fact, and there is no appeal.  THIS IS NOT DEMOCRACY.  At a recent Town Council, there was a public consultation regarding an Official Plan amendment that would allow an asphalt plant.  It may have been a noisy, sometimes tedious affair, but, it was a vital, fundamental right for the public to know and be heard.  It is already too easy to amend an ""Official"" Plan; there sometimes seems to be very little ""official"" about them.  Acts, like the Greenbelt Act prevent this undermining.  Imagine how it would be under Bill 66?  A very frightening thought.

I am also worried when I hear that City of Hamilton Planning Staff Staff ""have reviewed the proposed legislation and have a number of concerns, including a lack of need for the tool in Hamilton, potential unintended consequences from the tool, concern over potential impacts arising from exemptions to the Greenbelt Act and Clean Water Act, a lack of information on the proposed Regulation and prescribed purpose, and general questions on implementation.""
As an urban geography professor and Hamilton resident, I am aware of the multiple benefits that a protected and intact greenbelt offer for GTHA residents. Putting the greenbelt at increased risk of development is not necessary for urban growth and is potentially dangerous to environmental and human health.

As a farm operator and forest landowner, I am writing to the Premier and Government of Ontario to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt, call back the Ontario legislature and introduce a new Bill 66 that stops the destructive and misguided attacks on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important farmlands, forests, wetlands and natural areas.
During the election campaign, you promised to protect the Ontario Greenbelt Plan and recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan making the same commitment to the people of Ontario. Bill 66 as proposed, related deregulation and Section 10 will undo the beneficial land use policies that guide smart communities.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas with strategic marketing not urban sprawl. By building within existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in existing serviced communities while holding urban boundaries firm.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are being threatened. Farming and our local food production are economically important and provide jobs to thousands. Urban sprawl into farmland destroys farm businesses and farming communities.
Clean and abundant water is critical to both human and nature survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our environmental health, increases flooding, erosion and drought.
Forests, wetlands, natural areas and farmlands also provide healthy habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon, mitigate the effects of climate change, provide rural business and recreation opportunities and clean our air constantly and naturally.
Farmlands, forests, water and natural areas disappear forever in urban sprawl. Keep your promise to serve the people with integrity!!!

1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

For the substantive reasons set out below, ORA is strongly opposed to Schedule 10 of Bill 66 in its entirety, as well as the associated Environmental Registry postings as listed above.
This ill-conceived Bill, and associated Environmental Registry postings, proposes to enable municipalities to attract large-scale economic development by passing “open-for-business planning by-laws” under the Planning Act.  If enacted, these municipal by-laws would require the prior approval of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing but would not be subject to public notice, comment or appeal provisions which are currently mandatory under the Planning Act.  In addition, these by-laws would exempt application of key parts of several important provincial laws, plans and policies, including the:
•	Clean Water Act, 2006
•	Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015
•	Greenbelt Act, 2005
•	Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008
•	Ontario Planning and Development Act, 1994
•	Places to Grow Act, 2005, and
•	Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2003.
When tabling Bill 66, the Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade indicated that Bill 66 was aimed at eliminating “red tape” and “burdensome regulations” in order to promote business growth and create employment.
However, by any objective standard, the provincial laws, policies or plans excluded by Schedule 10 are neither “red tape” nor “burdensome regulations.” To the contrary, the legislative framework being ousted by Schedule 10 was carefully developed by the province with considerable input from Ontarians, non-government organizations and other stakeholders. In addition, the various components of this framework have been in place for years (and, in some cases, decades) in order to safeguard public and private interests throughout Ontario.
The proposed open-for-business by-law would prioritize economic goals and objectives to the exclusion of environmental, social and other goals and objectives. This is inconsistent with holistic and sustainable development. The proposed framework to formulate and approve an open-for-business by-law is inconsistent with an open, transparent and inclusive approach to community engagement and public consultation.  Moreover, Schedule 10 permits such bylaws to evade or sidestep the substantive protections that currently exist in law to safeguard residents, communities, agricultural lands and natural heritage features and functions all across the province.
We must have both sustainable development and a healthy environment.  We all want safe, healthy and resilient communities, so it is important that we protect our freshwater and groundwater resources, our farmland and the environment.
In closing, risky development decisions made in one or more jurisdictions could have significant negative cumulative impacts on our air, land and/or water, as well as the Great Lakes and many other highly valued ecosystems.  Being “Open-for-Business” is a good thing, unless it is at the expense of public health and safety or the environment.  Do we really want to risk another Walkerton or Grassy Narrows disaster?  That is precisely what the province is fostering with Bill 66.
Accordingly, ORA submits that Schedule 10 is a regressive, unwarranted and potentially risky proposal that is inconsistent with the public interest and does not adequately safeguard the health and safety of Ontarians.
Accordingly, ORA respectfully requests that Schedule 10 be completely removed from Bill 66.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment!

I am deeply concerned about the impact this Bill and the proposed 'Open for Business' bylaws will have on the environment, on planning, housing affordability, and the long term sustainability of our communities. It is false to suggest that Ontario needs such a Bill to create a more competitive business environment, when it is clearly working people who will suffer the most from any such proposals. We need communities where people can afford to live, where there are options for housing, work, and public transit, not more sprawl that creates environmental and social harms.
All the proposals within Bill 66 are deeply troubling, as is the lack of openness and accountability that is being built into the framework for cities and developers. I do not want my city building housing and business because of the whims of wealthy developers or continuing the cycle of speculation that has resulted in unaffordable housing prices and a model of housing development that is unsustainable and undesirable. I want my city to be able to build social and affordable housing, including the expansion of tools for cooperative housing models.
As a resident of Hamilton, I am also deeply concerned about what the elimination of the Toxics Reduction Act will mean for air, soil, and water quality in the city. I live close to an industrial area, and I want to know that those companies can and are being held accountable for what they are putting into the environment. Bill 66 eliminates this possibility, and that is truly terrifying.
Finally, I am deeply concerned about the impacts of Bill 66 on working people and on workplace rights. The changes to rules around overtime pay and hours worked mean that people will pressured into longer hours with less income as a result. People working in the lowest paid jobs will be the most affected, and many of these jobs are very dangerous especially when workers are overworked. Many workers do not know about their rights on the job and as a result are easily taken advantage of. Removing the obligation of employers to post information about the ESA will only increase the cases of workers being exploited and not knowing what to do. This is a minimal burden on employers - eliminating it is disgusting because it only serves to hurt workers and benefit employers by increasing ignorance.
I am not surprised to see this kind of legislation from this government, but as a resident of Ontario, I want something different. I strongly urge the government to withdraw all aspects of Bill 66 immediately.

19083,/comment/19083,"Remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66. It would be utterly irresponsible to allow municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act.
Why would we even consider allowing the Greenbelt - home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage - to be carved up and paved?
We now know that David Suzuki was right when he warned us back in the 80's that we should be taking action to mitigate climate change. He was also right in 2015 when he wrote the following:
""Canada’s towns and cities are at a crossroads. One path leads to continued low-density, sprawling urban expansion, with endless pavement, long commutes and traffic jams, and the high social and ecological costs of wasteful forms of urban design. The other path ends sprawl by creating compact, higher-density communities with mid-rise housing and access to public transit, bike paths and walking trails, surrounded by precious farmland and green spaces like Ontario’s renowned greenbelt. What kind of cities do you want?""
Some other extremely important facts from the same article that we should all think very seriously about:
""In the 1970s, Oregon’s government imposed strict urban-growth boundaries around a number of cities, including Portland. As a result, growth in the city was confined to existing built-up areas, thereby preventing development from spilling out to farmers’ fields. Many developers and businesspeople fought the plan, arguing it would hurt the economy, but Portland is now recognized as one of the most livable cities on the continent. It has facilitated densification, improved walkability and decreased the cost of energy and transportation for homes and businesses.""
""The greenbelt alone, comprising just over 20 per cent of the region, generates more than $9 billion in annual revenue to local economies, producing a bounty of fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy, honey and award-winning wines."" (from ""Good Things are Growing in Ontario's Greenbelt"" 2015, David Suzuki)
Unless we want to make our province even less livable and less sustainable, Schedule 10 must be removed from Bill 66.

19085,/comment/19085,"RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
Gravel Watch Ontario acts in the interests of residents and communities to protect the health, safety, quality of life of Ontarians and the natural environment in matters that relate to aggregate resources. We are a province-wide coalition of citizens’ groups and individuals.
Gravel Watch Ontario Members have deep concerns about many aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The proposed legislation would override critical requirements, under several provincial laws and policies that are designed to protect water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in decision-making.
Collectively, our organizations represent hundreds of citizens across the Greater Golden Horseshoe. On their behalf we urge the government not to proceed with Bill 66,  Schedule 10 for the reasons outlined below and trust that they will be considered with respect to all three relevant ERO postings (i.e., 013-4293, 013-4125, 013-4239).
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning by-laws that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies and in municipal official plans. The potential negative impact is far-reaching and profound. For example, policies that would not apply in open-for-business zoning by-law areas include:
●	Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems);
●	Those protecting farmland, provincially significant wetlands, woodlands, valley lands and habitat of species at risk;
●	Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency;
●	Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
●	Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
●	Those protecting freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed;
●	Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water.
Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with some flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and powerful and influential developers.
The vulnerability of Ontarians is heightened by the fact that open-for-business zoning by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
Contrary to the government’s contention that Bill 66 cuts regulations that are out of date, almost all the laws and policies affected were recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation. They include the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Toxic Reduction Act, 2009, the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, the Provincial Policy Statement (revised in 2014) and the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Growth Plan for the Great Golden Horseshoe (all revised in 2017). Municipal plans themselves are to be updated every five years.
It is also important to remember that many aspects of the modern land-use planning and land conservation framework now in place in Ontario were initiated by Progressive Conservative governments. For example, early work to limit sprawl occurred under the Harris government’s Smart Growth Program and the establishment and protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine was a signature PC government achievement. Undermining that legacy makes no sense to anyone.
Finally, there is no evidence that there is any need to make more employment lands available for development of new businesses or associated commercial, retail or residential development, the ostensible purpose of open-for-business zoning by-laws. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 at Queen’s Park many municipalities indicated that they have a surplus of employment lands and would like to see these repurposed for residential.
Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal councils and planners (e.g., Sudbury, Waterloo, Kitchener, Wilmot, Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Bradford, Mulmur, Ajax, Wellesley, Puslinch, Whitchurch Stouffville, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about its implications and/or have pointed out the presence of significant employment land surpluses within their respective municipalities. Many of these municipalities have also passed resolutions opposing this Bill.
Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. Open-for-business by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening farmland, water resources and sensitive natural features upon which we all rely. Gravel Watch Ontario believes that Schedule 10 should be wholly deleted from Bill 66.

•	Negative impacts to Ontario’s natural and built environment;
•	Degradation of important water sources;
•	Decreased preservation of greenspaces including agricultural lands, forests, parks and natural

Accessing clean water has become a problem due to overusage by bottling companies and by unbridled development. What’s next? Well, obviously - and unfortunately - the Green Belt! Too much red tape to do business in Ontario? So how do you plan to reduce it? By having developers deal with local municipalities, who don’t have a lot of staff on hand to investigate the pros and cons of development... For local municipalities the “cons” don’t usually come into consideration. It’s only the added tax benefits and economic advantages that are important to them. Developers are always ready to hand out money and gifts to those, who make their life easier. A friend, who intended to run for a councillor position in the North Toronto area, was approached by developers with promises of “gifts”, as soon as he submitted his name. Undoubtedly Mr. Ford has also been approached by these “generous” developers. Is this the type of government we want?
We are disgusted that the opening of the Green Belt is even on the table. Why do we need housing developments nonstop from Hamilton to Pickering and then north to Barrie? We feel it would be disastrous to move the decision-making to the local council level for reasons mentioned above.
It is our emphatic opinion that you remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, which allows municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act.

19108,/comment/19108,"If passed, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would trump critical environmental protections for land, water and wildlife. It would allow municipalities to create an “open-for-business planning by-law” to circumvent planning requirements and land use restrictions under numerous provincial laws, plans and policies. Under the guise of cutting red tape, Schedule 10 would line the pockets of big business at the expense of our health, our natural heritage and our environmental rights.
It would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment, and the health of people and communities across Ontario. We do not want another disaster like Walkerton.
From Thunder Bay to Toronto and Ottawa to Windsor, these changes would roll back progress that has been decades in the making. We will lose critical protections for water, wildlife and greenspace that are in the Planning Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Clean Water Act and more. This is not about unnecessary red tape or creating jobs – it is about generating short-term profits for the few at the long-term cost of the many. Additionally, despite the false narrative about jobs, Ontario's economy is strong – the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 18 years, and the construction industry is also doing well.
“Open-for-business by-laws” can bypass legal requirements intended to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land use decisions in our communities. They can present industry with a back door to develop properties in places like the Greenbelt. For example, these by-laws (1) can be passed without any public notice or meetings, (2) cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, (3) do not need to be consistent with municipal official plans, (4) do not need to be consistent with Planning Act policy statements, and (5)  do not need to conform to provincial plans. This is deeply alarming.
In other words, these “open-for-business by-laws” would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from previous Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments. They would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and their residents by facilitating sprawling and unchecked development in areas that are home to sensitive natural features and the water resources upon which we all rely.

We have worked hard for many years to implement regulations to protect the environment and the health of all species. It is most discouraging to think that these regulations will be weakened, even though this is not necessary for economic development in the province. There are many opportunities for development in safe, sustainable ways.
A dangerous aspect of Bill 66 is that it will allow municipalities to bypass critical environmental regulations as long as at least 50 new jobs are created. This will effectively gut the most important environmental protections in the province including:
the Greenbelt Act
the Clean Water Act
the Great Lakes Protection Act
the Lake Simcoe Act
the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act
The Bill is not necessary to ""cut red tape"" - the regulations in place now are necessary for saving lives.
Bill 66  would allow municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would override critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans and therefore are undemocratic.
The Bill threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
The Bill threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
The Bill threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
The Bill threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
The Bill threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would override requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
The Bill would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
The Bill would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
The Bill would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
The Bill threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

Based on years of experience dealing with the shortcomings of an application to re-open an old toxic landfill in:
•	class one wetland
•	 in Carolinian forest
•	on land that was part of the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee,
 I am extremely alarmed with Bill 66 – in particular Schedule 5 and Schedule 10.
My volunteer experience in dealing with this old landfill site made me aware of the current shortcomings and the limited resources and power of the Ministry of the Environment to protect sensitive land from actions of a company which had short-term financial gain as its priority. I shudder to think of what damage the “Open for Business by-laws” would to the protective, thought weak, infrastructure that is in place.
The speed with which this Bill 66 is being pushed through negates decades of work done by this province to protect source water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. This Bill 66 will rip apart the financial resources that the people of this province have invested in legislation and the human resources.

Because that's how democracy works, right?
I have grave concerns over Bill 66, and in general the attempt to rollback regulations which keep our communities safe. In particular, Schedule 10 is of utmost concern to me. Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would allow municipalities to override environmental regulations and promote the unchecked development for ""economic growth"". This Bill would promote the development of factories, industrial parks, and sprawling low-density car-dependent subdivisions in our green spaces, threatens public healthy and safety, and will allow developers to override important environmental regulations enshrined in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act. Furthermore, this Bill would allow municipalities to go ahead with these development projects without ANY public consultation. Once again, another great example of democracy.
The Greenbelt is home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage. This will be carved up with factories and subdivisions if the bill proceeds.
We need to protect our nature and local agriculture, and we need to maintain our commitment to fighting the worst effects of climate change for future generations. Economic growth is irrelevant if we don't have a clean, healthy, sustainable planet. Do you seriously want to expand the never-ending horizon of low-rise, grey, suburban townships and car-dependent McMansions that already clog the GTA? Have you not driven through these suburbs and felt depressed by the monotonous blur of cheaply-made cookie-cutter houses with two and three-car garages? Do you not desire to develop denser, more efficient and interconnected smart cities, to protect green zones, and to promote public transit so that the middle-class does not have to depend on cars to go about their daily business?
Canada is a country that is lucky to still have intact and beautiful nature preserves. We need to maintain this and sustain it, or else the next generation will suffer.
As a young Ontarian, environmental activist and climate change researcher, I am extremely worried about the future. I refuse to have children unless I feel that serious progress on climate action and environmental protection has been made, especially in my own province. Bill 66 does not give me hope that I will be able to change my mind about this any time soon. Many young people feel hopeless and desperate about how our capitalist society promotes unchecked development and consumerism at the expense of our planet. Many of us cannot bare the idea of creating a new generation with this current outlook. In light of the Ontario conservative party's terrible and corrupted development plans, it appears that climate action, environmental protection and sustainability are not a priority for those in charge.
In summary: I don't care how nice your paycheck is, stop prioritizing profits before the planet.
Protect the greenbelt and promote sustainable development of Ontario and the GTA.
If you don't, we will fight with every bit of energy that we have.
This will not be an easy pass for you, nor will any of your destructive and greedy policy decisions.
There is too much at stake for our collective future.
Furthermore, employment land already exists within current townships and cities in Ontario, which sets aside space for future economic development and building projects, rendering the need for further expansion into the greenbelt completely unnecessary and redundant.
I hope you seriously consider the concerns which I have raised. I speak on behalf of a growing and very politically engaged proportion of the younger generation. We are very much aware of the fact that we will have to clean up the reckless mess you have made to our province, and live with the consequences of decades of inaction dealing with the climate and environmental crises on our planet.

Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would allow municipalities to override environmental regulations and promote the unchecked development for ""economic growth"". This Bill would promote the development of factories, industrial parks, and sprawling low-density car-dependent subdivisions in our green spaces, threatens public healthy and safety, and will allow developers to override important environmental regulations enshrined in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act. Furthermore, this Bill would allow municipalities to go ahead with these development projects without ANY public consultation. Once again, another great example of democracy.
The Greenbelt is home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage. This will be carved up with factories and subdivisions if the bill proceeds.
We need to protect our nature and local agriculture, and we need to maintain our commitment to fighting the worst effects of climate change for future generations. Economic growth is irrelevant if we don't have a clean, healthy, sustainable planet. Do you seriously want to expand the never-ending horizon of low-rise, grey, suburban townships and car-dependent McMansions that already clog the GTA? Have you not driven through these suburbs and felt depressed by the monotonous blur of cheaply-made cookie-cutter houses with two and three-car garages? Do you not desire to develop denser, more efficient and interconnected smart cities, to protect green zones, and to promote public transit so that the middle-class does not have to depend on cars to go about their daily business?
Canada is a country that is lucky to still have intact and beautiful nature preserves. We need to maintain this and sustain it, or else the next generation will suffer.
As a young Ontarian, environmental activist and climate change researcher, I am extremely worried about the future. Many young people feel hopeless and desperate about how our capitalist society promotes unchecked development and consumerism at the expense of our planet. In light of the Ontario conservative party's terrible and corrupted development plans, it appears that climate action, environmental protection and sustainability are not a priority for those in charge.
Furthermore, employment land already exists within current townships and cities in Ontario, which sets aside space for future economic development and building projects, rendering the need for further expansion into the greenbelt completely unnecessary and redundant.
I hope you seriously consider the concerns which I have raised. I speak on behalf of a growing and very politically engaged proportion of the younger generation. We are very much aware of the fact that we will have to clean up the reckless mess you intend to make, and live with the consequences of decades of inaction dealing with the climate and environmental crises on our planet.
In summary: I don't care how nice your paycheck is, stop prioritizing profits before the planet. The state of the economy will not matter if our water, soil, and air is toxic.
Protect the greenbelt and promote sustainable development of Ontario and the GTA.
If you don't, we will fight with every bit of energy that we have.
This will not be an easy pass for you, nor will any of your destructive and greedy policy decisions in the coming years.
There is too much at stake for our collective future.

19158,/comment/19158,"What’s the point of having zoning, plans and provincial policies if they can just be bypassed?  The changes to “facilitate” the process just seems like code to bypass public input and consultations. In addition, the appeal process no longer exists for changes made by municipalities.  This could lead to overdevelopment of areas which cannot cope with additional buildings.  For example areas where the population is dependent on wells for its water supply.  Given the dry summers we now have, most of these areas would have even more problems than they have already.
It also seems to me that the bill is getting rid of regulations that protect people.  I do not like the abolition of regulations for home based child care.  Surely, these regulations were put in to protect children. One person cannot supervise several children adequately. I also do not approve of the fact that businesses will no longer have to get permission for excessive hours of work. these regulations are t0 protect workers.  In addition, I don't know what the ""Modernize and streamline administrative requirements for the operators of long-term care homes."" Will this mean a reduction in the protection of the aged?
means.
I dislike Omnibus Bills.  There is never enough information about every clause.  For example, I am wary of reducing any regulation of toxics and I wonder if transferring this to the Federal Government will do this.  To me much of this bill means that the protections for people are being abolished.  Those regulations were created for a reason and this lowering of standards will result in future problems.

Indeed, it is killer of good, well-paying jobs that support families. The delays that emerge in development are seldom due to the system of checks and balances that are in place to protect environment and heritage. Industry studies have shown that the number one culprit for project delays is incomplete submissions on the part of developers. Furthermore, I think it would be hard after this recent boom to make the case that developers are not doing well. It's a very profitable business. Giving municipalities this option to pass ""Open for Business"" bylaws opens the door to a ""race to the bottom"" in which municipalities competing for business place quick gains ahead of sustainability. It's just a bad idea. Can you tinker with the rules regarding review and approvals timelines? Sure. But leave the environmental and cultural heritage protections alone. Each of those rules represents a response to something bad and expensive (Walkerton, Ipperwash, Caledonia, etc.) that went disastrously wrong.

I am disappointed that the details of Bill 66, with the goal of encouraging development and business to Ontario, is coming at the expense of Ontario’s environment. I do not support the details of this bill, which allow municipalities to override protections established in the Clean Water Act, Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine Act, the Lakes Simcoe Protection Act, or the Places to Grow Act.
California and British Columbia, whose farmland we rely on to feed us, had extensive wildfires last year, with the possibility of more in the coming decades, due to climate change. We currently have an unstable relationship with China, a country that supplies us with many food items. These are just a few examples of locations Ontario has become very reliant on to feed our population. I believe it is very short sighted to rezone agricultural land in Ontario for development and expect that there will be food grown elsewhere available for us. Farmland is a non-renewable resource that should be preserved to ensure we can feed our own people, regardless of geopolitical or environmental conditions, now and in the future. In the future, other countries may not care, or be in a position, to help us if we can’t be self sufficient and raise our own food.
There are enough locations within urban centres in the GTA for ongoing residential and commercial development. Developing raw land is not something needed, it is simply what a few developers want. It is short sighted to develop the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraines, Lake Simcoe Watershed, and other last remaining natural pockets of land in Ontario. These are non-renewable resources. Once the trees are felled, the topsoil is scraped off and the structures are built, they will be gone forever. What impact will there be to the watershed, which is important to the Great Lakes hydrologic system? These lands should be protected for ourselves and for future generations.
I don’t know how it is legal to allow municipalities to approve development without Public Notice or the possibility of appealing decisions. How is the government protecting people’s rights if they remove the democratic ability to question dramatic changes to the landscape they live in?

19192,/comment/19192,"The rules and regulations that protect Ontarians and their future is not red tape. They are the result of years of experience, science and research, and policy reform. This does not mean that all Ontarians and especially developers will agree with them, but they exist for a reason. Schedule 10 must be removed from bill 66.
You are proposing sweeping changes without actually identifying how and what may be undertaken. The bill does not present guidelines for what the rules or thresholds for open for business bylaws may be or how they will be assessed. The process is not and will not be transparent and citizens will be left with no recourse to appeal. This is unacceptable. Detailed proposed rules for 'open for business bylaw' creation must be posted on the environmental registry for comment and legitimate consideration.
It appears as though nothing will be off limits, i.e., provincially significant wetland, species at risk habitat, significant fish and wildlife habitat. And individuals municipalities can use their discretion to exempt developers from rules and regulations with their word that jobs will be created. It appears that this mechanism can be used anywhere in the province despite the employment rate, the state and values of the local landscape, or the scale of the impacts. This is completely unacceptable and totally unjustified. Even if you are to enable such policies, there must be clear and transparent limits that consider and weigh these aspects.
There are already clear guidelines for developers. It is the cost of doing business to avoid impacts to the greater community. That is why our policies exist. It is evident from schedule 10 that the government is completely unaware of ecosystem services provided by natural heritage features, such as those protected under section 2.1 of the Provincial Policy Statement.
Southern Ontario hosts about a third of Canada's population, and is dominated by intensive agriculture. Some municipalities have almost no natural vegetated cover remaining. This is widely known to have direct impacts on human health, air and water quality, fish and wildlife populations, pollinators and food production, and climate change resilience. It is all connected, and it is already not enough. That's why we use appropriate planning practices that require these impacts to be taken into account, because these features pay us back in the end with the irreplaceable services they provide.
Despite the Environmental Commissioner being silenced, we already know that current planning policies have gaps, and we know schedule 10 would be a ludicrous step backwards by decades. We know we have continued to lose wetlands and have harmful algal blooms. We have continued to see species populations collapse, such as multiple species of bumblebees responsible for our crop production. We know we have to do better, and that the best way to do so is continuing to build strong legislation and policy to support responsible planning across the province.
Municipalities often do not have the capacity or expertise to make informed decisions related to natural heritage protection and planning. Moreover, their interest in increasing tax revenue through development is in direct conflict with these policies in many cases, which aim to deter development in sensitive natural heritage features because of the well established values they provide. We need them. And developers are already given the choice to avoid these features or to properly assess the potential effects and demonstrate that no negative impacts will result. Yes, it takes extra time and work to ensure our fish and wildlife, and wetlands and water sources are protected.
The proposed changes go in the opposite direction recommended by experts, both in Ontario and around the world, and as such it is obvious that no expertise from internal or external professionals was used to inform this proposal and assess its potential impacts, nor can we expect such comments to be taken into account. As a result, we will be putting the future of our communities at great risk.
How will municipalities and the open for business bylaws weigh the permanent loss of ecosystem services for everyone, against the temporary promise of cost savings and jobs for limited individuals? What evidence exists that this will ultimately benefit the province, and how is that being weighed against what we stand to lose? We are already in a time of reduced unemployment rate, and economists know that most governments operate in a deficit and can safely do so almost indefinitely. Ontarians are smarter than this and know it costs money to run a province worth living in.
Many citizens (myself included) make a modest income but are willing to pay more for healthy and livable communities that protect our natural resources, and we are seeking out and moving to forward-thinking communities that do. We do not want to live in communities that enable developers to enjoy more profits by eliminating their due diligence through proper Environmental Impact Assessments and causing irreversible long-term impacts.
Many citizens also know that the lack of funding and resources for public service is what takes time for approvals, not the policies and regulations that protect us. But instead of providing proper support to implement due process, you are eliminating the rules altogether to appease a limited interest groups at the expense of all others. Ontario does not want to be held to the same reduced standards as developing economies, nor is it in our best interest.
Official planning and natural heritage policies under the Provincial Policy Statement are not red tape. They are a livable future for Ontario.

I grew up on a farm in the Greenbelt, and while I live in Peterborough now, I still know that the protections the Greenbelt Act provides are vitally important to the health of the entire ecosystem, both natural and anthropogenic. By allowing municipalities to pass by-laws that ignore these environmental protections without public notice, ignoring vital consultation that allows citizens of this province a say in what happens in their community we are causing irreversible harm to a system that is already on the brink. Luckily many municipalities have already fought back, showing that they do not, and will not, support Bill 66.
Despite the fact that the Premier specifically said he would not open the greenbelt, bill 66 will allow development to ignore key environmental rules that protect the areas that make southern Ontario as great as it is. A healthy ecosystem provides billions of dollars of ecosystem services (a 2016 study found it provided $3.2 billion dollars annually): it cleans our water and air, pollinates our food, sequesters carbon, as well as providing easily accessible outdoor spaces that have their own host of measured benefits on human health and happiness. Ignoring these long-term benefits for short-term profit and gain is exceptionally short cited. Especially considering that there is currently enough land available in existing cities and towns to accommodate the expected growth until 2041 showing that opening the greenbelt for development is not actually for the benefit of the average Ontarian.
Cancelling (despite overwhelming opposition) a successful Cap and Trade program, and replacing it with a plan that has been shown to allow greenhouse gases to increase, and requires tax-payers to subsidize big businesses, as well as removing the authority of the arms-length environmental commissioner have already ensured that future generations will look back on this government with shame.

We were forced out of our home which will soon be completely torn up and destroyed, replaced with a plethora of low quality built houses, shopping centers, and the ever growing, putrid Brampton. We understand that city's develop and expand, however, we the families and people of Caledon and those within the Greenbelt believe in conceiving nature and respecting the last of the natural land. The farmers proving the dairy, meat, eggs, and food you, Doug Ford consume are being belittled and abused. We would clean up the litter and filth left by the people from the city would toss from their car windows, we would be forced to clean up the mountains of bags packed with garbage, and mounds of soil and debris from home renovations, large garbage materials like mattresses and washing machines that were constantly dumped on our land by city folk who were too cheap and lazy to deal with it appropriately. Doug Ford, by opening the Greenbelt to developers you are telling the people who live there that they are less important than money in your pocket. You are showing the generations to come that preserving natural land is unimportant and that treating nature like garbage is okay. Doug Ford you show us, the people of Ontario that you have no dignity and that you do not respect the hard working farmers that put food in your stomach.

That total (7,284 km² or 2,812 mi²) makes it one of the largest and most successful greenbelts in the world.

During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.

There is an abundance of vacant commercial and industrial buildings, zoned for business, in existing employment nodes across the province. Adding more would lead to an oversupply and collapse of property values, which would displease landlords. Construction jobs are short term and low skill, so there is no case for this need.
What we lack is the startup funding and knowledge sharing to create businesses that can compete on a world stage. If this is secretly intended for residential sprawl and to enrich developers, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a conflict of interest.
It is indefensible that ""No notice or hearing is required prior to the passing of an open-for-business planning by-law"". All zoning changes have consultations, from a minor variance to OPA, in every municipality.

These include the wind turbines, the green rebates, Drive Clean, and Cap and Trade, plus the rejection of electric cars, after the announcement that GM considered those to be their new focus, causing them to move elsewhere.
Please realize that you are destroying any faith people had in your ability to govern ""For the People"". To date the only one you seem to be governing for, is Doug Ford.

19218,/comment/19218,"I am very concerned about the idea of cutting ""red tape"" being used to weaken environmental regulations in Ontario, and call on the government to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, which allows municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act.

19227,/comment/19227,"I have deep concerns about Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. Bill 66 overrides essential components of provincial laws and policies that protect our water, farmland, natural heritage and public health. Not only does Bill 66 remove these protections, it allows the passing of an open-for-business bylaw without public notification, public consultation or the right to appeal.
There is no evidence supporting a land shortage in Ontario. Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land to meet housing needs in our cities and towns until 2041. Employment land is also widely available. In fact, Simcoe County alone has 2919 ha of vacant employment land. Many other communities also identified surplus employment lands at the Growth Plan Implementation Consultation held at Queen’s Park on Nov 8, 2018.
Allowing development within currently protected areas not only creates urban sprawl, it necessitates the expansion of infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer services. This will increase property taxes for people living in impacted communities and raises concerns about clean drinking water, the loss of farm land, further degradation of Lake Simcoe and worsening climate change.
The Clean Water Act was created as a direct result of the Walkerton water contamination crisis which caused the death of seven Ontarians. The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was created to prevent contamination of groundwater supplies for 250,000 residents and hundreds of farms.
Section 39 of the Clean Water Act is one of the provisions listed in Schedule 10 of Bill 66. Schedule 10 proposes to exclude Section 39 and subsections (1) to (8) from applying to developments approved under an open-for-business bylaw. As it is currently written, Bill 66 would allow the approval of employment development which could threaten safe drinking water for multiple communities. For example, a factory that produces toxic effluent could be constructed inside a wellhead protection zone. Bill 66 lays the groundwork for another Walkerton.
Only 5% of the land base in Ontario is available for farming. Each day, 175 acres of farmland is lost. Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is economically important and provides jobs to thousands of Ontarians. Bill 66 also increases the speculative real estate value of farmland making it more difficult for farmers to purchase and preserve the farmland essential to feeding Ontario residents. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Lake Simcoe is an essential part of Ontario’s natural and ecological heritage, supporting tourism and recreational fishing, as well as being a source of drinking water for local communities. Lake Simcoe has suffered from excessive phosphorous pollution from storm water runoff in urban areas, sewage and septic systems, and exposed soil and nutrients on farms and new developments. Phosphorous levels in the lake have decreased, but much work remains to be done. Bill 66 must not be allowed to erode the gains made by the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan and its associated policies.
By allowing development in previously protected areas, Bill 66 also conflicts with the Province’s proposed Made in Ontario Environmental Plan. Protected areas are crucial in combating climate change. The Greenbelt absorbs carbon and keeps an estimated 172 million tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere (1). Protected areas also help prevent flooding, forest fires and the other impacts associated with the extreme weather events caused by climate change. Passing Bill 66 directly contradicts Ontario’s Environment Plan and our province’s commitment to fight climate change.
I believe it is critically important to delete Schedule 10 from Bill 66 and respectfully request you work to remove this section of the newly proposed Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.

There is too much at stake regarding the greenbelt, wetlands, natural areas, and other environmentally protected areas. Protections for these areas must be maintained, especially as adverse effects of climate change are starting to be felt and observed. I strongly support politics that are in favour of global sustainability; opening these areas to commercial development is a step in the Wrong Direction on so many levels.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.

I do not want the Greenbelt - which is home to 5,500 farms, numerous species at risk, and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage - carved up with factories and subdivisions.
The greenbelt is what makes Ontario beautiful and attracts many tourists into the area.  The greenbelt is a perfect stretch of greenery and nature which is needed for the general public (especially those in the area), as a retreat from being surrounded by concrete and congestion, and contributes to a healthy state of mind and well-being.
Green spaces are constantly being taken away and developed, leaving the population surrounded by concrete and congested traffic with an increase in accidents and air-pollution.  But that's not all - unfettered sprawl causes deforestation, land conversion from agriculture to asphalt (large parking lots are a prominent feature of sprawling suburban communities), air and water pollution, and inefficient transportation infrastructure reliant upon single passenger vehicles and long commutes.  Natural eco-systems, habitats, and wildlife roaming areas are systematically destroyed leaving many animals homeless and trapped, leading to species extinction and desegregation of our environment.
I ask to what end are developers going to continue to take away green spaces and fill them up with unsustainable sprawling subdivisions and factories to fill their pockets?  Until there is nothing left, and we are completely separated from the nature and the natural world?  These unsustainable and archaic developmental practices are counter-productive to the health and well-being of Ontario residents.
The the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act, were all created for a reason, and they are at least the bare minimum we can do to safe-guard the natural spaces that we hold so dear, and that are so important to the health and well-being of Ontario residents and future generations to come.
Please have the courage in your heart to not give in to the pockets and greed of developers that have no interest in protecting our cherished green spaces, and will not think twice before bulldozing natural habitats and thousands of trees for profit.

In order to have a sustainable and strong economy we need to build that on a foundation of strong environmental protection.

There's a lot to be worried about with respect to BILL 66 currently brought forward. One, but not the only, alarming aspect is that it legislates disregard for our democratic process. Councils won't have to consult ahead of time with the public, or notify the public that particular projects under the umbrella of BILL 66 are under consideration.   Furthermore, there are questions about when and how Town Councils will be required to tell the public when by-laws have been passed using the caveats of BILL 66.
  And lastly, there is no right of appeal. The public will have no recourse. It’s the public who have to live with the decisions of the developer. The developer, in my experience, is not concerned about our forests, lakes, rivers, and endangered species. The developer’s concern is profit. The public needs to have a say and that say needs to be heard and valued. This bill will take us backward.

I’m writing in opposition to Bill 66 (“Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act,” 2018).  The provisions of Bill 66 would circumvent measures taken to protect water, the environment, heritage and Indigenous Rights, to mention but a few.
Provisions of Bill 66 to:
		- allow municipalities to circumvent their own Official Plans and Zoning By-laws, as well as provisions of provincial policies and plans,
- allow public consultation at the discretion of the municipality,
- and prevent public appeal to local bodies
are particularly odious and undemocratic.
Regarding heritage, Bill 66 would allow municipalities to bypass measures in the Planning Act and the Provincial Policy Statement, as well as their own Official Plans (often supplemented by Archaeological Master Plans), that were formulated to protect the heritage of the people of Ontario.  Bill 66 would, in effect, begin Erasing History; a vital part of how people define themselves, quite apart from the economic world in which they live and which Bill 66 is designed to promote.  My argument in opposition to Bill 66, aside from doubting that current regulations are harmful to business to the extent claimed, is that a healthy society requires a sense of its own history and an environment that fosters human health and a sense of inspiration and well-being, as well as a vigorous economy.  There is no either/or.  All must be protected.

1) As lower tier municipalities pass Zoning By-laws, what would be the role of the upper/Regional Municipality through this process? Would they have a role?
2) Please provide examples for the types of prescribed criteria that may be required to pass an Open for Business By-law.
3) Please provide examples of the type of conditions the Minister may provide in order for the municipality to approve an Open for Business By-law.
4) Please provide clarification on how specific the “prescribed purpose” needs to be. Should the purpose be limited to a specific business, specific type of use, or to a specific category of zoning?
5) Please clarify when site plan control does apply to a piece of property subject to an Open for Business By-law. Is it when the property subject to the Open for Business By-law is expanded upon?
6) Please clarify the process and how/what the Minister can amend in an OFB and if the municipality has a chance to address the modifications provided by the Minister before the Open for Business By-law is approved.
7) Please clarify if a by-law passed by a municipality amending or revoking an Open for Business By-law needs approval from the Minister. If it does not, does this mean the normal planning process should be followed? (ie. Public meeting, appeal period, can go to the LPAT)

You would make a marketplace out of what we all ought to carefully protect and cherish. How shameful! I do not believe this is in the best interests of Ontarians and am certain that if more residents were privy to the government's dirty dealings and intentions, you would be faced with a public outcry.

19318,/comment/19318,"January 17, 2019
Dear Premier Ford and Members of Provincial Parliament,
As a constituent of Ontario, I have deep concerns about many aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The proposed legislation would override critical requirements under several provincial laws and policies that are designed to protect water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, accessible and transparent public engagement in decision-making, and sets the stage for costly property tax increases to subsidize economically-inefficient, sprawling development. Also with our climate change crisis, Bill 66 undermines our ability to preserve natural green space and protect ground water and surface water resources, and will promote carbon intensive development. Let me ask you...do you have children or grandchildren? Do you think about the long term impacts of such reckless policy and development on future generations...your children and grandchildren? All the hard work over years to enact policies that are here to protect us...you...and safeguard public and private interests throughout Ontario cast aside to line the pockets of corporations that are only concerned about their bottom lines.
I urge you not to proceed with Bill 66, for the reasons outlined below.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning by-laws that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies, and in municipal official plans. The potential negative impact is far-reaching and profound. For example, policies that would not apply in “open-for-business” zoning by-law areas include:
• Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems). Do you want another Walkerton?
• Those protecting farmland, provincially significant wetlands, woodlands, valley lands and habitat of species at risk. This is so important to preserve as part of our diverse habitat.
• Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency. So, so important!
• Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
• Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
• Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed; and
• Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario. A 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water. Is this not what you want? Is this not what you want for your children and grandchildren?
Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with needed flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and influential developers. This is so sad!
The vulnerability of Ontarians is heightened by the fact that “open-for-business” zoning by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump (this sounds like...someone south of the border) laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Compounding the problem, communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them. Certainly not very democratic is it? Put the shoe on the other foot. You were voted in to represent us, not yourselves.
Contrary to the government’s contention that Bill 66 cuts regulations that are out of date, almost all the laws and policies affected were recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation. They include the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Toxic Reduction Act, 2009, the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, the Provincial Policy Statement (revised in 2014) and the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Growth Plan for the Great Golden Horseshoe (all revised in 2017). Municipal plans themselves are to be updated every five or ten years.
The modern land-use planning and land conservation framework now in place in Ontario was developed over the years by governments of varying political stripes. For example, early work to limit sprawl through Smart Growth, and the establishment and protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine were signature achievements of Progressive Conservative governments. Undermining that legacy would be a huge step backwards.
Finally, there is no evidence of a need to make more employment lands available for development of new businesses or associated commercial, retail or residential development, which is the ostensible purpose of “open-for-business” zoning by-laws. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal councils and planners (e.g., Sudbury, Waterloo, Kitchener, Wilmot, Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Bradford, Mulmur, Ajax, Wellesley, Puslinch, Whitchurch Stouffville, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about its implications and/or have pointed out the presence of significant employment land surpluses within their respective municipalities. Many of these municipalities have also passed resolutions opposing this Bill.
Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong, progressive government leadership. We should strive to be the role-model or set the bar for all other provinces and countries, for that matter, on how to live sustainably, protect our people, and protect our environments but unfortunately Bill 66 is regressive, dirty, and undemocratic. “Open-for-business” by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening farmland, water resources and sensitive natural features upon which we all rely. I urge all Members of the Provincial Parliament to vote against Bill 66.

Approved recommendations from the City of Waterloo staff report:
1. that Council encourage the Province to extend municipal consultation, and provide draft regulations with respect to the conditions under which the by-law may be used, the definition of employment uses and how the number of jobs created by the land use is calculated and maintained.
2. That Council object to the provisions in Bill 66 that would exempt planning decisions from the requirement to conform to the Clean Water Act.
3. That the Province re-examine the need for Bill 66, having regard to Section 47 of the Planning Act. If the Province elects to advance Bill 66, that the legislation be modified as follows:
a) that employment uses be prohibited within significant natural heritage features and areas (and their associated buffers), and prohibited in or proximal to sensitive surface water features and sensitive groundwater features / systems;
b) that employment uses be located within settlement boundaries as identified in the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe;
c) that employment uses be connected to municipal water and wastewater servicing and transportation infrastructure sufficiently sized and configured to accommodate the development; and,
d) that employment uses shall be compatible with nearby sensitive land uses, such as but not limited to residential uses, including in terms of adverse effects from noise, vibration, odour and other contaminants.
4. That Council encourage the Province to require municipalities to consult with adjacent and upper tier municipalities prior to adopting an open-for-business by-law. That Council encourage the Province to reconsider its exemption of open-for-business by-laws from appeal, given that the exemption may simply shift land use disputes from LPAT to the courts.

19327,/comment/19327,"Good morning,
I am writing this morning to express my dissatisfaction regarding Bill 66, notably Schedule's 5 and 10.
Regarding Schedule 5, repealing the Toxics Reduction Act may affect the health and safety of many Ontarians,  and should not be repealed, no matter the cost. The health and safety of citizens is a much higher priority than reducing the ""red tape"" associated for businesses. By repealing this Act, I worry that another incident such as the Walkerton e.coli outbreak may occur again.
As for schedule 10, the Greenbelt surrounding the GTA is crucial for the region, and has such a profound impact on the environment and our quality of life in Ontario. By allowing development in the Greenbelt, I fear that Ontario will become subjected to rapid intensified urbanization. What the government should be focusing on instead is maintaining the Greenbelt, but seeking alternatives for development within our existing urban environment. I do not want to see integral ecosystems, and pristine nature being replaced by rampant urban sprawl - by ensuring the wellbeing of our environment, we will ensure the wellbeing of the residents of Ontario.

The tourism industry depends on protecting our lakes and rivers and the green belt.
This bill can sideline municipal approvals and allow developers to go to the province for approvals. The provincial government was not elected to fulfil that role.
This bill reduces protection of source water. That’s cavalier given the Walkerton tradgedy.
This bill undermines smart growth planning that aims to increase density and facilitate affordable housing and public transit.

19339,/comment/19339,"I am writing to provide my comments and concerns with respect to Schedule 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.
The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation were not consulted prior to the introduction of this legislation. Nor am I aware of any First Nation that was consulted regarding the proposed “Open-for-Business” bylaw (OFB bylaw) in Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
The effect of an OFB bylaw is that individual projects, if they meet the prescribed criteria will be effectively exempt from the bulk of land-use planning and environmental legislation in Ontario.
These legislative mechanisms, while rarely sufficient by themselves, are a useful and necessary tool to ensure the Crown fulfills its obligations to consult and accommodate First Nations where the Crown contemplates conduct that could negatively impact existing or asserted s. 35 rights under the Constitution.
The proposed legislation will effectively prevent meaningful consultation and accommodation with First Nations where an OFB bylaw is passed because there will no longer be any mechanism that will allow the Crown to address potential impacts on rights.
OFB bylaws will, among many other things, eliminate the requirement to comply with the provincial policy statement (PPS). This includes a variety of provisions which require municipalities to behave in a way that is consistent with the Crown’s duty to consult and accommodate First Nations, including by engaging and partnering with First Nations in land-use planning decisions.
The lack of a requirement for notice to impacted First Nations prior to the passing of the bylaw, and the fact that the “prescribed criteria” as proposed do not include any reference to the requirement to consult and accommodate First Nations makes it difficult to see how the Act could be consistent with the constitutional requirements of s. 35.
What mechanism will ensure that our cultural heritage resources will be protected for instance, if there are no longer provisions requiring an assessment of archaeological potential for a development because the Cultural Heritage and Archaeology provisions of the PPS no longer apply?
It is simply not open to the government to create a legislative regime which effectively opts-out of the duty to consult and accommodate. The Supreme Court of Canada in Carrier Sekani explicitly forbid such behaviour by the Crown.
This legislation is deeply flawed and may be unconstitutional. If the government plans on introducing some other legislative mechanism that would allow the Crown to fulfill its duty to consult and accommodate in the face of Bill 66 then that should be included as part of the Bill itself.

You told voters you would protect the Greenbelt and therefore I urge you to call back legislature and introduce a new, different Bill that stops the attacks on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important protected farm and natural areas to development.
In your recent Environment Plan you made the same commitment to protect the Greenbelt. Bill 66 will threaten water supplies, green space, and protected farm and natural areas.
Natural infrastructure in the Greenbelt is a climate adaptation measure - it protects us from extreme weather events such as flooding by absorbing rainwater. Paving over this puts more Canadians at risk from more extreme weather events.
As well, provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks. You do not want another Walkerton.

A decision that enables this possibility runs against the direction in which we should all be heading to try and preserve what natural spaces we have left and make choices that leave a lesser carbon footprint. Over and above the benefit that any natural space provides, the greenbelt in particular has additional banefits to urban dwellers, not least of which is to provide proximity to nature. Without this proximity, decisions like this one become too easy to take, and I would fear a cascade of detrimental steps.

I understand the need for oversight by government, but feel that the ""Open For Business-Bill 66"", is more about selling off our children's future, rather than the Premier of Ontario's assertion that it invests in it. I would urge urban planners and policy makers to think/look 50 years ahead instead of just until the next election cycle. This is not about ""restoring"" Ontario's competitiveness. The residents of Ontario have, over time, decided that clean air, and living space is just as important to them as jobs. The Premier wants to claw back, the accomplishments that the Ontario people, (his own constituents!) have voiced as being their preference, that being quality of life over corporate gains.
If there is a need for better/new infrastructure (which there should always be), please think ahead and create it in areas that currently go underutilized. Business will be attracted to the reduced cost of being outside the GTA, workers could then migrate toward a job market that supports the potential  for cheaper housing, and where the transportation and communication services are firmly in place.
Simply extending or adding onto areas already grid-locked with traffic has become the simple, cheap, and unimaginative answer to a long-term problem that current politicians have either failed to identify, or more likely chosen to refuse to acknowledge.

19379,/comment/19379,"I am writing to you to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt and therefore call back legislature and introduce a new Bill 66 that stops the attacks on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important protected farm and natural areas to development.
During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.
If you are truly a government ""for the people"", you will call back Bill 66 and keep your promise.
Thank you,

It took over 10000 years to create the soil conditions ripe for agricultural uses that it is preserved for today. Opening up the Greenbelt for short term benefit of developers would damage the long-term stability of Ontario and for Canada.  There is no way that we should open up the Greenbelt to virtually regulation free development.

19384,/comment/19384,"I strongly object to your government's proposal to remove the current environmental safeguards for the Greenbelt through Bill 66.  The Greenbelt is a precious commodity, which is irreplaceable.  Already an enormous amount of rich, fertile farmland has been destroyed by non-stop construction.  Once destroyed by buildings, roads and parking lots, the fertility of the land cannot be restored - not to mention the negative impact on wildlife through habitat destruction and the pollution of waterways and water sources.
Removing environmental protections is not the way to go to promote economic prosperity.  Instead, government, industry and businesses need to look at constructive ways to work while maintaining the integrity of the Greenbelt.  Wind farms and solar panels, for example, were practically unheard of several years ago yet, today they are a growing industry and making profits - without negative repercussions for the environment.
New technologies and innovations are the basis for prosperity.  Ultimately, any economic advantages that you envision with Bill 66 will be short-lived as the results on the environment and the livelihood of farmers will be devastating and irreversible, negating any so-called economic advantages.

19395,/comment/19395,"I have grave concerns over Bill 66, and in general the attempt to rollback regulations which keep our communities safe. In particular, Schedule 10 is of utmost concern to me. Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would allow municipalities to override environmental regulations and promote the unchecked development for ""economic growth"". This Bill would promote the development of factories, industrial parks, and sprawling low-density car-dependent subdivisions in our green spaces, threatens public health and safety, and will allow developers to override important environmental regulations enshrined in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act. Furthermore, this Bill would allow municipalities to go ahead with these development projects without ANY public consultation. Once again, another great example of democracy.
The Greenbelt is home to 5,500 farms, 78 species at risk and 102 million tonnes of carbon storage. This will be carved up with factories and subdivisions if the bill proceeds.
We need to protect our nature and local agriculture, and we need to maintain our commitment to fighting the worst effects of climate change for future generations. Economic growth is irrelevant if we don't have a clean, healthy, sustainable planet. Do you seriously want to expand the never-ending horizon of low-rise, grey, suburban townships and car-dependent McMansions that already clog the GTA? Have you not driven through these suburbs and felt depressed by the monotonous blur of cheaply-made cookie-cutter houses with two and three-car garages? Do you not desire to develop denser, more efficient and interconnected smart cities, to protect green zones, and to promote public transit so that the middle-class does not have to depend on cars to go about their daily business?
Canada is a country that is lucky to still have intact and beautiful nature preserves. We need to maintain this and sustain it, or else the next generation will suffer.
As a young Ontarian, environmental activist and climate change researcher, I am extremely worried about the future. I refuse to have children unless I feel that serious progress on climate action and environmental protection has been made, especially in my own province. Bill 66 does not give me hope that I will be able to change my mind about this any time soon. Many young people feel hopeless and desperate about how our capitalist society promotes unchecked development and consumerism at the expense of our planet. Many of us cannot bare the idea of creating a new generation with this current outlook. In light of the Ontario conservative party's terrible and corrupted development plans, it appears that climate action, environmental protection and sustainability are not a priority for those in charge.
Furthermore, employment land already exists within current townships and cities in Ontario, which sets aside space for future economic development and building projects, rendering the need for further expansion into the greenbelt completely unnecessary and redundant.
I hope you seriously consider the concerns which I have raised. I speak on behalf of a growing and very politically engaged proportion of the younger generation. We are very much aware of the fact that we will have to clean up the reckless mess you intend to make, and live with the consequences of decades of inaction dealing with the climate and environmental crises on our planet.
In summary: I don't care how nice your paycheck is, stop prioritizing profits before the planet. The state of the economy will not matter if our water, soil, and air is toxic.
Protect the greenbelt and promote sustainable development of Ontario and the GTA.
If you don't, we will fight with every bit of energy that we have.
This will not be an easy pass for you, nor will any of your destructive and greedy policy decisions in the coming years.
There is too much at stake for our collective future.
Stop Bill 66!

19396,/comment/19396,"In accordance with the opportunity provided by the Government, the Carpenters’ District Council of Ontario, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (the “Carpenters’ Union”) is hereby providing its written comments concerning Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 (“Bill 66”). In particular, the Carpenters’ Union is providing its comments concerning those portions of Schedule 9 of Bill 66 which propose to amend the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (the “LRA”), by introducing new provisions of the LRA concerning deemed non-construction employers.
The Carpenters’ District Council of Ontario is composed of 16 affiliated Local Unions of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners across the province. In total, we represent approximately 27,000 women and men working in a wide range of skilled trades, including carpentry, drywall, resilient flooring, concrete formwork, underwater construction, welding, scaffolding, and a long list of other related work, primarily in the construction industry but also in other industries. The Carpenters’ Union, and/or its Local Unions across Ontario, are bound to collective agreements with tens of thousands of employers that perform work in the construction industry, including various employers that will be directly affected by the proposed changes to the LRA found within Bill 66.
The relevant portions of Schedule 9 of Bill 66 (Sections 12 to 15) will amend the LRA by declaring certain employers to be deemed non-construction employers. Such deemed non-construction employers will include municipalities, local municipal boards, school boards, hospitals, colleges, universities and various other public bodies. On the date that Bill 66 (as it is currently proposed) is proclaimed into force, all bargaining rights which relate to the construction industry for the employees of such deemed non-construction employers will vanish. Further, on that day, all deemed non-construction employers will cease to be bound to existing collective agreements that relate to the construction industry.
The Carpenters’ Union, and/or its relevant Local Unions across Ontario, currently hold bargaining rights for employees (primarily carpenters) employed by a number of entities which fall within the deemed non-construction employer definition. Such entities include the City of Toronto, the City of Hamilton, the Region of Waterloo, the City of Sault Ste. Marie, the Toronto Community Housing Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Canadian National Exhibition.
The work that our members perform for these types of employers primarily involves construction industry work. Essentially, these deemed non-construction employers employ members of the Carpenters’ Union to perform specialized construction industry carpentry work which, as skilled/qualified journeypersons and apprentices, our members are particularly qualified for. The Carpenters’ Union and its members have always been committed to providing the best possible skilled labour, at the best possible overall cost, to all of the employers that are bound to our collective agreements. In the case of many of the deemed non-construction employers, the productive and harmonious relationships with the Carpenters’ Union have existed for decades.
As noted above, should Schedule 9 of Bill 66 come into force (without amendment), we will automatically lose all of our existing construction industry bargaining rights with deemed non-construction employers and our members working for such employers in the construction industry will no longer be covered by their existing collective agreements. We recognize that the proposed language of Schedule 9 of Bill 66 does allow for the survival of bargaining rights and collective agreements, with deemed non-construction employers, which do not relate to the construction industry. However, this is of little solace to us and our members. As noted, the members of the Carpenters’ Union that are employed by deemed non-construction employers perform the vast majority of their work, for their respective employers, in the construction industry. Therefore, upon this Bill coming into force, they will essentially become non-union workers, by government fiat and without having any say in the matter.
In many cases, like in the City of Toronto, the relationship with the employers and Carpenters have been harmonious for decades. A number (and perhaps even the majority) of the members of the Carpenters’ Union currently working for the City of Toronto are long service employees. Many of these carpenters have spent 20 years or more of their working lives providing skilled labour to the City under, and in accordance with, the Carpenters’ Provincial Collective Agreement. Once Bill 66 is proclaimed, that will end and their terms and conditions of employment, concerning the construction work which they primarily perform, will thereafter be left to the unlimited discretion of their employer. For these employees, the impact will go far beyond their hourly wage. As is common in the construction industry, all of these employees receive access/entitlement to health and welfare and pension benefits through the Carpenters’ Union and the Collective Agreement under which they work. The Bill, by eliminating the bargaining rights and by tearing up the Collective Agreement, relating to the City of Toronto and the construction industry work which our members perform for the City, will end this and these employees will be denied ongoing access to their prior benefit coverage and pension plans.
The impact of Bill 66 will go beyond the existing employees of the employers involved and our existing relationship with the Toronto Community Housing Corporation (“TCHC”) provides a prime example of this phenomenon. Under the existing collective agreement which covers members of the Carpenters’ Union performing construction industry work for TCHC, the employer and the Union have committed to provide access to the industry, and in particular the carpentry trade, to young people who live in TCHC housing. Every year, such young people work, as pre-apprentices, alongside our carpenters performing construction work in the communities and housing developments in which they live. In this way, they gain knowledge and experience about the carpentry trade and the construction industry, along with earning some income. After their pre-apprenticeship period, any of the candidates who are interested are then taken into the Union and are signed up for carpentry apprenticeships. The success rate in this program has been quite phenomenal, with more than 75% of the pre-apprentices becoming actually registered apprentices who can then go on to acquire the skills which will provide them with a secure and rewarding work future. Bill 66 will end all such collective agreement relationships.
The Government claims that the purpose of Bill 66 is to stimulate business investment, create good jobs, and make Ontario more competitive. We do not believe that the deemed non-construction employer provisions of this Bill advance such purposes in any meaningful and material way. Some commentators have claimed that removing collective agreement obligations, particularly in relation to subcontracting from deemed non-construction employers, will save hundreds of millions of dollars for the employers involved but such claims are simply false. The labour cost component of any major construction project is, certainly as a percentage of the total cost of the project, on average now quite low, and is becoming increasingly lower given ongoing changes in technology and work methods. Unless they are contemplated a return to the construction techniques of the 1920s and 1930s, anyone who pontificates about huge savings to be had simply on the basis of reducing labour costs for construction projects (of the type that the deemed non-construction employers engage in) is deliberately misstating facts or is completely unaware of the modern day realities of our industry. Construction in Ontario is one of the most efficient and competitive industries in this country, and indeed in North America. The public tendering and bid process not only ensures that this is the case now but also ensures that it will continue to be so in the future.
The construction industry provisions of the LRA, as they currently exist, include various consensus developed compromises to ensure that labour relations in our industry and our collective agreements are not inflexible and/or uncompetitive. All employers have the opportunity to take advantage of provisions which allow for, and indeed encourage, variances to collective agreement provisions needed for efficiencies and competitiveness on either a project by project basis and/or for larger, systemic, issues. Many of the deemed non-construction employers that we are in bargaining relationships with take advantage of such flexibility on a regular basis. Accordingly, there is simply no current or pressing need for the draconian actions contemplated within Bill 66.
The lack of a relationship between the stated purpose of Bill 66 and the effect of Schedule 9 is perhaps made most clear by examining the current provisions of the LRA concerning non-construction employers. Those provisions were brought into effect in 2000 and have represented a compromise which all parties have been able to live with for the last 18 years. Quite simply, if a particular employer does not wish to be subject to the provisions of the LRA which apply to the construction industry, then that employer can achieve this result simply by not performing any construction work for compensation for a third party and thereafter applying to the Ontario Labour Relations Board to have it declared to be a non-construction employer. In this way, employers that do not wish to be, and are not in fact, part of the construction industry are not subject to the construction industry provisions of the LRA while the fairness of the level playing field for all construction industry employers is maintained and construction workers are not stripped of their rights. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the amendments proposed within Bill 66.
Based on all of the above, it is our position that the non-construction industry employer portions of Schedule 9 of Bill 66 are unfair, unnecessary, and will only weaken Ontario’s thriving construction industry. Therefore, we would seriously urge the Government to reconsider these portions of this Bill and significantly amend them if not remove them entirely.

19398,/comment/19398,"BILL66: MORALLY WRONG, UNDEMOCRATIC AND DANGEROUS
I want this message to ring the bell of danger. BILL66 undercuts every current hard-won “good” in Ontario civic, economic  and environmental life.
(A)	Morally wrong: (a) Even in the timing of the announcement of the bill, this was timed to sneak into public awareness – the Christmas/New Year rush and distraction wiped out the ordinary person’s awareness of the threat to our society embedded in the Bill. (b) A short time for citizens to react to the danger. (c) The Bill does not benefit the ordinary person. The Premier’s promise was to make life better for “The People”. But this Bill transparently plays to the benefit of developers, businessmen, and the rich who want to be richer. (d) You lied, Mr. Premier. Everyday life in Ontario will be a scene of chaos as the rich and powerful and greedy take over without any of the current protective laws in effect. (e) This bill is even titled with a lie: Business in Ontario is already open: functioning and doing relatively well. What is being protected is not the existing economy (functioning within traditions, expectations, today’s laws and equal opportunity).
(B)	Undemocratic: In a democracy, all individuals have equal access to health, safety, justice, and opportunity. This Bill openly creates opportunities for “business”, but simultaneously “pulling out the rug” of hard-won protections supporting the security of small businesses, the air all of us  breathe, the water we drink, and the securities of property and just protections in law. This Bill will affect physical health even of the bulldozing “businessmen” and their families. A sense of security and stability is part of physical and mental health, and would not exist under the takeover by the wealthy.
(C)	Dangerous: This Bill will create injustice, chaos and turmoil in society at large, while “Business” will have the right to undercut all familiar securities.  In Ontario currently and in other provinces, “the people” have a level of security of clean air and water, protection of private and public property, and accepted rights that cannot be bulldozed out of existence by government-approved bullying. Small businesses and individuals may move out of the province to regain security of health, property and social stability.
 Under this Bill, the transition from our usual limits and protections will be wiped out – chaos would surely ensue. Democracy is wiped out by this Bill: the already wealthy and secure could stage a takeover of all benefits of living in Ontario, while the ordinary citizen loses benefits of stable, protective laws to maintain equal benefits to all. The adjustment to the new set of takeover rights would be disruptive and grievous. So much for taking care of the “people”!!

19400,/comment/19400,"On behalf of the Board of Health for Peterborough Public Health I am writing to express my concerns with Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. If passed, this legislation could have deleterious effects on the health of our residents and all Ontarians. Given the risks to public health, I am hoping you will give serious reconsideration to some of the proposed changes.
One of the goals in the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2018 is to “reduce exposure to health hazards and promote the development of healthy built and natural environments that support health and mitigate existing and emerging impacts.” Our staff work with First Nations and area municipalities to achieve this goal and the changes proposed in Bill 66 stands would threaten this work. As it is currently drafted, the bill will allow municipalities to exempt proposed development from a wide range of planning and environmental protection legislation. This has the potential to open the door to large scale development in vulnerable areas which may threaten groundwater and surface water sources.
Furthermore, the successful passage or Bill 66 would result in the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and Regulation 455/09 on December 31, 2021. This Act, passed in 2009, increased the protection of the public and environmental health by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and informing Ontarians about toxic substances. I can attest that the historical chemical contamination of local soil and water continues to pose a health hazard and an outstanding health concern for present day residents here. Peterborough’s industrial legacy further demonstrates the need for a strong regulatory framework to protect the health of our community from toxic substances. Peterborough Public Health strongly urges the Ontario government to reconsider the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act.
It is deeply concerning that Bill 66 proposes to exempt Planning Act decisions from the source water protection section of the Clean Water Act, 2006. This section requires that land-use planning decisions protect drinking water sources from threats such as landfills, sewage systems, and the storage and handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organics solvents and other substances. Communities in Peterborough County and City, including Curve Lake and Hiawatha First Nations, rely upon both surface water and groundwater sources for their drinking water. The source water protection clause of the Clean Water Act arose from the recommendations of Justice O’Connor in the Walkerton Inquiry and is intended to prevent the type of source water contamination which occurred in Walkerton resulting in the death of seven residents and made over 2300 seriously ill.
Source water protection plans include a requirement to re-inspect sewage systems falling within source water protection zones. We partner with our area municipalities to deliver septic re-inspection programs for all sewage systems in those municipalities to ensure that sewage systems are working properly and to protect the health of residents. We work tirelessly to advocate for and implement these re-inspections programs and are alarmed by the potential of Bill 66 to allow development to occur in a source water protection area potentially negating the impact of our work.
In our review of the proposed changes in Bill 66, my staff and I believe that this legislation will dangerously weaken the source to tap regulatory framework currently in place which ensures the provision of safe and potable clean water for the residents we serve.

19403,/comment/19403,"Re.: Amend the Labour Relations Act, 1995 to explicitly deem public bodies, including municipalities, school boards, hospitals, colleges and universities, as “non-construction employers”.
Amending the Labour Relations Act, 1995 to explicitly deem public bodies, including municipalities, school boards, hospitals, colleges and universities, as “non-construction employers”, will not result in the cost savings Ontarians require. Reform of public sector procurement policies and procedures of construction and maintenance services is required.
As Ontarians, we are burdened by unprecedented government debt, government deficits, personal debt and rising interest rates. By 2030, Healthcare is projected to comprise 80% of the Provincial budget, leaving little room for the remaining operational expenses. Debt servicing is the 3rd largest government expense and risks being moved up on the budget in the event of increased government debt and/or higher interest rates.
Whereas construction industry purchasers and suppliers can continue to navigate the complexity of the public construction procurement and delivery process, resulting in higher costs to public sector construction, it serves our collective interests to move forward upon a new path. The Ontario government ought to investigate and resolve the causes of the public sector allegedly paying 40% more for construction and maintenance services should the Ontario government want an easy win on the path to reducing red tape and reducing public expenditures.
There is much to be learned from countries such as Scotland that embarked upon a process to improve public sector procurement based on a collaborative partnership approach between public sector and business that has resulted in a transformed public sector landscape with procurement today a lever for economic change.
In March 2006, the Scottish Government published the Review of Public Procurement in Scotland (the McClelland report). This concluded that public sector structures, people and technology were not in place to improve procurement. The report identified the opportunity to achieve significant, recurring financial savings across the public sector. Since 2006, the Scottish Government and Scotland Excel have launched several initiatives to improve procurement.
“The Scottish Government, Scotland Excel and councils reported total procurement savings of £71 million in 2012/13.”
“Audit Scotland estimated that, by the end of 2007 - 2008, the reform programme had directly delivered £327 million worth of savings and benefits. The Scottish Government's annual efficiency figures showed that, by 2009 - 2010, that figure had risen to almost £800 million.”
Recognizing the potential long-term cost savings by way of assisting municipalities with the supply of consultants to harmonize policies and procedures for completion of Asset Management Plans, it would be entirely appropriate for the Ontario government to move forward with the reform of public sector procurement policies and procedures of construction and maintenance services to achieve significant, recurring financial savings across the public sector.

We need to think about improving transit, growing more densely and finding new business models that aren't the same old, same old.
In addition to the threat that this Bill poses on the environment the archaeological and historical impact that it may have is nothing to snear at. Ontario  has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers. Archaeology gives a voice to many who have been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.

The people of Ontario have worked long and hard to implement reasonable regulations to protect their natural and built environments, their health and safety, and the security of their way of life. While it may be argued that some regulations create unnecessary red tape, any legislative changes should be specifically targeted to adjust the bureaucratic processes without losing the actual intent of existing laws. The new bill seems to be highly biased toward the desires of a very small elite of speculators and developers, while almost completely eliminating any chance for everyday Ontarians to have input in the planning process. While job growth is an important objective for government to facilitate, the people of Ontario do not want rampant uncontrolled growth that destroys the values we hold, the natural environment we love and enjoy, the environmental and health and safety protections we rely on, or the democratic processes by which we participate in governing ourselves.
Many of the provisions in the act would permit unilateral, irreversible, and incontestable changes in the fundamental character of Ontario. Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and deregulation of the Clean Waters Act would permit the potential fouling of water and soil resources on which Ontario depends for safe drinking water, safe food production into the future, and clean air on which we all rely. Notwithstanding pressures from agricultural and industrial lobbies who stand to increase short term profitability marginally from looser regulations, the long term effects of remediation or loss of agricultural land for the future, of making our water sources unfit for drinking or irrigation, and of health care expenses for treating environmental illness (e.g. E. coli poisoning in Walkerton, respiratory and cardiac conditions in northeast Hamilton) will all impose future costs on every Ontarian for the short term benefit of a few.
Provisions for overriding major components of the Planning Act and of the Provincial Policy Statement on planning would make a mockery of years of previous work in municipal planning. This work seeks to guide urban development in ways that not only provide for reasonable growth, but also make towns and cities healthier, more livable and more serviceable. The prevention of urban sprawl will, in the long term, provide major benefits to Ontario and Ontarians, by creating more efficient, less congested, and more environmentally sustainable cities, by preserving the farmland we need in a world of growing food instability and by providing ecological services such as cleaner air, groundwater recharge and healthy recreation opportunities. We absolutely need foresight and strong planning to manage the amount, location, timing, and long term impact of urban growth. Allowing either short-sighted municipal councils or profit-maximizing private speculators to drive the overall planning agenda is a recipe for future unsustainability, especially given the strong likelihood that climate change will exacerbate existing problems of stormwater management, transportation infrastructure, air quality, etc. over the coming decades.
Bill 66 opens too many loopholes through which a small minority of elites may irreversibly degrade the overall lives of a majority of Ontarians for short term greed in the name of job creation. At the very least, it needs the kind of very strong restrictive provisions that would be expected in any government legislation that permits for a small number of elected or non-elected individuals to override existing legislation. It needs far more specific and restricted definition of the character and number of long term, full time jobs that a project would have to create even to qualify for consideration, and it also needs far more requirement for public input into any such proposed overrides.

OPPI’s Preliminary Response to Proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act (EBR Registry Number: 013-4293), Proposed open-for-business planning tool (EBR Registry Number: 013-4125) and New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool (EBR Registry Number: 013-4239)
On behalf of the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI), I am submitting our preliminary response to the proposal for Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, and the associated “open-for-business” planning by-law tool and proposed regulations, which is currently at first reading in the legislative process.
OPPI is the recognized voice of Ontario’s planning profession and our over 4,500 Registered Professional Planners (RPPs). RPPs are the skilled, professional and dependable navigators that are employed to help lead communities towards the Ontario of tomorrow. RPPs are the local experts that bring together differing points of view, consult and develop recommendations that provide informed choices for decision-makers and elected officials. Like you, RPPs act in the public interest as professionals who work to improve the quality and livability of communities in Ontario today and their sustainability long-term. We are uniquely positioned to provide feedback on this legislation as RPPs live and breathe economic development and are often the first point of contact for developers looking to invest in communities across Ontario.
OPPI understands that the intent of Bill 66 is to provide municipalities with a Minister Zoning Order-like tool to capitalize on employment opportunities that are time sensitive. OPPI and our RPPs believe a robust economy is crucial to Ontario’s prosperity and having strong strategies and tools in place is vital. We also believe that economic development can be expedited while balancing social and environmental choices and consulting with the public and stakeholders.
While Bill 66 is at first reading and many details remain to be developed, OPPI believes that an “open-for-business” by-law is another tool in the planning toolbox and, when used appropriately, can position municipalities to be able to respond to those opportunities. We encourage the government to consider these changes as part of the larger planning reform it’s taking to ensure that municipalities continue to have the right tools to be responsive to economic development priorities as they emerge within the landscape.
OPPI’s understanding of this by-law:
As OPPI understands, the “open-for-business” by-law will complement policies and practices established for growth in the province today. Our understanding is that this tool is intended to expedite very specific, time-sensitive opportunities in communities that would provide broad community benefit. The key features as we understand it are:
•	The proposed regulation includes eligibility criteria for the applicability of the by-law, including a minimum job creation threshold of 50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000, or 100 jobs for municipalities with a population of more than 250,000 people.
•	The tool is intended to be applied narrowly, for major manufacturing or research and development uses only, not applications for residential, commercial or retail uses as a primary use.
•	A municipality would need to request to introduce this by-law in their community, and this would be subject to a ministerial approval.
•	As part of the ministerial review, the request would be shared with partner ministries and agencies.  We understand the Minister and partner ministries would review the request in the context of applicable provincial policies and may identify conditions/criteria of approval in order to meet provincial interests.
•	If provincial approval was obtained, and any conditions/criteria have been met, the municipality would then pass the “open-for-business” by-law and notify the public. It is also OPPI’s understanding that the Minister can rescind their approval up until the by-law comes into force.
This tool is not intended to address other issues municipalities are experiencing with respect to employment growth in their communities, specifically challenges with servicing industrial lands to produce “shovel-ready” projects. The province should consider this challenge as it reflects on what is needed to attract broader economic development and opportunities in Ontario.
Member Feedback on Bill 66
Given its significance, OPPI took the opportunity to survey our membership and gather their reaction to Bill 66. We received hundreds of responses in a variety of formats: survey, direct feedback and comments. Presented below is a snapshot of the results:
•	51 percent of respondents are planners employed by a local municipality and half of respondents come from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.
•	Close to 60 percent of respondents have more than 10 years of planning experience.
•	An overwhelming majority of respondents (77 percent) somewhat or strongly oppose the planning by-law tool.
•	An overwhelming majority of respondents (83 percent) somewhat or strongly agree that the “open-for-business” by-law would undermine key planning rules.
•	Approximately 60 percent of respondents believe an “open-for-business” by-law could be an acceptable tool but it must not undermine the integrity of planning.
•	Approximately 90 percent of respondents think the provincial government should slow down and consult further before creating this planning by-law tool.
OPPI’s survey invited comments and feedback from members which allowed them to articulate their thoughts on the proposed legislation. The feedback received indicates that they have concerns and questions in the following areas which relate to when the by-law could be used and how it is used. These concerns are directly rooted within the profession’s statement of values which require that Professional Planners balance social, economic and environmental interests when providing advice to decision-makers. OPPI’s thoughts are further reflected below:
1.	Consideration should be given to how this planning by-law could be used:
The current planning framework in Ontario encompasses many different pieces of legislation and documents. Within this framework, our members make their objective recommendations on planning matters in local communities across Ontario to inform local decisions. The following considerations should be given to how the planning by-law could be used:
•	Ensure the review process is fair and transparent.
•	Approval of large projects should be conditional on the availability or provision of services and infrastructure needed to accommodate them. This includes sanitary, water, storm and energy infrastructure as well as public transit and area amenities for employees.
2.	What is an appropriate job threshold to consider?
Ontario is a diverse province and a one-size-fits-all approach will not work given the different socio-economic experiences with many different regions and their various stages of growth. Feedback from OPPI’s membership suggests the employment threshold listed (50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000 people, or 100 jobs for municipalities with a population of more than 250,000 people) is low and does not align with the intent of the tool, which is to be applied to unique, major employment opportunities.
Municipalities should be given the opportunity to define major industrial and economic opportunities in their own communities. This could occur through the Official Plan similar to other enabling policies like the community planning permit process. In addition, there are some further considerations that need to be given to the job threshold:
•	Incorporate a clear distinction between employers offering full-time and part-time employment.
•	Ensure there is a monitoring system in place to monitor actual job creation realized after development.
•	It should be used for specific types of uses that are limited such as manufacturing, research and development, and not institutional, office, commercial, residential, etc.
3.	What is the process of applying the “open-for-business” by-law tool?
Our members raised concerns regarding the fit of this planning tool with existing local policies in addition to provincial policies and tools. These concerns are legitimate. The province should ensure this new tool balances economic, environmental and social goals and objectives at the provincial and local levels prior to decisions being made. Additional information and clarity is needed on this proposed legislation and its application to fully understand and comment on its ability to be successful in achieving the intended results. OPPI would recommend the province outline the intent and process to use the “open-for-business” by-law tool, in addition to the following recommendations:
•	Clarify the anticipated process and timeline associated with the Minister, staff and partner ministries review of any request.
•	Include an appeal mechanism for the by-law.
•	Consider a minimum threshold for public consultation. This could include posting requests from municipalities seeking to pass a by-law on the government’s Environmental Registry website and/or holding a public meeting in front of Council with an appropriate notice period, prior to municipal request to the Minister.
•	From a municipal perspective, allow flexibility for municipalities to prioritize economic, environmental and social objectives as part of the local planning process. This speaks to the legislative standards for implementation which are currently being considered through broader provincial planning reform.
•	The planning by-law tool may provide an unintended disincentive to municipalities to maintain their Official Plan policies and standards as it relates to employment land use. The government should consider requiring updates of Official Plan policies and zoning as a pre-condition of using this planning tool.
4.	Consideration must be given to ensure public health and safety:
Ontario has a robust framework to protect public health and safety. With the broad exemption powers given by the “open-for-business” planning by-law tool, and a lack of information and clarity on how the proposed legislation will work to protect public health and safety, there is uncertainty in terms of how public health and safety will be addressed and who will address it. In addition, consideration needs to be given to how issues in cases of opposing views between municipalities and the province will be resolved. OPPI welcomes additional information and clarity from the province on this matter, and we reserve final comment until we understand these details.
OPPI is happy to work with the government and consult further on this legislation. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with provincial staff to discuss our submission and broader legislative changes, and answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact OPPI’s Executive Director, Mary Ann Rangam, at 416-483-1873 or by email at executivedirector@ontarioplanners.ca.

19427,/comment/19427,"I am expressing my concern with, and opposition to, portions of the legislation tabled as Bill 66. While described as the 'Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act', there are potentially dire threats to the health of Ontario citizens if Bill 66 is enacted as written.
The tragedy that occurred in Walkerton in May of 2000 taught Ontarians many a harsh lesson regarding the need for protection of sources of drinking water across the province. In response to the events in Walkerton, the report from the judicial inquiry led by Justice O'Connor pointed out that, ""It is reasonable for all those in Ontario to expect that the government will do all it reasonably can to support a safe drinking water system.""
Bill 66 contains actions that are intended to allow businesses to create jobs by eliminating 'red tape and burdensome regulations.' This sounds much like that of the deregulation approach taken by the government leading up to, and according to Justice O'Connor, contributing to, the events in Walkerton.
The 2006 Clean Water Act was intended to follow directly from Justice O'Connor's Report and represent Ontario's best efforts to protect sources of clean drinking water across the province. To allow for section 39 of the Act to be overridden when considering some forms of proposed new development is ill advised and irresponsible.
Section 39 of the CW Act currently requires all land use planning decisions to conform to local source protection plans developed to protect community sources of drinking water. Any circumvention or requirements specified in these plans risks sacrificing public safety in the name of job creation and represents a course of action that would be misguided in the extreme.
I am urging the government to re-think Bill 66 and eliminate the portions of this piece of proposed legislation in Section 10 that could so negatively impact the health and well-being of Ontario citizens.

19434,/comment/19434,"What is this Ministry's definition of Environmental Protection? Where is the evidence that Bill 66 will protect source waters, the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, and other farm and natural areas? How does Bill 66 protect these areas from chemicals, illegal dumps, and from shrinkage that this Bill will open these areas up to? No where in these proposals are environmental improvements made clear. How does a government and a Ministry make policies without research and evidence? That is how this Bill was drafted: without regard to the latest research and evidence from policymakers and scientists.
In fact, there is a plethora of studies and evidence that shows how public waters and lands, farms and other natural areas, will be detrimentally impacted when irresponsible policies like Bill 66 are implemented.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. This is a travesty of a Bill.

Re: Comment on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
Dear Mr. Helfinger,
Thank you for the opportunity to offer comments on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.
The need to attract business and industry to municipalities is imperative for economic growth and prosperity. The need for intelligent, science-based planning is imperative. Under Bill 66, there is the potential for the development of industry in areas that may negatively affect the environment and drinking water sources.
The Sault Ste. Marie Region Source Protection Committee has concern with the portion of Schedule 10 of the proposed Act, under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.
In Sault Ste. Marie, the Source Protection Plan and the Official Plan identify and recognize the significant groundwater recharge area (SGRA). The particular characteristics of the region indicate that all municipal groundwater sources originate in the SGRA. Under the Clean Water Act, 2006 regulations, an SGRA cannot be classified as a significant threat. As such, any policies developed for the area are based on municipal planning components. Therefore, existing source protection policies can be directly affected through Schedule 10 of Bill 66 under which Section 39 provisions of the Clean Water Act 2006 do not apply.
As well, under Bill 66, this SGRA area could be exempt from existing planning requirements as per: “Allow municipalities to permit the use without having to strictly adhere to existing local requirements”.  In addition, the potential to remove the adherence to provincial policies and plans as noted in the EBR posting: “Remove the requirement for decisions to strictly adhere to provincial policies and provincial plans”.
The Source Protection Program of the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks has developed, in partnership with local Conservation Authorities across the province, detailed science-based Source Protection Plans. These Plans are in place to protect the integrity of municipal drinking water sources, prevent contamination and encourage municipalities to proactively plan for development.
Please consider withdrawing the reference to Section 39 provisions of the Clean Water Act, 2006 from the final legislation for the safety and security of municipal drinking water sources.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on Bill 66.

19439,/comment/19439,"I am a young professional living in Hamilton, and I care deeply about the Greenbelt, Lake Simcoe,  the Oak Ridges Moraine and clean water. It is home to farmland, forests, watersheds and wetlands. The Oak Ridges Moraine is the rainbarrel of Ontario providing drinking water to over 250,000 Ontarians and feeding many river and streams that flow into Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe.
The Greenbelt is also economically important.   Agriculture in the Greater Golden Horseshoe employes 38,000 people and gross output of farms is $11 billion, that’s $1.7 billion in tax revenue for all three levels of government. The Greenbelt provides $3.2B annually in services to the region, such as recreational activities and flood protection. It was created in 2005 to deliberately limit the rapid urban sprawl that was encroaching on land that is both environmentally and economically significant.
The Greenbelt has the capacity to store as much carbon dioxide as would be emitted by 33 million cars a year. Interfering with that crucial ecosystem means missing out on a chance to reduce our emissions and meet climate targets.
Greenbelt development is unnecessary for economic development. A recent Neptis Foundation study found more than 125,000 hectares of land in the GTA is currently available to accommodate growth through to 2031 and beyond.  If the province wants to allow a new business in Ontario they already have a tool for that, The Minister’s zoning order, they don’t need to allow municipalities to bypass environmental and health rules meant to protect us.
Bill 66 exempts developers from rules that are crucial to protecting human health.
For example, it undermines the Clean Water Act, which protects people from tragedies like the one that happened in Walkerton, where water contamination led to 7 deaths and thousands of cases of severe illness. The bill threatens vital water sources for Ontarians, including Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes. It also repeals the Toxics Reduction Act meant to reduce pollution by preventing industrial uses of certain toxic chemicals.
Your government did not get elected on this platform. After hearing from Ontarians that they did not want to see the Greenbelt threatened by development, your government wisely promised not to touch that land. Now, Ontarians want to see that commitment fulfilled.
According to a 2016 Nanos poll, 9 out of 10 Ontarians believe the province has a responsibility to ensure a healthy environment for all.By threatening both air and water quality, Bill 66 clearly violates that right.
As a municipal councillor, you have the power to stop the provincial government from interfering in local decision-making. Bill 66 imposes the provincial government’s political agenda on municipal decisions. By adopting a resolution not to use the Open for Business planning bylaw your municipality can send a clear message to your constituents and the province that you support business development but not at the expense of the environment.

19456,/comment/19456,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act, 2018. Upon review, two schedules appear to be of particular interest to the City of Kitchener.
Schedule 9 — Amendments to the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (Construction Employer Designation)
Kitchener's understanding is that Bill 66 would clarify that municipal governments are not construction employers. From a procurement perspective, Schedule 9 is a positive proposal. Currently, when Kitchener completes a tender for masonry work it is bound to use unionized masons because of this designation. The implementation of Bill 66 will remove this designation, opening-up the number of eligible bidders for these types of projects and ideally decreasing costs for the municipality.
Schedule 10 — Amendments to the Planning Act (‘Open For Business’ Tool)
Kitchener's understanding is that Bill 66 proposes introducing a new planning tool called ""open for business"" by-laws. Streamlining development approval processes is a key objective of its upcoming development services review, and in general speaks to the City’s commitment to improve customer service at-large through red tape reduction. To that end, the intent of Schedule 10 is both timely and relevant. The government’s goal to facilitate new, major employment uses is supported by Kitchener staff. The fact that the open for business by-law tool is intended to be optional for municipalities is also supported. However, the following observations are offered:
- It is unclear how the open for business tool will differ from a minister’s order. An opportunity may     be to simply enhance the minister’s order framework.
- Exemption from certain regulations through open for business by-laws may carry different risks from one municipality to another. For example, Section 39 of the Ontario Clean Water Act, 2006 is a much more significant consideration in ground water dependent communities like the Waterloo region. Allowing greater flexibility for municipalities to select which regulations can be exempt by an open for business by-law could elevate any disincentives in pursuing this tool. It is also noted, however, that municipalities that decide not to participate due to environmental protection concerns may still be negatively impacted due to cross-boundary environmental impacts.
- In many communities, employers of 50 to 100 jobs are far from the largest. It may be more advantageous to consider a higher threshold, such as one that would justify a minister’s order.
- It is not clear if the focus of this tool is on industrial/business park employers, which require major capital investments, or all employment categories. Consider making it clear that the focus is on industrial/business park employers.
Bill 66 was discussed at the January 14, 2019 meeting of Kitchener City Council.

The Constitution is set up to enable the residences of this country to have local governments to advocate for, and protect the region they live in.  Bill 66 will strip citizens of these Constitutional rights while potentially destroying the environment that so many Canadians have fought to protect.

RE:	Township of King Planning Department Report Number P-2019-02
Proposed Changes to Planning Act: Bill 66’ Open for Business By-law
Policy Planning File # PP-2018-07
________________________________________
Please be advised that at the Council Meeting of January 14, 2019, Council of the Township of King received and approved recommendations which were provided by the King Township Planning Department regarding an overview of the proposed changes to the Planning Act specifically “Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018”.
We respectfully submit the Council endorsed comments as outlined in Planning Department Report Number P-2019-02, a copy of which is attached for your information and file, which identifies comments and concerns King Township would like the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to take into consideration during the review process.
Summary of Comments to the Province on Bill 66:
1.	Bill 66 Review Process:
a.	Additional time for municipalities to adequately review Bill 66 is requested.
b.	Pre-conditions, prescribed criteria, and supporting information to be submitted are key matters, the details of which should be considered as part of the changes proposed by Bill 66 for municipalities to better understand how the OfB may be used.
c.	Draft regulations providing pertinent details are necessary to understand the open for business by-law framework, and should be made available.
2.	Exemptions from Provincial and Local Policy:
a.	The Province should consider a “hybrid approach” to provincial and local policy exemptions, whereby a municipality can determine which policy areas could be reasonably exempted and which ones need to be considered on a site-specific basis.
b.	Clarification is required as to how lands subject to an OfB would be designated under a municipal Official Plan if official plan conformity is not required, particularly where the existing designation differs from that which would typically be required.
c.	Clarification is required as to how the lands subject to an OfB would be zoned. Would the existing zone remain in place with a site-specific exception, or would the OfB rezone the lands to an appropriate employment zone?
3.	Site Plan Control:
a.	Matters such as architectural detail and sustainable design are as important as other aspects included in municipal review of site plans. Bill 66 should allow municipalities to apply these requirements to developments approved under an Open for Business By-law.
4.	Public Consultation:
a.	The Province should require public consultation to be conducted as part of the consideration of an OfB.
5.	Process:
a.	Discretion should be provided through language in Bill 66 to enable municipalities to assess which exemptions from policy sections or plans may be appropriate as part of the OfB process on a case-by-case to reduce barriers to attracting business. Full exemptions from all Provincial and local policies may act as a deterrent to the use of the open for business tool.
6.	Permitted Uses
a.	The Province should include language in Bill 66 itself pertaining to which uses would be permitted under an Open for Business By-law.
7.	Open for Business By-law
a.	Clarification is required as to whether typical zoning provisions (i.e. setbacks; coverage; height; etc.) can be included in an OfB.
b.	Is the municipality able to revoke the OfB at its sole discretion in such cases where the use specifically permitted by an OfB relocates or goes out-of-business? Additional information and clarification is required.
c.	Clarification is required as to whether a future property owner is able to apply to amend the OfB for a use that was not originally intended to be permitted under Bill 66 (i.e. retail or residential)? If so, what would be the amendment process (a typical official plan and/or zoning by-law amendment process under the Planning Act)?
8.	Provincial Approval of Open for Business By-law:
a.	The Province should confirm what the prescribed criteria will entail. This information would be helpful to inform municipalities’ review of Bill 66 and should be made available.
b.	The Province needs to provide details respecting the municipality’s recourse in the event that the Minister’s modifications to a municipal OfB are not satisfactory to the municipality. Confirmation is required as to whether the OfB be immediately revoked by the municipality?
c.	Additional language should be added to Bill 66 to state explicitly that a decision of a municipality not to enact an OfB cannot be appealed to or reviewed by any court.
In addition to the comments above, contained in Report P-2019-02, please accept the following comment identified at the Council Meeting of January 14, 2019 for the Province’s consideration:
Additional Comment: The Clean Water Act, 2006 is significant legislation, the intent of which is the protection of existing and future water sources, and public safety. To this end, the reference to the Clean Water Act in subsection 34.1(6) of Schedule 10 to Bill 66 should be removed.
The formal Letter to the Honourable Steve Clark, and Township of King Planning Department Report No. P-2019-02 are attached in support of the above submission.

Dear Premier Ford and Members of Provincial Parliament,
As a constituent of Ontario, I have deep concerns about many aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The proposed legislation would override critical requirements under several provincial laws and policies that are designed to protect water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, accessible and transparent public engagement in decision-making, and sets the stage for costly property tax increases to subsidize economically-inefficient, sprawling development. Also with our climate change crisis, Bill 66 undermines our ability to preserve natural green space and protect ground water and surface water resources, and will promote carbon intensive development. Let me ask you...do you have children or grandchildren? Do you think about the long term impacts of such reckless policy and development on future generations...your children and grandchildren? All the hard work over years to enact policies that are here to protect us...you...and safeguard public and private interests throughout Ontario cast aside to line the pockets of corporations that are only concerned about their bottom lines.
I urge you not to proceed with Bill 66, for the reasons outlined below.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning by-laws that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies, and in municipal official plans. The potential negative impact is far-reaching and profound. For example, policies that would not apply in “open-for-business” zoning by-law areas include:
• Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems). Do you want another Walkerton?
• Those protecting farmland, provincially significant wetlands, woodlands, valley lands and habitat of species at risk. This is so important to preserve as part of our diverse habitat.
• Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency. So, so important!
• Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
• Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
• Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed; and
• Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario. A 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water. Is this not what you want? Is this not what you want for your children and grandchildren?
Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with needed flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and influential developers. This is so sad!
The vulnerability of Ontarians is heightened by the fact that “open-for-business” zoning by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Compounding the problem, communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them. Certainly not very democratic is it? Put the shoe on the other foot. You were voted in to represent us, not yourselves.
Contrary to the government’s contention that Bill 66 cuts regulations that are out of date, almost all the laws and policies affected were recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation. They include the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Toxic Reduction Act, 2009, the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, the Provincial Policy Statement (revised in 2014) and the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Growth Plan for the Great Golden Horseshoe (all revised in 2017). Municipal plans themselves are to be updated every five or ten years.
The modern land-use planning and land conservation framework now in place in Ontario was developed over the years by governments of varying political stripes. For example, early work to limit sprawl through Smart Growth, and the establishment and protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine were signature achievements of Progressive Conservative governments. Undermining that legacy would be a huge step backwards.
Finally, there is no evidence of a need to make more employment lands available for development of new businesses or associated commercial, retail or residential development, which is the ostensible purpose of “open-for-business” zoning by-laws. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal councils and planners (e.g., Sudbury, Waterloo, Kitchener, Wilmot, Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Bradford, Mulmur, Ajax, Wellesley, Puslinch, Whitchurch Stouffville, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about its implications and/or have pointed out the presence of significant employment land surpluses within their respective municipalities. Many of these municipalities have also passed resolutions opposing this Bill.
Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong, progressive government leadership. We should strive to be the role-model or set the bar for all other provinces and countries, for that matter, on how to live sustainably, protect our people, and protect our environments but unfortunately Bill 66 is regressive, dirty, and undemocratic. “Open-for-business” by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening farmland, water resources and sensitive natural features upon which we all rely. I urge all Members of the Provincial Parliament to vote against Bill 66.

19465,/comment/19465,"I am writing to you to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt and therefore call back legislature and introduce a new Bill 66 that stops the attacks on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important protected farm and natural areas to development.
During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever. Please keep your promise and change Bill 66.
Thank you,

The language surrounding Bill 66 and the Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan, lacks language that protects any of the sensitive protected areas and allows for the government to arbitrarily approve whatever development they deem appropriate; like the government's recent return to pay to access fundraising, they will keep their friends close and ignore the legacy of the protected areas of Ontario.

19480,/comment/19480,"The Clean Water Act was enacted by the Province to implement recommendations from Justice O’Connor’s inquiry into the Walkerton Tragedy, when seven people died and over twenty-five hundred people became sick from contaminated drinking water in 2000.  This important piece of legislation forms the legal framework to protect sources of drinking water in Ontario from drinking water threat activities, and is the first step in the multi-barrier approach the Province has established to ensure Ontario residents have reliable and safe drinking water.
The Town of Orangeville (Orangeville) is concerned about the implications that the Bill 66 may have on its municipal drinking water supplies.  Allowing an Open-for-business planning by-law to be passed without the requirement for consideration of Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, or allowing the Risk Management Official to impose restrictions on a development proposal until it reaches the Building Permit stage, could adversely affect the sustainability of Orangeville’s drinking water supplies.
Section 39 of the Clean Water Act requires that Planning Act applicants address Planning Approval Authority policies in the local source protection plan through the Planning approval process with the local municipality.  In Orangeville, the Planning Approval Authority policies focus on a requirement to maintain pre-development recharge in the significant water quantity risk area.  By not requiring a developer to maintain pre-development groundwater recharge, available drinking water supplies in Orangeville may diminish to the point that there may be insufficient water supply to meet the future needs of residents.
Bill 66 will exempt a development from requiring traditional Planning Act applications. This exemption would also remove the Risk Management Official’s authority to screen the development proposal against policies created in accordance with Part IV of the Clean Water Act (i.e. requirement for risk management plans and/or prohibitions).  This is a critical step in any new development application, as the developer may need to modify their plans so that a new significant drinking water threat activity is not established within a source protection vulnerable area.  Without the Risk Management Official screening at the Planning Act application stage, the developer may need to make significant and costly changes when they apply for a Building Permit.  Section 59 of the Clean Water Act gives the Risk Management Official the authority to prevent the development from proceeding past the Building Permit stage if it does not satisfy the Part IV policies in the source protection plan.
Orangeville recognizes that Bill 66 includes a condition that would allow the municipality passing an Open-for-business planning by-law to impose conditions that the municipality determines are necessary to protect public health and safety.  This tool could be used to protect Orangeville’s municipal water supplies from development threats; however, significant portions of Orangeville’s wellhead protection areas extend beyond its municipal boundaries and therefore beyond its authority.  An Open-for-business planning by-law enacted by a neighbouring municipality may not impose the same conditions to protect Orangeville’s drinking water supplies.  Without the Provincial oversight and requirement to protect all municipal water supplies under the Clean Water Act, Orangeville will now be relying on the goodwill and discretion of its neighbours to protect its municipal drinking water supplies.  This is a significant gap in Bill 66 that should be addressed if it is enacted.
Orangeville is concerned that Bill 66 will put municipal drinking water supplies at risk.  The Province committed to implementing all one-hundred and twenty-one of Justice O’Connor’s recommendations so that another tragedy such as the one in Walkerton in 2000 would not happen again.  Bill 66 backs away from this commitment and opens the door for a breakdown in the multi-barrier approach to safe drinking water.  If Bill 66 is enacted as legislation, it should be revised to eliminate exemptions to the Clean Water Act to ensure Ontarians have safe and reliable drinking water now and in the future.

19481,/comment/19481,"The following comments are provided by staff of the City of Kingston Planning Division regarding the amendments proposed to the Planning Act by Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. Schedule 10 of Bill 66 proposes to amend the Planning Act to add a new Section 34.1, which would allow local municipalities to pass open-for-business planning by-laws.
The open-for-business planning by-law would be exempt from several Planning Act requirements that typically govern the passage of zoning by-laws, such as the Provincial Policy Statement and municipal Official Plans. Staff do not support these broad exemptions as they have the potential to negate the long-term vision for land use planning and development established in the City’s Official Plan as well as the policy direction established in the Provincial Policy Statement.
Additionally, staff have concerns as the proposed changes could potentially result in municipalities bypassing policies designed to protect drinking water resources and the environment (such as the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, the Greenbelt Act, 2005, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, and the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008).
The proposed framework to approve an open-for-business planning by-law would allow municipalities to bypass the public consultation process that is typically required for a zoning by-law amendment. Staff have concerns regarding this approach as it is contrary to Kingston City Council’s commitment to transparency and citizen engagement as an initiative under its Open Government priority. Further, it weakens the democratic planning approvals process currently required under the Planning Act which is intended to support enhanced public engagement in planning matters.

19484,/comment/19484,"The Province of Ontario’s proposed Bill 66 threatens our province's water quality and supply, agricultural and rural communities, natural ecosystems, and the continued smart growth of its urban cores. The bill would permit municipalities to allow business developments that don't follow laws that protect our water, agriculture, and community development plans.
As the bill allows developers to bypass agricultural protections, it threatens our local economy and our provincial food supply.
Of particular concern is Schedule 10 which adds section 34.1 to the Planning Act. If approved, this would allow particular types of development to be unilaterally approved by a municipality without regard for environmental impacts or impacts to a neighbouring municipality. This is a tool that creates division and reduces transparency of governance and allows for an erosion of protections. It removes a set of tools we have at a  municipal level to ensure that we leave keep the long term health of our environment ahead of corporate interest.
With respect to more local concerns in the Waterloo Region where I reside, in 1989, toxic chemicals were found in the groundwater underneath the Uniroyal Chemical site in Elmira. Experts say it will be decades before Elmira's water is safe to drink again. Bill 66 would allow the Province to override the Region of Waterloo’s Official Plan policies that were established to prevent similar toxic destruction of our drinking water. Limiting sprawl is of particular importance in Waterloo Region, where 75% of drinking water comes from aquifers located just beyond the Countryside Line. The Proposed Amendments to the Planning Act as set out in Bill 66 fail to adequately protect human health and safety and in particular the safety of the Region of Waterloo’s drinking water resources.
I am particularly alarmed that Bill 66 removes the requirement for public notice and public meetings with opportunity for community input, as well as the opportunity to appeal the decision. This is not good governance.
I reject Bill 66’s implicit suggestion that to grow the economy and add jobs we must accept environmental degradation, pave over farms, and risk the health of our families. While growth is important for a thriving economy, it can happen in ways that encourage good governance, prioritize environmental protections and respect the importance of agricultural land use.
I strongly urge the Ontario Government to reconsider these portions of Bill 66.

The limitation of urban sprawl is also important. Centres for living, employment, business and recreation must be dispersed to limit endless expansion of roads by making these activities possible locally. A long term view looking ahead several generations needs to be taken.

19492,/comment/19492,"There are a few major concerns within the bill for me. I don't believe removing the ""Toxic Reduction"" act is a good idea, it is important that we work towards being more environmentally friendly and business friendly. This goes the same for opening up areas within the greenbelt to businesses, that is a ridiculous idea. There are many other areas that are sufficient for our needs to build as a province.
The other issue is increasing the number of children that an at home care provider can take on. If this means increasing the ratio of children to adults, that is unsafe and potentially dangerous towards the children. Taking care of two/three children is hard enough, day care services have a much higher ratio of that already.

19496,/comment/19496,"Recommendations to Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO #013-4239, ERO #013-4125, ERO #013-4293) by the Quinte Region Source Protection Committee Regarding Bill 66
 (An Act to Restore Competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts)
1.	Preamble
1.1 This presentation to the Environmental Registry of Ontario on recommended amendments to Bill 66 addresses the protection of drinking water sources exclusively.
1.2 Bill 66 was introduced to reduce red tape and regulatory burden in order to make it easier for businesses to create jobs. The Quinte Region Source Protection Committee understands the objective of the Bill 66; however, the Quinte Region Source Protection Committee is concerned that the Clean Water Act is included in Schedule 10 of Bill 66.  The Committee is also concerned about the lack of detail regarding implementation of Bill 66, in particular with regard to the protection of drinking water sources.
1.3 The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and the companion Clean Water Act (CWA) were enacted, in part, because of Justice O’Connor’s findings that the major contributing causes to the Walkerton Tragedy were that: a) there was no mechanism to control the quality of the source water, b) local politicians placed the financial considerations of Walkerton’s water supply as more important than public health, and c) the provincial government of the time had  reduced its direct involvement in the provision of drinking water.
1.4 From the information received to date (see documents reviewed below), under Bill 66 the events in Walkerton could be repeated. If financial considerations are the main factors impacting decision-making, the result could be a waiving of drinking water source protection with no local input. While bylaws under the act require provincial approval, it is unknown the extent to which the province will require municipalities to rationalize not conforming to Source Protection Plans when considering bylaws and additionally, the extent to which the province itself would have regard for the impact of the bylaw on protecting drinking water sources.
2. Aim
2.1 The aim of this presentation is to provide the province with recommendations for consideration regarding Bill 66.
3. Factors for Consideration
3.1 All new acts make provision for regulations to be made as part of the act. From the public’s point of view such regulations, while they are published for comment, are subsequently passed or rejected without public debate.  Bill 66 as proposed, makes mention of a future regulation, but does not provide details. Rather, it has been left open for regulations or changes that may significantly affect drinking water source protection measures, with the result that detailed impact of the Bill 66 cannot be known nor therefore commented upon at this time.
3.2 It is indicated in the preamble that the SDWA and the CWA were enacted in recognition that the Walkerton Tragedy was, in part, caused by a lack of control of the drinking water source, a lack of interest in drinking water quality by local governance and a diminished provincial role in the provision of safe drinking water. Bill 66 risks establishing a recurrence of the same set of circumstances.
3.3 Investigations in the form of engineering reports and Ministry inspections following the Walkerton Tragedy revealed that there were similar situations close to occurring throughout the province. As such the SDWA and the CWA were enacted to provide safeguards to safe drinking water throughout the province. Diminishing or reducing the impact of either act increases the risk to public drinking water supplies regulated by these pieces of legislation. It is recognized that simplifying procedures for development proposals may be attractive to business interests; however risking public health by not regulating source protection is counterproductive.
3.4 Since Bill 66 does not repeal Section 19 of the SWDA, if persons named in the section (including councillors) enact a bylaw that attracts development but leads to putting the public at risk they may be subject to the penalties of the act. This may leave councillors and senior municipal staff in danger of violating the SDWA even when such bylaws are passed and agreed to by the province.
3.5 Source Protection Plans (SPPs) are science-based and reflect local conditions. The plans were locally developed by representatives of the public, industry and commerce and local governments. These plans, and supporting reports, were all subject to numerous public consultations throughout all stages of development and approval. SPPs have been endorsed through bylaw or resolution under local procedural bylaws by the municipalities to which the plans apply. These procedural bylaws typically require public notice of proposed changes to resolutions or bylaws. Nothing in Bill 66 allows for bypassing a procedural bylaw that endorsed the source protection plan. While Bill 66 may permit a bylaw to be passed without notice, the public will be notified in accordance with the municipal procedural bylaw(s). As such, regardless of Bill 66 as written, public notification will be provided. Waiving the requirement to adhere to source water protection plans is not in the interest of the municipality.
3.6 The areas designated in SPPs as vulnerable to significant drinking water threats represent a small portion of the land which is likely to be attractive for potential development. As such, applying Bill 66 to these lands will not appreciably increase the area to which municipalities will wish to attract development but may well place risks to drinking water safety. If something were to go wrong and the source of drinking water became contaminated, the costs involved would far outstrip the benefits from any development. Additionally, the objective of Bill 66 is already enshrined in the CWA under Section 39(3).
3.7 Development proposals in the United States are subject to environmental constraints similar to those in Ontario, although the process may be less arduous.  Business interests however, indicate that a rationale for locating in the USA is primarily based upon tax advantages offered by municipalities. As such avoidance of a source protection plan would not be a reason for development.
3.8 The Bill does not propose changes to other acts and regulations that provide measures of protection for drinking water, such as the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), the Ontario Water Resources Act (OWRA), The Drainage Act (DA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and The Technical Standards and Safety Act. These acts all have associated “instruments” that are relied upon in SPPs. The drinking water risks that are mitigated by these acts would remain in effect, with the exception of changes to Permits to Take Water (PTTW) which is discussed in the subsequent paragraph. Since the provisions of these acts upon which parts of source protection plans rely would remain in effect, there is no advantage to ignoring SPPs as a means to attract development.
3.9 The Government of Ontario’s for the People Cutting Red Tape mentions the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) in terms of permits to take water, storm and sanitary sewers and MISA regulations. It does not mention that drinking water may be placed at risk. In addition, the press release mentions Permits to take Water but only in terms of facilitating construction where water is pumped from a source and then immediately returned. In the latter case, as part of the project Environmental Assessment (EA), there will still be a requirement to consider drinking water source protection. Indeed Bill 66 does not repeal any acts or regulations requiring an environmental assessment, therefore any development may be subject to the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) and presumably would not be able to bypass the expense and time to conduct an environmental assessment. This provides some further assurance (but no guarantee) of protection of Drinking Water Sources.
Bill 66 does not address provincial instruments that regulate wastewater effluents (quality or flows). Thus municipalities must be cognizant of the impact of any new development that would jeopardize their waste treatment instruments. Attracting development that could lead to violating these instruments would not be in the interest of the municipality. This would negate any positive aspects of ignoring source protection measures.
Many drinking water sources in the Quinte Source Protection Region have been negatively impacted by commercial/industrial development in the past. Consequently, the Quinte Region Source Protection Committee is sensitive to situations which may repeat these occurrences and views the provisions of Bill 66 regarding source water protection with great concern. Examples of these situations are:
•	a municipal well in the Village of Madoc that had to be abandoned because of hydrocarbon contamination;
•	threats to the Picton Water Treatment Plant as the result of a fuel spill at a development for salt storage;
•	the contamination from a landfill site near the Belleville Water Treatment Plant; and
•	the groundwater and surface water contamination at an industrial property, metres away from the Bay of Quinte water source for the Town of Picton.
3.11 It is noted that Bill 66 does not apply to residential development and therefore residential development would remain under the requirements of Source Protection Plans.
3.12 Bill 66 only applies to development that will create more than 49 jobs in areas where the population is less than 250,000 people, which would apply to all municipalities in the Quinte Region. While the possibility of such development within the Quinte Region’s source protection Wellhead Protection Areas and Intake Protection Zones is likely of low possibility and given that there are ample options for such development outside source protection areas, there should be no need for municipalities in the region to consider the need for development that would violate Section 39 of the CWA. In addition developers of any new modern commercial and industrial complexes are unlikely to consider moving ahead without a thorough understanding of the associated risks. While this does not guarantee that drinking water sources will not be put at risk by such development, it does demonstrate that there will be an added cost.
Recommendations
Whereas source protection zones and areas in the Quinte Region where the impact of Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would apply are limited and development that could put drinking water at risk is unlikely to be attractive to such developers; and whereas it is paramount to avoid another “Walkerton”, by recognizing that protecting safe drinking water must take precedence over financial considerations,
The Quinte Region Source Protection Committee therefore recommends:
a) that Bill 66 be amended to remove Section (6) 6. of Schedule 10 of Bill 66 (An Act to Restore Competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts),
b) that if Schedule 10 remains in Bill 66, where a municipality passes a bylaw under the terms of Bill 66 that could impact an approved Source Protection Plan, a regulation be put in place requiring the province to publish a record of its review/approval proceedings and
c) that any approvals granted under Bill 66 be subject to appeal.
Sincerely,
M.G (Max) Christie
Chair, Quinte Region Source Protection Committee

This bill is not for ‘the little guy’ in ON, Doug Ford; this is for the benefit of developers and the elite who will profit from it to the detriment of the environment.
Infrastructure to get to the new urban sprawl will affect everyone through taxes and loss of farmland. Yet the current infrastructure of our cities is in dire need of attention.

During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.

19512,/comment/19512,"Our organization, the Midland/Penetanguishene Field Naturalists Club, has grave concerns about the proposed Bill 66, and specifically Schedule 10. Yes, we need more employment in Midland and Penetanguishene, and we support the government’s desire to create more jobs, but we don’t believe that encroaching on farmland and natural heritage is the way to go. Simcoe County has a surplus of appropriately designated employment land. This would be devalued if landowners have the option of converting previously protected land.
 We share the same misgivings as numerous other environmental, conservation and grassroots community groups who have outlined the harm that could be done by this bill. The Acts it will override, namely Greenbelt Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, Clean Water Act and Planning Act, have been implemented in the past years to protect valuable green spaces and farmland from development, and are not “red tape” to be brushed aside when certain interests see fit.
In our area of north Simcoe County we have seen a large increase in new residents from the GTA. Our club is concerned that the Open For Business bylaws, while focused on employment, also offer an opportunity for more housing to be added. When it comes to residential development, existing residents pay the cost through increased taxes, with the need for more infrastructure and demand for improved services.
We also question giving municipalities the power to approve new developments, with no public input or recourse. This is totally unfair and will result in acrimony amongst community members.
Another issue of concern for our club is the health and stability of our water and the pure aquifers that provide much of our area with clean drinking water. One such aquifer has its recharge area in the Waverley Highlands and supplies wells in the south of Tiny Township with some of the purest water in the world. This aquifer and others like it would be threatened by developments built over them and concerned citizens would not have to be notified of such plans.
Our club asks that you remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66 as it will prove detrimental to all the protections Ontario currently has in place.

Dear Mr. Helfinger and Mr. Petersen,
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018;    013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New  Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
The Couchiching Conservancy is a regional land trust, based near Orillia, which has been involved in the protection of over 13,000 acres of significant habitats in North Simcoe and adjacent areas over the past 25 years.  Most of our activity is focused on securement of significant lands, the use of conservation easements to limit future uses on private properties, and voluntary stewardship projects to protect or improve habitats in cooperation with willing landowners.  We rarely comment on provincial or municipal legislation; however, we feel compelled to register our serious concerns about Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.
Our concerns include four primary facets:
1.	The provisions outlined in Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would exempt eligible business developments from a wide range of environmental protection provisions, and have the potential to result in the destruction of significant wetlands, habitats of endangered species, significant woodlands, and high-value landscapes such as the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Greenbelt.  This approach will result in a loss of biodiversity in southern Ontario, a loss of ecological connectivity, and decreased ability to respond to the increasing impacts of climate change.  Ontario is well below national and international targets for the amount of various habitat types on the landscape, and both government agencies and non-profit groups such as the Couchiching Conservancy are devoting significant efforts towards landscape protection and restoration.  Bill 66 would undercut those efforts and result in further loss of ecological assets already at critical levels.
2.	The provisions within Bill 66 give unfettered priority to business interests above all other values, especially by exempting eligible business projects from municipal Official Plans and Provincial planning policies.  Those planning instruments are the result of years of discussion and debate, in the process creating a balance among competing interests and a guide to responsible decision-making.  Especially at the local level, planning policies are a concrete expression of local values and priorities, set within a decision-making system that provides consistency and fairness among applicants for major land use change.  Bill 66 will essentially throw out that balance, the product of provincial governments from the days of Premier Bill Davis onwards, and ignore the wishes of local governments and citizens.  Its favouritism to expanding business at any cost may well result in a “race to the bottom”; as some municipalities choose to adopt the “open for business” by-laws, adjacent areas will be under great pressure to do so as well in order to not be at a competitive disadvantage.
3.	The Province has failed to make a reasonable case as to the need for the sweeping provisions of Bill 66.  While we recognize that new jobs will always be needed, the current Ontario unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 18 years.  A recent review by Simcoe County found no shortage of available employment lands; in fact, the amount of such lands has grown significantly over the past decade.  We have seen no fact-based justification to suggest that a shortage of available lands is a constraint to locating new businesses in Ontario.
4.	Bill 66 allows municipalities to adopt “open for business” by-laws without public notice or opportunity provide input, and removes any right of appeal for decisions made under those by-laws.  These are fundamental limitations on the rights of citizens to communicate their views and to object when necessary to demand a second look at contentious decisions.
Based on these concerns, we believe that Bill 66 and the associated regulations should not be enacted without substantial amendments to incorporate environmental and health protection, a clear justification for need, and restoration of a balanced approach among competing values and effective provisions for public input on decisions.

Mark Bisset,

19516,/comment/19516,"Re: Schedule 10 of Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act
The Ecological Farmers Association of Ontario (EFAO) is deeply concerned about Article 10 of Bill 66 because it has the potential to convert prime agricultural land to other uses and accelerate the loss of productive farmland in Ontario.
The EFAO is an educational non-profit organization with over 500 farmer members across Ontario. For 40 years, EFAO has been providing opportunities for farmer-to-farmer training and mentorship. Our members are passionate about producing healthy food and protecting the environment through the use of farming practices that regenerate the soil, water and biodiversity, eliminate waste and pollution, and reduce energy consumption.
Our members run prosperous farm businesses that focus almost exclusively on the local market, creating jobs, providing high-quality food to Ontarians and building sustainable rural economies. We believe that the best way to create jobs on prime farmland is to promote profitable and productive farms, not to subvert the policies and regulations put in place to protect farmland. The fact that Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass ""open for business” bylaws without any public consultation, without regard to any planning laws or water protection and with no right of appeal, is particularly worrying for our members.
Agricultural lands in Ontario are a precious resource that is already under threat from development. Our member-farmers across the province want to see their lands protected for future generations of farmers, and for all Ontarians.

19519,/comment/19519,"The Algonquin to Adirondack Collaborative is an environmental charity which works to protect wildlife and to maintain habitat connectivity for wildlife through the broad region from Algonquin Park in Ontario to the Adirondack Park in New York State. We have over 50 partner organizations and 250 members who support our vision and work with us on a variety of projects including Conservation Action Planning and mitigating the effects of road corridors on wildlife. We envision an Algonquin to Adirondacks region that is resilient, with an ecologically connected landscape which sustains a full range of native wildlife.
http://www.a2acollaborative.org/
The negative impact of open-for-business by-laws is far-reaching and profound in the Ontario region of the Algonquin to Adirondacks Corridor. In each case they would override key operative provisions in the laws listed in Schedule 10, undermining fair and consistent application of laws and policies designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage, farmland and watershed health across Ontario, and leaving communities open to unchecked development. For example, policies that would not apply in open-for-business by-law areas include:
•	Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems);
•	Those protecting provincially significant wetlands, woodlands and valley lands and habitat of species at risk;
•	Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency;
•	Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, open-for-business by-laws would bypass legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act) designed to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land-use decisions in our communities. Open-for-business by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
Further, Bill 66 would allow Cabinet (not the Legislature) to add other legal provisions to the list of those in Schedule 10 to be circumvented by open-for-business by-laws, an approach which limits opportunities for transparent public consideration and debate.
Finally, we question whether there is demand from municipalities for open-for-business by-laws, ostensibly proposed by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 at Queen’s Park many municipalities indicated that they have a surplus of employment lands and would like to see these rezoned for residential. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal leaders (e.g., in Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about open-for-business by-laws and the circumvention of laws that protect drinking water, farmlands and natural areas and ensure public input and transparency in decision-making.
In conclusion, the A2A corridor represents a critical ecological link that provides the connectivity required to maintain important ecological functions, biodiversity and wildlife movement.  Regional ecological connectivity is also a key feature in protecting the landscape against climate change as species move to adapt to changing climatic conditions. If passed and implemented at the municipal level, Bill 66 represents a serious threat to the ecological integrity and connectivity in the A2A corridor as protection for wetlands and other environmental values are bypassed in the interests of open-for-business zones which municipalities have not been asking for or suggesting are necessary for good public planning or policy.
A high quality and protected natural environmental is critical not only for wildlife and ecological functions, but for our own quality of life.  It should not be set aside in the interests of unnecessary “open-for-business” provisions such as those contained in Bill 66.

1) Receive the report for information purposes;
2) Recommend that a copy of this report be provided to the County of Grey as the City’s preliminary Comment on Bill 66;
3) Recommend that a copy of this report be provided to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs as the City’s preliminary comment on Bill 66; and
4) Recommend that a copy of this report be provided to MPP Bill Walker.
Report Conclusions:
The proposed Planning Act changes appear to be ‘one time band-aide’ solutions, that do not appear to address the root of the perceived problem.
If the current planning process is an impediment to economic growth, then the province and municipalities can collectively work together to fix the process, rather than permit ‘one off’ exemptions on a case-by-case basis in scattered municipalities throughout the province. By amending the process for all development, rather than superseding it for certain uses, it could ‘level the playing field’ for all employers and developers (at least from a planning process perspective), while creating efficiencies in all municipalities. Having a more efficient process could also reduce costs for taxpayers generally and for developers specifically, which may help provide for more affordable or attainable housing.
Some potential solutions, which could be achieved at the municipal level, include but are not limited to:
a) Ensuring that official plans and zoning by-laws are up-to-date, and flexible, to minimize the individual burden on innovative new businesses (i.e. to prevent unnecessary proponent-initiated official plan amendments etc.);
b) Ensuring an adequate supply of available pre-zoned, shovel ready employment lands;
c) Streamlining development review between departments and agencies (including provincial), such that when a new employer ‘comes to town’ their site plans can be reviewed in an expeditious fashion;
d) Having a Community Improvement Plan (CIP) in place to provide incentives to new or growing businesses, or the re-use of brownfield sites;
e) Ensuring municipal documents such as community profiles remain up to date; and
f) Providing an ‘open-for-business’ pre-submission consultation process, consisting of planning, engineering/operations, and economic development, which provides timely data and information for any given site.
Some municipalities, outside of Grey County, have already stated that they have no intention to use this tool. In creating a tool which is only used by some municipalities to by-pass local planning documents, it has the ability to create competition between municipalities, with increased advantages to those who use the tool. These ‘advantages’ could result in decisions which ‘undo’ years of land use and infrastructure planning such as the negative ramifications outlined in the case study in the Background section of this report.
At the provincial level, the policy framework has seen significant evolution over the past 5 years and municipalities with limited resources are struggling to keep policy documents up to date and flexible to respond to the changes.  An example of just some of the changes:
- Bill 36, Cannabis Statute Law Amendment Act, 2018
- Bill 139 (proclaimed 2018) Building Better Communities and Conserving Watersheds Act, 2017
- Bill 73 (proclaimed 2016) Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, 2015
- Bill 7 (2016) Promoting Affordable Housing Act. 2016 (inclusionary Zoning regulation available 2018)
- Provincial Plans Review resulted in revisions to the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Niagara Escarpment Plan, Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2017)
- Provincial Policy Statement, 2014
When new Official Plans are adopted there is a time lag to obtain feedback or approval from the province.  At times, a new legislative change occurs during that time.
Expeditious review of development proposals or policy updates can only be streamlined to the extent that provincial ministries and municipalities have sufficient resources.  Rather than continued legislative changes, a pause to allow municipalities to implement the changes that have recently occurred and bring policy documents and administrative processes up to date would in itself result in more expeditious review of all development proposals within the contest of the vision of long term prosperity, human and environmental health and social well-being taking precedence over short term considerations for all Ontarians outlined in the PPS.
It should be noted that provincial and municipal land use planning policies often place the onus of conducting studies for matters such as compatibility, environmental impact, traffic etc. on developers.  Yes this results in time spent.  However, where such policies are by-passed should an impact result the onus may be on the taxpayers at large to correct or mitigate any impacts.  The obvious economic benefits of employment uses will need to be weighed against unknown potential consequences.

19527,/comment/19527,"Ontario’s Greenbelt is the largest greenbelt in the world spanning 325 kilometres . This expansive stretch of integrated green space is integral to the agricultural sector, enhancing natural environments, and supporting liveable climate-resilient communities. The proposed Bill 66 allows for open-for-business planning by-laws to be exempt from important planning provisions, including the Greenbelt Act, 2005. The objectives of the Greenbelt Act are to sustain, preserve, and protect this stretch of land recognizing its important economic significance, tourism opportunities, and role in managing urbanization. The Greenbelt naturally protects communities through important ecological and hydrological services including flood protection and providing clean air. Allowing open-for-business planning by-laws to circumvent the Greenbelt Act will compromise the greenbelt and its essential services, negatively impacting the health and wellbeing of Ontarians.
The conservation of land and greenspace is a pillar of the new Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. As stated within the plan “the Ontario government is committed to protecting the Greenbelt for future generations.”  This commitment is essential to supporting natural climate change mitigation and adaptation, at no additional cost to Ontarians. The Open for Business planning bylaws however are a direct contradiction to this commitment to protecting the Greenbelt for future generations. The proposed Bill 66 amendments to allow for exemptions to the Greenbelt Act and other essential environmental protection acts such as the Clean Water Act, will limit progress outlined in the key areas of the Environment Plan. Of the four pillars of the Environment Plan, the Greenbelt plays an essential role in three strategies; Protecting our Air, Lakes and Rivers, Addressing Climate Change, and Conserving Land and Greenspace.
Forest ecosystems mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration, at no additional financial cost to Ontarians. The Friends of the Greenbelt have estimated “the forested area of the Greenbelt alone can offset the equivalent of 27 million cars driven over one year.” The agricultural land, forest, and wetlands within the Greenbelt actively store carbon, with an estimated value of $11.17 billion (Source: Friends of the Greenbelt). Annually, the value of this carbon storage increases by approximately $51.94 million (Source: Friends of the Greenbelt). The value of the Greenbelt in carbon sequestration is of paramount importance to Ontario’s efforts to limit climate change, as outlined in the current Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan.
I urge your government to reconsider the amendments to the Planning Act. Environmental protection acts were put in place for a reason. Please respect the necessity of these acts and do not allow open for business bylaws to bypass important legislation.

19532,/comment/19532,"Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act.
The Provincial Government is proposing to make changes to the Planning Act to create a new economic development tool, the Open-for-Business Planning By-law.
The City of North Bay is generally in support of a Planning tool that would provide the necessary flexibility to make local planning decisions to promote and achieve economic development.
The Growth Plan for Northern Ontario identifies in Section 4.2 the long-range planning for all communities, which identifies that Municipalities should “prepare long-term community strategies, and that these strategies should support the goals and objectives of this Plan, identify local opportunities to implement the policies of this plan, and be designed to achieve the following:
a) economic, social and environmental sustainability
b) accommodation of the diverse needs of all residents, now and in the future
c) optimized use of existing infrastructure
d) a high quality of place
e) a vibrant, welcoming and inclusive community identity that builds on unique local features
f) local implementation of regional economic plans, where such plans have been completed
Municipalities are encouraged to align their Official Plan policies with their long-term community strategies developed in accordance with policy.
Providing a long-term vision of the City has been challenging, because of the changes or uncertainties with Provincial Policy and changes to the legislation.
The City of North Bay identified the Urban Settlement Area within the Official Plan. The Urban Settlement Area is where the City facilitates growth and development and consists of approximately 20% (6,460ha) of the land within the boundaries of the City of North Bay. Over many years, infrastructure has been planned and extended to facilitate growth within the Urban Settlement Area. The decision and investment into servicing these lands with paved roads and sewer and water was made based on previous policy, which allowed Municipalities to have regard for Environmental habitats and wetland features, but equally important was social and economic consideration.
Changes to the 2005 and 2014 Provincial Policy Statement changed the wording around environmental protection to be restrictive. This changed placed a hierarchy on the environmental policies.
As a result of these policies, the land within the Urban Settlement Boundary has substantial restrictions and uncertainties around cost and timing of development.
The City of North Bay is of the opinion a more balanced approach to development is required. In reviewing development the three (3) aspects of social, economy and the environment must be considered. Local Municipalities require flexibility with Provincial Policy to permit appropriate and sustainable development within the Urban Settlement Area.
The City of North Bay would prefer if the Open-for Business By-law could provide flexibility in Provincial and local policies to allow for the long-term vision of the City to be achieved, allowing reasonable development to take place in areas  that are within the Urban Settlement Boundary.
The Open-for-Business By-law should be passed on the lands which would make the lands ‘open for business’. If lands are predetermined to have the ‘open for business’ designation, it would allow the property owner to work with the City to find a balance of economics, social and the environment. This way the ‘open for business’ designation could be used to advertise the property’s and attract national and international development.
If the City is required to wait until the opportunity arises before an ‘open for business’ by-law can be utilized it is likely that it will never achieve its desired effect. The Province has stated it will take a year to review and pass (or deny) the open for business by-law. If the Minister does not pass the open for business by-law, this property owner would have been delayed a year of attempting to develop the property by traditional means.
Recommendation #1-
Lands within the Municipality can apply for the designation of ‘open-for-business before they have a business willing to invest. This recommendation would allow for property owners to ensure they hold the designation.
The Open-for-Business By-law would provide the City of North Bay the flexibility to attract employment opportunities and business within the Urban Settlement Area. The City of North Bay, Provincial and Federal Government has invested substantial amounts money into servicing the ‘planned’ urban settlement area. The open-for-business by-law would provide the necessary flexibility to allow these properties to be used for economic development, while still finding a balance between the environment and social wants and needs.
The Open-for-Business By-law is a unique tool which will allow for sustainable development and remove the uncertainty of changing Provincial Policy and legislation and allow Municipalities to implement their long term vision.
Recommendation #2-
The Province creates different categories for Municipalities with less population. A threshold for a population of 75,000 or less the job creation would be 20.
Bill 66 proposes regulation which defines the threshold of a new major employment would be considered. The threshold which has been defined is the creation of 50 jobs for population of less than 250,000 and 100 jobs for municipalities with a population of more than 250,000.
The threshold being proposed is too broad and does not help mid to small Municipalities. The threshold will limit the ability to utilize the tool and smaller to mid-sized municipalities may miss opportunities for development based on the threshold. The open for business by-law is an opportunity for smaller Municipalities to be competitive in attracting business to their region.

19541,/comment/19541,"Nobody would condemn a policy to increase Ontario's competitiveness, in real, technological, and economic terms.  But the intention to augment the Province's competitiveness by making it easier to subvert laws that protect our environment, our water resources, and the Great Lakes is completely unacceptable.  These laws protect us, the residents of this Province, as well as the environment as such.  Making it easier for companies to pollute and degrade our environment is an extremely poor excuse for those companies' not working to increase their actual efficiency -- and an increase in efficiency is the only way to truly augment competitiveness.  Besides, corrupting our environment now will only increase the cost of remediating the damage in the future.  There is ALWAYS a price to pay for environmental degradation, sooner or later.
Therefore I would request that the Government remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, which allows municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, and Great Lakes Protection Act.

Re: Schedule 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 and associated regulations (ERO #013-4293, #013-4125, #013-4239)
Dear Mr. Helfinger and Mr. Petersen,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Schedule 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.
The Green Infrastructure Ontario (GIO) Coalition is a multi-sectoral alliance comprised of private sector companies, industry associations, municipal and regional governments, community groups, and not-for-profit organizations. Together, we promote the implementation of green infrastructure across Ontario by providing a united voice for this vital and growing sector.
Green infrastructure includes everything from tree-lined streets, wetlands, urban parks and gardens, to green roofs, meadows, woodlots, grassed areas, urban and rural agriculture, soils, and bioswales. It provides a range of services that can make a substantial contribution towards climate change adaptation, and important contributions towards climate change mitigation and emissions reductions. Such practices are a 'win-win' approach to tackling climate change, in part because they also help deliver multiple other social, economic and environmental benefits. Green infrastructure has also been shown to have a high return on investment, create jobs, and can be a cost-effective complement (or alternative) to traditional grey infrastructure. In fact, the green infrastructure sector is already an important source of jobs – it employs over 150,000 people across the country. This includes people who work at small and large businesses as designers, growers, landscape architects, manufacturers, contractors and maintenance professionals.
As drafted, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 will have significant negative consequences on our province’s green infrastructure system by removing vital protections in the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, the Growth Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement, facilitating a patchwork approach to environmental protection in Ontario. Ontario’s current land-use planning and land conservation framework was developed over many years by both Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments. It provides critical protection to farmland, wetlands, woodlands, valley lands, other natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, freshwater, and natural linkage areas in the heavily developed Greater Golden Horseshoe Region. These features and networks span municipal boundaries and can only be adequately protected at a regional scale. The framework also currently encourages municipalities to consider green infrastructure in their stormwater management and climate change resiliency planning – potentially providing communities financial savings, as green infrastructure approaches have often been found to be less expensive and address many issues concurrently.
Schedule 10 also risks directly undermining many of the goals of the provincial government’s own Made in Ontario Environment Plan.
The GIO Coalition therefore recommend that Schedule 10 be removed from Bill 66 by government MPPs at second reading.
We would be please to provide any additional information required. Please do not hesitate to contact Michelle Sawka with any questions (michelle.sawka@trca.on.ca, 647-287-6540).

Deborah Martin-Downs

Our farmland, rivers, lakes and fragile ecosystems are already under threat.

19559,/comment/19559,"I am writing to you as a concerned retiree who lives within the Greenbelt, by the busy urban centre of Hamilton. I am against Bill 66 and implore you not to pass such a short-sighted bill that will dramatically set back essential environmental, ecological and social protections.
Ontarians care deeply about the Greenbelt, Lake Simcoe,  the Oak Ridges Moraine and clean water. It is home to farmland, forests, watersheds and wetlands. The Oak Ridges Moraine is the rainbarrel of Ontario providing drinking water to over 250,000 Ontarians and feeding many river and streams that flow into Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe.
The Greenbelt is also economically important.   Agriculture in the Greater Golden Horseshoe employes 38,000 people and gross output of farms is $11 billion, that’s $1.7 billion in tax revenue for all three levels of government. The Greenbelt provides $3.2B annually in services to the region, such as recreational activities and flood protection. It was created in 2005 to deliberately limit the rapid urban sprawl that was encroaching on land that is both environmentally and economically significant.
The Greenbelt has the capacity to store as much carbon dioxide as would be emitted by 33 million cars a year. Interfering with that crucial ecosystem means missing out on a chance to reduce our emissions and meet climate targets.
Greenbelt development is unnecessary for economic development. A recent Neptis Foundation study found more than 125,000 hectares of land in the GTA is currently available to accommodate growth through to 2031 and beyond.  If the province wants to allow a new business in Ontario they already have a tool for that, The Minister’s zoning order, they don’t need to allow municipalities to bypass environmental and health rules meant to protect us.
Bill 66 imposes the provincial government’s political agenda on municipal decisions. We should not use the Open for Business planning bylaw in Hamilton. I support business development but not at the expense of the environment.  A sprawling city is a shrinking Greenbelt. Many municipalities want to grow beyond their boundaries, but low density growth doesn’t pay its way.  More sprawl means higher taxes and more municipal debt.
Bill 66 exempts developers from rules that are crucial to protecting human health.  For example, it undermines the Clean Water Act, which protects people from tragedies like the one that happened in Walkerton, where water contamination led to 7 deaths and thousands of cases of severe illness. The bill threatens vital water sources for Ontarians, including Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes. It also repeals the Toxics Reduction Act meant to reduce pollution by preventing industrial uses of certain toxic chemicals.
Your government did not get elected on this platform. After hearing from Ontarians that they did not want to see the Greenbelt threatened by development, your government wisely promised not to touch that land. Now, Ontarians want to see that commitment fulfilled.
According to a 2016 Nanos poll, 9 out of 10 Ontarians believe the province has a responsibility to ensure a healthy environment for all.By threatening both air and water quality, Bill 66 clearly violates that right.

Re:	Bill 66 – Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018, the Open For Business Planning Tool and proposed regulation.
	EBR Registry Number:   013-4125
	Environmental Registry Number: 013-4125
Environmental Registry Number: 013-4239
I am writing on behalf of the Town of Richmond Hill Planning and Regulatory Services Department to provide you with comments on the proposed Bill 66 changes to the Planning Act and its associated proposed regulation.
On December 6, 2018, the Province released the first draft of Bill 66. The intent of the legislation is to stimulate business investment, create new jobs, and remove unnecessary regulation. Of particular interest, is Schedule 10 of Bill 66, which proposes a new Planning Act tool: “the open-for-business planning by-law” and its associated proposed regulation.
The Open For Business (OFB) Planning Tool
The OFB planning tool permits development that may otherwise by prohibited by Provincial, Regional or Local Legislation and/or Policy to streamline the approval of development associated with major employment
An “open-for-business planning (OFB) by-law” would allow a major employment use to proceed without being subject to:
•	Provincial Policy Statements issued under the Planning Act 1990, Metrolinx Act, 2006,
and the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016
•	Provincial Plans and Acts including the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Greenbelt Plan, Growth Plan, Parkway Belt West Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan and the Great Lakes Protection Plan
•	Policies identified in source water protection plans (Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, 2006)
•	Regional or local official plans, zoning by-laws, holding provisions, and
•	Increased height and density provisions in exchange for community benefits
In this regard, the “open for business planning by-law” has the same effect as a Minister’s Zoning Order (MZO), wherein the Minister can impose a Zoning Order that also need not conform with or be consistent with the policies of the above noted provincial and municipal documents.
The concept, as contemplated, represents an opportunity for Richmond Hill to facilitate appropriate employment uses not presently contemplated in the Official Plan. Using this tool, the Town could capitalize on opportunities to fuel job growth for residents and increase revenue for the Town.
Recommendation 1:
The most appropriate application of an OFB By-law is within the existing Urban Area, away from sensitive environmental areas such as the Oak Ridges Moraine. Accordingly, the list of Acts/Policies that are exempt from an “open for business by-law” should be those that apply to existing urban areas. The Bill should be modified to ensure that the protection of the environment is maintained by the continued application of provincial plans, such as the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, Great Lakes Protection Plan and source water protection plans; as well as Sections 2 and 3 of the Provincial Policy Statement.
Incorporates Site Plan Approvals
All matters generally addressed through site plan control as well as zoning are proposed to be addressed through the “open for business by-law”, much like a development permit under a Community Planning Permit System.  This is a key difference from a Minister’s Zoning Order, which still requires site plan approval.
As such, municipalities would be able to impose conditions as part of an OFB By-law, so long as such conditions are reasonable, related to the appropriate use of land, and necessary for protection of public health and safety.  Staff agree that combining these planning tools creates efficiencies. Furthermore, preparing the OFB By-law at the local level ensures that the by-law is well integrated with existing zoning nomenclature and practices of the municipality.
Requires Minister’s Permission prior to passing
Before a local municipality can pass an open-for-business planning by-law, the municipality must apply for and receive written approval from the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and demonstrate that any prescribed criteria is met. The criteria would be provided in a regulation.
Presently, the proposed regulation would require that a municipality requesting permission to use this by-law would need to provide:
•	information such as description of subject lands, land use planning information and details about the proposed employment opportunity
•	confirmation that the proposal is for a new employment use
•	evidence that the proposal would meet minimum job creation thresholds (e.g. 50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000 and 100 jobs for municipalities with a population of more than 250,000 people)
•	Identification of land uses, buildings and structures that may be authorized under the tool, such as manufacturing and research and development, but not residential, commercial or retail as the primary use
The regulation would also provide details regarding how notice is to be given to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, following the passing of an open-for-business by-law.
Recommendation 2:
Staff are concerned that a lengthy Provincial criteria to be met and reviewed by the Province may defeat the expeditious approval of employment uses. It is recommended that local municipalities define appropriate criteria surrounding the use of the OFB By-law. The Province could provide limited higher level direction to ensure that the goals of the legislation are met.
No Right of Appeal, but the Minister may Modify or Revoke the By-law
While the “open for business” planning tool appears to provide Council with extraordinary powers, the Minister is ultimately the decision maker in terms of whether or not a proposed development may be authorized by the OFB By-law. Accordingly, the municipality must notify the Minister within three days of the passing of the OFB By-law. The OFB By-law will come into effect within 20 days of its passing or a later date specified by the Minister. The Minister may by order modify or revoke the OFB By-law any time before it comes into effect. Similar to an MZO, there is no right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
Recommendation 3:
Given that there is no right of appeal, staff recommend that municipalities be empowered to undertake locally defined consultation requirements prior to the passing of the OFB By-law. This consultation process would ensure that public concerns regarding a proposed development are understood and addressed, to the extent possible.
Does not Require Public Consultation in advance of passing the by-law
Similar to the Minister’s passing of an MZO, local municipalities will be able to pass an open-for-business planning by-law without public consultation.  However, public notification is required within 30 days after it is passed.
Recommendation 4:
The Bill should be modified to require that a notice of Council’s resolution to request permission to use the “open for business planning tool” be issued to prescribed persons and agencies (as is required for an amendment to a zoning by-law). This notification will inform the public of Council’s intent and provide them with an opportunity to comment to the municipality and/or the Minister, without unduly delaying the adoption of an OFB By-law.
Additional Comments – Cross Jurisdictional Issues
Presently, the Town of Richmond Hill Official Plan designates land for employment-generating uses within its Employment, Employment Corridor, and Centres & Corridors land use designations. These areas are serviced and in most cases “shovel ready” for such development. Lands outside of the settlement area are subject to the Greenbelt Plan and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. The majority of these lands are environmentally sensitive and are not appropriate for major employment uses.
Within the settlement area, the tool should not be used in a manner that may result in creating cross-jurisdictional issues. Utilization of the “open for business” planning tool in one municipality could impact on a neighbouring municipality. If a municipality utilized the tool in an area adjacent to a municipal boundary, the proposed use may cause negative impacts on the surrounding land use owing to land use incompatibility issues and/or the need for supporting infrastructure. Impacts could include, requiring sewer and/or water services to be routed through the adjacent municipality where such services are not planned. There is also the possibility that other local infrastructure improvements may be required in the non-developing municipality in order to support the “open for business” development in the adjacent municipality. Yet, the proposed legislation does not provide for the ability of the “non-developing” municipality to participate in the planning process and ensure that the developer in the “developing” municipality is responsible for providing the required infrastructure upgrades. In a two-tiered system, the Upper Tier could play an important role of ensuring that cross-jurisdictional issues are addressed and that neighbouring municipalities are included in the planning process.
Recommendation 5:
In addition to the recommendations noted above, we recommend adjusting the Bill and corresponding regulation to require that Upper Tier municipalities and/or affected neighbouring municipalities endorse, or not “not object to,” the request of Lower Tier municipalities to use the tool, and that they are satisfied with the by-law as passed by the Lower Tier, to ensure that all cross jurisdictional matters are addressed.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation and its associated regulation. Based on the forgoing recommendations, the Town would support the use of this additional planning tool, where an economic development opportunity presented itself to the Town and the need for such an expedited and streamlined approach is warranted.

19572,/comment/19572,"The Ontario Forest Industries Association (OFIA) thanks you for the opportunity to comment on
the EBR Proposal 013-4293 – Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.  These comments are in respect to Schedule 5: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks.
The OFIA includes over 40 forest products facilities operating in the province of Ontario, representing all aspects of the product life cycle from forest management through to final pulp, paper and solid wood products.  With a strong primary sector, Ontario’s forest sector supports advanced manufacturing and innovation in the fields of biomaterials, biofuels and biochemicals.  Currently, the Ontario forest products sector represents $15.5 billion of economic activity and provides over 170,000 direct and indirect jobs across Ontario.
Ontario’s forest products sector has a long history of pollution prevention in reducing toxic substances from their facilities including:
•	Voluntary elimination of elemental chlorine bleaching to address generation of chlorinated organics, including dioxins and furans.
•	Voluntary elimination of products containing nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) in response to concerns around endocrine disruption.
•	Ongoing tracking and monitoring of chemical additives to respond to strict customer requirements and concerns around priority substances such as mercury.
The OFIA applauds the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 and all associated regulations by December 31, 2021 for the following reasons:
•	The over-prescriptive regulatory requirements do nothing more than create additional costs, regulatory burden and workload with little to no benefit for the regulated community or protection of the environment. The annual reporting requirements on average cost each facility over $20,000.
•	Since the program began in 2009, any reductions in the use, creation or release of toxic substance in the wood products and the pulp and paper milling processes have been driven by the needs of the mills and decreases in production, not the Toxics Reduction Program.
•	Tracking the trace amounts of the “toxic” substances that are naturally occurring in wood is a lot of work for no benefit to the public nor environment. The reporting numbers are meaningless because the calculations are based on chemical composition factors and emission factors related to production.
•	The reporting of release, disposal and transfers of the “toxic” substances are already being reported under the federal National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI).
•	The Ontario Toxics Reduction Program is not aligned with either the Federal programs for managing toxics via CEPA or with any other regulatory framework within the Province of Ontario.
The OFIA supports the proposal to no longer require facilities with existing toxics reduction plans to review those plans.  The OFIA agrees that this will remove unnecessary duplication with federal programs and voluntary environmental management systems.
The OFIA agrees with the government’s intention to restore Ontario’s competitiveness by reducing
unnecessary costs and burdens to businesses in Ontario.

19574,/comment/19574,"The following comments are specific to Schedule 10 of Bill 66 and the associated regulation.
The Open For Business Planning Tool permits development that may otherwise by prohibited by Provincial, Regional or Local Legislation and/or Policy to streamline the approval of development associated with major employment.  This permission is too broad. Permitting an employment use at the detriment of the environment is short sighted.  Accordingly, the list of Acts/Policies that are exempt from an “open for business by-law” should be modified to ensure that the protection of the environment is not put at risk.  The legislation should not be permitting a proposed use to be in contravention of the provincial plans intended for environmental protection, such as the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, Great Lakes Protection Plan and source water protection plans; nor should it be in contravention of Sections 2 and 3 of the Provincial Policy Statement.
Presently, the proposed regulation regarding criteria to be submitted to the Minister from  a municipality requesting permission to use this by-law is too vague.  The criteria should include:
•	evidence as to why this tool is required, as opposed to utilizing the normal Zoning By-law Amendment process,
•	that the proposed use is intended to operate for the long term,
•	that the proposed location can sustain such a use,
•	that future employees are able to access the site,
•	that servicing for the proposed use is available or planned for the area within the proposed timeframe,
•	that all efforts to avoid or minimize harm to the environment are/will be taken, and
•	that the municipality will undertake steps to inform and consult with the public, to the extent possible, in advance of passing the OFB by-law.
Furthermore, the criteria should be amended to:
•	raise the threshold for job creation (e.g. greater than 100 jobs), and
•	clearly prohibiting the use of the tool for residential, commercial and retail purposes.
Given that there is no right of appeal, the Bill should include a consultation process with the public, to ensure that public concerns regarding a proposed development are understood and to the extent possible are addressed prior to the passing of the OFB by-law and the Minister bringing it into effect.
The public consultation process should be required prior to Council passing the OFB by-law. The Bill should be modified to require that a notice of Council’s resolution to request permission to use the “open for business planning tool” be issued to prescribed persons and agencies (as is required for an amendment to a zoning by-law), to inform them of Council’s intent and provide them with an opportunity to comment to the Minister.
The tool should not be used in a manner that may result in creating cross-jurisdictional issues. To mitigate this, the Bill and corresponding regulation should require that Upper Tier municipalities and/or affected neighbouring municipalities endorse the request of a Lower Tier municipality to use the tool and to indicate that they are satisfied with the by-law as passed by the Lower Tier, for the Minister's consideration.

19579,/comment/19579,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments regarding Bill 66 – “Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018” and the proposed open-for-business planning by-law (“OFBP By-law”) amendments in the Planning Act.  Please accept this letter as the formal comments from the Town of Whitby on the issues we believe most impact the Town.
It is also requested that the Town continue to be sent all future notices and communications from the relevant Ministries regarding the provisions of Bill 66.  Should there be an opportunity to make a formal presentation or submission to a Standing Committee or Select Committee of the Ontario Legislative Assembly regarding this matter, the Town also requests to be notified of such opportunity so that it may participate if it so wishes.
Employment Standards Act, 2000
The Town welcomes the proposed changes to the Employment Standards Act, 2000.  The removal of the Director’s approval for agreements that allow employees to exceed 48 hours of work in a week, and to allow the averaging of employee’s hours of work per week for overtime pay purposes, is a positive step.  The current filing and reporting system is an unnecessary bureaucratic step, especially in the unionized environment that exists at the Town.  We also expect that this will allow the Town, as an employer of choice, to have a greater flexibility to manage and support its employees.
With the removal of this requirement, hopefully the Ministry of Labour will have greater availability to address issues affecting workers in vulnerable sectors, instead of overseeing the municipal sector where employees are well-represented and protected by unions and collective agreements.
Labour Relations Act, 1995
The Town supports the amendment to the Labour Relations Act, 1995 to deem municipalities as non-construction employers.  This clarifies the role of municipalities within the construction industry as we build and maintain infrastructure and community facilities.  The Town believes that this amendment clarifies that municipalities are allowed to seek the best contract and price for construction work regardless of union affiliation, ensuring the responsible use of municipal revenues.
Pawnbrokers Act
Currently, the Town requires pawnbrokers to obtain a municipal business licence, and also requires them to ensure that they meet the provisions of the Pawnbrokers Act.
The Town requests that if the repeal of the Act moves forward, then such repeal should not take effect until at least 90 days after Bill 66 is passed or receives Royal Assent.  This time is required to allow the Town, and other municipalities, to revise local by-laws and ensure that the appropriate licensing and operating requirements are incorporated therein to cover the outgoing provisions of the Pawnbrokers Act.
The local police service has previously indicated that appropriate record-keeping requirements for pawnbrokers are an important investigative tool to assist them in solving crimes.  As such, the Town also needs this time to consult with local police to ensure that their needs are met in any new or revised by-laws, and to ensure that there is no legislative gap for enforcement.
Planning Act and the Proposed OFBP By-law Provisions
The Town has concerns about the proposed Planning Act changes and inclusion of the new OFBP By-law provisions.
Within the Town of Whitby, the OFBP By-law could be used to facilitate higher-order industrial (manufacturing with no open storage) and office development on lands that are adjacent to Highways 412 and 407, and Lake Ridge Road.  The OFBP By-law could also be used to assist development in other employment areas identified in the Town’s Official Plan and various Secondary Plans.
It would also be helpful for economic growth in Whitby if the surplus provincially-owned lands in the Highway 412 and 407 corridors were released for development.  Proposed industrial and office development on those and other lands in the highway corridor could be considered on a site specific basis, and should demonstrate how the building location and form, access, intended use, and the number of created full time jobs would take into account any environmental impacts, with a plan to best mitigate those impacts.
However, the streamlining of the overall employment land development process through the proposed OFBP By-law tool must be balanced with the protection of environmentally sensitive land areas that have been identified through provincial legislation and in the Town’s Official Plan.
Even if the OFBP By-law tool is made available through the adoption of Bill 66, the Town remains committed to preserving areas that are otherwise environmentally sensitive or protected, including the provincial Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine.
The Town suggests that the OFBP By-law should only be used in exceptional circumstances to address site specific issues, while respecting current environmental policies and protections.  Some of these site specific issues could also be addressed by the province without the need to adopt the OFBP By-law provisions, through other planning mechanisms that are within the province’s authority (e.g., implementing the comments of municipalities regarding the Greenbelt Plan boundary).
There is also a concern that the OFBP By-law provisions have no mechanism for public notice or public input to the municipality or the province prior to the by-law being used, which is contrary to good planning practice.  This should be reviewed further by the province.
Consultation between the province and municipal planning departments is also strongly advised in order for the province to fully understand municipal planning concerns related to the OFBP By-law.  There needs to be a proper balance between encouraging economic development and sustainable local/provincial planning.
The Town also recommends that a provincial/municipal liaison committee be formed, through the Association of Municipalities of Ontario if it is agreeable, to jointly review and consider all municipal comments and suggested amendments, and make recommendations to the province prior to the passage of Bill 66.
Further public consultation should also be conducted prior to the adoption of these new Planning Act provisions.
If the province is eager to support Ontario’s economic competitiveness and development, especially in the Town of Whitby and Durham Region, then the removal of tolls from Highway 412 and the future Highway 418 should be an immediate priority.  While the availability of the OFBP By-law could assist development of employment lands in these areas, the imposition of tolls on these highways is a large negative factor on business development.
Furthermore, since these highways are solely within and serve mainly the residents and businesses in Durham Region, they represent a cost and development restriction that no other region faces in the GTA.  In the strongest possible terms, the Town requests that the province immediately remove tolls from Highways 412 and 418.  This will also protect the competitive balance among municipalities in the GTA, and will support Durham Region’s employment growth.
Other Proposed Regulatory Changes
Contemporaneous with the announcement of Bill 66, there were a number of proposed regulatory changes announced by the province that the Town would also like to comment on briefly:
•	The Town is cautiously supportive of expanding connected and autonomous vehicle testing.   Encouraging development in this emerging area is a business and employment opportunity for the Town and Durham Region, which has strong experience in the automotive sector and is currently investing in assistance for new technology companies.  However, the Ministry of Transportation should be directed to work with municipalities where testing will occur, to ensure that infrastructure and maintenance requirements can support such testing.
•	Allowing electric motorcycles on controlled highways is within the province’s jurisdiction, but thought should be given on how this could trigger other requirements in terms of increased maintenance and signage.  For example, smaller tires are more susceptible to cracks in asphalt, which means an increased need for crack sealing; lower speed considerations; and the need for higher standards of winter maintenance.
•	Amending the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System regulation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act to allow updated labels to be placed on existing chemical containers may save the Town a small amount of funds.  Without this change, existing chemicals would need to be disposed of despite still being of use, and new chemicals would need to be purchased.
•	The Town would appreciate receiving further information on the new instructions to the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation regarding the assessment of industrial properties.  Specifically, the Town would like to better understand the financial impact of assessing these properties based on current permitted uses, as opposed to their highest and best use based on applicable Official Plan designations.
Municipalities already have restrictive revenue tools available, and limiting revenues from property taxes on industrial properties will have a resulting impact on residential property tax rates.  Instead, the province should consider broadening the revenue tools available to all municipalities, or improving the province’s revenue sharing with municipalities from its share of the HST.
•	For all of these regulatory changes, the Town would like the province to provide a timeframe for when they will be implemented.  Where there could be potential costs to municipalities, implementation should be delayed by at least a year so that such costs can be accounted for in future municipal budgets.  Proper consultation with municipalities is important.  Alternatively, provincial funding should be provided to address such regulatory implementation.
Once again, on behalf of the Town, thank you for the opportunity to make submissions regarding Bill 66.  The Town trusts that you find the above comments and recommendations helpful, and it looks forward to their consideration and action as Bill 66 proceeds through review and debate.
Sincerely,

19588,/comment/19588,"I am very concerned at what is proposed in Bill 66 and recommend that it is repealed.
Ontario's green spaces need more protection, not less. This bill threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act. It also threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
I am particularly concerned at the threat is it poses to human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.
Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. It would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely.
The City of Niagara Falls recently experienced an assault on an area that is ecologically sensitive at Thundering Waters Forest. This is just one example of what can happen when indiscriminate developers take advantage of an area. We need resolve to protect our green spaces and then have clear legislation so that areas like these are protected. Bill 66 will not do this for Ontario.

19608,/comment/19608,"Thank you for reading my comments about the proposed “Open for Business” Planning Act changes.
As a resident of the City of Hamilton, I share City staff’s concerns with the proposed amendments as follows:
-	The changes are unnecessary.  There is a currently an option in place for a Ministerial Zoning Order if zoning for employment lands is raised and perceived as an issue.  I believe the provincial government is attempting to put the onus on municipalities to override urban plans in favour of developers;
-	The amendments could undermine the City of Hamilton’s planned urban structure – years of work has gone into our current Urban Hamilton Official Plan and Rural Hamilton Official Plan built around principles of intensification, efficiency of land use, concentration of employment uses in designated areas, protection of natural areas and agricultural lands;
-	The actual draft regulation was not released and the language of the proposal is vague.  Of particular concern is the phrase “any prescribed provision”, which is very broad and could lead to any regulation being overridden;
-	Exemption from Section 39, the Clean Water Act is particularly risky for obvious reasons.  Endangering our water supply is reckless and unwarranted.
In addition to the concerns outlined above, my own concerns include the future of land and water use in the Province of Ontario.  The Green Belt lands prescribe a sensible approach to land use within urban areas, preventing out-of-control urban sprawl which has caused so many environmental problems.  Urban sprawl also costs municipalities (tax payers) exorbitant amounts of money to service new developments while the urban core requires investment in infrastructure.
The Ontario PC government was not elected with a majority of voters, but won a majority of seats in the legislature.  There was no mandate for this government to make sweeping changes to environmental protections in Ontario, as the Progressive Conservatives campaigned without a detailed platform, neglecting to inform voters of its plans to change these important Acts.
In closing, I would like to remind this government the current Premier promised to keep the Green Belt  safe.  Bill 66 goes against this promise and endangers the future of our environment and health of residents, land and wildlife.

19621,/comment/19621,"Please see the attached for input from the Middlesex-London Health Unit.
The Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) recognizes and supports the Government’s work to make Ontario more competitive and open for business. Employment, income, and economic development are crucial determinants of health. An Ontario that is working is a healthier Ontario.
MLHU also appreciates the opportunity to provide input on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. MLHU’s mandate includes the promotion and protection of the health of the people who live in London and Middlesex County.
For a business to be successful, it needs healthy employees. As such, an open-for-business approach should ensure adequate protections for the basic necessities of human health. Clean drinking water is such a necessity. Achieving a clean drinking water supply has been among the greatest public health achievements in history.
The proposed amendments found in Schedule 10 would allow municipalities to create bylaws that could put drinking water at risk of contamination. As such, the Middlesex-London Health Unit recommends that this schedule be removed from the legislation, or at a minimum, adjusted so that it does not circumvent the Clean Water Act.
Schedule 10
The Clean Water Act and other relevant legislative documents have been enacted after the Walkerton tragedy in 2000 as a response to strengthen the water safety net in the province. Schedule 10 amends the Planning Act to add a new section 34.1, which allows local municipalities to pass open-for-business planning by-laws. These by-laws involve the exercise of a municipality’s powers under section 34 of the Act and allow municipalities to impose one or more specified conditions. The “open-for-business” zoning by-laws do not have to comply with prescribed provisions in the Clean Water Act, Greenbelt Act, 2005, Great Lakes Protection Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016 and other provincial statutes.
The Walkerton Inquiry Report authored by Justice Dennis O’Connor considered lack of multi-barrier approach a fundamental gap in ensuring the safety of drinking water. Protection of source water is the first and most important step of the multi-barrier approach in the provision of safe drinking water. Allowing large-scale industrial developments in vulnerable areas that may threaten groundwater or surface water resources diminishes the safety net for drinking water sources.
Section 39 of the Clean Water Act currently requires all Planning Act decisions to conform to policies in approved source protection plans that address significant drinking water threats prescribed by the Clean Water Act such as landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems. To ensure the protection of drinking water sources, this provision should remain applicable to all municipal planning and zoning decisions.
Risk to Residents of Neighbouring Municipalities
An important consideration with regards to requiring municipalities adhere to a provincial standard or Act is that the effects of actions taken by a municipality are not necessarily limited to the municipality that takes the action. When a municipality allows for an activity that has impact on a water system, it would likely be a downstream municipality that would suffer the impact which emphasizes the importance of adhering to provincial standards.
Recommendation:
The MLHU recommends that the Government of Ontario continue the protection of source water and the health of the people of Ontario by removing Schedule 10 from Bill 66, or at a minimum that the legislation not allow circumvention of the Clean Water Act.

Climate change and environmental protection are a very pressing matter that needs to be addressed in order to keep a country, economy and even the world in proper working order. The amount of protected waterways in Canada have already been cut drastically and by opening the greenbelt to development more waterways will be affected. Water is an essential to life and is already becoming increasingly difficult to access for many people. The government needs to address environmental problems first and look at more sustainable options which will, in the long run, have high economic value as the ecosystem services provided are irreplaceable. Pollution is a major concern to the future of the planet and should be seen as a priority to minimize the effects on Earth. It is economically beneficial to take in to consideration the protection of the environment and this proposed bill does not do that. Agriculture, drinking water and the environment will be impacted by the passing of this bill and it should be the governments responsibility and priority to protect the citizens and the environment we REQUIRE for life above all other matters, including but not limited to increased jobs and further development.

The value of the Greenbelt is beyond dollar value, and there are many spaces that can be developed in already existing urban environments. As a Hamilton resident, I can think of many such locations. Employment lands are normally located within an urban or town boundary close to infrastructure that can support businesses such as water, sewers, internet and a good road network. Allowing employment uses (like factories or big box stores) anywhere in the province, as the open for business bylaw would allow, will put a huge burden on municipalities and utilities to provide services and upgrade roads in addition to the potential loss of farmland, and environmental impacts. These services are expensive and building them will cause property tax increases and make it even harder to build public transit.

I strongly oppose any Bill opens up or eases the restrictions for development in the Greenbelt or surrounding land in the Golden Horseshoe protected by conservation plans. I have no doubt these sentiments are shared by Ontario's at large.

Little ones are busy people who need a lot of care and guidance (i.e., feeding, toileting/diapering, educational games, holding/comforting,...) and one adult cannot possibly provide that type of ongoing care in a full day, 5 days a week without relief. Adding additional children to that ration is a recipe for disaster!

I witnessed periods of environmental harm due to inadequate protection, followed by increased protection and monitoring, which has since been followed by less thorough monitoring and, as a result, protection.  Bill 66 will allow much more serious systemic failure to protect environmental quality, supposedly due to a higher valuation on creating jobs.
It is obvious that in today's world, jobs are becoming increasingly temporary, whereas environmental degradation has a much higher degree of permanence.   A healthy environment is a key component of fiscal capital in Ontario's economy.  Allowing environmental degradation creates economic challenges, in that impaired environmental quality has less value, being less attractive to development due to increased costs (i.e., brownfields).
Bill 66 is plaqued by short-sightedness.  Sacrificing environmental vigilance means sacrificing financial value of a healthy environment in favour of ephemeral jobs.  Ontarians deserve better.

There are public health risks with Schedule 10.  Clean drinking water and a clean environment are threatened. The Clean Water Act was introduced to strengthen protections for drinking water at its source, and is a direct response to the Walkerton tragedy.  The Great Lakes Protection Act protects drinking water for communities drawing water from the Great Lakes.
I do not want Open For business Planning tools to be put in place which will allow municipalities to undermine the building blocks and fundamentals of planning.  There needs to be evidence-based growth management policies that ensure healthy and sustainable communities.

With no checks and balances on municipalities, and no possibility of appeal, excessive development of Greenbelt lands can easily spiral out of control. The Crombie Report explicitly states that Ontarians overwhelmingly want the Greenbelt expanded, not turned into an enormous development. Water quality and protection could quickly revert to pre-Walkerton standards, endangering lives.

The 600-member Hamilton Naturalists' Club joins with many conservation and environmental organizations, and a growing number of municipal officials and representatives across Ontario, in opposing very contentious aspects of Bill 66.
We urge the government to listen to the constructive feedback it is receiving and rewrite this omnibus deregulation bill to ensure that economic development and job creation will be sustainable in terms of environmental protection and sound planning.
Like many others, we do not support various sections in this sweeping Bill that would amend or abolish well-established regulations and legislation, affecting 12 municipalities, that have been designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage features such as the Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine, the health of watersheds and farmland.
We are especially opposed to Schedule 10 in the Act, which would allow municipalities to introduce ""open for business"" bylaws that would override critical legislative requirements that ensure sustainable planning, protect our environment, public health, natural resources and more.
The Greenbelt Act, of vital importance in preserving the quality of life in fast-growing and heavily urbanized southern Ontario, is just one of the beneficial laws that would be circumvented by Bill 66, notwithstanding Premier Ford's promise to leave the Greenbelt intact. The premier's statement was well-founded, in light of a 2016 Nanos poll that found 90 per cent of Ontarians believe the province is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all.  Ninety-seven per cent support the right to clean air and water.
Laws that safeguard the Greenbelt, the Great Lakes, the Oak Ridges Moraine, farmland and more must be comprehensive. The protection that communities rely upon will be put at risk whenever a municipality chooses to enact an ""open for business"" bylaw for exemption from provincial requirements.
Ontario's sound foundation of balanced, sustainable environmental and planning legislation must not be eroded by municipalities, one by one. Watersheds, for example, cover multiple municipal boundaries. Pollution emanating from one municipality invariably causes harm to an area well beyond the original source. Ontario, if anything, should strive to assist municipalities in improving initiatives such as the Greenbelt, ideally with a Bluebelt to enhance protection of watersheds.
It is difficult to understand why the province would open the possibility of the Clean Water Act, a welcome safeguard implemented after the Walkerton tragedy, being circumvented by Bill 66. Citizens have ample reason to worry that an exemption from the Clean Water Act would jeopardize the safety of our drinking water.
Similarly, the HNC opposes the potential repeal of the Toxics  Reduction Act in Schedule 5, a proposal that has particularly worrisome implications for industrial cities like Hamilton.
It is disturbing that Bill 66 would permit ""open for business"" bylaws to eliminate opportunities for public input on planning decisions. Such bylaws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.  We join with many groups in finding such lack of transparency completely unacceptable.
Many organizations and municipal officials have questioned the need for new ""open for business"" bylaws, ostensibly proposed in part by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation on November 8,, 2018, at Queen's Park, many municipalities indicated they have a surplus of employment lands.
We believe Schedule 10 and Schedule 5 would undoubtedly be a retrograde step, turning back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and inspired leadership by governments of all political stripes. Ontario must not return to an era of short-term, politically expedient planning that would degrade our natural resources, promote costly urban sprawl at the expense of precious farmland, jeopardize the safety of our drinking water, and diminish our quality of life.
It is crucial that our young people and future generations are not burdened with trying to solve such daunting problems as a result of provincial policies which were the problem rather than the solution.
We urge the government to remove Schedule 10 and Schedule 5 from Bill 66.  It is essential that conservation and environmental organizations, together with municipalities, are fully consulted.  We urge the government to rewrite the legislation as we have suggested to ensure that Ontario's prosperity is managed in a responsible way to the benefit of present and future generations.

19689,/comment/19689,"Bill 66 allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would negate legal and ethical requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being.
Such by-laws would override approved source protection plans intended to safe-guarding existing and future municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides. This returns the people of Ontario to a pre-Walkerton-crisis vulnerability in terms of water quality but, moreover, the proposed act thus actually threatens economically productive activities and growth.
Likewise Bill 66 would repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce use and emission of toxic chemicals. Again, this threatens the health of Ontarians.
Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for important habitats and species, as set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.  Equally, proposed by-laws bypass agricultural protections in the PPS and other regulations.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. Likewise they trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
These by-laws would take precedence over municipal official plans and override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
The intended effect, of these changes is to increase urban sprawl.  Sprawl is an expensive drag on the economy and a contributor to human-induced climate change. Sprawl’s inefficient and extensive infrastructure has to be maintained in perpetuity at the expense of citizen and corporate tax-payers.
Businesses make investment decisions on quality-of-life calculations for employees that they wish to attract. The above changes will be counter-productive in the emerging knowledge economy of Ontario. They impede Ontario’s capacity to create jobs and attract workers.
Bill 66 is an alarming melange, thrown together in an “omnibus” format that defies rational debate (We have here regulations affecting the wages of greenhouse workers, bed-ridden seniors, college students, international driving permits, expression of religious  beliefs, unionists, child care standards, loan guarantees, electricity meters, consumer credit, the work week, elevators, architectural detailing, pawnbrokers….. and on…. and on ,……and on).
Worst of all, and contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the above by-laws could be passed without prior public notice and behind closed doors. Community members - citizens - would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. That is not Canadian democracy as we know it!

Bill 66 essentially undermines this future by selling out lands critical to water protection, agricultural development and conservation to developers for more sprawling low density homes.
The Halton Hills region includes a vibrant agricultural community, depends on ground water and already is seeing extensive development on the south side of Georgetown towards Steeles avenue and as a result already suffers from terrible congestion going into and out of the community Monday to Friday. I can't understand how a government with strong rural support would support a bill that would put those elements at risk to make a few millionaire real estate developers even richer - especially as there is more than enough land to build more housing supply.

Those aforementioned areas are Ontario's jewels, and they provide us with fresh drinking water, recreational opportunities, prime agricultural land and a buffer zone to provide cities with greenspace (oxygen production, carbon sequestering etc.). DO NOT DEVELOP IN THE GREENBELT OR OTHER PROTECTED AREAS. DO NOT REMOVE WATER PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS. We do not wish to drink poisons, and nor should polluted water become the norm.
The last time ""restrictions"" were eased, people died from contaminated water in Walkerton. Let us never forget that this happened in Ontario, a developed world jurisdiction which used to have laws to prevent such tragedies, until a certain government stupidly decided that water protection laws were bad for business.
So-called ""red tape"" is most often there to protect us, the little people, from others who would choose profits over people, and environmental destruction over preservation of life for/of future generations. Short term gain is great for politicians but not for the health of the population. Make the right decision and do not reverse years of work to put safeguards in place for those sensitive areas. Environmentalism is not a fad or popular trend - it is our health and well-being at stake.
2. Regarding streamlining long term care standards - will those new regulations ensure the safety of the most vulnerable, the patients who cannot speak up for themselves?
3. Regarding the removal of restrictions on the number of children supervised by home daycare providers - how will you guarantee that there is adequate supervision? Again, you are removing safeguards for our most vulnerable, who cannot speak for themselves. Instead, encourage more home daycares to open, rather than placing more burden on existing centres. Childcare is a difficult profession even under the most ideal conditions.

You have already shown that you do not care about the minimum wage earner by freezing their salaries.

So many are trapped in the ""working poor"" cycle of poverty - and those same people probably need to rely on charities and government aid to make it through the week. There are not enough hours in the day to earn more than they do. Ensure that workers get the overtime pay they deserve.

been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the
Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.

Dear Mr. Helfinger,
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
We, the undersigned organizations, strongly oppose several aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. We disagree with the Government of Ontario’s contention that Bill 66 cuts “unnecessary” and “out of date” regulations (ERO posting 013-4293). This is patently not true in the case of Schedule 10 which introduces “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical requirements under several laws that are designed to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being and to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in land-use decisions.
We outline our concerns below and trust that they will be considered with respect to all three relevant ERO postings (i.e., 013-4293, 013-4125, 013-4239).
Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent fundamental protections for environmental and human health.
The Government of Ontario claims that Bill 66 will “make Ontario more competitive by cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date” (ERO 013-4293). To this end it intends to allow municipalities to pass open-for-business by-laws so that they can permit land-uses “without having to strictly adhere to existing local requirements (e.g., official plan and zoning)” (ERO 013-4125). Both government statements are misleading. The laws, plans and policies that will be sidestepped through open-for-business by-laws are neither unnecessary nor out of date. Nor are they simply “local requirements.” As outlined in the table below, open-for-business by-laws would override requirements to be consistent with many of Ontario’s key planning laws and policies recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation.
Table: Key requirements that will be overridden in seven of the ten laws listed in Schedule 10
Law listed under Schedule 10 of Bill 66 	Requirements that would not apply to an open-for-business by-law	Timing of the passing or most recent revision of specific law, plan or policy
Planning Act, Subsection 3 (5):	This section requires the decisions of municipalities and others (boards, ministers, government agencies) to be consistent with policy statements and provincial plans. This includes Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) requirements regarding natural heritage protection, water features protection, active transportation, climate resiliency etc.	The Provincial Policy Statement was revised in 2014 following five years of in-depth public consultation.
Planning Act, Section 24:	This section requires public works and by-laws to be consistent with municipal official plans.	Municipal official plans are to be reviewed every five or ten years, with community consultation.
Planning Act, Subsections 34 (10.0.0.1) to (34):	These subsections set out requirements for public engagement in order to amend a zoning by-law, including public notice, public consultation and opportunities for appeal.
Clean Water Act, 2006, Section 39:  	This section requires land-use planning decisions (municipal, provincial and others) to conform to the significant threat policies and Great Lakes policies adopted in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water. It also requires public works, municipal by-laws and provincial approvals to be consistent with the significant threat policies. 	Since the law came into effect in 2007, communities across Ontario have been developing source protection plans, with public input required.
Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, Section 20:	This section requires planning decisions to conform with designated policies in “geographically focused initiatives,” a tool that allows communities to solve complex problems to protect or restore the ecological health of the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River basin.	The law was passed in October 2015.
Greenbelt Act, 2005, section 7:	This section requires that planning decisions conform to the Greenbelt Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the Greenbelt Plan.	The Greenbelt Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Section 6:	This section requires that planning decisions conform with designated policies of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan. It requires that in cases where policies in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan conflict with other provincial plans or policies, that which provides the greatest level of protection for the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed will prevail.	The law was passed in 2008.
Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, section 7:	This section requires that planning decisions conform with the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and prohibits by-laws to be passed that conflict with the plan.	The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
Places to Grow Act, 2005, Subsection 14 (1):	This section requires that planning decisions comply with the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario.	The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe was amended in 2017, after extensive public consultation.
The potential negative impact of open-for-business by-laws is far-reaching and profound. In each case they would override key operative provisions in the laws listed in Schedule 10, undermining fair and consistent application of laws and policies designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage, farmland and watershed health across Ontario, and leaving communities open to unchecked development. For example, policies that would not apply in open-for-business by-law areas include:
•	Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems);
•	Those protecting provincially significant wetlands, woodlands and valley lands and habitat of species at risk;
•	Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency;
•	Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
•	Those protecting two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
•	Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed;
•	Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to the interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water.
Open-for-business by-laws would eliminate opportunities for public input on planning decisions.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, open-for-business by-laws would bypass legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act) designed to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land-use decisions in our communities. Open-for-business by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them. The only check and balance against municipal misuse is the requirement for the minister’s approval, which itself has no formal mechanism for public input.
Further, Bill 66 would allow Cabinet (not the Legislature) to add other legal provisions to the list of those in Schedule 10 to be circumvented by open-for-business by-laws, an approach which limits opportunities for transparent public consideration and debate.
Finally, we question whether there is demand from municipalities for open-for-business by-laws, ostensibly proposed by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 in Toronto, many participants indicated that there is a surplus of employment lands. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal councils and planners (e.g., in Sudbury, Waterloo, Kitchener (City and Region), Wilmot, Cambridge, Woolwich, Guelph, Norfolk, Aurora, Burlington, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Halton, Mulmur, Ajax, Wellesley, Puslinch, Whitchurch Stouffville, Barrie, Collingwood, Georgina, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about open-for-business by-laws and the circumvention of laws that protect drinking water, farmlands and natural areas and ensure public input and transparency in decision-making. Many of these municipalities have also passed resolutions opposing this Bill.
Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with some flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and powerful and influential developers.
Concluding remarks
From Kenora to Toronto and Ottawa to Windsor, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. Open-for-business by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely. Bill 66 would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment and the health of our communities. Ontarians do not want another disaster like Walkerton, when over 2,000 people fell ill and seven died as a result of a failure to safeguard the local water system. Environmental deregulation, budget cuts and staffing reductions were all identified as major contributing factors in that tragedy.
We urge the government to avoid similar mistakes and to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.

19751,/comment/19751,"I am very concerned about the changes proposed in this Bill 66.  The changes that most concern me have to do with the environmental impact of opening up lands and 'development' without requiring regulation and review.  'Reducing red tape' is a very broad goal, and there are times when red tape is necessary to ensure that proposals are following regulations that protect people from the effect of those proposals.
When we put business development ahead of health and environmental priorities, everyone suffers.  Reducing regulation in so many places is concerning to me:
- why are we reducing the requirements on the number of children allowed in daycares?  Are there studies indicating that our current cap is unreasonable and that more children per adult will still be safe and effective for the children included?  The purpose (to provide more space for more children) is not justified if those spaces result in over worked staff and unsafe environments.  Perhaps instead more funds can be put to daycare spaces in Ontario so that there is a business incentive to create more daycares that are properly regulated, where number of children is capped, and where staff are properly compensated for their work.
- opening up land for development: there is plenty of land in municipalities that are already available for development with existing zoning and regulations.  In Hamilton, Ontario, we have former industrial parks that are empty of business and are ripe for development by business.  These lands are within existing infrastructure of the city, meaning that electrical, water, sewage, etc. services are already in place for those spaces.  I cannot support opening up Greenbelt land or farmland for rezoning and development when those lands are non-recoverable, and necessary for the health of our citizens in the long-term.
- reducing red tape is generally a euphemism for reducing regulation.  In the areas of air, water, education, food regulation, worker's safety, regulation is meant to keep people safe, healthy, and to preserve our systems for years to come.  I do not support de-regulation without clear evidence-based research behind it.  I do not feel that this government has done that work to justify these changes.

19770,/comment/19770,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018.
About Us: The Rescue Lake Simcoe Coalition is a lake-wide umbrella organization representing 17 member groups around Lake Simcoe that share a concern for the lake’s health, and a desire to improve its future.
We are a member of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition, and we support their submission as well.
What does Bill 66 do?
The main subject of our submission is the relevance of the legislation that is impacted under Schedule 10 of the Bill. Under Schedule 10, there is a proposal to create an Open for Business Bylaw (OFB-ZBL) tool which allows municipalities to apply to the Minister of Municipal Affairs for permission to use an Open for Business Bylaw. This bylaw is intended to allow the municipality to fast track the approval of development applications whose primary purpose is employment (which can include retail) and can also include residential, commercial and industrial land uses as a secondary use.
In order to facilitate fast tracking employment development applications, this Bill aims to cut “red tape”. However, this attempt to cut red tape guts key planning and environmental legislation including 5 sections of the Planning Act, Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, 2006, Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act, 2005, Section 6 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008 and Section 7 of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001. The sections affected are those with legal effect. Said in another way, without those sections, the affected legislation is rendered impotent as if the other protective policies contained in the Acts are non-existent.
Thus, an OFB-ZBL would enable any participating and approved municipality to bypass a host of regulations that are intended to control sprawl, safeguard municipal drinking water, protect Lake Simcoe, the Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine, and the natural features within those geographical areas.  That said, we do understand that the use of the Open for Business Bylaw is site specific, as is the effect of Schedule 10, and that the passage of Bill 66 would not mean that the legislation affected by Schedule 10 is cut across the province.
In our view, the environment and the economy are inextricably linked, and damage done to our environment literally costs us, “the people” who depend on water, air, and food (which, last we checked was everyone) in a variety of ways. Protecting natural features like wetlands, on the other hand, has multiple benefits such as municipal and household cost savings and preserving ecosystem health and biodiversity.
If the government is serious about cutting red tape then it should streamline the approvals process, and deal with duplicative policies without undermining the right of citizens to participate in local development decisions, or the future of our water and natural resources. We believe this would be welcomed by planners, municipalities and developers.
We recommend that the Province remove Schedule 10 of Bill 66 and make no further attempts to weaken environmental legislation affecting Lake Simcoe.
What does Bill 66 do to the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and Plan?
Due to the phosphorus pollution stresses affecting Lake Simcoe, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, and Plan, 2009, came into effect in order to, among other things, “protect, improve or restore the elements that contribute to the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed, including water quality, hydrology, key natural heritage features and their functions, key hydrologic features and their functions.”
We are concerned that as Lake Simcoe’s health is showing tentative signs of recovery that additional assaults could negate any gains made.  For example, an OFB-ZBL could be applied by any of the municipalities in the watershed and as such may not be required to meet any of the policies contained within the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan (LSPP) for qualifying development applications.  OFB-ZBL development applications, therefore; would not be legally bound to:
•	Comply with additional protection policy for natural features like forest and wetlands;
•	Comply with mandatory natural buffers around streams, the lake, and around other natural features;
•	Comply with mandatory septic inspection system to catch faulty systems, and ensure septic systems are doing their job;
•	Use enhanced stormwater management guidelines in their planning and development.
Other components of the LSPP that could be swept aside with the use of the OFB-ZBL are:
•	The requirement that no new sewage treatments plants (STPs) can be built unless they are replacing an old system;
•	The current phosphorus load caps on STPs are tough, and in the LSPP’s associated Phosphorus Reduction Strategy, the plan is for these caps to get lower over time, forcing municipalities to upgrade the technologies used in the STPs or get creative in other ways to reduce the system’s phosphorus load to the lake. The biggest gains in lowering phosphorus loads have come from these STP load caps [i]. We need them to stay tough to keep bringing phosphorus loads down.
It should be noted that 58% of the land in the Lake Simcoe watershed is in the Greenbelt Plan area, which provides similar protection to forests, wetlands, and buffers around natural features as the LSPP. Allowing development to not adhere to the policies of the Greenbelt Plan will reduce the amount of natural cover in the watershed, which given past evidence, will lower the lake’s water quality.  Protecting natural features is an inexpensive way to get services we need: A lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority report found that the value of Lake Simcoe wetlands’ ecosystem services is approximately $435 million each year.
Avoiding the LSPP’s designated policies through the use of OFB-ZBLs would create an uncoordinated stewardship approach for a body of water that depends on regional coordination and cooperation. The gutting of the LSPP through the use of OFB-ZBLs would negatively affect the lake, and therefore Bill 66 threatens the economies that rely on a healthy Lake Simcoe.
Lake Simcoe’s health is a local economic driver
The potential of Bill 66 and an OFB-ZBL could significantly damage or threaten existing, key regional economic drivers. In Simcoe County and around the Lake Simcoe watershed, our existing economies are highly reliant on water (Wasaga Beach, Lake Simcoe, Georgian Bay) as well as our agricultural systems. Tourism and recreation bring an estimated $200 million each year for the Lake Simcoe economy.
Further, research conducted by Ryerson University in 2015  includes the following highlights, which demonstrate the importance of a healthy Lake Simcoe in the local economy, and show us the value of sustainability to tourists. Ryerson Associate Professor Dodds’ report, says,
The average visitor spends $178 per person for an overnight stay and $49 per same day visit. The potential to generate economic contribution to the region is high (i.e. the economic impact potential for 1,000 average groups of visitors who travel to Lake Simcoe to fish and stay overnight generate $1.2 million in visitor spending, which generates $1.1 million in GDP in Ontario (indicating a low level of economic leakage), produces $727,000 in labor income that equates to 17 full time jobs.
In addition, $273,000 in combined direct taxes for all three levels of government is generated.
There are four main user groups that represent 65% of the visitors to the region:
o Outdoor recreation
o Visiting friends and relatives
o Fishing
o Going to a cottage
There is a high interest in sustainability by all user groups:
o 73% somewhat or extremely likely to consider sustainability in their travel plans;
o Outdoor recreation (68%) and fishermen (70%) are the most interested in seeing   sustainability showcased as well as considering it in their travel plans;
o Lower income were also the most interested in sustainability (44% of those who make under $50,000 per annum).
(Dodds, pg 4)
Putting the Lake Simcoe ecosystem at risk through Bill 66 could very well weaken the tourism industry, and thus the local sustainable tourism and fishing industries. This kind of red-tape-cutting is not helpful to communities and local entrepreneurs.
We sincerely hope that logic prevails, and that this government will remove Schedule 10 of Bill 66 and make no further attempts to weaken environmental legislation affecting Lake Simcoe. There are many more constructive ways to cut red tape than by gutting long-fought environmental polices, many of them gained through campaigns funded and run by “the people” of Ontario.

Water and watersheds must be protected!
Protect our land, too!  Agricultural groups across the province are very concerned with Schedule 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, because it would allow municipalities to pass “open for business” bylaws that could lead to development of prime farmland in order to “reduce red tape” and create jobs – without any public consultation, without regard to any planning laws or water protection and with no right of appeal.
I do not support Bill 66.  There must be a better way.

19774,/comment/19774,"Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers. Archaeology gives a voice to many who have
been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario
Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.

19781,/comment/19781,"By eliminating the Toxics Reduction Act and allowing for development under Schedule 10 of Bill 66 that ignores important environmental measures, these proposals eliminate the regulations that are meant to protect the very people whom these government claims to be “for”. These regulations are only “red tape” if you ignore the very reasons that they exist, such as the role of the Clean Water Act to protect Ontarians from another tragedy such as the one that once occurred in Walkerton. Aside from the proposal being fundamentally against this government’s claims of being “for the people”, it is poorly defined and short-sighted in nature.
By eliminating the duty to consult the public about development projects and removing the right for appeal, Bill 66 goes against the democratic rights of the people. This attempt to hide decisions that affect “the people” behind closed doors is extremely suspect for a supposedly beneficial bill. Planners know very well why the present-day consultation processes exist, these are not simply “red tape”, but rather, help to ensure that the rights and freedoms of “the people” are met. Would a government that was “for the people” really like to go back to a time when developers were simply able to pave an expressway through a city (think Robert Moses, New York City), and displace everyone in its path due to a lack of public input and consultation? Likely not, yet this what happened in times when the public did not have input in planning processes. If this government is truly “for the people” it is ludicrous to implement a policy that will prevent these very people from having any say as to what happens in their communities.
When it comes to the un-scientific nature taken on by schedule 10 of Bill 66, the City of Waterloo makes an excellent point in their staff report  regarding the scientific concept of cumulative effects. The concept of cumulative effects is a relatively simple one, the effects of an environmental loss or degradation are not only felt locally, but also in interconnected environmental components. If a threshold of degradation is surpassed, it is possible that the ecosystem can go past the point of recovery within our lifetimes. An example of this is easily illustrated in the case of Waterloo’s drinking water, the majority of which comes from groundwater and is already under immense pressure, due to a high population in the surrounding region and decreased ability for recharge in a paved landscape. In this instance, decisions made by the adjacent municipalities of Kitchener and Cambridge on open-for-business zoning could have effects on the watershed that could be felt regionally. Although a municipality can decide to opt-out of the open-for-business by-law, they cannot decide to opt-out of the effects that the activities of adjacent municipalities may have.
Another scientific argument against the implementation of Bill 66 exists in the case of wetlands, which protect “the people” through ecosystem services up to and including flood mitigation. The importance of wetlands is internationally recognized by the 170 contracting parties of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, of which Canada is a signatory. A great deal of protection for these invaluable features comes in the form of Ontario’s Provincial Policy Statement, if they are deemed significant or are coastal. Policies that will be exempt by Schedule 10 of Bill 66 exist because the scientific, economic, and social importance of features like wetlands is well understood both provincially, nationally, and internationally. Prior to these policies, wetlands were drained at such a rate that only a fraction remain, and we simply cannot afford to lose these under Bill 66. Eliminating the need for development to pay attention to and conserve these features again goes against what is actually best “for the people”, as one can expect that the increased flooding events that will happen with climate change will be dramatically worsened if we don’t have environmental features like wetlands to mitigate them.
When it comes to the Toxics Reduction Act, the claim that it is redundant and that the same function will be covered by the federal Chemicals Management Plan is simply false. Data shows that for facilities that have indicated an intention to reduce toxics in their toxics management plants, the amounts of toxic substances used, created, or contained in product steadily decreased during the period 2012-2016. However, as compliance with plans under this Act is voluntary, data on reductions as a whole actually show an unchanging trend and even an increase per year in terms of substances related to cancer, and released to air, land, and water . Rather than eliminate it, it is important to improve this act to achieve overall toxics reductions that will protect “the people”, as neither the current program, nor the federal legislation is currently managing to do so.
Overall, removal of the Toxics Reduction Act and the implementation of Schedule 10 of Bill 66 ignores the fundamental democratic rights of the people of Ontario, as well as the planning and scientific research that comes from our universities. These proposals need to be reconsidered in a manner that accounts for the people’s democratic rights and the science that will keep our communities viable in the face of climate change. If this government is truly “for the people”, they will not proceed with these proposals without significant modification that improves beyond the short-sighted nature that they currently hold.

Changes involving such a different array of areas of society should be rejected and only allow policy changes proposal for very specific aspects.
The person driving this changes is an oligarch following with the ""Globalisation"" agenda that has already destroyed countless regions of the world. At the end, the only beneficiaries are a few multinational corporations that belong to the same group of people.
At the end they only care about increasing their profits regardless of what happens to people, society, the country and the environment. The globalisation of corporations is just a way to hide profits and minimise taxes; there is no real exports, it is just moving parts from place to place.
The result is that the taxes needed to provide the services these corporations need to operate (security, roads, etc.) are subsidised for them and mainly paid by the common people, while the owners of these corporation hide their profits and avoid paying taxes.
And the ""jobs"" created by this ""open for business"" policies are just as disposable as a dirty napkin. Get the cheapest guy either from desperate locals or even more desperate new immigrants through third party agencies, and get rid of them as soon as you can find a cheaper one. Have you analysed what is the average duration of employment nowadays in big companies and multinationals not counting the desperate humans at the bottom?

- many changes of different areas are bounded together to hide the social impact these changes will have.
- many of the proposed changes are really detrimental to the environment.
- it will reduce the quality of jobs in Ontario and it will lower real wages and safety to employees.
- it does not benefit Canada or Canadians
- it will further help the self declare king help his friend and himself get richer by avoiding paying for what they need to operate businesses while transferring the tax burden to the common people.

An example is that you need approval from the Escarpment Commission to install solar panels on your roof. That obviously defies any logic. Consequently, people in this region (including myself) lost confidence and trust in the Escarpment Commission and their neighbouring organisations in the Green Belt region. At the same time, most people you would ask are in favour of conserving and protecting our (somewhat) rural areas around the GTA. So the issue is more to win over people's hearts with a reasonable set of regulations that citizens can follow, rather than scrapping the Green Belt protection the majority wants to maintain. Delegating the protection to the municipalities is not an effective solution because it is a) a regional issue in the first place and b) some municipalities are lacking competence to decide on matters of such great importance.

19825,/comment/19825,"Bill66
I must state my objection to the passage of this bill. It is presented in the format of a routine omnibus housekeeping bill, but is in fact a broad ranging deregulation bill that destroys years of effort to create reasonable protocols for management of the environment and other matters such as workplace safety and urban planning. Having spent many years teaching on matters dealing with the environment, I understand how difficult it is to develop environmental laws that survive intense lobbying by industry to make them as little trouble as possible to the conduct of business. Bill 66 would change this to no trouble at all by allowing certain businesses to by-pass regulations that provide essential environmental protection, as stated in Schedule 10, or to not have them at all, as stated in Schedule 5.
Schedule 5 would repeal the Toxic Reduction Act, as though we had learned nothing from the Walkerton tragedy. True, it was the consequence of human error in monitoring water quality, but water would not have been poisoned in the first place had there been proper control of agricultural contamination. The same could easily result from other toxins that leach into the groundwater around a well, or into lake waters from which communities draw water.
The theme of removing regulations that safeguard water quality is strongly featured in Schedule 10, with the non-application of Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act and Section 7 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act to any Open for Business By-law that a community might enact. The other major theme in Section 10 is to ensure that an Open for Business By-law will preempt existing zoning by-laws, thus creating an open zoning situation that compromises effective urban planning. At this point one realizes that Bill 66 is not a carefully crafted document to fine tune the regulation of business within the context of effective environmental management and urban planning. It is a shopping list of regulations that certain business elites find to be irritating, which they demand to be removed in the name of making Ontario more competitive.
In fact, Ontario has always been competitive due to its connection to America’s industrial manufacturing belt and its ability to diversify. Among the areas of diversification are environmental management and urban planning which have grown, both as stand-alone enterprises and as units within large industrial operations thanks to the need to respond to regulation, a response that also fuels innovation. I think that the perceived benefits of Bill 66 will give way to the realization that by allowing business a free pass on the environment this bill is moving the province in the direction of less business competitiveness, both within and outside the businesses it is supposed to help.

To quote the Canadian Environmental Law Association:
If a municipality passes an “open for business planning by-law” under the proposed law, Bill 66 removes the current legal requirement that municipal land use decisions must conform to significant threat policies in source protection plans approved under the Clean Water Act. This exemption opens the door to large-scale industrial development in vulnerable areas that may threaten groundwater or surface water resources.
By any objective standard, laws that protect drinking water, regulate rail safety or control hazardous chemicals are not red tape. Instead, they are essential safety requirements that we expect governments to enact, enforce and maintain in order to protect the public interest.

19844,/comment/19844,"Architectural Conservancy Ontario — Comments on Bill 66
Architectural Conservancy Ontario (ACO) welcomes the opportunity to provide comments on Bill 66, the proposed Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act.
While there are many problematic things in Bill 66, ACO is especially concerned about the impact of “Open for Business Planning By-laws”, as proposed in Schedule 10 of the bill, for Ontario’s built heritage, cultural heritage landscapes, and archaeological resources. These resources are often drivers of economic development in our communities and make them more economically resilient — they have strong links to the creative economy, attracting business, creative enterprise, cultural industries like film production, investment, and tourism.
 
The government’s rationale for the proposed new planning measure — the “open for business planning (OFBP) by-law” — is to expedite investment and speed up approvals. If the current land use planning process needs improvement, ACO believes the solution is not to provide a means to circumvent long-established and widely-accepted planning rules. These are not “planning barriers” but the essential pieces of a policy-based planning system that respects and safeguards a great range of societal and community benefits. To ignore them not only endangers the public interest in these resources but also opens the door to major conflict and controversy in our communities.
ACO objects to the following features of OFBP by-laws:
they do not have to adhere to provincial policies and provincial plans
they bypass the Planning Act and the Provincial Policy Statement, which includes a policy that ""Significant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes shall be conserved.""
they do not need to follow municipal Official Plans or existing zoning
they cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeals Tribunal
they can proceed without the public being given notice of the by-law and the triggering development proposal 
We believe that OFBP by-laws could pose serious risks to our heritage buildings and other cultural heritage resources.  By exempting land use proposals from cultural heritage policies in the PPS, provincial plans and municipal Official Plans they would effectively eliminate requirements for heritage impact assessments, archaeological assessments and other measures designed to ensure that conservation of heritage resources is considered in planning decisions. Even protected heritage properties designated under the Ontario Heritage Act could be made vulnerable since a municipality that resorts to an OFBP by-law for a property may be encouraged to approve any proposed demolition.
In summary, Schedule 10 of the bill has many potential negative impacts for Ontario’s irreplaceable heritage assets. Architectural Conservancy Ontario urges the government not to enact a measure to be used to waive established planning practices and safeguards, one which may generate serious unforeseen conflict in our communities. The government should look at other ways to streamline and expedite planning processes through discussion and consultation with all affected interests.
About ACO
Architectural Conservancy Ontario is Ontario’s leader in advocacy for conservation of our built environment. With 25 branches across the province, ACO has been actively involved in preserving Ontario’s architectural and environmental heritage since 1933 by helping communities and owners preserve buildings, structures and places of heritage merit.

Bill 66 is not ""An Act to restore Ontario's competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts"". It is an act that is product of the government's laziness and lack of commitment. Bill 66 is not fair to me, it is not fair to you or to the very Earth we live and depend on.

Schedule 10 of Bill 66 is a rookie mistake.
You need to remove this section of the Bill.
It makes me feel like what you're telling us is that we don't matter. Our thoughts and opinions don't matter. No right to consultation, no right to appeal through the OFBBL says this.
Our communities' health doesn't matter. Councils can build where they want, when they want. Our drinking water, our good farmland, our lakes, who cares because it's all up for grabs.
It makes me and my family feel like your rich buddies are more important to you than the regular good people of this province.
I feel angry.
This is not For the People.
This is for Your People and I know by Bill 66, that I'm not one of those people.
I have never, in my entire life, felt more alienated by the Province.

Re: Environmental Registry Comments from Healthy Environments Division, City of Hamilton for Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
Dear Sir/Madame,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The Healthy Environments Division of the Healthy and Safe Communities Department within the City of Hamilton is mandated by the Province of Ontario’s Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHTLC).  One goal of Ontario Public Health Standards: Requirements for Programs, Services, and Accountabilities, (2018) is:
“To reduce exposure to health hazards and promote the development of healthy built and natural environments that support health and mitigate existing and emerging risks, including the impacts of a changing climate.”
The City of Hamilton’s Healthy Environments division maintains the Ontario Public Health Standards in a variety of areas including Safe Water and Air Quality.  Provincial mandates for these areas are stated in the Program Standards of the Ontario Public Health Standards: Requirements for Programs, Services, and Accountabilities, (2018) for Safe Water and Healthy Environments.
The Provincial Program Standard for Safe Water includes the following goals: “To prevent or reduce the burden of water-borne illnesses related to drinking water” and “to prevent or reduce the burden of water-borne illnesses and injuries related to recreational water use.”
The Healthy Environments Division respectfully does not support the passing of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 as it will have potential adverse effects to air quality and safe water systems, misaligning with Ontario’s Public Health Standards and will result in putting Ontario citizen's health at risk.  The division would like to submit the following comments for the Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 EBR posting:
Repeal of Ontario Regulation 455/09, Toxics Reduction Act (2009)
Although some overlap may exist between federal and provincial programs in toxic reduction(s); the provincial approach which was introduced after the federal policy is more advanced in its mandate.   The Province of Ontario has exceeded the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) by placing a greater emphasis on reducing the use and creation of prescribed toxic substances at the cradle end of the industrial process.  The province’s program is a more in depth reporting/accountability mechanism than its federal counterpart. Public transparency has played an integral role in bringing voluntary compliancel.  By repealing this regulation, transparency is lost with potential threat to the health of citizens.
Schedule 10 Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing subsection 34.1 (6) (Planning Act Changes)
The Open-for-business planning by-law may have unintended negative environmental and health impacts. The by-law would allow different types of developments within previously protected naturalized areas such as the Greenbelt, Source Water Protection Areas, Provincially Significant Wetlands and other areas not previously designated for development. Not only do these naturalized areas provide significant carbon sequestration that reduces and stores carbon instead of releasing it in to the environment. It also provides other essential services including stormwater management to prevent flooding, air pollution removal of particulate matter and recreational opportunities to encourage a healthy lifestyle.
Further untended consequences that can accelerate carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere making climate change worse is the urban sprawl that this type of development would allow. Municipalities have planned for greater intensification and connected modes of transportation and allowing development outside of these planned areas would lead to further traffic congestion and greater costs to municipalities that would have to expand infrastructure services including electricity and municipal sewer and water. Municipalities also direct industry and other related types of development towards certain areas to prevent land use compatibility issues. Development allowed near sensitive land uses such as residential development can have negative health related impacts from degradation of localized air quality from future industrial operations and traffic congestion.
The Open-for-business planning by-law does not align with other proposed provincial policy including the Preserving and Protecting our Environment for Future Generations: A Made-in-Ontario Environmental Plan which includes protecting clean air and clean water.
Section 39 of Clean Water Act (2005) --- Source Water Protection Plans
In Ontario, the Boards of Health have the responsibility of protecting population health via the implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards: Requirements for Programs, Services, and Accountability are published as the public health standards for the provision of mandatory health programs and services by the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, pursuant to Section 7 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA).  Therefore, in Ontario, public health programs and services specified under the HPPA must ensure “provision of safe drinking water by small drinking water systems”.  The Clean Water Act (2006) works to protect existing and future sources of drinking water with a focus on source water protection as the essential step to protect the health of the population in this multi-barrier approach.  The need for a multi-barrier approach to Ontario’s drinking water protection was made evident after the Walkerton Water Crisis in 2000 where the drinking water system became contaminated with deadly bacteria, primarily Escherichia coli O157:H7 causing 7 deaths and 2300 illnesses (Ontario Ministry of Attorney General, 2002). The bill would grant municipalities the power to create an ""open for business"" by-law exempting cities and towns from sections of more than a dozen policies and acts, including the Clean Water Act, developed following the Walkerton tragedy. Deviation in Ontario’s current approach to drinking water protection may compromise Ontario’s ability to protect the drinking water supply serving the population and hence place the health of our population at risk of morbidity and mortality similar to those devastating events in the Walkerton Water Crisis (2002).
Section 20 of Great Lakes Protection Act (2015)
The Great Lakes Protection Act (2015) intent is to protect and restore watersheds, wetlands, beaches, shorelines and coastal areas for this Basin.  The Great Lakes are the source of drinking water for 80 percent of the province’s population.  Stressors on the ecosystem from residential/commercial/industrial development must not have any legislative loopholes.   Initiatives or designated policies that protect the natural heritage, land-water interface, hydrology etc. must be kept intact for all developments. This is of paramount importance as Ontario and specifically Hamilton faces more extreme weather and flooding impacts. In 2017 Hamilton experienced unprecedented shoreline damage caused by extreme precipitation and wind. Any legislation that proposes to minimize the protection of the Great Lakes puts municipal infrastructure, water quality and human health at risk.
The Healthy Environments Division is committed to working collaboratively with provincial agencies’ to help improve and ensure the health of citizens in Hamilton and across Ontario. Please do not hesitate to contact the Senior Project Manager – Air Quality and Climate Change within the City of Hamilton Healthy Environments Division. Thank you very much for your time.
Sincerely Yours,

19863,/comment/19863,"In order to remain sustainably competitive with longevity into the future, the province requires better long term, well structured and strong legislation in true matters of future stability, such as environmental health. As a resource-based economy (Randall & Ironside, 1996).
This bill proposes perhaps the most significant environmental regulation rollback In Ontario history: it certainly is in my lifetime. I have very rarely felt ashamed of being Canadian and was happy to return to my home of Canada after living abroad for a few years, and I wanted to stand for my Nation, because I believe we are progressive, strong, and just, but this Bill makes me questioning staying in Canada any longer. The effects of this bill threaten my willingness to start a family here. I want to be proud of my home and the decisions my democratic politicians make, but this will destroy our future: a future that belongs to my children, and my grandchildren, not the oligarch currently making decisions for my future.
My husband is a Doctor who is seeing more and more environmental disease prevalence everyday and myself as a Scientist, sees Ontario’s citizens as needing the right to a healthy environment including air, water and soil. We aren’t just hurting the environment, we are also hurting ourselves and our ability to lead a healthy life (Suzuki). The last time regulations were repealed like this, standards were cut and we were faced with the Walkerton tragedy (Salvadori et al., 2009). As ecosystems are more fragile now and we have put more urban stress on them with impervious surfaces, demands for potable water and electricity for our homes, the infrastructure deficit across many of our urban centers is on the verge of crumble and removing our standards that protect the health of every Ontarian cannot be weakened as Bill 66 proposes. We will face the wrath of much larger systemic and long-term issues which will cost the province inexorably more than we gain from any “claimed increased economic competitiveness” (WaterCanada, 2018). In a resource-based economy, there is no increased competitiveness without an increased natural capital. The cost of floods from filling in all our wetlands and destroying our forests is far greater than the GDP of the buildings that will sit on top of them and that’s on the tip of the iceberg.
We cannot fully comprehend the deleterious effects of this Bill, and in this age of undeniable climate change, do we really want to take that risk? Working WITH the environment is proven to increase GDP and wealth and therefore competitiveness of companies (Interface Inc.). If we want to be competitive, what we need is to be innovative. It’s time to invest in green infrastructure, sustainable buildings and carbon neutral energy production because that is the ONLY way forward. My children deserve the same rights to a healthy life full of opportunities as I had. Do not take this away from our future and do not pass Bill 66.

Our natural habitats naturally filter water, prevent flooding, minimize storm damage, store carbon and provide natural habitat for endangered species.  All of this has enormous financial benefits.
What is the point in having zoning/planning requirements in place if you don't need to ""strictly adhere to them""? Altering height and density rules leave many grey areas open to abuses. Appeal processes are there for a reason.   The money passing across the desk now can have serious irreplaceable  future consequences!!!!!

19866,/comment/19866,"I completely agree with the comments below:
Dear Premier Ford and Members of Provincial Parliament,
As a constituent of Ontario, I have deep concerns about many aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The proposed legislation would override critical requirements under several provincial laws and policies that are designed to protect water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, accessible and transparent public engagement in decision-making, and sets the stage for costly property tax increases to subsidize economically-inefficient, sprawling development. Also with our climate change crisis, Bill 66 undermines our ability to preserve natural green space and protect ground water and surface water resources, and will promote carbon intensive development. Let me ask you...do you have children or grandchildren? Do you think about the long term impacts of such reckless policy and development on future generations...your children and grandchildren? All the hard work over years to enact policies that are here to protect us...you...and safeguard public and private interests throughout Ontario cast aside to line the pockets of corporations that are only concerned about their bottom lines.
I urge you not to proceed with Bill 66, for the reasons outlined below.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning by-laws that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies, and in municipal official plans. The potential negative impact is far-reaching and profound. For example, policies that would not apply in “open-for-business” zoning by-law areas include:
• Those addressing significant threats to municipal drinking water (e.g., landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems). Do you want another Walkerton?
• Those protecting farmland, provincially significant wetlands, woodlands, valley lands and habitat of species at risk. This is so important to preserve as part of our diverse habitat.
• Those supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency. So, so important!
• Those protecting key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine;
• Those protecting two-million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt;
• Those protecting fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed; and
• Those supporting smart, integrated, long-term planning for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a heavily developed region facing intense development pressures.
These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario. A 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water. Is this not what you want? Is this not what you want for your children and grandchildren?
Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with needed flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and influential developers. This is so sad!
The vulnerability of Ontarians is heightened by the fact that “open-for-business” zoning by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump (this sounds like...someone south of the border) laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Compounding the problem, communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them. Certainly not very democratic is it? Put the shoe on the other foot. You were voted in to represent us, not yourselves.
Contrary to the government’s contention that Bill 66 cuts regulations that are out of date, almost all the laws and policies affected were recently passed or updated with extensive public consultation. They include the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Toxic Reduction Act, 2009, the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015, the Provincial Policy Statement (revised in 2014) and the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Growth Plan for the Great Golden Horseshoe (all revised in 2017). Municipal plans themselves are to be updated every five or ten years.
The modern land-use planning and land conservation framework now in place in Ontario was developed over the years by governments of varying political stripes. For example, early work to limit sprawl through Smart Growth, and the establishment and protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine were signature achievements of Progressive Conservative governments. Undermining that legacy would be a huge step backwards.
Finally, there is no evidence of a need to make more employment lands available for development of new businesses or associated commercial, retail or residential development, which is the ostensible purpose of “open-for-business” zoning by-laws. Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal councils and planners (e.g., Sudbury, Waterloo, Kitchener, Wilmot, Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Bradford, Mulmur, Ajax, Wellesley, Puslinch, Whitchurch Stouffville, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about its implications and/or have pointed out the presence of significant employment land surpluses within their respective municipalities. Many of these municipalities have also passed resolutions opposing this Bill.
Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong, progressive government leadership. We should strive to be the role-model or set the bar for all other provinces and countries, for that matter, on how to live sustainably, protect our people, and protect our environments but unfortunately Bill 66 is regressive, dirty, and undemocratic. “Open-for-business” by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening farmland, water resources and sensitive natural features upon which we all rely. I urge all Members of the Provincial Parliament to vote against Bill 66.

19869,/comment/19869,"The following letter to the Chair of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and Council, reflects the views of The Preservation of Agricultural Lands Society (PALS) on Bill 66 Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act 2018
January 15, 2019
Regional Municipality of Niagara
1815 Sir Isaac Brock Way
Thorold, Ontario L2V 4T7
Dear Regional Chair  Bradley and Council
As the oldest  farmland preservation group in Canada,  and credited in the Provincial Legislature  for being the impetus behind the establishment of the Greenbelt land use protections,  the Preservation of Agricultural Lands Society (PALS)  firmly  opposes the Ministry of Municipal Affairs’  proposed Bill  66 “ Open For Business Act .
Therefore, we  call upon  the Regional Municipality of Niagara to let the Government of Ontario  know that our  Niagara’s  Greenbelt tender fruit and grape lands and  other prime farm lands  should not be  “ open for business”  other than that of  tender fruit and grape , cash crops and other farming  and farm-related uses.
While PALS knows that  Bill 66  refers to commercial development, history tells us that this will bring with it  sewer, water,  and road  extensions,  which in turn use  good farmland and put pressure on nearby farmlands and farming.
Additionally, developers, emboldened by the proposed “Open for Business “ local municipal council  zoning   powers, which under Bill 66  can  by-pass Regional planning policies and processes,   are bound to  press for   urban expansions into the  unique and threatened tender fruit and grape lands .  This is particularly important as the Region moves further along in the development of its  new Official Plan.
We would add, that If  lower-tier  municipalities take advantage of  Bill 66, and side-step good planning, by shutting out  public input and ignoring important Regional planning  and  other protective Provincial  Legislation such as the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, Greenbelt Act, and  Places to Grow  Act,   they will put  at risk  fruit lands,  prime farmlands,  water resources,  environmentally sensitive areas and  air quality  in Niagara , which we all, urban or rural, rely on . Therefore,  PALS will also  urge   Niagara’s 12 lower- tier  municipalities  to  go on record, that   they will not use these re-zoning powers during their terms of office  should Bill 66 be approved .

19873,/comment/19873,"Bill 66 is equal parts foolish and reckless. Instead of continuing to sustainably attract and retain new talent and employment in urban cores, especially Toronto, the province proposes that its 'economic growth' should be driven by land-intensive, sprawl-inducing production-based employment. This is an economic approach that is thirty years out of date and does not respond to an increasingly highly-educated potential workforce driven through innovation, new technologies, and forward-thinking industry. Bill 66 also looks to subvert the regulations Ontario has in place to protect our natural environment, resources, and farmland; simply said, when it's gone, it's gone for good. It also flagrantly overrides PPS policies that emphasize active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure, and climate resiliency. The communities of the future are denser, walkable, sustainable, and ultimately richer with community amenities and infrastructure, social capital, and connectivity. The tactics behind Bill 66 look to the past to claw at unsubstantiated short-term economic gains instead of proactively responding to how our cities, province, and an increasingly urbanizing world are changing.

19876,/comment/19876,"I wish to object to the current formulation of Bill 66, both for what I view as its general effect of using omnibus legislation to enable the effective repeal of selected current legislation which currently helps protect the interest of common people, in favour of development interests, and for the specific holes it punches in those protections. The declaration that it is simply a voluntary tool for use at the discretion of municipal governments is at best naïve, at worst disingenuous, as it will incentivise violation of hard-won protections for common people.
My rationale echoes the following excerpts from the CITY OF HAMILTON PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, Planning Division, regarding e proposed open-for-business planning by-law:
“The proposed by-law could have impacts on employment land values and the City s transportation and infrastructure investments by creating uncertainty as a result of unplanned development.
There is a concern that the proposed by-law under Bill 66, which does not contain precise language on its purpose, could potentially be utilized for purposes beyond major employment development, which could undermine the City s planned urban structure and responsible growth strategy.”
Portions of their analysis of which I share concern follows:
“Staff have concerns over the exemptions cited in the draft Bill which identify certain sections of several Acts which do not apply to an open-for-business planning by-law. The exemptions of concern include:  Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, and Great Lakes Protection Act.”
“First, although the option to pass the open-for-business by-law is at the discretion of the municipality, there is a concern that allowing for this option in the legislation will create significant pressure on municipal councils to permit development in areas that would normally be protected under provincial legislation.”
“Second, staff question the rationale for exempting development from these acts for the purpose of promoting economic development….”
“Third, staff have a concern that the inclusion of these exemptions may have the impact of incentivizing development in the Greenbelt Plan area, among others. “
“The decision on whether or not to utilize the open-for-business by-law rests with the local municipality. If the City of Hamilton chooses not to utilize the tool, other surrounding municipalities may choose to do so, and the concerns around impacts on natural areas, water resources and rural lands would remain valid.”
“By permitting development that is not consistent with the PPS, it is not clear how the City can ensure that the provincial interest is being met in the decision on a proposed development.”
“Staff have concerns with allowing development which does not conform to the Official Plan. Allowing new development to proceed which does not conform to the Plans not only undermines the planned urban structure, but staff view it as a slippery slope to opening the door to additional unplanned development. “
In the event of passage, I support these recommendations cited from the Hamilton Planning report:
(i)	Remove the exemptions to Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act, Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act, and the exemption to any prescribed provision"".
(ii)	 Include the prescribed purpose of the proposed open-for-business planning by-law in section 34.1(5) of the draft Bill to restrict the prescribed purpose to major employment uses only.
(iii)	Prior to passage of the proposed legislation, provide additional information on the prescribed information and prescribed criteria which must accompany a request to use an open-for-business by-law, which is currently referenced in the draft Regulation but without details.
(iv)	When the Province proposes new regulations, the full text be provided to allow for meaningful review and comment.

19877,/comment/19877,"The protected area of the Greenbelt and that throughout Ontario is crucial for the health and quality of life of Ontarians. This Greenbelt surrounds the GTA and protects the waterways that feed into Lake Ontario, along with other locations from which large proportions of the population get their drinking water. Additionally, it protects sources of drinking water for future populations. It is critical that we protect this land so that we will have clean water not only for today but for years to come. On top of the access to clean water that the Greenbelt provides us, it allows for an area of reduced air pollution surrounding the metropolis of the GTA. With health conditions related to poor air quality on the rise, it is crucial that we protect this land so that Ontarians have access to clean, fresh air to maintain a high quality of life. This increase in exposure to poor water and air quality would only be amplified by repealing the Toxic Reduction Act, which again reduces Ontarians' exposure to harmful chemicals. Not only does this protected land improve quality of life by providing clean air and water and reduce our exposure to toxic chemicals, but it improves quality of life by reducing urban sprawl and providing natural and recreational areas for Ontarians. Because of the above reasons, I strongly oppose the Bill 66, as it would irreversibly hinder the health and quality of life that are currently experienced by Ontarians. The Walkerton Water Crisis of 2000 proves as an example of what happens when government is not present to preside over decisions that put our health in danger. This legislature is in place to protect the health of Ontarians, and the ability to bypass these regulations in aim of economic development will ultimately hurt the health and quality of life of all Ontarians.

With this narrow focus on business, the proposed measures in Bill 66 overlook opportunities to create, not just jobs and profits, but environmentally sustainable, livable communities and undermine the future health, productivity and well-being of all citizens for generations to come.

19899,/comment/19899,"I would like to voice my strong opposition to Bill 66, particularly section 10 of the Bill which introduces an ""Open for Business"" by-law tool. ""Red tape reduction"" and ""open for business"" are snappy catch-all phrases that are constantly being thrown around by this new government. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that this government has not giving much thought to what this philosophy means in practice; this has been demonstrated by the continuous conflation of eliminating redundancies with out-right disregard for the legislation that was created to protect our most valuable resources.
This Planning Act tool exempts proponents from adhering to provincial policies, provincial plans (Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, etc.), and local planning documents, all the while removing appeal rights and limiting public consultation/notice. Interesting that this ""Government for the People"" is removing ""the People's"" ability to give their opinion on projects.
This tool is being positioned as an ""economic development tool""; however, all it does is de-legitimatize the provincial and local planning decisions that have been made in the public interest. Individual municipalities have spoken out against the tool -- this is both incredibly encouraging and troubling, as this could create a ""race-to-the-bottom"" attitude in this Province. In my opinion, clear, effective, and consistent policy application is the ultimate red tape reduction strategy. Land speculation, which has been proven to go down when clear planning policy direction is in place, will be spurred. This will both increase the price of farm land and make it more vulnerable -- at a time where we need to be doing everything to protect the precious farm land we have. Re-introducing uncertainty about agricultural land protection is NOT what our farmers need.
Only 5% of Canada's land base is considered prime agricultural land and a considerable amount of this land is right here in Ontario. It should be treasured and we should do everything within our power to protect this land and keep it viable. Even under current policies, this land is at risk. Under Bill 66, prime farm land will be put at unprecedented risk. Ontario's agri-food sector creates 1/9 jobs in Ontario, and contributes $39 billion to Ontario's GDP annually. It is high time to start seeing agricultural land as integral to job creation in this Province.
I was beyond shocked to see Section 39 of the Clean Water Act included in this Bill. We are not that far removed from the Walkerton crisis, and the inclusion of this piece of legislation in this Bill is incredibly dangerous. Who benefits from this?! The more I think about this Bill, the more baffled I am as I try to determine who is benefiting from this, and what cynical and short-sighted minds developed this legislation. We may have jobs, but will we have a healthy environment and the things we value as a Province?
Please listen to the countless municipalities that have already passed resolutions that they will not use this tool.  Please listen to the countless Ontarians of all political stripes in and in all geographies -- in Ajax, Hamilton, Walkerton, Kitchener any beyond -- that are speaking out against this tool. If for no other reason but to keep your alleged promise of being the ""Government for the People"".

19908,/comment/19908,"Dear Mr. Petersen,
Please accept this letter in oppostion to Bill 66, the proposed “Open for Business” provincial legislation.
This Bill, allowing municipalities to request a by-law  providing exemptions from the Planning Act,  would, when invoked, by-pass land-use planning and environmental laws and regulations in the name of being 'Open for Business'.
The legislation goes further, foregoing any consultative process with the public and disallowing residents from appealing such 'Open for Business' decisions.
This would serve to disenfranchise the public, whose consent is the democratic underpinning of all  laws under which they are to be governed.
In addition, the strong potential for negative environmental consequences of land development in sensitive areas should  this legislation be enacted, will be borne by the Ontarians whose rights to consultation, due process and appeal are to be curtailed.
The provisions of Bill 66 by-passing laws, protections, policies and regulations that have been generations in the making and which benefit all Ontarians, is unacceptable.
I respectfully ask you to consider these points, and the many other points being brought to your attention by individual residents, community associations, municipalities, environmental groups and other concerned entites and to withdraw any and all legislative changes to the Planning Act, as well as the provision for the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 as proposed in Bill 66.

Dear Mr. Helfinger,
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
I strongly support the submissions made by Ontario Nature, Environmental Defence, Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition and other organizations in opposition to Bill 66 and these regulations. I have attached links to some of these submissions below.
I am appalled that a municipal Council would be empowered to pass an ""Open For Business By-law"" without any notice, public consultation or public appeal process.
Further, It is completely unconscionable that such a by-law could exempt some development proposal (for the promise of as little as 50 jobs!) from meeting the legitimate planning and environmental requirements of The Planning Act, including local and upper tier Official Plans, local zoning by-laws, the Provincial Policy Statement for Land Use Planning, the Growth Plan, the Greenbelt Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Clean Water Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Protection Act, etc. which are listed in Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
The repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act is another totally wrong-headed part of Bill 66.
I have practiced as a land use planner in Ontario since 1970 and have never witnessed such an assault on legitimate planning and environmental legislation and regulation as is proposed in Bill 66.
I strongly urge the Government to withdraw Bill 66 immediately.

19934,/comment/19934,"As a devoted member of the Ontario community, I do not approve of the Bill 66, or the proposed ""Open for Business"" act that allows development in Ontario's greenbelt and sensitive areas.
The most important concern is in regard to the endangerment of Ontario drinking water. Clean water is an essential need for all citizens of this province and this important resource is put at risk by Bill 66, as it allows companies and corporations to build in sensitive areas, without the protection of waterways.
We have evidence of the broad effect of contaminated water. The Walkerton Tragedy is a perfect example of what can come of exposing community water resources to harsh chemicals and bacteria due to poor waste management and water protection. With this tragedy, more than two thousand Ontario residents became sick and six died. The Walkerton Tragedy could have been prevented if the provincial government prioritized waste management and water safely. We simply cannot risk the health and safety of Ontario citizens again and Bill 66 has a large potential to be extremely dangerous and detrimental.
As well, Ontario farmers will also be affected by Bill 66, as it will harm almost two million acres of farmland. Introduction of this bill will result in a great loss of farmland and disruption of farming communities.
Lastly, transit corridors will also be at risk if Bill 66 is put in place. Transit corridors are an integral part of the preservation of wildlife populations. With Bill 66 and its inadequate restrictions of company development in sensitive wildlife areas, transit corridors will be lost and could cause irreparable damage to Ontario wildlife.
In consideration of the Bill 66, I strongly uphold an opposing stance to this bill as its benefits do not outweigh its serious harm. We must first put forth the stability of Ontario farmers, wildlife and most importantly Ontario citizens health and safety as a whole.

The proposed legislation would override critical requirements under several provincial laws and policies that are designed to protect safe drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, consistent and transparent public involvement in decision-making and sets the stage for costly property tax increases to subsidize economically inefficient sprawl development.
I urge the government to not proceed with Bill 66, as this would allow allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning by-laws that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies and in municipal official plans.

19938,/comment/19938,"The current governing party and it’s leader was elected on the promise not to open the Ontario Greenbelt to new development other than those uses (primarily agricultural or agribusiness related) allowed by The Greenbelt Act of  2005.
The passage of the proposed Bill 66, The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, if approved as introduced to the legislature in December of 2018, will break this promise. Specifically, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 specifically allows The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act to override the provisions of section 7 of The Greenbelt Act, when these two acts are in conflict. Similarly, Schedule 10 also gives similar provision of Bill 66 to override section 39 of The Clean Water Act. Both environmental protection acts are essentially gutted by Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
The Greenbelt Act prevents uncontrolled urban and suburban expansion from compromising food production and ecosystem services, both essential and recreational, close to the huge population of Ontario’s ‘Golden Horseshoe.’ This geographic area contains a significant proportion of Ontario’s best farmland and many landscapes of ecological, aesthetic and recreational significance. It must be protected if the quality of life for the residents of urban, suburban and rural inhabitants is to be maintained. Healthy food is essential and its production close to consumers is an increasingly important factor.
Similarly, The Clean Water Act protects the quality of water for all uses, domestic and industrial, for the highly concentrated population of southern Ontario as well as for other regions of Ontario. Healthy water is not an option, and the tragedy of Walkerton immediately comes to mind when protection of drinking water sources is compromised.
The goals of The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act may be largely desirable, but not at the expense of provincial treasures such as the Greenbelt’s protection of food production and close to home access to natural areas for residents of southern Ontario, and at the expense of jeopardizing the quality of drinking water supplies.
In conclusion, before it’s passage, The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act  must be amended to remove its ability to override section 7 of The Greenbelt Act and section 39 of The Clean Water Act.

It includes different kinds of animals and plants that can improve the atmospheric environment, effectively reduce urban traffic noise, provide habitat of a wild animal protection area, and increase bio-diversity. Greenbelt policy as an effective tool for promoting urban environmental sustainability, especially important when considering Ontario's Greenbelt area is more than protected countryside. Ontario's Greenbelt was created in 2005 to sustainably manage growing urban environments.
The Greenbelt includes the Niagara Escarpment, Oak Ridges Moraine, and agriculturally protected Holland Marsh. 800,000 acres of land are protected by the Niagara Escarpment Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan plus 1 million acres of land in the Protected Countryside overarching Greenbelt Plan. That total makes it one of the largest and most successful greenbelts in the world. Over $50 million of carrots, onions, and other popular vegetables are produced in very fertile soil in Holland Marsh. Oak Ridges Moraine covers 1,900 square kilometres between Caledon and Rice Lake, near Peterborough and is a hydrological system of streams, wetlands, kettle lakes and ponds, and their catchment areas, seepage areas, springs, and aquifers and other recharge areas. The Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve is a geological formation reaching 725 kilometres long and up to 500 metres tall that began as coastline of the Michigan Basin 450 million years ago. It is protected due to the many unique species and prime recreation grounds. It was designated as one of 15 UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves in Canada in 1990. Tourism associated with the escarpment contributes $100 million to local and regional economies.
Opening the Greenbelt to urban sprawl and companies/factories will loosen urban containment with detrimental effects to greenbelt recreation values, the environment, and orderly growth. Walkerton's contaminated water disaster in 2000 was a result of disorderly growth. It is irresponsible to allow the Ford Government's Bill 66 to deregulate Greenbelt policy and threaten its protections. Ontario's Greenbelt area should be enlarged as the population grows, not reduced. The protections in place now protect future generations. I am aligned with pressure to stop Bill 66, enlarge the greenbelt, and keep policies in place to control the effects of urban sprawl and urban development.

ACER firmly opposes the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 (ERO #013-4293).
Bill 66 makes Ontario’s Greenbelt, our clean drinking water, and farmland vulnerable to the whims of developers.
Ontario’s Greenbelt is a permanently protected area of forests, farmland, wetlands, and watersheds, established by the Government of Ontario in 2005. It is one of the largest greenbelts in the world at nearly two million acres. The Greenbelt provides us with clean water, fresh air, and local food, as well as recreation. It was created to protect agricultural land and prevent urban sprawl. It serves as a crucial part of our provincial economy and heritage.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 states that “Open for Business” by-laws do not have to comply with fundamental protections to environmental and human health, including:
·      Ontario Planning and Development Act, 1994
·      Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001
·      Greenbelt Act, 2005
·      Places to Grow Act, 2005
·      Metrolinx Act, 2006
·      Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008
·      Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015
In addition, the bill leaves ambiguous space for noncompliance by including language referring to any other “prescribed provisions” in provincial legislation.
“Open for Business” by-laws erode governmental transparency, as they may be passed without public notice, behind closed doors. If citizens take issue with them, they are left without recourse. Community members are not permitted to appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. An informed, educated citizenry is an invaluable strength for Ontario, and keeping legislative processes as accessible as possible is in all of our best interests.
It is more important than ever to look forward as informed citizens, to plan, and to educate those who will live the consequences. Bill 66 will undo decades of work in Ontario, pulling us backward into the dark.

The NEPDA has put unnecessary restrictions on businesses that fall within in its orbit.  For instance, wineries in the NEPDA are restricted from having ancillary services, like restaurants.  The Commissioners use the act to direct a winery owner who would like to add on premises food services, to how many seats they may have and what they may have on their menus.

It would do so in a fashion that undermines fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in  decision-making and sets the stage for costly property tax increases to subdize economically inefficient sprawl development.I  am concerned  for instance in particular about underground pipes leaking and causing toxic contamination to our ground water  and soil.  If Bill 66 is passed it will  put the  Oak Ridge's Moraine ground water  in Danger, this system of wetlands kettle lakes and ponds covers over 1900 square kilometers  the headwaters to more than 30 rivers.  Bill 66 puts our natural areas and water sources at risk. These and other outcomes of Bill 66 would run contrary to interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water. I am concerned if Bill 66 passes municipalities will face uncertain outcomes and unpredictable cost in relations to water clean -up, natural heritage, toxic  spills to agriculture lands, well water contamination   ( my mom is on well water in Newcastle ON).  I am concerned if bill 66 is passed, this will cause even more harm and destruction to our threatened species habitat. We have valued country side, the Greenbelt legislation protects areas like the Holland March which produces over $50 million popular vegetable in very fertile soil. Bill 66 would open up precious  farmland . I  would appreciate you advising on updates on this issue and also let me know any other interested parties who may be approaching you with their concerns. Thank you

19979,/comment/19979,"To whom it may concern.
I am deeply concerned by the many changes proposed by Bill 66. I will comment briefly on what most disturbs me, which is with regard to the changes brought forward in Schedule 10. I would also like to register my disagreement regarding the government's use of an omnibus bill in this regard, noting that such a tactic has traditionally been used more for legislative housekeeping, so to speak, than for substantive changes of the sort currently proposed.
I would first like to assert that the wealth of Ontario is directly related to the health and well-being of its residents. The numerous Acts that Schedule 10 provides a method of over-riding are core to ensuring this health and well-being. Accordingly, if Schedule 10 is meant to promote the health and well-being of Ontarians, the objective and the method for reading it are not in agreement.
Continuing on this theme of method not fitting with means, the stated intention of reducing legislation duplication isn't support by the fact of the Bill, specifically Schedule 10, and the numerous assertions by members of the government, such as MPP Doug Downey and MPP Sam Oosterhoff, that the Greenbelt will not be touched. Why include a provision if there is no intention of it being used? Wouldn't this be an example of exactly the type of needless regulation the government has stated its the intent of Bill 66 to reduce?
I should clarify that I don't believe the assertion that certain provisions in the Bill won't be used. One of the big problems with Bill 66 is it places power in the hands of politicians, rather than vesting them in regulations. I know this has been the case with Ministerial zoning orders and whatnot, but Bill 66 takes it much farther by devolving the request point to the municipalities, which focuses pressure to develop on bodies often desperate for the funding that development can bring ( desperate for funding often as a result of past poor planning decisions), and by making the process by which said requests and approvals are committed far more opaque. Under these conditions there is no telling what might happen, either at the Ministerial level or at the municipal level.
Finally, I will point to the lack of need for employment lands, particularly in Simcoe County, where I live. The County's own land budget shows a surplus of employment lands forecast through 2031. There simply is no need to risk the protections afforded Ontarians by the Acts included in Schedule 10 - the cost, or risk, of doing so is far outweighed by the benefit of certainty those Acts currently provide.
Respectfully, I ask that Schedule 10 be removed entirely from Bill 66, and that the government re-commit to prudent and careful planning, including protection of water, Lake Simcoe, and the Greenbelt, that is so clearly in the best interest of Ontarians.
For your information I have attached the land budgets for the municipalities of Simcoe County, which show the forecast needs are easily met without requirement for the provisions included in Schedule 10 of Bill 66.

19981,/comment/19981,"Re: Bill 66, the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018/ EBR Registry number 013-4293
I am opposed to the Ontario government weakening or removing environmental controls in the proposed legislation (Bill 66). Doing so not only threatens the health and well-being of our residents, but puts municipalities in a position of potential litigation over development. Existing controls in the Planning Act and other laws and policies should be strengthened, not weakened.
I would prefer to see the province continue to fully protect Natural Heritage Features and Areas, including the Greenbelt, to protect significant wetlands, significant coastal wetlands, fish habitat, significant woodlands significant valley lands, habitat of endangered and threatened species, significant wildlife habitat, and significant areas of natural and scientific interest. These are irreplaceable and a public trust. If you allow them to be destroyed or developed, if you allow our sensitive environmental areas to be compromised, we can never get them back.
I oppose allowing development on identified “hazard lands” as a matter of public health and safety.
The Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015 (especially Section 20) is necessary to the vitality and environmental quality of our largest source of fresh water. The existing Act should be retained and strengthened. I oppose doing anything to de-regulate, revoke, compromise, bypass or weaken that legislation.
Please retain and strengthen the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009. It should not be not de-regulated, revoked, compromised, bypassed or weakened because doing so will compromise public health and safety.
It is crucial that the province maintain Ontario’s existing drinking water standards to ensure the continued security and safety of our drinking water. The government should instead assure residents that those standards will be upheld in this and future legislation. We do not walk another Walkerton event here.
Please do nothing to weaken, compromise, revoke or bypass the Clean Water Act, 2006 (particularly Section 39) nor allow any drinking water source protection plan prepared under the Clean Water Act to be weakened or bypassed.

19983,/comment/19983,"This bill, if passed will result in the dismantlement of a finely tune system of community planning.
The passing of a Open for Business Zoning By-laws will have a dramatic impact on what Ontarions expected :  that the preservation of farmland, and necessary protections for groundwater to guarantee the health of people in Ontario would be maintained.  That is what Mr. Ford campaigned on.
It will impact the already shrinking supply of farmland as well as it will encourage urban sprawl.  (From a planning perspective we know that this approach cost a municipality more than it gains in taxes.) Further it will impact on ground / drinking water as water aquifers do not respect municipal boundaries but rather geographic boundaries.  A decision by one municipality can impact downstream municipalities. This would be without any consultation and the downstream (or down aquifer) municipalities or even citizens within the enacting municipality would have no notice until the ground water was contaminated.
Further the clean Water act was enacted to prevent the deaths that occurred in Walkerton. Does the threshold of 50 or 100 jobs as spelled out in the bill justify the risks and damage to decades worth of protection on areas and systems that were designated after scientific study.
Bill 66 has no basis in science and instead relies on the hope the proposed bylaws will not impact precious and irreplaceable resources that our communities rely on.
Farmland constitutes about half the land area of the Greater Golden Horseshoe and represents one of the most important economic sectors of the region. In 2011 alone, agricultural production in the GGH brought $6.3 billion into the economy. It is also a significant employer, with 35,000 employees in 2011, representing 39 per cent of Ontario’s employment in this sector. The Greenbelt farms are particularly productive, for a variety of reasons, and produce an average of 55 per cent of Ontario’s fruit and 13 per cent of its vegetables.  How is this not significant to the future of our communities and the employment base.
The more farmland lost to speculation and developers the less is available to existing and potentially new farmers. One of the major impediments to new farmers wanting to enter the business is the cost of land.  Is Mr. Ford's government not concerned that if our food producing lands continue to be paved over we will reduce our agri business and reduce our ability to feed ourselves.
By allowing municipalities to pass bylaws that would exempt developers from compliance with higher order planning documents and legislation, Bill 66 would reduce farmers’ access to an already limited resource and, at worst, displace farm businesses and limit the possibility of economic growth, not only of the agriculture sector, but of the province as a whole. Prime farmland is not a renewable resource.

19985,/comment/19985,"I am opposed to Bill 66. The Ontario Government claims it will just eliminate red tape but it will pose significant risks for the health and well-being of Ontarians by allowing large corporate interests to ignore important regulations in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act, as well as open up the Greenbelt for development. These are regulations that are meant to protect us and our environment, and in some cases to save lives.
Here are just a few things at risk:
- Clean drinking water. Bill 66 would let corporations ignore protections like the Clean Water Act -- which was put in place after the tragedy in Walkerton where seven people died and thousands made sick from E. coli poisoning. The bill puts real lives in danger with the threat of drinking water contamination.
- Ontario’s Greenbelt. Those 2 million acres of tranquil, protected nature — that grow our food, provide habitat for endangered species, and hiking trails for nature walks — would be opened up for major industrial development and urban sprawl. This will endanger the water supply of many large municipalities such as Toronto. Sprawl will encourage more cars on the road, more gridlock and more pollution.
- The Great Lakes — which house one fifth of the world’s freshwater and supply Ontarians with 80% of our drinking water, would be threatened with harmful pollutants, toxic chemicals, and greater wetlands loss, making them less swimmable, drinkable, and fishable.
- Child-care protections: Bill 66 changes the number of babies — children under the age of 2 — that can be cared for by a single adult in an unlicensed home-based daycare from two to three. The existing regulation came into effect in 2015, after children died in unlicensed daycares. Removing barriers to more daycare spots is a worthy goal, but not if it sacrifices the safety of small children.
Contrary to its claims, Bill 66 is not about just addressing administrative excess or paperwork. It is eliminating or exempting companies from rules that were put in place to save lives — rules about about labour regulation, child protection, clean water safeguards, even the greenbelt legislation the provincial Progressive Conservatives promised on the campaign trail they would protect “in its entirety.”
Bill 66 should be scrapped, and the government should hold an open discussion in the Ontario Legislature, with non-profit and advocacy groups working for better health and social conditions in the province, and with the people on Ontario on how to achieve its aims for a better life for all residents of Ontario.

I am also adamant that the Great Lakes Protection Act should be respected. However, since there is some indication that the Toxics Reductions Act stopped working in recent years, I am not that concerned about it. I would ask that whatever is decided in terms of environmental protection, ambitious or less robust than many (including me) would desire that at least there is long-term and meaningful monitoring and oversight. I would also encourage Minister Rod Phillips to continue his good work in building trust between the development and environmental sectors. In the end, I would rather face the challenge of building homes on Greenbelt lands sustainably as a result of Bill 66 than witness the quiet approval of the dumping of toxic dirt in them or the building of highways that mar my nature walks but that I can't even afford to use.

I do not support Schedule 10, which will allow municipalities to ignore provincial policies and provincial plans when approving new developments.

It is similar to the widening of roads to alleviate traffic congestion-- ask any economist and he/she will tell you that widening roads is only a short term fix, and will only encourage more driving to the point where the roads are congested once again. How far will we go? Until we have developed every inch of space?
Opening up the Greenbelt to release the pressure on property prices so that we can continue business as usual (i.e. urban sprawl) is not a forward-thinking strategy. The Greenbelt was put in place because we recognized the negative impacts of our sprawl development and realized we shouldn't continue this way.
As with most environmental issues today, it should be universally accepted that we cannot continue down the same road, and certain sacrifices must be made if we want a liveable future.
For years we have had it easy, but we are also living with the consequences.

These must be protected for wildlife diversity, health of all citizens, clean water and resources for self sufficiency as Ontarians. These are group resources and they should not be open for sale to the highest bidder.  Existing urban areas should increase in density and there should never be an encroachment into greenbelts.  Only an upper tier of government can create these regulations.  It should NOT be delegated or left to municipalities.  This IS competitive creating living spaces in our province that makes it desireable to all.  There is a clear role for Provincial government NOT to delegate this level of decision making not to mention the cost to municipalities.    I am entirely against this.
We even need more regulations. look at areas of farmland along the shoes of Lake Huron for Example - all of the farmers send their animal waste into the great Lakes.  Why is this permitted. Bill 66 will only lead to it being worse.
I am entirely against the open for business laws that are proposed in this bill.  It has nothing to do with being open for business.  We can have and should have provincial regulations of green spaces and existing regional decisions should not be given to local municiaplities - a recipe for disaster as one municipality can then harm the drinking water of a nearby municipality.  There is no decision maker.  It will lead to all kinds of litigation.  Why? I don't see the purpose.  I do see lots of opportunities for growth  without this Bill.   Ontario can be competitive and this is not needed to achieve that in fact maintaining the current system would make everything better for all Ontarians regardless of where they live.  Laws should apply equally.   This would not be the case if municipalities had the final say.   Just look at the town of Dashwood - it's in TWO municipalities.
Will half the town be one way and the other half different on important issues like waste management and protection of the environment?   Every single one of us will be exposed to increased levels of harmful substances.  Our children, our next generation.  This plan leads to that without question.  Once you lose those areas there will be nothing left.  I want something left. I am a voting taxpayer and I don't want unlimited sprawl or municipalities with local decision makers who often have a vested interest in the outcome - making such key decisions.  I am against Bill 66 as it is currently drafted and would be very upset if it was implemented without taking these signficant concerns into consideration.  This is a recipe for more lawyers getting rich and for the citizens, the ""people"" who you represent having less.  I understand that If passed, the province, developers and municipalities could, in theory, bypass some regulations, provided a development could prove it would create jobs and generate an economic benefit.  This is far too high a price to pay for more jobs that can be created in much better ways for all of us.    These are my own views after personally thinking about this matter.  You don't have to see what websites I went to or my comments on them.  I have read the views of those in government currently in Ontario who are Conservatives.

20048,/comment/20048,"On behalf of the Ontario Association of Professional Archaeologists (APA) we wish to express our deep concerns regarding Bill 66 and in particular the open-for-business by-law contained within the bill which would allow municipalities to opt-out of a range of provisions included in the planning act including sections requiring archaeological assessment as a component of the development process. These include subsection 3(5) and section 24 which trigger requirements for archaeological assessment as part of the development process.  Stripping these requirements allows municipalities to ignore both provincial policy statements and Municipal official plans regarding archaeology and heritage.  While this may seem on the surface to be some form of streamlining for development projects, this deregulation will have severe implications both in terms of provincial/Indigenous relations and the livelihood of thousands of workers and dozens of small businesses across the province.
Key components of Municipal Official Plans are Archaeological Management Master Plans which have been adopted by many municipalities throughout Ontario.  Provincial support for the development of such plans was a policy recommendation (Recommendations: Volume 2, recommendation 26) which came out of Commissioner Linden’s 2007 inquest into the shooting of Dudley George at Ipperwash in 1995.  One of the key catalysts of the occupation of Ipperwash Provincial Park was the refusal to acknowledge and ensure proper protection for Indigenous cultural patrimony, which included in that case an unmarked ancestral burial ground. Similarly, the Indigenous occupation of a housing development in Caledonia from 2006 to 2014, resulted from the failure to recognize the history of Indigenous settlement and a lack of proper consultation. Archaeological Master Plans aren’t designed to hinder development or public works, but rather to ensure that areas with high potential to contain significant archaeological sites or burial grounds are properly assessed and cleared so that incidents like what happened at Ipperwash and Caledonia do not occur. As part of the reconciliation process governments, businesses and individuals all have a duty to ensure that the rights of Indigenous groups are protected and this includes the right to determine how Indigenous cultural patrimony is protected.
Beyond the cultural and historical value that is generated through the archaeological assessment process, the privately operated firms that carry out such assessments also represent a significant industry in Ontario employing thousands of people annually.  Most of our members are owners, managers or employees of archaeological firms which carry out the archaeological assessments under licenses issued by the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport.  Most firms are small businesses which would be vulnerable to the loss of revenue which would occur if even a handful of municipalities adopt the open-for-business bylaw. The impact of this would be cuts to staff of between 50-70% annually according to some of our members, while others say they would likely have to shut down their businesses.  This could in turn delay development in other municipalities due to shortages of available firms to carry out assessments in a timely manner.  It will also likely result in hundreds of Ontarians losing their jobs and livelihoods.
The Open-for-business by-law does not only put at great risk the cultural heritage of both Indigenous peoples and Euro-Canadians, it will lead to job losses particularly for small businesses and could precipitate events as we have witnessed in the past at Ipperwash.  None of these outcomes benefits development in the province.  We implore the government to reconsider the full economic and cultural impact of the bill, and remove the Open-for business by-law.

The Greenbelt is also economically viable to the region. Services like recreational activities, flood protection as well as groundwater recharge for drinking water.  We are now plunging head first into the inevitability of climate change, and without the Greenbelt we would lose the capacity to store as much carbon dioxide as would be emitted by 33 million cars a year! Interference in this process annihilates our chance to reduce our emissions and meet climate targets. Bill 66 would let corporations ignore protections like the Clean Water Act, which was put in place after the tragedy in Walkerton. The land that we grow our food on, and provide habitat for endangered species, would be opened up for major industrial development and urban sprawl. Already an eye sore in other areas of Ontario. As an outdoor educator, we are trying to reintroduce children, of this technological age, to nature and the outdoors in order to help reduce the obesity rates and the myriad of problems that are the result of not being exposed to fresh air, limited physical education in schools and greenspaces. Please stop Bill 66. It is an outrage, and would leave an undeniable blight on our beautiful land in Ontario.

20054,/comment/20054,"There is widespread opposition to Bill 66 (Schedule 10) by the very community councils one might think would be benefitting from it. In our area, the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, and Guelph, the townships and the Regional government are all opposing Schedule 10 and sending in notice of their opposition. It behooves our representatives and the government to ask why that is. I would hope that even a majority government would take a sober second look and respond to deep concerns about what they are proposing. The legislation needs to be either stopped or rewritten before being passed.
Here’s part of why I’m worried about it: Schedule 10 gives municipal governments the option to create “open for business” bylaws which will allow development to bypass provincial laws that protect water, agriculture, sensitive lands, and community development plans. This will also remove the public consultation process so that people will not have the option to comment on development. Once the bylaws are passed, there is no right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. In addition,  municipalities don’t need to give advance public notice that they are planning to pass these bylaws. This has the potential to:
·         Subvert local planning strategies and land use organization and create haphazard development.
·         Remove our chance and choice as local citizens to have a say about what happens in our backyards.
·         Remove the opportunities of local governments to have input into what might affect them from neighbouring areas (e.g., upstream polluters).
·         Negatively impact water, air and sensitive or high priority land, that has been designated for protection or special use (e.g. growing food, protecting groundwater for drinking).
·         Put (sometimes vulnerable) local governments even more at risk of being influenced by powerful industry.
·        Have lasting negative impacts on the environment that we leave for our children.
I have heard it argued that local governments are not obliged to create an ""open for business"" bylaw.  That's true, but the creation of the option opens up a vulnerable local government to temptation from powerful and perhaps financially attractive businesses that may not be in the best interests of the people or the long term quality of the environment. We would hope the local councils would act in those best interests, but that's not always the case. That's why we have laws in place, the very legislation that these new bylaws would circumvent.
Thank you for the work you do on our behalf.

20056,/comment/20056,"10 Reasons to reconsider Bill 66
1) This proposed Bill 66, appears to be in conflict with provincially required and approved municipal official plans and zoning bylaws that would be subject to change, by creating jobs on lands potentially inappropriate for the land use and/or the community.
2) There is no required municipal advance notice for public input on a job creating Planning Act application. Therefore, potentially it is left to municipal/developer back room deals, as there is no requirement for transparency or municipal accountability.
3) The municipal politician is required to advocate for the local residents and will not be able to fulfill this provincially legislated duty, as they will not be able to say no, to an application under the context of creating jobs, despite constituents not having a voice through their locally elected councillor on the Planning Act proposal.
4) Further municipal politicians are the most accessible to influencers and large land owners in a municipality. This Bill if passed, will lead to a perceived conflict of interest and potential distrust of local politicians  by hiding development applications negotiations from the public.
5) Municipal Councils will be able to invoke 'in camera', sessions using the Planning Act based on this proposed Bill, to keep secret developer driven applications/negotiations from the tax paying public.
6) If a development that creates jobs is proposed under the changes proposed from this Bill,  the municipality does not have an appeal process for a flawed/inappropriate development application or non-conforming land use.
7) The Provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing appears to take no responsibility or provide any transparency  for applications that are driven by developers, not in compliance with Official plans and Secondary plans.   Therefore the provincial recognition of Official plans appears to place the minister in conflict, by having municipalities not follow their approved official plans without any consequence to both the province and municipalities, due to this provincially driven action.
8) This Bill under the Planning Act usurps the integrity of the Province of Ontario recognized professional planners and their requirement to uphold the Planning Act, oversee  implementation of Official Plans/Secondary Plans/zoning bylaws, other acts affecting development applications as well as the concept of ""good planning principles"".  As the planning tools currently used do not all apply, potentially leading to undermining of planning principals without any responsibility or discipline from any governing body.
9) If a development application under the guise of creating jobs, under the Planning Act based on this Bill 66 proposal, undermines the function of planning departments by preventing stakeholder/public participation, leading to lack of transparency or accountability of municipal staff, leading to distrust of municipal  planning staff due to the provincially proposed changes.
10) It appears matters of long term environmental and public health are being set aside for short small term job gains, by not requiring the use of noted Provincial Acts  or sections of Acts as noted in (6) 1. - 14.  The proposed provincial changes will drive secretive municipal activities undermining community values and needs, reflecting on the Provinces lack of respect of local government and local planning matters.

To determine piecemeal or partial exemptions based on commercial criteria is NOT acceptable.  This government was not elected to override Ontario's laws protecting the environment, our water security and supply, our labour laws, or our childcare laws.
In addition, this proposed legislation has emerged with unseemly haste and completely without the far-reaching public AND EXPERT CONSULTATION that it absolutely requires.
The OFB by-law proposal should be withdrawn.  Under no circumstances should this ad hoc accumulation of corporate permissions be allowed to override:
*     The Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Green Belt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Metrolinx Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Ontario Planning and Development Act and the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act.
•	Approval to work in excess of the maximum weekly hours of work without approval of the Director of Employment
•	Approval to average hours of work to determine overtime pay without the approval of the Director of Employment
Bill 66 should NOT alter current labour designations for employees of local boards, school boards, hospitals, colleges, universities and public bodies
•	All current bargaining rights and all applicable collective agreements for municipalities and certain local boards, school boards, hospitals, colleges, universities and public bodies would cease to apply. Employees and their unions would no longer have their current designations as part of the construction industry, and all collective bargaining agreements would cease to apply.
In addition, Bill 66 (an omnibus bill) contains changes to the Child Care Modernization Act, 2014 that leave children seriously at risk, according to childcare experts.
The proposed legislative change would apply to both the licensed and unlicensed settings. (Licensed home child care is heavily regulated but licensed agencies run only a small proportion of total home child care. ) The following are COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.
•	Care providers would be allowed to care for three children instead of two children under age two, and up to six children under the age of 13 (or up to five children in the case of unlicensed providers).
•	Rules around the age of a care provider’s own children would also change: right now, the provider’s children are not counted towards the maximum number of children allowed in the home if they are aged six or older.
•	Any children of providers aged four and older would not be included in the count of total children in care. The new legislation also allows two caregivers to work together to care for double the number of children.

20064,/comment/20064,"Whether ""you believe"" the government's intention may is ""to make it easier for businesses to navigate the complex  system of development approvals""  helping businesses looking for sites, and meeting certain prescribed provincial criteria to qualify for streamline approvals is exactly what WE DO NOT NEED!!  Businesses already have far too much leeway and too many loopholes to circumvent legislation that was designed to protect our environment.  Removing that ""red tape"" is exactly what businesses and developers want to help them circumnavigate legislation that protects our environment from being poisoned by them.
The problem with the ""mantra"" of ""cutting red tape"" means that safety precautions we have fought long and hard to institute are subsequently removed.  What is actually being cut are labour regulation, child protection, clean water safeguards, even the greenbelt legislation that you, the provincial Progressive Conservatives, promised on the campaign trail you would PROTECT ”IN IT'S ENTIRETY"".    How can you honour that promise when Premier Doug Ford was caught on tape discussing the exact opposite in a ""back room"" meeting with his developer friends.
Bill 66 also changes our independent Commissioner of the Environment so we will no longer have a yearly independent report on the government's handling of the environment portfolio.  This in no way inspires any confidence in the citizens of Ontario that the Progressive Conservatives have any true desire to protect our environment against the greed of developers who only want to line their own pockets and have no vision for the future well-being of the people who live here.
Letting developers and corporations have a streamlined process to ram through their operations is hardly the way to protect our environment.  We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the consequences of continually raping our natural heritage.  Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.   We must be vigilant and protect our water and green spaces from further contamination.

20068,/comment/20068,"The Ford Administration brands themself as the government of the people. Bill 66 allows for a number of provisions that will seriously undermine the physical and mental health and wellbeing of Ontarions. This is incredibly concerning given the efforts made to improve source water protection in light of the Walkerton incident in which several deaths and over two thousand people being ill. In the United States, reversals to environmental protections comes  at a time where several e coli outbreaks have occurred and recalls have been done on Romaine lettuce, broccoli and other vegetables.
Furthermore, public consultation is essential for a proper functioning democracy and governing for the people. People deserve to have input over what is occurring in their communities. Locals contain knowledge due to their lived experiences and provide very valuable information for experts.  This is critical for functioning plans as well as properly consulting people.
Furthermore, Bill 66 is problematic for the following reasons:
1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations. https://ontarionature.org/bill-66-facts/

The Clean Water Act was introduced in 2006 as a response to the Walkerton Tragedy, when contamination of a drinking water source by E.coli resulted in 7 deaths and thousands falling ill in Walkerton, Ontario. After Walkerton, the province acted to protect drinking water with a multi-barrier approach. Source protection plans now cover 97% of our drinking water in Ontario, and there are 38 local committees who have created plans to protect local drinking water. We now have some of the strongest protections for drinking water in the world.
Bill 66 allows previously unthinkable exemptions to these source protection plans. Ignoring the locally developed protection plans could open the door to another Walkerton tragedy.

20084,/comment/20084,"Comments on Schedule 10, Bill 66
Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, was introduced by the Government of Ontario on December 6, 2018 with a deadline for submission of comments of January 20 2019.  Our comments are directed only at Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation.
Schedule 10 would firstly create a new economic development tool, the open-for –business planning by-law (OFBPBL), which would be available to all local municipalities to ensure they can act quickly to attract businesses seeking development sites.  A second change would create a new regulation under the Planning Act which would specify the criteria the Province would require the Municipality to conform with before it approved the OFBPBL. The Province has yet to outline these criteria.
If an OFBPBL request was made by the municipality and endorsed by the Province, the municipality could then bypass a very broad range of existing laws and regulations including provincial laws, and official plans and zoning requirements, avoid public notice requirements and local planning Appeal Tribunal appeals. Green Durham Association comments are as follows:
1 We oppose Schedule 10 of Bill 66, as it is currently presented, for the following reasons:
a) The proposal would allow an OSBPBL to be passed without public notice or meetings or right of appeal. We see absolutely no justification for such an approach.
b) The extremely short timeline allowed for comment over the holiday period allows no time for developing better understanding, for interaction with local government, or for careful reflection on the implications of this sweeping proposed legislation.
                                                                                                                                           c) The proposed legislation provides no background information or rationale for the problems this Bill has been designed to address; and why such problems cannot be addressed either within the current planning framework, or through a much less intrusive approach.
d) The proposed legislation does not include any of the criteria which the Province would apply when approving a municipal OFBPBL request, thereby making it virtually impossible to evaluate the proposal, since without the criteria, the proposed change has no real substance.
e) Some municipalities may decide they can use the OFBPBL, while also assuring consistency with certain elements of the existing planning framework, (including Source Water Protection Plans, the Oak Ridges Moraine Plan, The Regional Official Plan etc)  However legal experts at CELA (Canadian Environmental Law Association), have pointed out that once the OSBPL is approved, such assurances could put municipalities in an unlawful situation, since they have no legal basis for providing such assurances.
CELA also point out, that while developing legislation follows a formal, transparent process with opportunity for comment throughout development of the legislation, replacing some of the legislation governing the existing planning framework with regulation, which Bill 66 effectively does, makes the overall planning framework less transparent, and less open to public scrutiny when regulations as opposed to legislation are changed.  If the Province were now to impose regulations, that to name just a few of the regulations that we feel would be necessary, required the draft Bill  to require municipalities to maintain conformity/ consistency with the PPS, and the Moraine, Greenbelt, and Growth plans, and the Regional Official Plan, we understand these criteria could be far more easily modified by the Province in future than the current legislative framework that Bill 66 would partially replace.
2 We believe in most cases it makes sense to only consider making significant planning and policy changes at specific points when reviews of Official Plans or of Provincial Policy are scheduled.  If major changes can be made quickly with less oversight and broad consideration outside such cycles, then we are concerned it will create a tendency where advocates for major changes promoting employment opportunities, will realize it is in their best interests not to raise such change when overall plans are being set and there will be far more scrutiny, but under “open for business” legislation.
3 We have been strongly supportive of most of the Provincial level planning changes that have been made over the past few decades beginning with the introduction of the Moraine Plan by the Provincial Conservatives some 18 years ago.  We believe that by clarifying the nature and location of what development would and would not be allowed, a lot of red tape was removed and long fights between development advocates and opponents that ended up in costly OMB hearings were greatly reduced after such legislation was implemented, at least in the area of West Durham where our efforts have been largely focused.
However we have also seen over the past few decades a significant increase in the red tape and expense that one has to go through for even modest changes in land use and related matters.  So we too have real concerns with overregulation and are very open to thoughtfully examining the removal of red tape, however no such examination has taken place here. Furthermore the red tape that sometimes frustrates us, has nothing to do with obstacles to creating employment, which is the only area the Province is concerned about with this legislation.
We believe that a more meaningful discussion around removing such obstacles could be had, if before adopting a solution like Bill 66, there was more focus on the problems municipalities and others are having in moving forward, overall and not only with respect to the important issue your government has raised - attracting new business and employment. If for example Uxbridge has had a need it can justify to expand employment lands, why have they been unable to accomplish this in the past, and is Bill 66, or another approach, the best way to improve the process?
Studies we have read suggest there are sufficient employment lands set aside in the GTA to accommodate employment needs, and the most likely pressures that would create a shortfall, seems to stem from the fact that there has been pressure to use employment lands for residential growth.
The provincial initiative identifies that the “primary use” of the by-law must be for jobs and employment use. However residential, commercial, and retail, can be a secondary use, and we believe a considerable amount of support for this by-law is from interests who see this as a way of pursuing future residential growth.   A delay in moving forward would enable fruitful discussion to take place in each municipality around what changes stakeholders might recommend the Province take to address specific concerns, while at the same time protecting and balancing other environmental and community interests.
4 Green Durham Association has been particularly focused on matters pertaining to the urban fringe. All municipalities want to attract more employment. Uxbridge, and Durham Region, haven’t wanted to attract too much residential growth in Uxbridge for two reasons: because that would support urban sprawl since most residents work in urban areas mainly to the south and west, and also because sewage treatment facilities in the Town are limited.
Aggregate pits occupy a few thousand acres of land in Uxbridge Township. Most have been operating for 35 years or more and are an interim use, so what happens on these lands in future is critical to us.  While many future uses can be beneficial, we have recent experience with the nearby Greenbank Airport in Scugog where airport proponents made a case for an airport and associated employment. In reality there was no serious airport proposal; it was a commercial fill operation where contaminated fill was being imported under the guise of a worthy project.  So when residents hear of a way to bypass ‘red tape’ to stimulate employment opportunities, particularly on land not designated for such purposes, we have some cynicism!
5 When considering North Pickering and Uxbridge, apart from ensuring that sufficient employment land is available for suitable development, one of the most likely ways of increasing employment is to increase tourism particularly agri–tourism. This is particularly true given the following: 1) our area’s proximity and public land connection to major urban centers, 2) the recent addition to the Rouge Park of 5200 acres in Durham (some 1200 acres in Uxbridge, the remainder in Pickering), 3) the attractive and extensive trails and conservation lands in the entire area, and 4) the fact that in North Pickering, a great amount of the high quality agricultural lands is publicly or developer owned and being cash cropped on short term leases, rather than being invested in – investments which could create  more agricultural jobs and revenue..
GDA’s position is that while a major airport has not currently been justified on the Federal lands, we recognize that any Federal Government will want to ensure that if/when the need arises, a portion of these lands will remain available for that purpose in future, We feel however there is a way of leaving that possible future possibility open, while also promoting far better employment generating use of these prime agricultural lands.  The Food and Farming sector in Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe is one of the largest in North America and far more could be done in this area to further encourage its growth
In conclusion, we urge the Province to:
a) Drop any consideration of approving development proposals without any public meetings, notice or review.
b) Significantly extend the comment period, and set a comment deadline well after releasing a draft of the criteria and regulations the Province plans to impose in approving any municipal open-for-business by-law.
c) Include criteria which ensure that the OFBPBLW will not subvert the extensive planning framework and processes the Province has currently created
d) Use the extended comment period to more substantively explain, and encourage discussion about the problems the OFBPBL is intended to address, and seriously consider alternatives for dealing with it in less intrusive ways than the open- for –business approach.
We further urge the Town of Uxbridge and other Municipalities to:
Oppose the Provincial initiative and agree to never use the by-law if implemented, unless the Province addresses at least a), b) c) and d) above.
Addendum
Our comments above on Bill 66, Schedule 10 were completed before we became aware of the Province’s January 2019 announcement that it was also amending the Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan, and providing another very short public comment deadline of Feb 28, 2019 (http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page20926.aspx)
Communities on the urban fringe are very affected by the Growth Plan. Any reductions in urban area density targets, amendments to which the Province has announced and appears to be considering, will almost inevitably lead to more sprawl and residential expansion of the urban area, onto prime agricultural and/or Moraine land on the urban fringe to the north.
Because of this interconnection, the Province’s previous review of the Growth Plan was completed together with a review of the Provincial Moraine, Greenbelt and Escarpment Plans, and considerable time was set aside for public comment that we participated in, before the final changes to these plans were announced in 2017.
This provides yet another reason to increase the period for comment for Bill 66, Schedule 10, as well as for the proposed changes to the Growth Plan.  A longer comment period would enable the public and Government to review any such interconnected changes, and others the Province may be considering which affect the overall Provincial Planning framework together, rather than making piecemeal final decisions. This interconnection may not be an issue in some parts of Ontario but it certainly is in the Greater Golden Horseshoe.

20088,/comment/20088,"We are writing you as long-time residents of the Provincial riding of York-Simcoe. We are very concerned about Bill 66 proposed by your Government that would give municipalities the power to override important natural heritage, environmental and health and safety existing legislation that your government wrongly sees as impeding economic development, in support of jobs through a purported  “open for business planning bylaw”.
From our review most of the legislation you are proposing to roll back, such as the Clean Water Act (adopted after the Walkerton tragedy), The Greenbelt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Act, Places to Grow Act (Growth Plan), etc. is ill-conceived. The wide-ranging Omnibus nature of this legislation is truly concerning and obviously lacks balance and a full understanding of real planning implications. This proposed Bill would allow municipalities to pass a by-law to place employment uses and secondary uses such as residential and commercial anywhere in Ontario without conforming to these important Acts, and indeed contravene their recent existing Official Plans and Secondary Plans arrived at through extensive local community consultation and good planning process. We strongly disagree with this. As small business people in the arts and community organizations, and active in social, cultural and natural heritage organizations in our municipality we urge you to immediately abandon this legislation. We will actively be working with our neighbours and family to advise local municipalities not to use Bill 66, should it be passed.
With this Bill 66 employment uses could be built anywhere in the province without following a public planning process. This is poor planning. Our research, and our own knowledge of our local area and municipality confirm that there is an excess of economic development land here, and in cities across the Greater Golden Horseshoe.

20089,/comment/20089,"I am writing to you to ask that you protect the Greenbelt and stop Bill 66 which attacks our Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important protected farm and natural areas to development.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.

20091,/comment/20091,"I am writing to express my dismay about the recklessness of Bill 66. The regulations that it is proposing to repeal are essential to protecting the health and well being of the citizens of Ontario. Reliable access to clean drinking water, protection against the damaging effects of toxic chemicals and agricultural run-off, and the maintenance of greenspaces for both conservation purposes but also as buffers against catastrophic flooding re fundamental to all our lives and livelihoods in this province. Other measures in Bill 66 including the removal of restrictions on home-based daycare will put vulnerable populations at risk. I urge the reconsideration of this legislation so that evidence-based studies can inform more sound and ethical decision making.
The responsibility of a government is to care for the people, the land, and the future of this province.

20093,/comment/20093,"Bill 66, Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act, 2018 is aimed at increasing employment by cutting red tape - eliminating redundant regulations. This bill contains two Schedules, 5 and 10, that will needlessly bypass or eliminate critical regulations and put public health and safety at risk. Schedule 10 will result in expensive sprawl, harm to wildlife and sensitive ecosystems and the reduction of public participation in the planning process.
Regulations that protect public health and safety and our natural environment are not red tape.
For nearly two years, Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) represented the Concerned Walkerton Citizens at the Public Inquiry investigating that Ontario community's tainted water tragedy. It has definitely caused me to be very concerned about Bill 66 for the reason that CELA has expressed very strong opposition to Bill 66 Schedules 5 and 10.
With regards to Bill 66 Schedule 5, CELA states it does not agree “that the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 (“TRA”) is duplicative of requirements under federal law on control of toxic substances and, therefore, does not find persuasive the [Minister’s] argument that repealing the TRA will reduce a burden on industry from having to comply with duplicative programs. Ontario has also previously identified many toxic substances in Ontario not covered by federal requirements that if they are still present in the province could benefit from application of the TRA.”
Regarding Bill 66 Schedule 10, the long list of laws, plans and policies that the Open For Business Zoning By Law created by Bill 66 are exempt from includes: the Ontario Planning and Development Act, Places to Grow Act, Greenbelt Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Provincial Policy Statement, Great Lakes Protection Act, and the most concerning the Clean Water Act (CWA).  CELA concluded  “there is no legal justification or compelling public policy rationale for allowing open-for-business planning by-laws to bypass key Planning Act provisions, and to circumvent or override the provincial laws, policies and plans listed in Schedule 10 of Bill 66. CELA maintains that Schedule 10 is a regressive, unwarranted and potentially risky proposal that is inconsistent with the public interest, and that does not adequately safeguard the health and safety of Ontarians. In particular, CELA objects to Schedule 10’s ill-conceived rollback of current legal requirements that were specifically enacted under the CWA to prevent a recurrence of the Walkerton Tragedy. Accordingly, CELA strongly recommends that Schedule 10 be immediately abandoned or withdrawn by the Ontario government.”
It is my opinion that CELA's warnings and recommendations should be taken very seriously. None of us want to see another tragedy like the Walkerton water crisis  or the Lac Megantic train disaster happen in Ontario. We count on the Provincial Government to protect our public health and safety.
With a thriving local food movement, prime farmland needs protection, but Schedule 10 would do the very opposite. Agriculture is a major driver of the Ontario economy, particularly in Brant County where I live. It does not make sense to undermine this important sector of the economy by allowing development that bypasses acts, policies, plans and regulations that have been put in place to protect existing agricultural land within Brant County and in other areas such as the Greenbelt.  Implementing Section 10 will only promote sprawl. Sprawl will use up agricultural land and it will be expensive. Sprawl results in higher taxes to pay for the additional infrastructure and public transit.
Brant County relies heavily upon ground water from the Grand River watershed, and every municipality in Ontario relies on having a source of clean high quality drinking water. Wetlands and other areas such as moraines are critical to maintaining water quality in lakes, rivers, streams and aquifers. We need the Province to protect watersheds such as the Grand River watershed. Moraines and wetlands also require protection because they play a critical role in maintaining water quality within the watersheds. The Paris-Galt Moraine, the Oak Ridges Moraine, the Greenbelt along with drinking water sources such as Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes must remain protected. Sprawl puts extreme pressure on existing aquifers, and can result in contamination of water sources. It is critical that development plans  comply with the Clean Water Act and other planning policies and regulations that protect water sources.
I would like to state that I have deep concerns regarding the the right to appeal and the requirement for public notice and consultation that could all be bypassed with Schedule 10. Public notice and consultation is critical to ensure that the we have the ability to present perspectives and information that will balance those of the developer. Public participant requirements are also not red tape, they are essential to good land use planning.
In conclusion I would like to respectfully request that both Schedule 5 and Schedule 10 be withdrawn from Bill 66.

Dear Sir:
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125, Proposed open-for-business planning tool; and 013-4239, New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
McIlwraith Field Naturalists of London, Ontario Inc., operating under the public name Nature London, strongly opposes aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018, especially in Schedule 10.  Nature London, with origins dating back to 1864, has for many years advocated for the protection and enhancement of the natural environment and natural heritage of the London municipality and surrounding areas, and has provided input into the planning process for new development as it relates to potential impacts on the natural heritage.  The proposals listed in Schedule 10, if passed into law, would override very important environmental protections under existing Acts for land, water, and wildlife. Nature London objects to the Government of Ontario’s contention that Bill 66 cuts “unnecessary” and “out of date” regulations (as per ERO posting 013-4293).   Nature London requests that the comments below be considered with respect to all the ERO postings relevant to Bill 66 (i.e. 013-4239, 013-4125, and 013-4293).
Nature London strongly opposes any proposed open-for-business by-law that would trump or circumvent existing requirements set out in current legislation, especially the Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act; Clean Water Act, 2006; Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015; and municipal Official Plans, all of which are relevant to London and vicinity.  Nature London also opposes the following;
1.	The proposal to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009;
2.	The proposal to allow an “open-for-business planning by-law” to be passed without public notice and consultation; and
3.	The proposal that citizens would not be able to appeal such a by-law to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).  Public notices and consultation, and the right to appeal to the LPAT, help to ensure that a planned development is being assessed carefully for potential impacts on surrounding areas, including the natural environment, and may provide valuable additional information to municipal planners.  Citizens, especially those paying provincial and municipal taxes, should not be deprived of this right to provide input.
A healthy natural environment is absolutely essential for a healthy human population and for beneficial flora and fauna.  Facilitation of development under an “open-for-business planning by-law” that ignores sound and well thought-out existing environmental protection policies, which are based on transparent and fair public consultation, should never be allowed (a possible exception being in the case of extremely dire circumstances).  Schedule 10’s short-sighted policies for short-term economic gain could potentially result in harmful long-term environmental damage.
The economic and health benefits provided by wetlands, forests, grasslands, farmlands, and other natural areas have been estimated to be about $85 billion/year for southern and eastern Ontario, and this should be carefully taken into consideration before any environmental protections under existing legislation are overridden in the name of expedited large-scale economic development under an ill-conceived “open-for-business by-law.”  These natural areas contribute to fresh water, water filtration, wildlife habitat, flood control, pollination, soil formation, erosion control and climate regulation.  Sprawling and unchecked development facilitated by “open-for-business by-laws” could threaten the long-term health and resilience of communities and natural areas, and have disastrous results.  Environmental deregulation was partly responsible for the Walkerton tragedy.
Nature London urges the Provincial Government to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.
Thank you for providing the opportunity to comment.

20097,/comment/20097,"Thank you for the opportunity to submit feedback on the proposed New Regulation under the Planning Act for the open-for-business planning tool.
The name: Competitiveness act
We all know to be a good competitor, one must be fit and to be fit, one must be in good health, well equipped / protected and need to be able to train.
Section 10 of the proposed bill is asking for more farmland to be paved over. This is like asking a hockey team to play with a shorter stick in a smaller rink (less productive land) and with no helmet (gamble with the natural environment) in order for the team to be more competitive.
Only five per cent of Ontario's land mass is suitable and available for agriculture but a 100% of Canadians expect to be fed every day.
Loosing food sovereignty and growing more and more dependent on imports and foreign Nations to feed us, makes us not very competitive, it makes us dependent and at the mercy of foreign policy makers and foreign corporations.
As an active farmer on the outskirts of a major city, growing food for consumers across Ontario, I am very concerned with every acre of productive land paved over. As a member of the policy advisory committee member of the Ontario Farmland Trust (OFT), a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to protect and preserve Ontario farmlands and associated agricultural, natural, and cultural features of the countryside, I do see opportunities for more healthy growth.
Ontario’s agri-food sector is a major economic engine for the province. In terms of job creation and economic growth, a 2018 report confirmed that the agri-food sector contributes over $39 billion to Ontario’s GDP and employs more than 820,000 Ontarians in the supply chain [1]. Compared with the $20 Billion of the Ontario Auto sector. The agri-food sector contribution is overwhelmingly significant in rural areas, where roughly 12% of the GDP and 10% of rural jobs are attributed to the farm sector [2]. Ontario is also positioned favourably to attract agricultural and manufacturing investment because it is a global leader in the agri-food industry and houses one of the largest agri-food hubs in North America. This, in turn, generates growth in employment and GDP.
OFT believes that the proposed open-for-business planning by-law (OFB-ZBL) places the agri-food sector and its substantial economic benefits at an unacceptable level of risk. As such, OFT recommends that the proposed Open-For-Business Planning Tool and related New Regulation be rejected.
The following section outlines some of the proposed OFB-ZBL’s threats to the farm sector and suggests alternative actions to improve the province’s business environment while attracting agri-food investment.
Threats to the Farm Sector
The proposed Open-For-Business Planning By-Law could open up for development farmland that is either currently protected (e.g. through the Greenbelt Plan) or is outside of projected municipal growth areas. This negatively impacts the farm sector in a number of ways.
Farmland is vital to farmers and communities. It is vital to food production. It is vital to every single Ontario residents. It sustains us all by providing healthy food and clean water and should be afforded the respect it is owed.
The proposed OFB-ZBL:
•	Threatens to pave over and permanently destroy productive farmland. Protecting Ontario’s farmland is absolutely critical for the success of the farm and agri-food sectors. The loss of this land to non-agricultural uses is irreversible and negatively impacts Ontario’s economy, food security, and agri-food investment potential.
•	Introduces conflicting land uses adjacent to land used for agricultural purposes. This disadvantages both producers and those on adjacent properties and ultimately makes it more difficult for farmers to continue running financially sustainable farm businesses and can create conflict with neighbors.
•	Places water quality at an unacceptable level of risk. Agricultural properties rely on clean ground water for drinking, livestock, and irrigation water. Bypassing water protection policies using the OFB-ZBL endangers the safety of rural Ontarians with potentially significant health and economic impacts.
Actions to Improve Ontario’s Business Environment
We all need growth, but unhealthy, uncontrolled growth is called cancer.
A path for new and innovative growth must be fostered. Luckily, Ontario’s planners don’t need to engage the armed forces to fight for more land the way land constricted Countries have to do. All we need to do in Ontario is think innovative and get out of our Status quo comfort zone.
Bill 66 offers an opportunity to introduce new ideas at a time where most cities face overcrowding. Ontario is blessed like very few Countries on this planet, with a huge landmass. Because 5% of Ontario’s landmass was suitable for Agriculture, this is where people mainly settled and industries sprung up from what these settlers produced and needed to have produced for them. But in modern days, business needs to stop fixating on GTHA.
Zoning and partnership proposal for an Ontario Economic and Population Growth Plan
•	Grow Ontario and ease the pressure on the GTA by building Satellite villages and towns on land not suitable for growing food.
•	An innovative growth plan, based on interacting micro economy principals, should include amendments to the building code to allow construction more easily for off grid homes, tiny homes, homes with alternative, recycled material content, multiple generation dwellings, mixed zoning areas, home businesses and more.
•	Partner Ontario Municipalities: Every municipality in south Ontario projected or wishing to grow (10% for example) on population needs to partner with one or more municipalities in an area where there is no agricultural land suitable for farming at any scale due to climate or soil conditions. Then the 2 partners develop together existing and new infrastructure to the needs of citizens wishing to live in these satellite center while the partner municipalities share resources and taxes.
•	The satellite settlements are micro economies with their own shops, schools, baker, butcher, hairdressers, recycling, composting facility, central heating system from renewable sources and a micro grid electricity from renewable sources and much more.
While the OFT is opposed to the proposed Open-for-business zoning by-law we all acknowledge that there are other actions that can be taken to improve the business environment in the Province, beside the above mentioned micro economies in Satellite Settlements and attract investment in the agri-food sector, including:
•	Coordinating the actions of provincial ministries so they work as a team to facilitate appropriate development
•	Adopting an online ‘single portal’ approach to planning applications, approvals, and communications between government agencies and applicants
•	Providing greater recognition and promotion of the agri-food sector as an economic engine in the province
•	Promoting job creation and investment opportunities that recognize and support agricultural business potential in rural areas. Farmland is rural employment land and employment in one sector should not place jobs at risk in another, which is the current reality of Section 10 given the risks it will create for agricultural viability.
•	Creating land-use certainty by using existing planning or policy tools to permanently protect critical Ag-sector resources and identifying areas clearly not suitable for food production due to lack of soil or poor climate conditions.

20100,/comment/20100,"I understand that we live in a democratic society and my parents escaped a dictatorial communist society. This Bill is undemocratic and potentially very damaging to the environment. As much as I support “open for business”  I do not believe that this concept can work in isolation or irresponsibly.  We have to respect each other and the environment. I am writing to express my strong opposition to Schedule 10 of Bill 66, which introduces “open-for-business by-laws” that would circumvent many of the requirements under several laws to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in land use decisions and protection of water, natural heritage and human health in Ontario.
Under the guise of cutting red tape, Schedule 10 is a full-scale assault on the environment. Big business must factor the health, natural heritage and quality of life of ordinary Ontarians in its operations. We matter, and we demand that our government respect the well-being of the citizens of this province.

Without the enforcement of Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, tragedies such as Walkerton can happen again.

20104,/comment/20104,"This bill is a terrible, retrograde, and anti-democratic piece of legislation, effectively side-stepping essential environmental and other protections. These protections were put in place over decades, by elected governments of different parties, based on significant research and consultation.
This bill would allow municipalities to avoid public consultation with the people whose lives, communities, environment and livelihoods will be affected by the development. It views land only in terms of material wealth to benefit the few -- in the form of development of for-profit housing, or corporate interests such as industry and extraction.
Land and water are essential, non-renewable resources. They are part of our heritage as Ontarians. The Green Belt, Oak Ridges Moraine,  Great Lakes, Clean Water and other protections Acts protect our water supply and our natural environment, and improve the quality of our air.
We need clean water, in good supply, and these areas are the watershed for the GTA.  Industry has a long history of poisoning our waters, or selling them off to other countries in plastic bottles -- yielding  material gain for shareholders, but no local benefit.
This bill is being falsely touted as being about solving the housing crisis. I have worked in human rights, housing, and planning matters for many years. You solve the housing crisis by measures like: properly regulating rental and bought housing; having genuine rent controls, including applying regulations to ALL rental housing and limiting increases between tenants;  curbing out-of-control and insufficiently regulated Air BnB activities; setting out inclusionary zoning regulations; and requiring developers to create barrier-free, accessible housing with a set percentage of dedicated low-cost affordable housing.
You also solve the housing crisis by requiring that people be paid fair, living wages (such as $15 minimum wage and through Pay Equity legislation), and by providing adequate financial support to people who cannot work due to disability, work enough to meet their needs, or who are out of work.
These strategies have been shown to work, in many cities and towns in North America and around the world.
The government must act in the public interest -- for the people.
People want clean air and water, and we need these beautiful protected green spaces -- to visit, for tourism, and to maintain our water and help counteract the poor air quality caused by our cities and industry.
People need affordable, supportive, and low-cost rental housing,  not just more poorly planned urban and suburban sprawl to benefit developers and those diminishing numbers of Ontarians who can afford to buy a new home.
Environmental and heritage protections must not be waived for developers or industry, and not for individual elected members' or their friends' financial gain. Developers are not suffering, they have been building unabated, at great profit, for decades.
I would like to see Ontario be competitive in the ways that really count, and in the ways that a government _should_ be competitive:  in protecting the environment, meeting the needs of the poor, growing the middle class,  and regulating and preventing the excesses of corporations that act in their financial interested, rather in the public interest.
This bill will allow immeasurable, permanent harm, and should not be passed.

20105,/comment/20105,"I disagree with many of the proposals made in this bill. Eliminating protections put in place for consumers doesn't cut red tape, it cuts consumer protections. Eliminating environmental protections doesn't cut red tape, it cuts environmental protections. And eliminating important health protections doesn't eliminate red tape, it endangers lives. Keeping people safe should be an expected cost of doing business in Ontario or anywhere else.
Restrictions were placed on private daycares because children were dying. Babies were dying. I do not have children but I would happily pay a bit more tax to subsidize daycare costs to protect children and the future of our province. I would not ever stand for a government that would reduce protections of our most vulnerable citizens, mere infants, as a proposed way to save a buck.
Taking away the safety requirements around clean water regulations? I know it's annoying for developers. I have clients who are developers and property managers. They often see it as being unnecessary when water tests consistently come back ok. But to take away that requirement means that it won't be known when the water tests don't come back ok. Again, this regulation was created because people were dying. This is a cost of doing business that is highly justified. Developers still build here. There is no shortage of that. Just take a drive through York Region and see.
And the Green Belt - a huge point of pride in this province. It should continue to be protected at all costs. I've heard the line that the previous government carved at the green belt, but it's handy that you don't mention WHICH previous government. And if it was the Wynne government (which I can't find any evidence to support), that's even worse. To demonize the Wynne government and then suggest that it's ok to do something because Wynne did it too? That's hardly fair to the voters who wanted change.
It should have been clear from the outcry prior to the election that the green belt is something that Ontarians want protected. The suggestion that allowing it to be developed - regardless of whether it is up to the province or municipalities - will lower housing costs is ludicrous. Especially with Doug Ford's elimination of affordable housing and rent control requirements. What's to stop a developer from clear cutting the Vivian Forest and building 3 mansions? That land should be protected. It's a true point of pride and beauty and should not be risked under any circumstance.
It seems everything in this bill is designed only to hurt Ontario and take away from the people who live here. These incentives don't help businesses who want to do business in Ontario, it only helps scammers who seek to take advantage of the population. The pawn brokers act, designed to protect people from ridiculous interest rates sending them into bankruptcy. The pension benefits act, toxic reductions act, wireless services agreements act - the were acts that were put in place for the people. Taking them away under bill 66 does nothing but harm.
This bill was proposed as something to help businesses be more competitive, but these businesses currently compete against each other within Ontario. Surely adjusting the regulations across the board for all of them will not make them more competitive.
I cannot stare just how disgusted I am by this bill, as a whole. I have been a registered member of the PC party for years. If this bill passes, not only will the PC party have permanently lost a voter, but also very likely a tax paying resident. I will be looking at relocating elsewhere.

20108,/comment/20108,"The significance that the current provincial government is placing on Bill 66 and labeling it ‘Open for Business' is misleading and lacking in real detail. The specifics of what is being proposed are deliberately being withheld. The actual gist of what is being forced on Ontario residents and taxpayers is regressive and entrenched in an all too familiar agenda of attempting to turn back the clock. This is just dangerously delusional. It is disingenuous and misleading to imply that eliminating the checks and balances or so-called red tape that has been determined to be essential, due to the costly repercussions of previous backward thinking Ontario governments, can now be considered in the best interest of Ontario’s economy.
I would suggest that this “troubling trend of businesses looking outside of Ontario, and other competitive jurisdictions” that you mention in your message has been very much accelerated by the substance of the messages the current provincial government has been sending to potential investors. The petty personal agenda of premier Ford is embedded in the agenda of the current provincial government. This narrow-minded master plan labeled Bill 66 amounts to much more than just the ridiculous disruptions during the recent municipal elections in Ontario. The last-minute challenges to Toronto’s council numbers has become very much characteristic of the knee jerk decisions, without consideration of the perverse long-term unanticipated consequences, which certainly doesn’t impress upon potential investors that Ontario is in good hands. This is one of several small-minded foolish attempts on the part of the current premier of Ontario to shine a spotlight on himself that absolutely does not provide Ontario residents and taxpayers with the assurance that is needed to convince them that he and the current provincial government are capable of responsibly representing Ontario.
You say that you have heard loud and clear from municipalities and so-called job creators. You should now have the opportunity to hear loud and clear from the nonpartisan forward-thinking component of Ontario business, residents and taxpayers who confidently recognize the value of careful discretion when their provincial government is fixated on eliminating the checks and balances that have proven to be a steadfast mainstay of Ontario’s past successes. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing already has a tool to bypass municipal legislation and allow development anywhere in Ontario, it is called the Minister’s zoning order. Why create a new tool when you already have one that has the same effect? Calling legislation enacted to protect farmland, drinking water, and natural areas unnecessary and outdated is not reasonable. It very much appears that the current provincial government wants to make our environment an area they think can be exploited to fabricate employment numbers in their favour.
Municipal government and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs data show that there is currently a surplus of employment land within existing city boundaries to develop new businesses. In fact, many municipalities are seeking to convert these lands to other uses, like residential because of the lack of demand from industry to develop these lands. Many of these lands are near highways and or transit, which is very attractive to new businesses.
In addition, development approvals have been held up by sprawl developers who in the past appealed all regional official plans to the Ontario Municipal Board. They did this in order to secure more land for subdivisions than needed, but they were unsuccessful as there was more than enough land for development purposes. These appeals slowed Official Plan implementation by an average of over 3 years. Research by the Neptis Foundation also shows there is over 100,000 ha. of land available within existing urban boundaries for housing development. This is an area the size of Mississauga and Toronto combined and will meet regional population growth projections for decades to come.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 makes it clear that the prohibitions against development contained in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, and the Places to Grow Act will not apply to “Open for Business By-Laws”. These by-laws can be initiated and passed by any municipal government without public notice. They are then forwarded to the Ontario government for approval. They cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeals Tribunal.
This change could open the floodgates of multiple municipalities opening protected areas to development at the behest of developers, who are large election campaign contributors at the municipal level. Many of the costs of development will be borne by local taxpayers for the additional infrastructure required.
It is obvious from your message that it is a form letter sent out in a bid to announce the current government’s resolve to turn back the clock in Ontario to what they believe were sound principles of governance in the past. It is therefore understandable that your form letter has also been automatically sent to someone belonging to a group of Concerned Citizens of Ramara who has already experienced the true scope and capability of our current provincial government when it comes to taking constituent concerns seriously.
When my wife and I met with you at your constituency office on October 19th, 2018 you respectfully listened while we explained in detail that there is more than one large scale soil dumping site in our Township of Ramara. We provided a map of Ramara Township indicating the five known large-scale soil dumping sites in Ramara Township and one close by in Carden Township, City of Kawartha Lakes and mentioned if none of the identified sites is located close to you, don’t make the mistake of believing that this is a certainty. These are only the sites that are known. We further explained that noncompliance is the issue. The Ramara Township Fill Bylaw 2012.70, revised in October 2018 to become Ramara Township Bylaw 2018.64, A Bylaw To Prohibit Or Regulate The Placing Or Dumping Of Fill In The Township Of Ramara has not been properly applied or enforced at any of the indicated locations. This has allowed uncontrolled large-scale soil dumping of many thousands of cubic metres of soil to take place at each of the sites. Freedom of Information requests were submitted to Ramara Township to determine what level of compliance actually existed for three of the large-scale soil dumping sites. The information received through the Freedom of Information process confirmed that the protective measures of the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw were deliberately circumvented in all three locations. Despite the existence of stop work orders existing for two of the three locations large-scale soil dumping has been allowed to continue unchecked. So far there has never been any actual application and enforcement of the protective measures of the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw, and there hasn’t been any recognizable effort on the part of Ramara Township to believe that this will ever be the case.
My wife and I left your constituency office with the impression that the genuine concerns of the Concerned Citizens of Ramara along with the evidence-based information we provided during our meeting would be seriously considered and given the respect and dignity they deserve. Over the following weeks your constituency office was provided with a great deal more evidence-based information regarding the large-scale soil dumping in Ramara Township. On December 17th, 2018 we were provided with an email message stating the following.
""Thank you for your emails and updates regarding this the Miller Road large scale soil dumping situation. We apologize for the delayed response to your request from the Ministry.
MPP --------- passed the package you provided her on October 23, 2018, to give to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks to look into. Our office just heard back from the Ministry regarding the documents concerning your request for information regarding fill material deposited at the site – and the municipal response indicates that the material was placed at the site in accordance with the local fill bylaw (therefore not an illegal dumping issue). They stated that their Barrie District Office conducted a site inspection this fall and confirmed that the site was operating under a municipal permit to receive the soil.
As the Ministry has confirmed, there is nothing more we can pursue with the Ministry on your behalf. Thank you kindly for reaching out and keeping us apprised of the latest developments in this.""
If only a small fraction of the information that was provided to your office had been given even the slightest bit of serious consideration you should have realized that ""the Miller Road large scale soil dumping situation” is in the City of Kawartha Lakes and not in Simcoe County.
With regard to the ""package you provided her on October 23, 2018” and the predictable response from the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks and the Ramara Township municipal response. Which large scale soil dumping site are you referring to? Once again had you given the information provided to you the least bit of the adequate attention, a constituent should be able to expect from their MPP, you would have recognized the glaring discrepancies in the information provided by the MOECP and Ramara Township. There isn’t any recorded instance of the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw 2012.70 or 2018.64 ever being used to address large scale soil dumping in Ramara Township. The only time the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw 2012.70 or 2018.64 has been referenced is to search for an exemption to the protective measures stipulated in the document after the incidents of large-scale soil dumping have been repeatedly brought to the attention of Ramara Township representatives. Yes, there certainly isn’t an illegal dumping issue when the government of the day, the MOECP and Ramara Township are for some reason so blindly disinterested in our Ontario environment that they can’t be bothered to even vaguely perform their responsibility to protect the interests of their residents. The illegal dumping of soils in rural areas of Ontario is proving to be very lucrative for those who are willing to close their eyes to the inevitable environmental disaster. This is only reinforced when any semblance of environmental responsibility can be ignored and condoned by our levels of government.
The response your office provided is irresponsible, obstructive and far short of what rural Ontarian's should expect from their provincial representatives. The very sad conclusion is that the people who took advantage of Ramara Township’s inability to apply and enforce their Fill Bylaw are also watching. The excess fill is still being marketed to anyone who is willing to make a fast buck and now the current provincial government wants to further diminish the availability of environmental regulation with Bill 66. Improvements to environmental regulations are needed so municipalities like Ramara Township are given the oversight from the provincial government that has been demonstrated as lacking. If the current provincial government considers Bylaws as Red Tape, then Bill 66 most certainly should not be passed. Not that bylaws are currently anything to be taken seriously in Ramara Township anyway.

20114,/comment/20114,"Dear Conservative government,
I would like to remind you what good governance is - and how Bill 66 S. 10 and S. 5 was presented is not an example of good governance.
Good governance is an exercise by political leaders for the well being of citizens. Proper and effective use of resources is demonstrated by good leaders.  Given that the most important needs of citizens is clean air, clean water, safe food and a healthy environment to sustain these needs, these sections of Bill 66 do neither.
Good governance is participatory and representative. By pushing the Bill through over Christmas break, it was apparent that the government was trying to limit any real participation by the public or municipalities who will be directly impacted by these changes. Bill 66 Section 10 eliminates any public participation and appeals process for real public concerns around development if the municipality chooses to pass a bylaw.
Good governance should be consensus oriented and accountable to All the people being represented, not just a few. Through the Planning Act, municipalities undergo a rigorous, thoughtful and public oriented process under their Official Plans. They have already established adequate development lands for employment. There are 16,742 vacant hectares of land currently available. There is no need to risk our Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine or Niagara Escarpment which provides the citizens of Ontario with much of its available farmland and provides many of its residence with clean drinking water. Since the Moraine feeds sits on 2 watersheds, negatively impacting this feature has serious consequences for a huge geographical area. As your environment ministry knows, cleaning contaminated groundwater is not an easy task.
Good governance should be competent. Risk assessment needs to be a top priority for the government when passing laws. Bill 66 S 10 does not seem to adequately consider the risk to farmland, drinking water or climate change. By carving into the protected areas, urban sprawl is encouraged. As you know our urban infrastructure is seriously insufficient. Exacerbating this with more sprawl is unconscionable and contributes more carbon emissions to the air as commuters sit idling in traffic every morning and evening. By repealing the Toxic Reductions Act without replacing it puts Ontario citizens at risk.
Good governance is operating via rule of law, but when the law is being changed to the detriment of the public, the government must be held accountable. They need to be responsive to the best interest of the public, ensuring the basic needs of all are equitably distributed. Our basic needs for clean air, water, food and a healthy environment to sustain those needs have to be the top priority of the government. As such, it is recommended that Section 10 be deleted and REPLACED with a clear, delineated area in which no development can take place in perpetuity. This will allow an equitable, level playing field where all know the rules around development lands vs. the piecemeal approach recommended in Bill 66. I sincerely hope our government will do what’s in the best interest of us all. The decisions of today will have serious consequences for tomorrow. What will be your legacy??

So the main thrust of Bill 66 to suspend the application of a multitude of environmental protection measures in the name of removing obstacles to investment and job creation is completely out of step with what is needed. Its passage into law can only make matters worse, not only for the environment and public health, but for the overheated development industry itself.
In light of how wildly disconnected from reality this legislation actually is, it can only be seen as another artifact of the culture war mentality of this government. It invokes extraordinary, draconian measures to address an issue that does not even exist, but ignores the most significant problem that is staring us in the face, climate change.

With the recent endangered classifications coming up for vital animals in our ecosystems are known to be harmful- we must not add to the harm at any cost.
The hazards caused by removing any protection to the environment are far more costly than removing the protection.
If any changes are made to our legislation that will put our planet and communities at more of a risk, it  is not acceptable. Not to me, not to my family, or the animals who live in our wilderness. The quality of our air, our soil, and our water- makes the quality of our very selves.
We can not play with the safety of humanity. Not for a minute, an hour, or a day. The results of environmental hazards are not being taken seriously and we must find reasonable, and educated help to provide the proper handling of any legislation that regards such importances.
We cannot remove safe operating procedures for ladders in any workplace, so why would we remove any safe handling practices for our environment.  It would be an utter failure and disappointment, not to mention the long term effects. We need to take seriously the dangers being presented by this bill.
Our environment is being put at risk right now with the very idea of Bill 66, just as an incapable employer would make an employees work unsafe purposely for monetary gains.  It is not just removing safety- it is potential destruction.
We have many ways to make money while nurturing and protecting our environment, so someone needs to grow up and stop scaring the public until we do not have these glorious benefits at hand anymore. The environment is absorbed into ourselves.
Anyone supporting this Bill should seriously re-educate themselves on health and safety of the community, and the environment.  This is potential chaos.
Our air, and water are not safe as it is. We should be taking care of that more than anything else. Money can be saved elsewhere- by punishing companies for environmental hazards more harshly and charging more for their unsafe practices including such ideas as found in Bill 66..

Think of any small children you know. Now picture them constantly coughing, picture them burnt from the sun, picture them dying of dehydration, and being poisoned by chemicals, starving to death.

It opens up Ontario’s Greenbelt for factory, retail and residential development, undermines drinking water protection rules and guts rules that help industry reduce the release of toxic chemicals.
At its core, though it is labeled as a bill to improve economic development, it will take Ontario backwards and have major financial impacts on the Province in terms of environmental degradation, health care, and the provision of affordable foods grown relatively locally to its citizenry.
Bill 66 basically takes us back backwards as a province and, at the same time, gambles on our future while benefiting a small minority in the here and now. This is short sighted. We need a government who is going to look after its citizens now and balance that with future wellbeing.
If there is a need for efficiencies and ways to improve the way business is done in Ontario, this needs to be done with more than the next four years in mind, but rather the future in which our children and grand-children will live. If there is a need for these improvements, they need to be done with human beings in mind, not corporations.

Affecting every municipality in Ontario, Bill 66 would allow municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” trumping critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
Threatening drinking water sources across Ontario, open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
Endangering  wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario, Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
Compromising farmland across Ontario, Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
Bill 66 compromises transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors, leaving citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

20158,/comment/20158,"Approval of Bill 66 will have significant negative impacts on all natural systems which sustain the health and well being of southern Ontario. Opening up the Greenbelt for further development and environmental destruction will be detrimental to all of us.
It endangers food production and prices by opening land to development. There is only 5% of arable land in Ontario.  Urban sprawl has already consumed much of the available Class 1 agricultural land and has put pressure on open land for development. In doing so, it has prevented the younger generation of farmers and land stewards from accessing affordable land to continue traditional agricultural practices.
Waiving environmental assessments for businesses seeking to further exploit arable land, is setting us back years and will undermine environmental protections meant to safeguard these essential areas. The effects will be devastating. Once valuable land is lost, it can never be returned to its natural, productive state. We depend on the Greenbelt for food. Food costs will inevitably rise as we look elsewhere for food that will be less nutritious and will contribute to an increase in carbon. Already the Greenbelt sinks the carbon of 33 million cars. Reducing this, would be detrimental to air quality and climate goals.
Residential and commercial development of the Greenbelt is unnecessary for expansion or for economic development. A Neptis Foundation study found 125,000 hectares of land around the GTA suitable for development through 2031.The Greenbelt already provides $3.2 billion in services through recreational activities and flood protection and $11 billion in agricultural outputs - $1.7 billion of which is tax for all levels of government. The Greenbelt employs 38,000 people in the agricultural sector. Bill 66 will meddle with a system that is already working and is providing a multitude of benefits. With Bill 66 in place, the law of diminishing returns will prevail. There is never an end to what a healthy environment can supply.
Bill 66 will compromise the health of significant watersheds by encouraging sprawl and by allowing municipalities to ignore legislation such as the Clean Water Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, and the Great Lakes Protection Act. Municipalities will not be required to participate in select planning.
Bill 66 further erodes democracy by allowing municipalities under the ""Open for Business"" bylaw to ignore public consultation. Once development is approved by the provincial government, the decision cannot be appealed. People care very much about the Greenbelt and the benefits it bestows. This is not what the current government was elected to do. People want the Greenbelt to be protected for the health of us now and for future generations. Everything depends on a healthy environment.

20162,/comment/20162,"Ontario has never been uncompetitive, so ""restoring"" its competitiveness is a red herring, a straw man. But, if you want Ontario to be truly competitive, with the lowest common denominator, you should consider outlawing labour unions, eliminating minimum wage legislation, lowering the minimum working age to nine to allow for more child labour (I hear they're cheap),....... No? Never or just not this term of office? Then we can keep up with India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Venezuela..... Who are our competitors? The developed world or the Third World? Free trade with much of Asia has made the Third World our competitors, so if you want Ontario to be competitive with them, child labour sweat shops are the way to go. Who knows -- we might even lure back air-duct-cleaner call centres to Ontario. Is Europe our competitors? I would hope so and I would hope we are already competitive with them. Is the USA our competitor? It would seem so, though I am no longer convinced they qualify as a First World economy.

20163,/comment/20163,"Let's talk about this word 'unnecessary' for a moment.
I know you folks have convinced yourselves that better solutions can be found by simply not wasting resources on people and issues you aren't convinced really matter to your taxpaying constituents. You've made it abundantly clear that you aren't really interested in making life better for ALL Ontarians, however much you might dance around that truth. You have your favourites, and we all know who they are, even if we can't see them because they're hiding behind walls of money made from buying and selling assets that we tend to describe as the Working Poor. You may have heard of them, but I suspect you think they are a myth, like unicorns and such. And that's the whole problem with telling people that you know better than they do what is 'necessary', when you clearly haven't even understood the problem presented to you.
Let me put it to you another way: by the time you figure out that you were wrong about the environmental impact of unregulated Capitalism (even as your assumptions and economic theories have been soundly disproved over the last century), there will be no one left alive or in good enough health to tell you why you're dying. I know you think that's hysterical nonsense, or that you've already secured your Get Out Of Jail Free card in advance, but you have no proof to support your point. We HAVE proof of our point, and it's a sad indictment on our times that you people aren't educated enough to comprehend the concept of Unintended Consequences.
So I'm going to explain it to you as quickly as I know how: You do not actually have a Dog-given right of Dominion over any persons, places or things on this planet, to do with as you see fit. Property as we know it is merely a human concept dreamt up to justify not sharing what you've found. That's really all it is. I know you don't understand this, but bear with me. If I were to say I was the rightful ruler of everyone, you could reasonably dismiss my claim as being baseless, because no rich government or wealthy family has endorsed my claim. The trick is, the only thing that gives them the right to dismiss my claim is the social contract we as a society agreed on in order to take part in this society. It's like a legal contract without paper. We know when we're losing ground, because people drift away and forget us. Kinda like how they did the concept of Sun Kings and Pharoahs. And that's where we find ourselves now. If you can't figure out that you have an actual responsibility to ALL Ontarians, no matter how hard you find it to understand and placate the Left-leaning members of our society, then it really is only a matter of time before we dismiss you and find another system to help govern our lives and resources more fairly.
History can be very subjective, it turns out. But we all know where the leaders of the last few failed governmental philosophies ended up. Precedent has been set, and the forces that made those changes possible have not magically disappeared from the planet. You people are basically gambling--with our children's future, I might add--that we won't figure out we're being manipulated and silenced before you prove to the cosmos that Money Worship Works. That will be the epitaph on the memorial we probably won't be alive to erect in your honour, even as a cautionary tale for anyone watching.
Please, prove me wrong about you people. Do the one thing human beings have learned to do that actually redeems us: Change your minds, and recognise what you are doing, not only to your political and ideological opponents, but to the whole planet, which we are still tethered to until we actually figure out how to safely move somewhere else. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from destroying ourselves with myopic policies designed to reinforce Classism and Patriarchy and deny anyone else a voice at the table where the future of our planet is being decided.
If you can't see that you're wrong, you can rest assured, some of us have noticed where you're going wrong. We're here to help. Listen to us. We have nothing to gain from lying to you about this. Only pride stands in the way. And Pride goes before the fall.

20170,/comment/20170,"I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 66. Please protect the Greenbelt to ensure the well-being of people and wildlife as promised during the election campaign!  This Bill expedites development of environmentally sensitive lands and negatively affect the Oak Ridges Moraine Trail as well as planning policies such as the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act.
Ontario’s Greenbelt covers an area of approximately 1.8 million acres surrounding the Golden Horseshoe from Niagara Falls, north to Tobermory, and east to Rice Lake.  It provides protection to wetlands, forests and farmland and its inception was a result of mitigating the negative effects of ever-increasing urban sprawl.  The Greenbelt has been recognized internationally as an exemplary example of land-use planning.
The benefits of the Greenbelt for the residents of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are numerous.  This natural infrastructure contributes to the health and wellbeing of people and wildlife, a prosperous economy, local food, tourism, recreational opportunities, proper land-use planning and natural capital benefits.  For example, it is estimated that the economic benefit of the Greenbelt exceeds approximately $9 billion annually throughout the Province in direct, indirect and induced impacts.  The Greenbelt ensures the protection of fertile farmland and our natural heritage and provides ecosystem services such as clean air and water, climate change and stormwater mitigation, carbon sequestration, reduced strain on city infrastructure, and habitat for birds, turtles and species at risk.  It helps sustain biodiversity and our quality of life.
Please honour the promise during the election that the Ontario government would leave the Greenbelt intact!  Low density sprawl creates more gridlock, long commute times, more municipal roads, sewer and water pipes to maintain. Taxes are also lower in denser cities where services such as transit are more affordable and cost justified.  Affordable housing is also more achievable.  Once the Greenbelt is paved, the damage is irreparable and our quality of life will be jeopardized for generations to come!
Thank you.

I am opposed to the changes proposed under Schedule 3. Increasing the span of control for children's care is not the way to make more child care spaces. The current standards were spurred by tragic circumstances and informed by stakeholder consultation. This proposal endangers people's lives.
I am opposed to the changes proposed under Schedule 10.  In its current form it:
- Disregards important provincial policy documents like the PPS and the Big Move side-stepping planning principles followed to create liveable communities.
- Disregards planning processes designed to enable a fulsome, comprehensive review of a municipality's growth. These processes are important to ensure sustainable, managed growth across the entire municipality, region, and larger geographic area (GGH). These processes are an important part of ensuring that we create communities based on an established vision and wisely use resources. These processes have been created for a reason. History shows us what will happen with unmanaged, disconnected growth.
- Undermines planning policy intended to protect our valuable agricultural and natural resources (Greenbelt, ORM, and NE Plan).
- Does not serve the public as there is no requirement for public consultation before the OFB-ZBL is approved. Public consultation is part of the foundation of planning for the public interest.
- Is a danger to safe drinking water.

I would like a guarantee from our provincial government that every decision they make has an eye on the future health and well being of these precious souls. To be honest, I do not feel Bill 66 provides this reassurance for me. I feel it is a massive mistake. Actually, it feels like a betrayal of trust.
I am especially concerned about Sections 5 and 10. I get the sense that the passing these sections of Bill 66 will reward big business, not the people and most certainly not the environment. They will weaken many regulations that were passed to protect our environment and drinking water.
Can it be that it will allow municipalities to bypass important environmental regulations as long as at least 50 new jobs are created? And how about the impact it will have on The Greenbelt Act, The Clean Water Act, The Great Lakes Protection Act, The Lake Simcoe Act and The Oak Ridges Moraine Act?
Where does this leave my grandchildren? Someone needs to explain to me why their futures have not been taken into serious consideration. They deserve better! They deserve legislation that does not sacrifice the environment for short sighted economic gain.

This undermines the past efforts to protect Ontario's drinking water and the Toxic Reduction Act to reduce the release of toxic chemicals.  Wetlands, woodlands and species at risk would be threatened by this Bill.  Wetlands are so important to our municipalities because they aid in collecting and draining water from nearby municipalities and furthermore filtering this water before it enters our groundwater.  Furthermore, wetlands are homes very biodiverse ecosystems which are essential to the survival of many species that rely on these habitats. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean

It would leave citizens without recourse and community members would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

20193,/comment/20193,"Comments on Opening the Greenbelt for Development, Bill 66
French politician and statesman Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (1807-1874) was apocryphally quoted as saying, “There go my people and I must follow them, for I am their leader.” M. Ledru-Rollin was eventually exiled to England by the ruling elite for his ideas of actually listening to the people who did all the living, working and dying. Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) also is quoted as using this very powerful line. Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned for leading a grassroots movement of non-violence against a foreign imperial power that refused to listen to the wants, desires and needs of the people. Wherever the quote came from, it speaks to the best qualities of a leader, whether that leader is a business owner, crew leader, religious leader or politician. I believe all politicians should have this line printed on their mirrors. This is the highest quality of a leader: to look after the people who are relying on them to lead them to a safer, happier, healthier tomorrow, or, in my chosen profession, to ensure they go home safely at the end of the day. I believe that with Bill 66 the current government of Ontario and the premier have not only not looked in their mirrors, but decided to break them and throw them out.
It is my understanding that the Greenbelt was initiated by the province of Ontario for the future enjoyment and protection of Ontarians and their environment. The Greenbelt would set aside land for recreation, agriculture, environmental protection and safe water. Opening the Greenbelt for commercial, residential and industrial development flies in the face of forward-looking politicians, business people and private individuals, lead to loss of green space for future generations and loss of habitat for endangered species, damage to water supply systems and irreparable damage to ecosystems that have been in place for thousands of years.
Over the past few years I have tried to do everything I can to reduce my impact on the environment. Part of this was to reduce my energy usage through using the GreenOn rebates. These rebates were paid for by the provincial Cap and Trade program. I replaced my aging furnace and air conditioner to the highest efficiency units available, replaced windows, replaced all my lightbulbs with LED’s, sealed my house, I even bought an all-electric vehicle. Over the past 20 years, before I retired, I commuted the 20 km to and from work through most of the year on my bicycle. Why? Because it was the right thing to do. What is this government doing? Turning the clock back 40 years. I am waiting for it to reopen coal-fired power plants.
Cancelling the Cap and Trade program simply speaks to this government’s mindset: the environment is not a concern, it is for sale to the highest bidder and we need to pave the world. Bill 66 follows along with this theme. MPP Donna Skelly is quoted as saying that environmental protections will still be in place, but at the same time the proposed Open for Business bylaws allow municipalities and businesses to ignore red tape put in place for the protection of the environment, the world, the province and the people who live here. Municipalities who do not wish to pass these bylaws are free to do so, but they will be under increased pressure to do so if a neighbouring municipality decides they will open up development. It is a Catch-22 scenario for these municipalities – damned if they do, damned if they don’t.
The Oakridges Moraine is a unique geologic formation that is beautiful in its entirety. It is also home to many species, some of which are under survival stress if they lose habitat. It has the ability to act as a carbon sink for millions of tons of carbon dioxide and it supplies and filters millions of gallons of water necessary for the drinking water for inhabitants of the area, both human, farm and feral animals. It is also essential in holding back floodwaters. This unique area needs to be protected, not leveled for urban sprawl.
The Lake Simcoe watershed is a beautiful area that I have visited many times. It is home to many aquatic birds and animals as well as a large human and farm population. The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority released a report last year that shows some stress in the watershed area. Further development and intensification of residence, commerce and industry will further erode plant life, forestry, and the waters of the area. Storm and sewage runoff are already a problem. More trees and wetlands are required to ensure the long-term health of this area.
I worry about our environment. I worry for my children and grandchildren; and not just mine, but everyone’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I worry about not being able to go outside and see the stars because the air is too thick to see through and with sprawling residential, commercial and industrial areas, the night sky will be more blotted out with light pollution. I will have to go farther afield to see stars. I remember being able to see the Milky Way in the night sky as a child. The only time I have been able to see this from my home was back during the large power outage in August 2003.
I worry about being able to ride my bike through chucky thick air. I worry about having safe water to drink. I worry about biodiversity. I worry about what my grandchildren will say about me and about us. What did we do when we had the chance? I want to be able to say that we did something. How can I look in the mirror and say to myself, “We had the chance to fix the problem and we did nothing!”?
In the entire Golden Horseshoe area there are thousands of hectares of brownfields waiting to be redeveloped. This land simply needs to be cleaned up to be suitable for new industry, commerce and residential areas. The land is already serviced, infrastructure in place and in many cases on existing transit lines. Why can this land not be used instead of going to the expense of servicing new lands, plowing and paving agricultural lands? There is apparently enough serviced land in these areas to keep developers busy into the 2030’s. Why do we need to destroy sensitive lands that are habitat to many species that will lose their homes? Already we have coyotes in the urban and suburban areas and parks attacking domestic animals. They are there because they are being pushed out of their regular habitats due to human encroachment. We have a rabies outbreak in the Hamilton-Caledonia area. This has nothing to do with the current Greenbelt plan; but if we further encroach on wildland areas, wild animals will have no other choices but to become extinct or encroach on land already developed. This will only worsen as we sprawl more and more into their habitat. Paving this area will also lead to worsening flooding.
One of the best tenets of the Greenbelt plan was to keep agricultural land close to where it is needed. By destroying farmlands we will have to truck in food from farther and farther afield. Why? We can produce much of our food right here. To produce it farther away means more cost and more carbon produced in delivering it into the urban areas. That leads to more spoilage, less fresh foods, more costs in delivery and worsening climate change.
During the past provincial election, the current premier was caught electioneering to a group of developers in the GTA. He promised to open up the Greenbelt to development. When these comments became public he quickly reversed his decision stating that the he would not open the Greenbelt for development. Now, after being elected, he has done what so many politicians have done in the past: promise anything to get elected and, once in power, pay back all the political favours to all his wealthy backers. He has not actually done this himself; he is allowing the municipalities to do his dirty work for him by rolling back environmental safeguards. He has not followed his people.
These choices we make now will affect Ontario, Canada and the world for decades, if not centuries. Political decisions that affect the environment and employment should not be made in haste. The plans put in place were well thought out. Premier Ford’s plans are not well thought out. He has yet to deliver a comprehensive plan for reducing climate change. This Bill will only give short term benefits to the developers but leave a lasting impact on our live and our grandchildren’s lives for ever.
Remember, once agricultural land is gone, once wildernesses are torn up for short term gain, they are gone forever. I don’t want to live in a world where the air is so thick that we cannot breathe it, where I cannot see the stars, where there are no wilderness areas to explore, where we cannot go outside because it is too hot to survive, where my home will be gone due to rising water levels, where the water is not safe to drink or swim in, where our children are poisoned from rising mercury levels and other toxins allowed to enter water tables and food stuffs due to government inaction.
We only have a few years to make the right choices before these things begin to happen. We need to act now, not in ten years when it is too late. There is no need for this legislation. Serviced land is already available on current public transit lines. I beg this government to listen to the wants desires and needs of the people, not to the greedy desires of powerful, faceless land developers. Please, kill Bill 66. Save our earth. It’s the only one we have.

I am writing to you to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt and therefore call back legislature and introduce a new Bill 66 that stops the attacks on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe, Source Water Protection Areas and other important protected farm and natural areas to development.
During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to circumvent these important protections, and all without public consultation which is the bedrock of our democracy.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.

Premier Ford 's ""Government of the People"" is undoing the Ontario PC Party's own environmental legacy legislation and the hard work of the people of Ontario over the past 40 years.
Former Progressive Conservative Premier, the Honourable Bill Davis (1971-1985), is hailed as the saviour of the Greenbelt. In 2007, the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation, Davis' actions laid the groundwork for what has now become the Ontario Greenbelt.
In 1973 Davis and his government took action to protect the Niagara Escarpment from overdevelopment, putting into place Canada's first-ever environmental land-use plan.
In terms of biodiversity and environmental significance, the Ontario Greenbelt is priceless. The Greenbelt is the world's largest protected greenbelt. Ontario’s Greenbelt provides the province with $9.1 billion in economic benefits and 161,000 full-time equivalent jobs according to the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation.

Developers should not be allowed to bypass the 2005 Green Belt Act Act (which protects 2 million acres of farms, natural areas and water sources), the the 2001 Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the 2006 Clean Water Act (which is in place to prevent tragedies such as the E. coli outbreak in Walkerton), the 2015 Great Lakes Protection Act, and the 2008 Lake Simcoe Protection Act. Furthermore, I do not support removing the 2009 Toxins Reduction Act which protects and informs consumers from harmful toxins. And allowing by-laws to be passed without meeting the legal requirement to ensure fair, consistent, transparent public engagement with land use in communities-- as laid out in Schedule 10 of Bill 66-- is not democracy. This Bill puts our land, water, wildlife, health, and natural heritage at risk, and undermines evidence-based city planning.

Bill 66 represents an unprecedented and unacceptable attack on legislative provisions which currently safeguard environmental quality and public health and safety throughout Ontario.
Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA).
What You Need to Know (Source: Ontario Nature).
1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations. https://ontarionature.org/bill-66-facts/

20243,/comment/20243,"In its current for, I absolutely:
•	Oppose Bill 66 – Schedule 10
•	Oppose the open-for-business planning Tool
•	Oppose the New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
The potential damage of Bill 66 – Schedule 10 and the associated open-for-business planning tool and new regulations go far beyond the obvious threats to public health if The Clean Water Act is no longer prioritized. The Bill, Tool, and New Regulation can undo decades of valuable legislation and directly contradicts the government’s own future plans. Biodiversity will decline further and efforts to restore habitat and reduce pollution will be seriously impinged. The damage done has the potential to escalate over time due to human nature and will reduce the liveability and sustainability of communities in Southern Ontario.  The Ontario Government must withdraw Schedule 10 from Bill 66 and withdraw the open-for-business planning Tool and its associated New Regulation under the Planning Act.
The effort, time, expertise, and public consultation that went into developing regional plans exemplifies thoughtful, democratic regional planning that must be respected. For example, to develop The Oak Ridges Moraine Plan, an advisory panel of 14 stakeholders, an inter-ministry team of senior government officials, four public consultation forums involving 2000 people, approximately 1200 written submissions eventually led to the regulations recognized today in numerous other planning documents and all local official plans. (Ontario, 2018). Similar processes have been followed for almost two decades to create other legislation so that planning decisions within local municipalities are compatible regionally and are based on ecology, sound research, and public engagement. Schedule 10 of Bill 66 was not the result of consultation and was announced strategically to minimize the ability of citizens, organization, and municipal governments to appropriately respond. It authorizes municipalities to create bylaws to allow job-creating developments to occur that do not meet the purposeful and beneficial constraints of nine Acts and potentially additional provisions. This completely undermines the purposes of these Acts and creates unfair discrepancies in obligations between properties. The Canadian Environmental Law Association provides a thorough explanation, in plain language, of exactly what provisions from these Acts can be ignored for the potential benefit of quick approval and as few as 50 jobs. (Lintner, 2018) These Acts were specifically created for the conservation of land and water that provide valuable ecosystem services, protect biodiversity, and help with climate change adaptation and mitigation, for increasing liveability and sustainability of growing communities, and for safeguarding the health of the residents of Ontario. Schedule 10 directly conflicts with Dufferin County’s Official Plan (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3.1 (a)) and the Conservative’s own Ontario’s Environment Plan, “to continue to protect and identify vulnerable waterways and inland waters…and continue to implement the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan” (p.13) and, “protect and enhance our natural areas, support conservation efforts, continue to conserve species at risk, develop adaptation strategies, and promote the importance of healthy natural spaces for future generations to use and enjoy” (p. 46). It also clearly states, “The Ontario government is committed to protecting the Greenbelt for future generations.” (p. 48). Allowing development according to Schedule 10 and the Planning Tool does not demonstrate any such commitment.
The ecosystems of the Greenbelt and the proposed expansion need more protection, not less. The primary threat to the 97% of the 78 provincially listed species at risk that live on the Greenbelt is loss and fragmentation of habitat (David Suzuki Foundation & Ontario Nature, 2011). Many species require intact expanses of forests, but some are still able to survive if corridors of natural spaces are protected and expanded so that species can migrate and fulfill their needs throughout all parts of their lifecycle. To this end, virtually all conservation authorities work extensively to restore forest, meadow, and aquatic habitat, engage landowners through education programs and planting programs to restore private land, and engage youth through education and volunteer experiences. Credit Valley Conservation has planted nearly 6 million trees in their history. (CVC Foundation, 2017) Many other organizations, community groups, and private landowners (myself included) also work hard to expand and improve local ecosystems. Schedule 10 and the Planning Tool will completely undermine and will likely undo many of the improvements made in local ecosystems by removing pockets of habitat and increasing fragmentation. The ecological restoration work benefits humans too by improving water quality, absorbing excess rainfall, and reducing temperatures. For mental and physical health, people need access to nature. Irresponsible development will push natural spaces farther away from the communities that need them most. Already there are high school students who think the few trees near the school fence or along a local creek are a forest.
If there exists an opportunity to take shortcuts and profit whatever the cost to the environment, too many people will not hesitate for a moment and Southern Ontario will return to a low density sprawl model that is clearly flawed. Municipal Councils and the Province itself are already under tremendous pressure from developers and speculators to open protected land, even without Schedule 10 and the associated Planning Tool. In the 2017 Greenbelt review process, there were over 650 requests to remove land from protection, totaling a land area of almost 11,000 Ha. (Greenbelt Alliance) (interactive map at https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1PbYE-LkNpKxDQwlrw_yNu3E8KM&ll… ). Fortunately, the province refused these requests. Schedule 10 and the Planning Tool will remove this level of due process and allow development to occur in a haphazard and sprawling manner. Although many municipalities have already stated their opposition, the existence of such an easy route to development will eventually, or very quickly, lead to intense lobbying that some councils will succumb to. Development approvals with no opportunities for comment and no opportunities to appeal remove democratic citizen engagement. The jobs that these sites are required to provide will not be accessible to people without cars because they will be beyond the reach of town and city transit systems. Transit becomes efficient and cost effective for municipalities and a viable option for commuters when densities are high enough to justify frequent service. If commuters can live close to their workplace in complete communities, they may also be able to commute by bicycle and cycling infrastructure can effectively be incorporated into city design. In a time when the region has been trying to focus on improving transit and encouraging active transportation to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, a mechanism to encourage sprawl is catastrophic.

This is a wide sweeping Bill that is trying to be pushed through quietly and quickly.  There is so much to comment on.

It doesn't serve it's purpose, nor is it necessary. It puts children and elderly at risk. It is a setback on environmental regulations. It is an attack on worker's rights.

The most dangerous part of the Bill is that it removes protections in the Clean Water Act.  This puts our health and our lives in danger. The Clean Water Act was established after thousands of people got sick and seven people lost their lives in Walkerton. Protective measures are needed to ensure we have safe drinking water and prevent further tragedies.
As someone who cares about the environment, I am appalled at the risk of losing significant green spaces such as the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine, and Lake Simcoe lands that are directly mentioned as being opened for development. These lands are necessary to help naturally filter our drinking water and have valuable farmlands that give us food security.
Not having to use unionized workers on public sites and requiring workers to work significant amounts of overtime without overtime pay is rolling back worker's rights and is simply not right.
Increasing the ratios of childcare and changing long term care puts children and seniors at risk.

20249,/comment/20249,"My comments concern Schedule 10 of the proposed Bill 66, “Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act”.  I am writing as a professional working in the field of land use planning and environmental consulting, and I submit these comments with this experience and knowledge in mind.
As written, Schedule 10 significantly changes the land use planning process in Ontario, often in ways that seem designed to limit public participation in the planning process.  I understand that the “open-for business planning by-law” (OFBPBL) is designed to allow municipalities to act quickly in the interest of attracting new businesses and potential employers to an area.  Given that there can be significant costs to municipal taxpayers in servicing employment lands that are not adjacent to existing communities, and given the broad suite of provincial policy, legislation, and regulation that this OFBPBL allows municipalities to disregard, it seems like there is ample justification for public consultation around these important decisions.
What does the Province see as the justification for not requiring public consultation, or even notification, around the decision of a town or city to request approval of an OFBPBL from the Province? Does the Province believe that public input into the OFBPBL request itself constitutes “red tape”?  The OFBPBL, as conceived, is a powerful legal instrument, and municipalities should absolutely be required to notify the public when considering its use.
Furthermore, the problem that the OFBPBL was intended to address, namely that municipalities require access to additional employment lands beyond the existing supply, seems to have no factual basis.  This is underscored by a 2017 report by the reputable Neptis Foundation (see supporting links), who found that over 125,000 hectares of land were available to accommodate housing and employment in the Province to and beyond 2031, the large majority of this supply being lands already designated as greenfield.  I have also not seen any evidence that the Province consulted municipal governments in a meaningful way about the specific burdensome requirements that they might hope to rectify within the current planning legislation framework.
What, then, is the explanation for the major revisions to the Planning Act proposed under Bill 66? Could it be that development interests would like to capitalize on land holdings outside designated greenfield lands that cannot be developed under the existing legislative framework? The perception among everyone who has taken the time familiarize themselves with Schedule 10 is that the Ford government is catering to development interests to a degree that is unprecedented in this Province and, frankly, embarrassing in its brash transparency.
While the Province might hope that the expedited creation of employment lands in this manner would lead to more prosperity for Ontarians, the risks inherent to use of the proposed OFBPBL are immense.  Haphazard development of the Greenbelt and rural communities would lead to greatly increased costs to municipal taxpayers in the form of servicing and transportation infrastructure.  Furthermore, the creation of an avenue for municipalities to ignore carefully prepared plans to protect drinking water seems especially ill-considered in light of the Walkerton Tragedy, and also considering the extremely mild restrictions on land use activities (where and what) embodied in the source water protection plans.  Finally, there are the myriad legal issues that a municipality may face in seeking to use an OFBPBL while maintaining conformity with the existing planning framework, as identified in a recent legal analysis by the Canadian Environmental Law Association (see supporting links).  There is real potential that this mode of opening new lands for employment leads to increased confusion, and associated cost and time in finding a solution through litigation. The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Plan were not only designed to help conserve natural heritage in the Province, but also to provide clarity and a common understanding to all parties, thus facilitating the development process in this area.
Recommendation: If the Province sincerely wishes to help municipalities restore competitiveness by attracting new employment, they would do well to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, in its entirety, and seek a longer and more meaningful consultation with municipalities and the general public.  The instrument of the OFBPBL is extremely blunt and ill-considered. This government may not be able to anticipate all of the consequences such an approach would lead to, and would be better off seeking to change or modify the underlying acts to address perceived challenges than simply creating a route to by-pass so many important pieces of legislation, which is liable to increase confusion among developers, municipalities, and regulatory bodies, and the corresponding potential for drawn-out litigation.
I ask that the Province live up to Doug Ford’s promise made during the 2018 election that the Greenbelt will not be “open for development”. This government should not tarnish the Ontario PC party’s vision and legacy in creating the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act.  Bill 66 is an extremely important issue to me, my community, and my professional associations, and we will be watching this issue closely as the Province considers the feedback received and brings the bill up for a vote in the legislature.

20250,/comment/20250,"To Whom It May Concern,
I have a twenty-five year career in Sustainable Tourism Development in the UK and Ontario (including working for the Provincial Government).  The proposed changes to the Bill 66 - in particular planning regulations, development, etc. - are not in the interest for the Province and its citizens.  Indeed, the proposed changes are quite short-term and focus primarily on economic (i.e., job creation) in the areas of manufacturing and research/innovation and do not take into account environmental and socio-cultural considerations.  It is short-sighted and irreversibly harmful to relax planning regulations that allow for existing green spaces (e.g., the Green Belt) and new green spaces / agricultural land to be taken away for purposes such as manufacturing, research/innovation and/or new housing.
In reviewing the proposal you are granting municipalities more decision-making power and less public consultation for their respective citizens.  May I remind you that it is the citizens of this Province that pay taxes and seek sustainable tourism development.  In my twenty-five career, it is the process of balancing the concerns of economic, environment, and socio-cultural aspects that create the best outcomes for all concerned.  It may be a lengthly process, but one that has the best buy in and results by all involved.
Ontario receives approximately 100,000 newcomers each year and while they often wish to reside in major centres in Southern Ontario, more incentives could be offered to locate in Northern Ontario and to build homes by infilling in City centres and by re-purposing existing brown fields for manufacturing, industrial parks, and so on.  With the increase in population each year, the pressure for green space both within Cities and throughout the Province will increase and if anything the Provincial Government should not only protect our existing green belt, green spaces and provincial parks but increase the number of the these in the near future.  An opportunity may exist now, if the the Provincial Government has the political will (through its Ministry of Parks and Recreation) to  contact the Girl Guide Association of Ontario to purchase and re-purpose former Girl Guide camp grounds for provincial day-park and overnight use.  Some of the sites have already been sold off to private owners, but there are still some Girl Guide Camps that may be available if the Government chooses to move quickly.  This would be a cost effective way to increase our green space throughout Southern Ontario in particular and in some cases work with local not-for-profit groups and communities to ensure they are well cared for.
Some of our Provincial Parks generate substantial revenue to subsidize other provincial parks and towards General Revenue.  Many of our parks need quite a bit of investment (for example: new garbage facilities, new picnic tables, new washrooms with change facilities) to keep them pristine, and to preserve the beauty and attractiveness that draw citizens and tourists in the first place to use and enjoy.  Some of these parks are located near communities and generate a great deal of economic benefits - both directly and indirectly - for these communities and are nationally and in some cases internationally recognized by visitors.  As a government, you should lead by example, to preserve our green space, to enhance them, and to increase the number of them.  Thank you for your consideration of my comments.

20251,/comment/20251,"Dear Mr. Michael Helfinger,
I am writing to provide comments on Bill 66 for the Ministry's consideration, specifically with regards to Schedules 3, 5 and 10.
Schedule 3: Ministry of Education
While I appreciate the government's efforts to increase access to affordable child care, safe, quality and attentive care also need to be a priority in order to prevent the tragic daycare deaths that have happened in the past. Increasing the limit of children in home-based child care settings must be accompanied by strengthened government programs and stronger oversight to provide adequate training to child care providers, and licensing and inspection of child care settings.
Schedule 5: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks
I humbly ask the government to reconsider the proposal to completely repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 and associated regulations by 2021. While the government cites the science-based Federal Chemicals Management Plan as a robust mechanism to manage toxic chemicals, it should not replace the need for toxic substance reduction plans to be developed by owners/operators of certain industrial facilities in Ontario. Polluters must be held accountable for preventing pollution and protecting public health and safety by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances in their facilities. By eliminating the Toxics Reduction Act, the Government of Ontario is peeling back the multi-layered protection against toxic substances in Ontario, and forfeiting important provincial oversight of the use of toxic substances, for which the Province could be held liable.
Schedule 10: Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing
Again, I humbly request the government to reconsider the proposal to introduce a new municipal tool that would allow municipalities to pass an open-for-business planning by law without the need to: be consistent with the PPS, conform with Provincial Plans (including the Greenbelt Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, etc.), conform with municipal Official Plans, consult with the public, adjudicate disputes through the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, conform with significant threat policies identified under the Clean Water Act, among other provincial requirements. These provincial policies and plans play an essential role in protecting our quality of life and a clean and healthy environment in Ontario. A single test of meeting minimum job creation thresholds should not replace the need to conform/be consistent with the array of essential policies and plans listed above. Furthermore, municipalities have/are in the process of identifying employment lands through a municipal comprehensive review, to identify appropriate locations for current and future employment uses. An expedited approvals process for approving business development is unnecessary if these business were to be located in identified employment lands. While the respect for local municipal flexibility and autonomy is appreciated, the Province must also ensure that municipalities do not abuse their planning powers provided through the Province. The significant policies and plans that municipalities are able to by-pass through the proposed open-for-business planning tool is a disaster waiting to happen.
Thank you for your consideration.

20255,/comment/20255,"I commend Ontario Govetnment for taking step forward to the-evaluate the existing land use policy. It is obvious that the exuding planning act and zoning mechanisms are not effective. The rights to decide on the land use should go to the municipalities and to local communities. The practice where non local people are working in making decision for communities should stop. The existing practice supports development of sub-division, that are ruining environment, without long term vision or actual environmental planning in mind.

20256,/comment/20256,"I am opposed to many of the cuts in services that are being proposed though Bill 66. Regulation provides important protections for society and should not be abandoned to make it easier for business. Business makes quite enough profit as it is and don't need the encouragement that is being offered here. Rather business should be taxed more and those revenues should be used to provide value to the general population. So many people are struggling in Ontario. Giving greater handouts to business will not help those people.  These proposed and destructive policies will damage the lives of people and the environment. The benefits that business receives will not 'trickle down' to those people who need help the most. These are failed policies, that will hurt 'the people'.

20258,/comment/20258,"Protect the Greenbelt! Please protect the Greenbelt to ensure the well-being of people and wildlife as you promised during your election campaign!  The future of Ontario’s Greenbelt is currently at risk with the introduction of Bill 66.  This Bill could expedite development of environmentally sensitive lands and negatively affect the Oak Ridges Moraine Trail as well as planning policies such as the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act.
Ontario’s Greenbelt covers an area of approximately 1.8 million acres surrounding the Golden Horseshoe from Niagara Falls, north to Tobermory, and east to Rice Lake.  It provides protection to wetlands, forests and farmland and its inception was a result of mitigating the negative effects of ever-increasing urban sprawl.  The Greenbelt has been recognized internationally as an exemplary example of land-use planning.
The benefits of the Greenbelt for the residents of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are numerous.  This natural infrastructure contributes to the health and wellbeing of people and wildlife, a prosperous economy, local food, tourism, recreational opportunities, proper land-use planning and natural capital benefits.  For example, it is estimated that the economic benefit of the Greenbelt exceeds approximately $9 billion annually throughout the Province in direct, indirect and induced impacts.  The Greenbelt ensures the protection of fertile farmland and our natural heritage and provides ecosystem services such as clean air and water, climate change and stormwater mitigation, carbon sequestration, reduced strain on city infrastructure, and habitat for birds, turtles and species at risk.  It helps sustain biodiversity and our quality of life.
Please leave the Greenbelt intact!  Low density sprawl creates more gridlock, long commute times, more municipal roads, sewer and water pipes to maintain. Taxes are also lower in denser cities where services such as transit are more affordable and cost justified.  Affordable housing is also more achievable.  Once the Greenbelt is paved, the damage is irreparable and our quality of life will be jeopardized for generations to come!
Thank you.

20259,/comment/20259,"In the last decade I have lived in both Hamilton and Sudbury, two cities supported by industrial complexes that helped Ontario to thrive economically and provided sustainable jobs for the community. Both communities continue to grapple with what it means to be a sustainable industrial city, one that supports business while also protecting the biodiversity, drinking water, and quality of life for their citizens. Sudbury's legacy in particular is a stark warning of what can happen when the economic viability of an industry takes precedence over the protection of air, lakes, lands, and human health. We were once a beacon of pollution; barren, black, and devoid of vegetation, and it was only through collaborative intervention by municipal stakeholders and provincial emissions regulators that Sudbury's environmental prospects began to turn around. We're still grappling with the environmental impacts of our predecessors, I don't want this to be the same legacy that we leave for future Ontarians. This legislation undermines what we've learned from the Sudbury experience; that regulations to protect drinking water, wildlife, greenspace and human health are integral to making a community ""livable"". Sudbury would not attract and retain families and a talented workforce if provincial regulation hadn't made sure that the city was worth living in.
I am in opposition to policies that undermine and circumvent the critical protections that Ontarians depend upon for healthy communities, such as the Planning Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Clean Water Act and more. It is critical that bylaws that intersect with these protections are visible to the public, open for public appeal, and need to fall in line with provincial and municipal official plans. I do not support legislation that directly undermines the safety, health, and environmental quality of the province that I call home.

20260,/comment/20260,"As a mother, teacher and citizen I am opposed to bill 66, especially in the following postulates:
- allowing businesses to by-pass or get easier approval for environmental related laws and by-laws if jobs are created. No jobs now can make up for polluted land, air and/or water for our kids. I use to live in the Green Belt and I still live very close to it. I try to buy local produce and want the farm land to remain farm land and forests remain forests. If anything, we need more of both, not less, to feed growing population locally and to provide many places for people to enjoy outdoors.
- I am against the process that overrides public consultation. Anything of this scale, that dismantles protections to other environment, absolutely must go through public consultation. If a particular community decides that healthy environment for their children matters less than jobs created now, that is alright, but that is community deciding, not government deciding for them.

20263,/comment/20263,"The MMAH/Planning Act Changes proposed in Bill 66 are regressive and endanger not only human and environmental health but also the long-term health of our economy. I do not understand how the government can say they are “For The People” when this bill would allow for secret meetings and decisions and would negate so many critical rules and acts. What happened to Doug Ford’s promise to not touch the Greenbelt?
Bill 66 promotes sprawl — the antithesis of good planning. It puts our few remaining natural spaces and our ever-shrinking foodlands in jeopardy. As well, it will wipe out all the invaluable green infrastructure benefits that these lands provide.
Congestion in the GTA is already worse than any other area in North America. Adding transit-unfriendly sprawl will make congestion even more unbearable and will kill economic growth.
Bill 66 bypasses the sound environmental protection and human health Acts that were put in place for a reason. Due to actions taken by a previous PC government Ontario citizens died because their right to clean drinking water was compromised. We need the Clean Water Act. Your government must be aware that 40 million people depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. You cannot allow The Great Lakes Protection Act to be bypassed. Seven municipalities get their drinking water from Lake Simcoe, a lake that generates over $200 million per year in the local economy, 80% of which is connected to ice fishing. Drinking water, local biodiversity and recreational and commercial fishing in Lake Simcoe must be protected.
The Planning Act, Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act and The Places to Grow Act, among others that could be impacted by this Bill, are all essential to the well-being and long-term prosperity of this Province. Governments must act with long-term benefits of all in mind, not the short-term benefits of developers.
This Bill isn’t even needed for the purpose that’s proposed. More than 125,000 hectares of developable land currently exists within urban boundaries as the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the Neptis Foundation have proved. Not only is green field land available within current urban boundaries but there are thousands of hectares of abandoned industrial lands and low-rise sprawl along main urban transportation corridors desperately in need of redevelopment.
This Bill needs to be withdrawn.

Toxics Reduction protects people from being poisoned, and our environment from being harmed.  We're at a critical point in regards to climate change and need to immediately take steps to reduce our impact, not remove regulations so that industries can make more money at the cost of our planet.  Reduced reporting and testing regulations are what led to the e. coli outbreak in romaine lettuce in the U.S.  Why is Ontario heading down this same path?

I am concerned about the potential for Schedule 10 to undermine the gains that have been made in local planning. Specifically, please ensure that the wording is such that agricultural and heritage lands are protected as strongly as possible. The pressure particularly of residential development continues without an economic model that provides for the provision of funding for services required or as downloads add to local costs.
Before you continue with this Bill, please have the Budget Office review the impacts of development. We have seen growth and recently a boom in the housing market without an adequate boom in the provision of funding for services such as Public Health, Long Term Care, or even more direct Provincial responsibilities such as Health care as in Mental health or funding to deal with homelessness.
Agriculture has been an industry that has grown while others such as the auto industry have declined. To weaken protection for agricultural land would be a mistake that will be difficult to repair.

20271,/comment/20271,"Although the intent of this bill is to increase jobs and Ontario’s competitiveness, I believe the repercussions will have negative effects in many areas, especially the environment.
Bill 66 proposes the addition of section 34.1 of the Planning Act which will allow municipalities to pass open-for-business planning by-laws that would authorize and allow for the use of land for “prescribed purposes.” This will essentially give municipal councils bias discretion when it comes to determining which policies and protections they chose to implement. This also means that developments can take place through the process of streamline zoning approvals, which will effectively exempt them from compliance with legislation and planning documents. Some of this legislation includes the Clean Water act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, and the Greenbelt Plan. I find this to be very concerning because it shows little regard for the protection of the environment, and a complete disregard for quality of life (human and animal) in exchange for a short-sighted small benefit the economy. Ontario business is already booming. While voluntary compliance is possible and municipalities should do what is in the best interest of their local area, there is no reason why this should be done with no public consultation and/or no option for appeal. What are you trying to hide? This schedule for the Municipal Planning Act alone would move us backwards in terms of transparency and environmental protections. This needs to be amended to include public consultation and an appeal process. This will maintain trust in the government and some important developments could still get approval.
Source water protection is the first barrier to ensure clean and safe drinking water for Ontario’s citizens. These open-for-business by-laws will take precedence over critical legislation like the Clean Water Act which protects our drinking water. One of the most critical locations for the recharge of groundwater is the Oak Ridges Moraine. The creation of Algonquin Park in the 1860s was to protect this headwater which is the source of water for many municipalities. A long-term vision that can ensure public health and clean drinking water.
Urban sprawl and the destruction of our prime agricultural land needed to be halted, so the Greenbelt Plan and Places to Grow Acts were passed in 2005. This land needs to be protected in perpetuity. We need to repurpose our urban spaces and stop the unsustainable practice of commuting and subdivisions. The shift in the energy economy depends of more centralized residential and commercial spaces. We can encourage development, but not in these limited protected spaces.
Bill 66 is pushing to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act and all associated regulations by the year 2021. While Part 5 of the Environmental Protection Act manages toxic substances, it does not mandate that companies have reduction plans or report their use of substances to the public. I understand reducing redundancies to save money, but we need to compare apples to apples. Some of the regulations may be able to be discontinued, but a full repeal is not in the best interest of Ontarians. The far reaching and long-term impacts of toxics will affect our resource base and sooner than later cause a negative impact on our economy – yes, our economy.
I believe that Bill 66 will have some very serious ramifications regarding the health of the environment, and it will destroy a lot of the progress we’ve made as Ontarians. We need to move forward. Be patient, we can still improve competitiveness in a controlled way instead of giving in to big business lobby. We all need to be thinking sustainably or we are ALL in trouble.

20272,/comment/20272,"I do not support your proposal for Bill 66.
It is disturbing to me that the Ontario government under Doug Ford would try dismember the Acts that were put in place to protect the human health of our communities and ensure that the water we drink is safe and the environment is protected for our and future generations.
Section 5 comment:
I do not support your proposal to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act. This Act was put in place so industrial facilities which use toxic chemicals in their processes would be pressured to swap them out for less toxic alternatives. This is very important to me as a resident of Hamilton. Toxic chemical emitters like the steel industry and chemical industries should be kept in check by provincial government and its Ministry of Environment because without it they will do nothing for the health of the surrounding community, being private companies, to them only the bottom line matters. It is only because of the Toxics Reduction Act, Ministry orders and pressure from the community that the Hamilton airshed is getting better with time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still the worst airshed in Ontario but we’re seeing slow improvements in our community. Doug Ford, you are taking away the people’s right to clean air and water. Come and visit the industrial area in Hamilton where the two steel mills and supporting industries sit. This is how things were done 100 years ago, where industrial growth trumped human health and the environment. We don't want these situations for other communities. The impacts to the Hamilton and Burlington has been high with increased cancer rates and toxic waste in our bay.
Section 10 comment:
Your proposal for “Open-for-business by-laws” is unnecessary and redundant. There is no “red tape” which is stopping businesses from opening up shop in Ontario. Every city has designated areas for industry and plans for growth. There is no need from the province to meddle in city affairs when it comes to city planning. The biggest problem I see in your proposal for Section 10 is the huge environmental impacts it will have on our human population and wildlife. The Clean Water Act was put in place for a reason. Do you think having another Walkerton crisis is a good idea? Your so called “red tape” protects human lives by ensuring we have clean, safe water sources in Ontario and vulnerable ares in our beautiful province are protected. Keep your hands off our Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act and the Clean Water Act. The only “red tape” you’re removing is the obstacles for your Developer buddies who want to build on prime farmland and download the costs onto the cities. We know you wanted to open up the Greenbelt for them and backed off with the public outcry. Don’t think we, the people, don’t see what you’re doing.
This proposal undermines efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Your “Open for business by-laws” would override existing Provincial Policy Statements under the Planning Act that support active transportation, green infrastructure, affordable housing and climate resiliency. That is just irresponsible and wrong.
What I find even more alarming is that this proposal for Bill 66 would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to currant legal requirements your “open-for-business by-laws” could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors. This would leave communities without recourse. This would take away the voice of those living in Ontario communities. There would be no appeal options left for us. We live in our cities and should have a say in what is proposed because not all elected officials represent the whole constituency.
Section 3 comment:
Removing restrictions on home-based child care providers could endanger the lives of children. Yes, it will open up more child-care spaces but at what cost? Children, especially very small children should be given constant attention and care, how will you ensure that the person taking care of 6 children can handle them all and ensure their safety?
Overall, this bill will do more harm than good for Ontarians. It would lead us in the wrong direction. Don’t download important matters of human health and protection onto the cities, they are overwhelmed as is.

FOCA is the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Associations, a member-based organization representing over 500 local community groups across rural Ontario. Waterfront property owners represent one of the single largest rural constituencies – over 250,000 families, located in hundreds of Ontario municipalities and who collectively own and steward 15,000 kilometers of the Provinces shorelines, and over 50,000 hectares of economically and environmentally important lands.
FOCA’s mission is To protect thriving and sustainable waterfronts across Ontario.
FOCA has province-wide interests founded on thriving communities and healthy natural environments that sustain them. We help to achieve this through our education and promotion of best practices, informed individual actions, and by providing leadership on sound public policy.
A number of fundamental strategies to deliver affordability and sustainability include land use planning that considers the myriad community needs along with consideration for impacts that will degrade our ability to thrive and prosper in the future. Protecting vital resources and especially our water is non-negotiable; reducing the threats to drinking water has been a necessary and positive step in the right direction, currently secured through the provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and other provincial statutes.
As a primarily rural constituency, we appreciate the challenges confronting smaller communities, the economic pressures they face, and also the stretched resources they have available to provide the information upon which to make decisions.  As creatures of the Province, they benefit from clear and principled policy direction. The proposed open for business planning bylaw could precipitate a “race to the bottom” and will put significant pressure on competing municipal councils to attract jobs and allow development in areas that would normally be protected by provincial legislation.
Protecting all of our water sources (lake, river, ground) is essential to healthy communities and families. Strongly affirming that Ontario’s health is not for sale and therefore our water cannot be compromised for the sake of other interests, is appropriate and a long-term strategy for success. 
Key to achieving this is a shared and common knowledge that we have both individual and collective responsibilities to the stewardship of these resources. The CWA has been a step forward to systematically identify risks to our primary drinking water sources and employed a robust and very public process to reduce these threats.
FOCA has long held the belief that the types of risk mitigation delivered through the CWA and Source Protection Plans was a solid first step, and has the potential to further protect all of our waters if applied more broadly.
Bill 66 seeks to undermine the primacy of the protection in these CWA policies, and we feel this is an unacceptable breach of both science-based policy protocols, and the public trust.
We implore the Province to reconsider the language and intent of this Bill and especially the provisions in Schedule 10 that specify the open-for-business planning bylaws do not have to comply with established and important environmental protections and land use controls.
We are concerned that the proposed Open for Business approach exempts lands from the Provincial Policy Statement, The Great Lakes Protection Act, the Growth Plan, Greenbelt Act, Oak Ridges Moraine protections, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, and similar initiatives.
Collectively, these Acts and initiatives are vital to how the planning framework identifies and protects natural heritage and therefore our air, water, and biodiversity; community resilience from erosion and flooding, and ultimately, human health.
Exemptions from the provisions in the Provincial Policy Statement and similar protective measures is a threat to public health and safety, could degrade terrestrial and aquatic natural heritage, biodiversity, and ultimately, both Ontario’s social wellbeing and its economic vitality.
Our planning system will be compromised by allowing the passing of bylaws that do not conform with Provincial policy, and circumvent the normal process of good planning which would include proper public scrutiny.
We hope that these comments are useful and will help you to amend your proposed Bill so we don’t repeat the mistakes that lead to the Walkerton tragedy in 2000, and so as not to further degrade our natural heritage, waters and vital biodiversity.

On behalf of the City of Vaughan, I am pleased to submit the City’s comments on the provincial government’s draft Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018, identified as ERO number 013-4293. The City recognizes the Act is at first reading and we appreciate the opportunity to provide our comments.
The City supports promoting responsible economic development through the streamlining of the development review process to find efficiencies. The City is strongly committed to sustainability and balanced decision making to create vibrant communities, a strong economy and a healthy environment.
On January 17, 2019, the City held a Special Committee of the Whole Working Session to discuss this legislation. We heard directly from thoughtful and engaged citizens who shared their ideas on how this bill could potentially impact Vaughan’s future. Enclosed are the comments of individuals who made deputations. The entire meeting can be viewed online at vaughan.ca. Council has actively encouraged citizens to make submissions individually to the Ontario government reflecting their opinions on this matter.
During this well-attended community meeting of more than 100 concerned citizens, Council discussed the City’s response to the Province’s request for input, which includes policy analysis that impacts the land-use planning process, economic development, intergovernmental relations and environmental sustainability, among other city-building issues. Please find enclosed the staff report which provides further information.
Council unanimously approved a motion, which is attached to this letter, that made clear that the City does not support Bill 66 in its present form. Further engagement is needed on the draft legislation including the need for more time to allow the City to respond. Council and our community believes there is a great need to continue to protect the Oak Ridges Moraine and the lands in the Greenbelt, that public consultation be maintained under the proposed legislation, and to ensure any legislation adheres to the Clean Water Act and Vaughan’s Official Plan.
Council remains committed to ensuring we safeguard the health and well-being of our local environment for current and future generations. Vaughan is a green city with a record of sustainability and stewardship. The environment is at the heart of our city-building efforts.
The City of Vaughan will continue its efforts to work with all governments and the business community to strengthen the local economy in a responsible way for our rapidly growing, world-class city.

Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

Coyote encounters are up and we have no one to blame but ourselves. We are ruining our air and water for the sake of money. The green belt is already too small. We are sentencing ourselves and future generation into a health crisis and premature death. Do you want Ontario to be “open for business”?

20294,/comment/20294,"Good afternoon,
I am writing to voice my concerns about Bill 66 and its potential impact on my community. First of all, I believe that repealing the Toxin Reduction Act is a dangerous step that could result in increased exposure to harmful substances. The Bill 66 posting on the ERO website claims that the TRA is redundant under the federal Chemical Management Plan, however, this is not the case. The CMP does not deal with pollution prevention, as it does not mandate the development of plans for reduced use of toxic substances. The CMP only deals with a few of the toxic substances covered by the TRA. The TRA requires companies to plan to use less of the toxic substances that the CMP allows to remain in circulation. Additionally, the TRA is modeled on legislation that has been demonstrated to successfully reduce the use and creation of toxic substances in the United States. As such, the TRA is an important piece of legislation that encourages companies to reduce the quantity of harmful substances released into the environment.
Secondly, I am concerned that the ""Open for Business"" by-law will threaten our environment and cultural heritage while reducing transparency and opportunities for public consultation on developments. Namely, the ""Open for Business"" by law would allow development to occur in areas designated for source water protection with complete disregard for the effects of this development on water quality. This reckless action threatens our drinking water supply. It further threatens woodland, wetland, and species at risk habitat in Southern Ontario by circumventing the protection policies laid out for these environments in the Planning Act. Finally, this by-law could be enacted without any form of public consultation. This has the potential to seriously damage communities by ignoring the needs and priorities of those that live there.
Overall, as a young person hoping to live, work, and start a family in Ontario one day, I am discouraged by the total disregard the Government has for the protection of the natural lands and vibrant communities that make this province a great place to live.

Developers should not be allowed to bypass the 2005 Green Belt Act Act (which protects 2 million acres of farms, natural areas and water sources), the the 2001 Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the 2006 Clean Water Act (which is in place to prevent tragedies such as the E. coli outbreak in Walkerton), the 2015 Great Lakes Protection Act, and the 2008 Lake Simcoe Protection Act.

20303,/comment/20303,"Bill 66 - An Act to restore Ontario's competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts - is an astonishingly undemocratic piece of proposed legislation that further demonstrates the current Ontario Government's' full-on attack on the environment. This proposed means of dealing with what the Government describes as ""red tape"" is reckless, even ominous. It further illustrates the current Government's unwillingness to seriously address the need for environmental & climate controls, or land use and existing potable water threat issues, and provides proof that the people of Ontario are not Mr. Ford's primary concern. This Act speaks to poor governance and partisan politics - not the health and well-being of current and future generations of Ontario residents.
Schedule 10 of this Bill - the proposed Open-for-Business Planning By-Law - offers a Municipality the option to enact a planning by-law without public consultation or approval, & undermines the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes protection Act, the Greenbelt Act, & the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act among other legislation that set vital legal requirements to safeguard land and water in Ontario.
Further, it threatens farm lands, wetlands, & woodlands across the province by making it possible for a Municipality to avoid protections detailed in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, for examples, as well as the Provincial Policy Statement included under the Planning Act.
Bill 66 is disingenuous. Ontario has always been open for business. We live in a Province where job numbers have been growing since before the current Government assumed power and unemployment statistics have remained low. This proposed Bill 66 is all-about uncontrolled urban development, industrial bias, and the wanton destruction of legislation created to provide protections for citizens of Ontario. It threatens people's health, wildlife existence and well-being - through the repeal of the Toxic Reductions Act, for example, and leaves residents of the Province without recourse to question or appeal. This is dangerous and, if Bill 66 is enacted, will prove both economically and politically costly given existing environmental and potable water threats facing residents in Ontario.
We live in a democratic Province in a wonderful Country and tumultuous world that requires sure-handed, informed and proactive leadership in any and all matters that may negatively impact citizens, including climate change, environmental challenges, threats to potable water supply and quality, and agricultural land security. De-regulation will accomplish nothing good.

20315,/comment/20315,"This comment is with respect to Schedule 5 of the proposed Bill 66, to cancel the Toxic Reductions Act.
Introduction
I do not agree with the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (“MECP”) that the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 (“TRA”) duplicates requirements under federal law on control of toxic substances -namely the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (“CEPA”)] -  and, therefore, do not agree with the MECP argument that repealing the TRA will reduce a burden on industry from having to comply with duplicate programs.
Ontario has also previously identified many toxic substances in Ontario not covered by federal requirements that if they are still present in the province could benefit from application of the TRA.
Background
I live in Hamilton, which is a city with a heavy industrial core and an extensive base of manufacturing facilities.   Members of the community have worked for many years to see these facilities make improvements to reduce their emissions to air, land and water.   This has included pushing for greater openness and transparency so that Hamiltonians living in neighbourhoods near the industrial core have information about what their industrial neighbours are doing, what risks and challenges are associated with these activities and, most importantly, what efforts are underway at these facilities to minimize and ideally eliminate any environmental impacts from these operations.  Ontario’s Toxics Reduction Act and associated regulations represents an important piece in the on-going effort to increase openness and transparency and realize progress in reducing and/or eliminating the use and release of harmful substances from industry wherever possible
Comment on Bill 66 Proposal
The MECP proposals are based on the assumptions that: (1) the TRA and its planning and reporting requirements are duplicative of federal requirements; and (2) eliminating the TRA and its requirements will save industry money but still result in protecting human health and the environment. The assumptions are not correct. The concept at the heart of TRA of mandatory preparation, but voluntary implementation, of toxics reduction plans has a record of demonstrated success in jurisdictions such as Massachusetts that have had such a law in place for approximately three decades. The TRA has only really been fully in effect since 2013. There is no reason, and more importantly, no evidence, to assume it cannot work in Ontario given time and dedication.
The purpose of the TRA is to prevent pollution and protect human health and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and informing Ontarians about toxic substances. Pre-TRA legislation in Ontario (e.g. EPA, OWRA) focused on, and continues to focus on, pollution abatement, not pollution prevention. This problem explains why Ontario’s emissions of toxic substances to air, land, and water are some of the highest in North America.
There are several limitations under CEPA. The reporting requirements pursuant to notices issued under s. 46 of CEPA that result in the NPRI, address the obligation on companies to report on the release, but not the use, of toxic substances. Accordingly, a focus on the use (and creation) of toxic substances, as is the case with TRA, represents new, not duplicate, legal authority in Ontario. As the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario has observed: “While the existing federal NPRI program focusses on gathering and publishing information on industrial emissions…the driving intent of the TRA is toxics reduction”.
The planning and reporting requirements of TRA are the heart of the statute and how it fills the gaps in the inadequacies of federal law (CEPA). By eliminating the TRA and its unique requirements, MECP jeopardizes both the human health and environmental protections of the statute as well as its potential economic benefits to industry in identifying where reductions in the use and creation of toxic substances may be possible
Conclusion
The TRA needs to be improved, not abandoned and the need for these improvements dwarfs any concern with alleged “red tape” under the program.

I wish to express my deep concern over the proposed Bill 66.  This piece of legislation puts our environment at risk.  Only recently the Greenbelt went through an evaluation process, and overwhelmingly Ontarians rejected the idea of developement in this precious area.  In fact, they wanted even more land protected from the relentless onslaught of development.  Bill 66 is a threat to more than the Greenbelt.  It threatens the entire province and puts at risk our drinking water (remember Walkerton), our farmlands, wetlands, woodlands, lakes and rivers and valuable habitat for wildlife and species at risk.  These areas need more protection, not less.
We live on a finite planet, and we must set aside areas where nature and natural habitat are protected now and for the future.  This needs to happen not just in remote areas, but here in Southern Ontario where natural areas are under great pressure and are being destroyed piece-by-piece. Once they are lost, these very valuable areas and the life forms that depend on them will be lost forever.  We will be the poorer for it.

I am concerned that there will be less wildlife. These are currently parks where I can see Great Blue Herons and other specialized species of birds. This act risks removing their habitat and threatening these species. We essentially have pristine greenery to walk through in the GTA thanks to the acts. This has a lot of co-benefits like reducing stress for individuals and providing tourism options for locals and foreigners. It also means that you can get your nature in without having to drive 1-2 hours away from the city. It took a lot of work to have these acts passed. It would be a shame to have them compromised. Passing Schedule 10 as part of Bill 66 will have consequences through less animals and flora for generations to come.
As well, changing these acts to allow for developers to build single-family, detached homes will be a big mistake. It will create more congestion, more stress for individuals, and more environmental contamination. This infrastructure will also be more costly for municipalities to maintain over the long-term.

20350,/comment/20350,"I am writing to express my opposition to the ""Open for business"" planning by-law provision of Bill 66.  While this provision purports to support economic competitiveness, it will not do so.  It's bad economics, even viewed through a mainstream economics lens.  In short, planning provisions are needed to achieve both the right proportions and arrangements of land uses.  The free market, left to its own devices, will not achieve this, due to the fact that the developer purchasing and developing the land does not pay the costs to other land uses (or the public) associated with the land development.  In an unregulated free market (what this bill will allow), conflicting land uses are too close together, and irreversible future costs of development (such as destruction of groundwater resources and productive farmland) are passed on to future generations, who have no ability to participate in current land markets.
Free markets are also characterized by frequent oversupply and contraction cycles, as most market participants respond to profit motives without considering that others will have the same supply response.  The result is oversupply-too much student housing, too many 1 bedroom condos, and too many strip  malls.  ""Open for Business"" will only exacerbate this problem.
This bill will allow planning provisions, which are carefully designed through years of public and professional consultation, to be circumvented.  This may benefit individual developers--but the communities that result will not be attractive to the kind of high-valued industries, such as major tech firms, that Ontario seeks to attract.  Consider that Google headquarters is in high regulated, but amenity-rich California, and their next nodes will NOT be in Texas, but in areas with a high degree of coordination and regulation--including a new node in Toronto.
This bill disenfranchises the many highly educated and informed citizens who participate in collaborative planning.  Within a clear policy environment, such as we now have in place, negotiations between these citizen groups, developers, and municipalities can result in development solutions that are better for all.  A command-and-control, few minds at the table approach is not likely to gain the same success.
Passing Bill 66 and related measures would be short-sighted politically for the current administration.  Efforts to disenfranchise citizens may work not, but come the next election, the current government will not survive.

While we agree that administrative burdens and red-tape may need to be revisited in certain circumstances, we feel that the measures in Bill 66 go too far and undermine the democratic principles of citizen participation. In particular, we are concerned about Schedule 10 amendments to the Planning Act that eliminate the right for consultation or requirement to provide a notice for any hearing prior to passing an “Open for business by law.”
The proposal provisions that would allow for elimination of public consultation violate the established principles of natural justice whose objective is to ensure that every person whose interests are at risk is entitled to participate in an administrative process before a decision is taken.  Taking away the voices of ordinary citizens and taxpayers– may of whom may have voted for the Progressive Conservatives in 2018 – is undemocratic and goes against allowing residents and constituents to have more of a say in what goes on in their communities.
To summarize, we have concerns about the following:
-Short-circuiting the safeguards of the Planning Act, the Official Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement.
-Weakening of health, safety, and environmental protections. E.g. Eliminating the Clean Water Act that was created after the Walkerton Water crisis/tragedy from 2000-2001 where seven citizens died and 2300 became after the town’s water supply was contaminated with E.Coli.
We also believe Bill 66 undermines essential governance principles by:
o          (a) eliminating the requirement for public consultation, especially with respect to larger development proposals
o          (b) eliminating the right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal and from Ministerial decisions
 In conclusion, the RPCA and many others do not believe that the measures proposed in Bill 66  are necessary to improve competitiveness in Ontario.  On the contrary, passage of Bill 66 in its present form will threaten  the quality of life and, undermine the key principles of responsible government of all Ontario residents. Bill 66 should be withdrawn and replaced with legislation that will protect the safety of citizens and respect the principles of administrative fairness that Ontario taxpayers deserve.
Sincerely
Kris Nanda
Immediate Past President, Riverview Park Community Association

20355,/comment/20355,"Environmental studies in Ontario and around the world show that maximizing natural areas, and maximizing species diversity, is the best approach to maintaining an overall healthy environment. That sounds real nice, but it's more than a benign sentiment. It is a key to understanding that we are UTTERLY dependent on our natural environment to sustain our human health. Every time we chip away at it we're reducing the environment's capability to keep us healthy and alive. Future generations are depending on us to do the right thing and not just keep present protections in place, but to expand upon them.
Thank you

20356,/comment/20356,"I unfortunately see a great number of difficulties with this bill, the first of which is that there are far too many and widespread issues being addressed.  Omnibus bills such as this are never good for the public as, while there may well be some good components, there are often others that many will have difficulty with and it's an all-or-nothing proposition.
Changing the way municipalities can process developer applications without public consultation is bad enough, but removing an appeal process is absolutely tyrannical.  Southern Ontario in particular is in jeopardy of losing prime agricultural lands and protected environmental lands.  Those protections were put in place for a reason, and we need to keep agricultural land for its designed purpose - to provide food for the rest of us.  There may come a time we will not be able to rely on international imports, and our local producers must be encouraged to continue to stay in operation.
The remainder of the multitude of changes that the government wishes to endorse and employ may well have their good points - in that instance they deserve the concentrated attention and due diligence they deserve on their own merits, not be lumped together in a huge bill such as this.
Premier Ford, please reconsider this bill - you were elected to change the ways things were done in government, don't replicate the Liberals' tactics of information overload in one piece of legislation.

The fact that this government believes that protecting the environment and maintaining the systems that make Ontario a fair and safe place for everyone involves ""unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date"" shows how out of touch with science and reality they are.
Not all of us want to burn a path through the planet for our own gain while destroying the the world for future generations. Not all of us support the idea that wealthy big business should be able to do whatever they want in the name of creating short term job opportunities. Not all of us are short-sighted, uneducated, corporate suck ups who don't care about anyone but ourselves and getting re-elected.
Some of us understand why regulations and legislative structures have been put in place. Some of us expect our provincial government to do what is best for all in the province not just their rich entitled friends.  Some of us wish that the garbage this government is doing would only affect the fools who voted for them instead of trapping us all in the aftermath.
I have no expectation that this government cares if people oppose their proposals. I have no expectations that this government will actually do what is best for the province. Despite this, I will continue to voice my opposition to these rash and poorly planned changes in the hopes that perhaps, there is a small chance that SOMEONE in the Conservative party has some integrity.

New Regulation under the Planning Act for Open-For-Business Planning Tool
On December 6, 2018 the Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade introduced Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitive Act, 2018. The Bill contains amendments to various Acts, most notably to the Planning Act and related provisions in a number of other Acts.
The proposed Bill 66 amendments to the Planning Act and concepts for an implementing regulation were posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) on December 6, 2018 for a commenting period of 45 days ending January 20, 2019.
Comments provided below have been endorsed by the Credit Valley Conservation (CVC) Board of Directors on January 18, 2019 to be sent directly to the ERO. The Credit Valley Board is also the Credit Valley Source Protection Authority established under the Clean Water Act, 2006.
CVC is one of 36 conservation authorities which are local watershed management agencies, mandated to ensure the conservation, restoration and responsible management of Ontario’s water, land and natural habitats through programs that balance human, environmental and economic needs. Like other conservation authorities, CVC derives its authority from the Conservation Authorities Act and regulates development and interference with wetlands, shorelines and watercourses pursuant to Section 28 of the Act. CVC also provides planning and technical advice to planning authorities to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities regarding natural hazards, natural heritage and other relevant policy areas pursuant to the Planning Act.
The Credit Valley Conservation Authority, under subsection 4(2) or section 5 the Clean Water Act, 2006 is required to exercise and perform the powers and duties of a drinking water source protection authority.
It is within this context, CVC provides the following comments.
1.	A new Section 34.1 of the Planning Act is proposed, which would give new by-law making powers to lower-tier municipalities. Subject to approval by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, municipalities would be able to pass an “Open-for-business planning by-law” (OFB-PBL). These new Section 34.1 by-laws would override existing land use policy and controls contained in the Planning Act and other legislation including Provincial Policy Statements, Provincial Plans, Drinking Water Source Protection Plans, Official Plans, Zoning by-laws and Site Plan Control. Section 34.1 by-laws would be similar to a site-specific zoning by-law in that they would regulate land use and the erection, location or use of buildings or structures for a specific development site and certain conditions to approval could be imposed. Passage of such a by-law may be subject to satisfaction of criteria that may be prescribed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.
2.	As currently drafted, a Section 34.1 by-law could be enacted anywhere in a municipality without regard for any existing land uses, environmental hazards, features, constraints or established land use planning. The only scoping or conditions would be established by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. However, there is no requirement that the minister provide any scoping or conditions. Neither the minister nor the municipality is required to conduct any consultation to determine what might be appropriate scoping or limitations to a Section 34.1 by-law prior to enactment.
3.	Further, Subsection 34.1 (6) of the proposed amendment would exempt a Section 34.1 by-law from every fundamental land use planning requirement that would otherwise be applicable. The following table summarizes the critical land use planning requirements related to CVC’s regulatory and policy interests that are proposed for exemption:
** table format - see PDF submission as it has not translated properly
Proposed Exemptions under Subsection  34.1 Open for Business By-law	CVC response
Subsection 3 (5) of the Planning Act	This section is fundamental to the land use planning system and requires land use and development decisions to be consistent with the PPS and to conform to provincial land use plans.
Section 24 of the Planning Act	Requires public works (roads and servicing infrastructure) and the enactment of by-laws to be undertaken in conformity with a municipal Official Plan (OP).This section gives legal effect to Official Plans and requires that decisions made conform to OPs.
By excluding Section 24, development could occur which does not conform to an Official Plan and in particular does not comply with the OPs environmental policies.
Section 34 (10.0.0.1) to (34) of the Planning Act	This section provides a process that includes pre-consultation, public meetings, notification, appeal rights, etc. to the passing of zoning by-laws.
Responsible for the provincial interest in relation to protecting people and property from natural hazards (flooding and erosion), CAs rely on these provisions to provide the policy and technical input into the passage of zoning by-laws with rights of appeal.
Section 36 of the Planning Act	Provides for holding provisions in zoning by-laws. Holding by-laws are used frequently to ensure that technical matters related to CAs roles are addressed prior to the removal of the “H” (obtaining a permit from CVC prior to the “H” being removed on lands zoned floodplain).
Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, 2006	Gives legal effect to Drinking Water Source Protection plans by requiring planning and development decisions conform to significant drinking water threat policies and requiring that planning and development decisions have regard to any Drinking Water Source Protection Plan.
CVC is a drinking water Source Protection Authority and with TRCA and CLOCA make up the CTC. The CTC Source Protection Plan has Significant Drinking Water Threat policies that apply to land use decisions. The exclusion of Section 39 means that an OFB By-law could approve development that may threaten surface water and groundwater sources used as municipal drinking water systems.
Section 20 of the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2008	Ensures that planning and development decisions conform with Great Lakes protection initiatives. Not requiring a shoreline project to conform to any protection initiatives would mean less environmental protection for the Great Lakes.
Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act, 2005	Requires planning and development decisions made under the Planning Act to conform to the Greenbelt Plan. Excluding Section 7 would allow large scale development in the Protected Countryside which also identifies lands within a Greenbelt Natural Heritage System.
Environmental protection could be compromised if development were permitted by an OFB By-law in the Protected Countryside and/or the Greenbelt Natural Heritage System. Major Employment uses are directed to Settlement Areas where there is a fixed urban boundary yet there is no distinction between Protected Countryside and Settlement boundaries in the Bill.
Section 7 of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001	Section 7 requires planning and development decisions to conform to the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan which provides policies which protect the ecological and hydrological integrity of the moraine.
As with the Greenbelt Plan development is directed to settlement areas in order to protect agricultural lands, hydrologic features and natural heritage systems.
Subsection 14 (1) of the Places to Grow Act, 2005	Section 14 requires a decision under the Planning Act to conform with the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe. As with other provincial plans, the Growth Plan provides for environmental protection and directs development to rural and urban settlement areas.
4.	It is understood that the minister could establish conditions to the approval of a Section 34.1 by-law that might re-establish some of the policy direction contained in the fundamental planning requirements set out in the table above. However, that would be undertaken at the complete discretion of the minister in the absence of any legislated obligation on the minister to consult the public or agencies with technical and site-specific knowledge such as conservation authorities.
5.	Section 34.1, as currently drafted, automatically exempts critical public health and safety provisions related to drinking water source protection, land use policies that direct new development away from flooding and erosion natural hazards, including areas that would be unsafe for people in the event of a natural disaster and basic environmental protections for natural heritage including wetlands, woodlands, valleylands and watercourses. The section is very broad, provides the minister with unchecked discretion, and should be re-drafted to require the minister to apply all relevant health and safety and environmental protection policies, as a condition to any approval of a Section 34.1 by-law.
6.	 Some suggestions to be incorporated in the Bill and/or the associated regulation are:
•	The consideration of use of an OFB-PBL should be geographically limited to existing designated employment lands with access to full municipal sewer and water services and proximity to 400 series highways and/or other major transportation corridors.
•	The province should require consistency with the PPS, Clean Water Act, and area specific plans in the proposed regulation to ensure the CA mandate for protection from natural hazards is implemented through an OFB-PBL application, a process that has been developed over decades of consultation and application of legislation to minimize risk to people, life and property in Ontario.
•	If the recommendation above is not pursued in full, CVC recommends including in the regulation of “prescribed criteria” for an OFB-PBL application, the following minimum requirements to demonstrate that public health and safety issues will be addressed:
o	Remove the Clean Water Act from Schedule 10;
o	Appropriate considerations are incorporated to development and redevelopment decisions, to ensure new natural hazards from flooding and erosion are not created and existing hazards not aggravated, including review and sign off by the local CA prior to Ministerial endorsement;
o	Include requirements that no development or site alterations take place within a 30 metre setback from key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features; and
o	That sites be pre-screened by a municipality, with approval from the local CA, to ensure the development feasibility of the proposal in relation to the physical characteristics of the site, so that public health, safety and natural hazard technical issues can be addressed appropriately on the site to meet provincial standards and that permits can ultimately be issued.
•	Allow for field verification of limits of the Greenbelt applying some criteria to ensure its continued integrity while allowing for boundary modifications that are rational from a land-use planning and environmental perspective.
7.	The province should engage stakeholders, including CA’s, in a consultation process over red tape reduction that would yield ideas and options to improve service delivery and identify legislative impediments to the timely approval of development lands.
In conclusion, CVC does not support Bill 66 as currently drafted and it would appear from an environmental perspective, this Bill to eliminate red tape and burdensome regulations, may not speed up the process and could lead to further environmental degradation that will have long term implications for the province. CVC maintains that there are other mechanisms that can be helpful to the streamlining of approvals that will be easier to implement and may have a greater chance of broad implementation among municipalities.

We ask that this section be removed and exemptions not be offered to business to the essential Acts, regulations and protections for our water, farmland and remaining green space.
Bill 66 is extremely concerning in its approach, wording and intent as well as how rather than trying to fix red tape it simply exempts big business from all regulation.  It is an insult to all Ontarian and in-particular residents of all these communities to stand to be so negatively impacted and who won't even be consulted or received notice of the pending changes since all public engagement, consultation, notice and appeal is removed under this bill.

Destroying the Greenbelt will do irreparable damage. You can build a factory, a subdivision, or a big box store in a matter of months but you cannot recreate the Greenbelt once it is gone.

Developers should not be allowed to bypass the 2005 Green Belt Act Act (which protects 2 million acres of farms, natural areas and water sources), the the 2001 Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the 2006 Clean Water Act (which is in place to prevent tragedies such as the E. coli outbreak in Walkerton), the 2015 Great Lakes Protection Act, and the 2008 Lake Simcoe Protection Act. Furthermore, I do not support removing the 2009 Toxins Reduction Act which protects and informs consumers from harmful toxins. And allowing by-laws to be passed without meeting the legal requirement to ensure fair, consistent, transparent public engagement with land use in communities-- as laid out in Schedule 10 of Bill 66-- is not democracy. This Bill puts our land, water, wildlife, health, and natural heritage at risk, and undermines evidence-based city planning.

20380,/comment/20380,"ERO - 013-4293 - Jan20-19 -- re-- Bill 66 Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act 2018
Bill 66 is a very troubling piece of legislation to me.  If enacted, it could create a situation whereby developers and others could run roughshod over currently protected greenbelt and water resources without having to worry about environmental impacts.
I live in the Grey-Bruce area where drinking water is already an issue for many.   I think of the issues and tragedy that happened a number of years ago in Walkerton, with some of the people there still victims of the problems that transpired without adequate safeguards in place.   I also worry about the many First Nations Peoples in Ontario and elsewhere who are still lacking adequate clean drinking water security and still battling issues of chemicals in fishing grounds from industrial pollution.  These situations are unconscionable in this day and age. I would hate to think that the Ontario government would pass legislation that would send us backward in terms of seeking better water protection and environmental safeguards.
Weakening environmental protection policies will likely negatively impact some endangered species and species at risk.  I think of the problems faced by the endangered Piping Plover at Sauble Beach.  It’s habitat can be wiped out by certain beach raking operations without adequate protection and is currently under attack from those who think only of the Sauble Beach tourism dollars and not take care of our environment.  Laws should be strengthened to protect portions of the Piping Plover’s Beach home from reckless destruction.
With climate change and the need for food and water sustainability we need to strengthen our resolve to protect our environment, our land and our air and our species at risk and endangered from would be polluters and wanton development.
Please stop Bill 66 from being passed into law.
Thank you for your consideration.

20384,/comment/20384,"I wish to express my deep concern with many of the provisions of the ""Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act"" (Bill 66). Ontarians have worked long and hard to implement reasonable regulations to protect their natural and built environments, their health and safety, and the security of their way of life. I believe Bill 66 seriously threatens this! While it may be argued that some regulations create unnecessary red tape, any legislative changes should be specifically targeted to adjust the bureaucratic processes without losing the actual intent of existing laws. The new bill seems to be highly biased toward the desires of a very small elite of speculators and developers, while almost completely eliminating any chance for everyday Ontarians to have input in the planning process. While job growth is important for governments to facilitate, the people of Ontario do not want rampant uncontrolled growth that destroys the values we hold, the natural environment we love and enjoy, the environmental and health and safety protections we rely on, or the democratic processes by which we participate in governing ourselves.
Many of the provisions in the act would permit unilateral, irreversible, and incontestable changes in the fundamental character of Ontario. Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and deregulation of the Clean Waters Act would permit the potential pollution of water and soil resources on which Ontario depends for safe drinking water, safe food production, and clean air on which we all rely. Notwithstanding pressures from agricultural and industrial lobbies who stand to increase short term profitability marginally from looser regulations, the long term effects of remediation or loss of agricultural land for the future, of making our water sources unfit for drinking or irrigation, and of health care expenses for treating environmental illness (e.g. E. coli poisoning in Walkerton, respiratory and cardiac conditions in northeast Hamilton) will all impose future costs on every Ontarian for the short term benefit of a few.
Provisions for overriding major components of the Planning Act and of the Provincial Policy Statement on planning would override years of previous work in municipal planning. This work seeks to guide urban development in ways that not only provide for reasonable growth, but also make towns and cities healthier, more livable and more serviceable. The prevention of urban sprawl will, in the long term, provide major benefits to Ontario and Ontarians, by creating more efficient, less congested, and more environmentally sustainable cities, by preserving the farmland we need in a world of growing food instability and by providing ecological services such as cleaner air, groundwater recharge and healthy recreation opportunities. We absolutely need foresight and strong planning to manage the amount, location, timing, and long term impact of urban growth. Allowing either short-sighted municipal councils or profit-maximizing private speculators to drive the overall planning agenda is a recipe for future unsustainability, especially given the strong likelihood that climate change will exacerbate existing problems of stormwater management, transportation infrastructure, air quality, etc. over the coming decades.
Bill 66 opens too many loopholes through which a small minority of elites may irreversibly degrade the overall lives of a majority of Ontarians for short term greed in the name of job creation. At the very least, it needs the kind of very strong restrictive provisions that would be expected in any government legislation that permits for a small number of elected or non-elected individuals to override existing legislation. It needs far more specific and restricted definition of the character and number of long term, full time jobs that a project would have to create even to qualify for consideration, and it also needs far more requirement for public input into any such proposed overrides.
Bill 66 is a knee jerk reaction guided by a political philosophy of deregulation rather than a well thought out process to improve efficiency. Far more thought and discussion must occur!

20389,/comment/20389,"The Muskoka Lakes Association has deep concerns about many aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competiveness Act 2018 and more specifically with Schedule 10.
The Muskoka Lakes Association was formed in 1894 and is Canada's oldest cottage association.  We represent over 2300 member families to carry out the MLA's mission - to promote the responsible use, enjoyment and conservation of the unique Muskoka environment, a value we all share.  The MLA provides the following comments on the on behalf of our member families.
Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” planning by-laws (OFB-PBL) that would circumvent fundamental protections for drinking water, farmland, natural heritage and human health and safety as set out in Ontario’s key planning laws and policies and in municipal official plans.  Our provincial laws and policies establish a fair and coherent rule set and system of governance that uphold the provincial interest, with needed flexibility provided locally through municipal official plans. In contrast, the outcome of Bill 66 would be a piecemeal, directionless approach to land-use planning and decision-making, leaving communities vulnerable to the whims of changing councils and influential developers.
In Muskoka, the environment IS the economy since millions of people come to Muskoka and invest here because of its clean lakes, rivers, forests and natural character. To emphasize the obvious, 90% of the District’s tax base is dependent on preserving Muskoka’s delicate environment.  Last summer your government acknowledged just that by announcing it was making $5 million investment to ensure the protection of the Muskoka watershed. Schedule 10 is inconsistent with this action.
The MLA has worked with our local municipalities to ensure environmental protections for our recreational lake system are built into their official plans to protect them now and into the future. And yes we have held our local politicians to account when they have elected to favour economy over environment.
Public input on development proposals has been a key means of informing our governing
councillors and planners about the impact of development proposals. We have witnessed this
first-hand on numerous occasions where public input has informed Council in a manner that led them to make a different decision than initially recommended by their planning staff.
them to make a different decision than initially recommended by their planning staff.  The vulnerability of Muskoka is heightened by the fact that “open-for-business” _zoning by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice or meetings and could not be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.   In other words, by-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Compounding the problem, communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
This bill purports to “ Introduce a new economic development tool and remove planning barriers to expedite major business investments and speed up approvals by about two years” and thus the create jobs,  yet nowhere in the act is there a purpose described nor criteria to assess the use of such a by-law  [“A municipality may pass an open-for-business planning by-law only if it has received approval to do so in writing by the Minister and if criteria as may be prescribed are satisfied.” Bill 66].
By any objective standard, the provincial laws, policies or plans excluded by Schedule 10 are neither “red tape” nor “burdensome regulations.” To the contrary, the legislative framework being ousted by Schedule 10 was carefully developed by the province under various governments with considerable input from Ontarians, non-government organizations and other stakeholders in order to safeguard public and private interests throughout Ontario.  Safe drinking water, protection from natural hazards and preservation of the green infrastructure of our province is not “red tape”.   While short-term gains may be realized, long term costs may result for future generations to bear.
So it is time for a grown up conversation about what is working and what is not in the quest to bring employment, if that is the objective, to Ontario. What are the barriers and how can they be streamlined without abrogating laws and planning policies, impacting the environment and eliminating public rights in the process?  What kind of employment are we streamlining for? Retail plazas or good long term jobs?
We know that we can always improve processes if we all work together to determine a better way. That consultation should happen before heavy handed measures are taken. Such streamlining can occur immediately and should policies or laws be identified that need to be modified, they can be targeted rather than eliminated without cause.
We recommend that the government delay any further reading of this bill in favour of a thorough consultative process that involves the province, municipalities, stakeholders and the public providing an opportunity to identify stream lining solutions in support of provincial objectives.
Should the government continue to pursue reading of this bill, Schedule 10 must be deleted.
In summary, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong, progressive government leadership on both sides of the house. “Open-for-business” by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health, safety and resilience of our communities by facilitating development that could ignore environmental safeguards which currently protect Muskoka’s greatest asset - its lakes and shorelines. Ultimately, the result could be irreversible negative longer term implications for Muskoka’s economy and jobs.

20390,/comment/20390,"Hi,
Attached below please find our submission developed collaboratively with dozens of other Ontario Nature Network Groups.
We are all extremely concerned about Bill 66 and want to see this dreadful bill that is so against the interests and welfare of Ontario citizens and so skewed to the benefits of big business profits immediately revoked and cancelled - particularly Section 10.
The Premier ""of the people"" should be ashamed in the way that this bill removes all public engagement, consultation, meetings and notice as well as the ability to appeal any decisions.  Municipal councils in Ontario - particularly small rural councils do not have the best track record of great decision making, are often over-influenced by developers and have faced serious litigation issues from poorly informed decisions that have bypassed due process and public consultation.
Our lake association is very concerned about the impact this bill could have on the environmentally sensitive lands around our lake that are so close to the rapidly growing cities of Waterloo and Kitchener.
While we have confidence in our current councils who knows what future elections could bring.  Bill 66 is simply not in the best interest of Ontarians, our environment and the essential natural resources we all depend on for the long term and needs to be scrapped completely.  Our existing rules and regulations were created usually after incidents involving the deaths of citizens.  They are not red tape and should not be bypassed - particularly solely for the pursuit of commercial profits.
Thank you.

Myself along with everyone I have spoken with about this bill is strongly AGAINST it. It is not a good idea to take away all the years of hard work to put these important acts that protect the people and natural environments that we depend on for our survival. With climate change moving on its own course, we cannot continue our way of life by exploiting the Greenbelt and the natural surrounding areas trying to create developmental ""growth"" at the cost of our ecological environment.
This bill is not for the people. We cannot take shortcuts to destroy our natural environments for the sake of opening more businesses. The reasons these acts were put in place were to protect us and people who don't understand the importance of caring for our health and environment in the long run. This bill may seem like an okay idea right now, but it will only benefit the wealthy businesses and hurt the local people and environment. It especially will not help us in combating climate change.
Drinking water, natural areas, and farmlands are necessities for life and we need to continue to set precedence on protecting them, not making it easier for them to be destroyed. Please don't let this bill go through.
Thank you,
Vicki

1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations. https://ontarionature.org/bill-66-facts/

Once these resources are gone, they are gone, and instead of focusing on creating legislation that recognizes this inherent life-threatening risk to our community our government instead creates legislation that does the exact opposite. We have a responsibility to our community and to the environment that we live in to protect it, and subsequently protect the things that keep us healthy and alive.

– Critically important agricultural land and greenspace being developed and destroyed.
– More urban sprawl and poorly conceived development.
– Employees working significant amounts of overtime without pay.
– Lower wages for unionized construction workers in many sectors of the economy.
– Daycares with more children and fewer staff to look after them.
– Less qualified caregivers in public schools and daycares.
– Less protection from dishonest business practices by wireless companies.
– Long term care homes being operated by companies with no experience and with less oversight.

The environment is a precious resource and should be protected. Not in the least because we depend on it for our survival. The shortsightedness of this bill is astonishing and would have detrimental and long lasting effects.
On the subject of archaeology, Ontario has a rich history of occupation that dates back more than 12,000 years. The archaeological assessments completed each year in advance of development help fill in the gaps in the story of our Province, Indigenous Peoples and more recent settlers. Archaeology gives a voice to many who have been written out of the history of our Province. Indigenous and descendant community participation in the process of archaeological investigation has recently amplified that voice. Bill 66 threatens to allow municipalities to opt out of provisions within the Planning Act, including the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) which require many of the assessments that are completed.
Under Bill 66, a municipality will be able to circumvent Subsection 3(5) and Section 24 of the Planning Act which give authority to the Provincial Policy Statement (2014) and Official Plan requirements respectively. The protection of heritage is a mandatory provincial interest under the Ontario Heritage Act, not a decision of convenience at a municipal level. Bill 66 needs to be amended to restore the requirements that protect our heritage for the generations to come.
Furthermore, if the purpose of Bill 66 is job creation let me ask you - what about all the jobs that will be lost by bypassing these acts? What of the environmental scientists, the archaeologists, the farmers? The people who work to ensure that protections are in place and being complied with. The people who ensure that we have clean drinking water, food on our table, safe lakes and rivers. Does this government care about their jobs?

Section 7 of the Greenbelt Act, 2005.
Section 6 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008.
Section 7 of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001.
Allowing for municipalities to bypass these regulations puts not only habitat and biodiversity, but also public health, at risk. As the planet's temperature is set to increase by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius in the coming decades, it is more crucial than ever to protect the naturally-existing infrastructure which supports our clean air, drinking water, food pollinators, and other vital ecosystem services. Much of this infrastructure is contained within the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt.
Lowering costs for businesses will cost us all in the long run, as municipalities and the province will have to pay for the services once provided to us for free if they are compromised by development. As what happened in the past with the Walkerton tragedy, some people will ultimately pay with their lives, if sources of drinking water are not adequately protected.
In addition to being a student of environmental science, I am also a part-time worker who is equally concerned about Schedule 9 of this bill, particularly:
-Amend the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA) to reduce regulatory burden on businesses, including no longer requiring them to obtain approval from the Director of Employment Standards for excess hours of work and overtime averaging.
-Stop requiring employers to post the Employment Standards Act (ESA) poster in the workplace, but retain the requirement that they provide the poster to employees.
This blatantly undermines worker protections, making it very clear that the ""people"" Doug Ford claims to be for are business owners. Removing the requirement for employers to post the ESA poster in the workplace strikes me as especially ridiculous, and I fail to see how putting up a poster constitutes a ""burden"" on businesses. Workers have the right to be able to easily refer to this poster at their place of employment.

The specifics of what is being proposed are deliberately being withheld. The actual gist of what is being forced on Ontario residents and taxpayers is regressive and entrenched in an all too familiar agenda of attempting to turn back the clock. This is just dangerously delusional. It is disingenuous and misleading to imply that eliminating the checks and balances or so-called red tape that has been determined to be essential, due to the costly repercussions of previous backward thinking Ontario governments, can now be considered in the best interest of Ontario’s economy.
I would suggest that this “troubling trend of businesses looking outside of Ontario, and other competitive jurisdictions” that you mention in your message has been very much accelerated by the substance of the messages the current provincial government has been sending to potential investors. The petty personal agenda of premier Ford is embedded in the agenda of the current provincial government. This narrow-minded master plan labeled Bill 66 amounts to much more than just the ridiculous disruptions during the recent municipal elections in Ontario. The last-minute challenges to Toronto’s council numbers has become very much characteristic of the knee jerk decisions, without consideration of the perverse long-term unanticipated consequences, which certainly doesn’t impress upon potential investors that Ontario is in good hands. This is one of several small-minded foolish attempts on the part of the current premier of Ontario to shine a spotlight on himself that absolutely does not provide Ontario residents and taxpayers with the assurance that is needed to convince them that he and the current provincial government are capable of responsibly representing Ontario.
You say that you have heard loud and clear from municipalities and so-called job creators. You should now have the opportunity to hear loud and clear from the nonpartisan forward-thinking component of Ontario business, residents and taxpayers who confidently recognize the value of careful discretion when their provincial government is fixated on eliminating the checks and balances that have proven to be a steadfast mainstay of Ontario’s past successes. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing already has a tool to bypass municipal legislation and allow development anywhere in Ontario, it is called the Minister’s zoning order. Why create a new tool when you already have one that has the same effect? Calling legislation enacted to protect farmland, drinking water, and natural areas unnecessary and outdated is not reasonable. It very much appears that the current provincial government wants to make our environment an area they think can be exploited to fabricate employment numbers in their favour.
Municipal government and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs data show that there is currently a surplus of employment land within existing city boundaries to develop new businesses. In fact, many municipalities are seeking to convert these lands to other uses, like residential because of the lack of demand from industry to develop these lands. Many of these lands are near highways and or transit, which is very attractive to new businesses.
In addition, development approvals have been held up by sprawl developers who in the past appealed all regional official plans to the Ontario Municipal Board. They did this in order to secure more land for subdivisions than needed, but they were unsuccessful as there was more than enough land for development purposes. These appeals slowed Official Plan implementation by an average of over 3 years. Research by the Neptis Foundation also shows there is over 100,000 ha. of land available within existing urban boundaries for housing development. This is an area the size of Mississauga and Toronto combined and will meet regional population growth projections for decades to come.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 makes it clear that the prohibitions against development contained in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, and the Places to Grow Act will not apply to “Open for Business By-Laws”. These by-laws can be initiated and passed by any municipal government without public notice. They are then forwarded to the Ontario government for approval. They cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeals Tribunal.
This change could open the floodgates of multiple municipalities opening protected areas to development at the behest of developers, who are large election campaign contributors at the municipal level. Many of the costs of development will be borne by local taxpayers for the additional infrastructure required.
It is obvious from your message that it is a form letter sent out in a bid to announce the current government’s resolve to turn back the clock in Ontario to what they believe were sound principles of governance in the past. It is therefore understandable that your form letter has also been automatically sent to someone belonging to a group of Concerned Citizens of Ramara who has already experienced the true scope and capability of our current provincial government when it comes to taking constituent concerns seriously.
The response your office provided is irresponsible, obstructive and far short of what rural Ontarian's should expect from their provincial representatives. The very sad conclusion is that the people who took advantage of Ramara Township’s inability to apply and enforce their Fill Bylaw are also watching. The excess fill is still being marketed to anyone who is willing to make a fast buck and now the current provincial government wants to further diminish the availability of environmental regulation with Bill 66. Improvements to environmental regulations are needed so municipalities like Ramara Township are given the oversight from the provincial government that has been demonstrated as lacking. If the current provincial government considers Bylaws as Red Tape, then Bill 66 most certainly should not be passed. Not that bylaws are currently anything to be taken seriously in Ramara Township anyway.

20451,/comment/20451,"I would like to provide a number of points of concern I have regarding Bill 66:
-the omnibus approach the bill takes by lumping together amendments that affect a large number of acts and industries
-section 10, which threatens regional planning laws, and proper processes to ensure that developments are aligned with environmental and agricultural protections
-section 5 which indicates that the Toxic Reductions Act, 2009 will be retired in 2021 without any indication of the development of more robust policies to protect the environment and sensitive lands
I understand the desire to present a structured plan to make Ontario more competitive. It is a logical, business approach which probably stems from the need to support the Canadian economy.
But, this type of approach (lumping 12 schedules of changes affecting a variety of acts and industries in different ways) is dangerous.
My main concern is that this confuses citizens. It makes it especially hard to submit proper comment when there is so much to read through and analyze. I would need to write a thesis in order to properly comment on this Bill. I am submitting comment regarding a few concerns I have, but I do not have enough time to research and understand all of the sections in this act, so my comments will be focused on those issues I feel I have researched enough to understand. Given more time I would likely have more comment.
As a resident of Waterloo Region, section 10 is especially concerning. In Waterloo Region we have a Regional Official Plan that indicates where development is allowed to happen through 2031. The countryside line indicates the boundaries of development. It is my understanding that the amendments proposed under section 10 of bill 66 seek to expedited development approvals, and allow developers to be granted exemptions on these boundaries. I do not agree with these changes as this puts not just our agricultural lands at risk, but it also poses dangerous risk to our groundwater recharge areas. Waterloo Region relies on moraines for a large % of it’s drinking water.
Section 5 also stands out as alarming. Why would the Toxic Reductions Act be repealed, and the regulations under the act revoked? What will this act be replaced with to ensure that Ontario is doing it’s part to reduce toxins, and pollution?
We NEED our government to be making progressive changes that safeguard the environment and lower carbon emissions. The future of our children depend on it.

20452,/comment/20452,"The significance that the current provincial government is placing on Bill 66 and labeling it ‘Open for Business' is misleading and lacking in real detail. The specifics of what is being proposed are deliberately being withheld. The actual gist of what is being forced on Ontario residents and taxpayers is regressive and entrenched in an all too familiar agenda of attempting to turn back the clock. This is just dangerously delusional. It is disingenuous and misleading to imply that eliminating the checks and balances or so-called red tape that has been determined to be essential, due to the costly repercussions of previous backward thinking Ontario governments, can now be considered in the best interest of Ontario’s economy.
I would suggest that this “troubling trend of businesses looking outside of Ontario, and other competitive jurisdictions” that you mention in your message has been very much accelerated by the substance of the messages the current provincial government has been sending to potential investors. The petty personal agenda of premier Ford is embedded in the agenda of the current provincial government. This narrow-minded master plan labeled Bill 66 amounts to much more than just the ridiculous disruptions during the recent municipal elections in Ontario. The last-minute challenges to Toronto’s council numbers has become very much characteristic of the knee jerk decisions, without consideration of the perverse long-term unanticipated consequences, which certainly doesn’t impress upon potential investors that Ontario is in good hands. This is one of several small-minded foolish attempts on the part of the current premier of Ontario to shine a spotlight on himself that absolutely does not provide Ontario residents and taxpayers with the assurance that is needed to convince them that he and the current provincial government are capable of responsibly representing Ontario.

20455,/comment/20455,"To whom it may concern,
I have lived within the Greenbelt for my entire whole life and I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill 66 which, if passed, would undermine many critically important pieces of legislation that were created to protect the people of Ontario. Cutting and cancelling these important protections in the name of economic “competitiveness” will endanger lives, hurt our long term economic interests, and lower the quality of life in the province.
I oppose the changes in Bill 66 that will result in:
– Less protection for drinking water sources.
– Critically important agricultural land and greenspace being developed and destroyed.
– More urban sprawl and poorly conceived development.
– Employees working significant amounts of overtime without pay.
– Lower wages for unionized construction workers in many sectors of the economy.
– Daycares with more children and fewer staff to look after them.
– Less qualified caregivers in public schools and daycares.
– Less protection from dishonest business practices by wireless companies.
– Long term care homes being operated by companies with no experience and with less oversight.
Gutting important regulatory safeguards in the hopes of creating a few jobs is incredibly short sighted. Bill 66 will not make Ontario more competitive – but it will endanger our health, our communities, our environment and our future.
For all of these reasons and more, I oppose Bill 66.

20456,/comment/20456,"Please see our full submission in the attached letter.
The main points we make in our letter are as follows:
1. The stated purpose of the proposed Open-for-Business Zoning By-law (OFB-ZBL) has no basis in fact. Many studies show sufficient land already designated and set aside to accommodate anticipated needs for employment lands for years, perhaps decades. In Durham Region alone, 56% of such designated land has yet to be built on, and another 17% remains underutilized. Want of suitable land is not why large industrial manufacturers may be reticent to locate their operations in Ontario. A far more likely reason is the uniquely high cost of electricity in the province.
2. Implementation of the OFB-ZBL would interrupt coordinated land-use planning at all levels of
government. The result would be the fragmentation of policies and practices across the province, with chaotic, unfair, and destructive results. Chief among the victims would be our vitally important agricultural sector. Re-enabling urban businesses to randomly fragment agricultural lands would weaken the viability of the surrounding agricultural area and the fabric of rural life.
      With the damaging effects of climate change becoming more and more apparent, and with our population continuing to grow, any legislation that could result in the loss of farmland or harm the agricultural sector can only be considered deeply irresponsible.
3. The process laid out for permit approvals discards transparency. Regulations exist for a reason. They must not be overridden without in-depth review and public consultation. To prevent public oversight of development plans represents a clear breach of public trust. The OFB-ZBL rejects the importance and necessity of open, coordinated planning and critical oversight to prevent abuses. The current system could be streamlined, to everyone’s benefit, but it should not be made a
secret process with no right of appeal once the decisions are made public.
4. Schedule 10 denies vital health protections. If this legislation became law, a number of important
environmental protections embedded in at least five existing provincial Acts would no longer apply for new industries under the OFB-ZBL. Surely the Government of Ontario can find ways to declare the province open for business without intentionally putting the health and even the lives of its population at risk? If new industrial uses – considered and approved in secret – go on to contaminate our air, soil, or drinking water (and it would only be a matter of time), it will be the Provincial Government, with its flawed legislation and failure to regulate, that will be held to account.
We respectfully ask the Premier to keep his word – to continue to protect the Greenbelt (including the
Oak Ridges Moraine), which provides so many Ontarians with their drinking water, food, fuel, recreation, livelihoods, and economic benefits. Premier Ford must keep his promise; Schedule 10 must be removed from Bill 66.

20458,/comment/20458,"Regarding Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 66 which if passed will have devastating effects on our natural environment, our farming communities and our quality of life.  I am a resident of Cavan Monaghan Township which encompasses sections of both the Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine.
The Greenbelt, which has been protected since 2005, is a priceless public resource providing clean drinking water, fresh air, local food, and endless recreational opportunities.
The Greenbelt is an important public asset that is held and protected in trust for the benefit of our children’s children’s children. The Greenbelt represents our hope of leaving a sustainable community for future generations to thrive in.
It’s not just the Greenbelt that is threatened. Bill 66 will also allow development projects to sidestep environmental and community protections currently mandated by the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Lake Simcoe Protection Act.
Bill 66 is Doug Ford’s pay back to developers that supported his election. It will cut red tape and allow projects to go ahead without public consultation and so it is not only an exploitation of our land resources, but also a great diminishing of our democratic resources, our rights and tools to shape our future.
Under Bill 66 lands currently protected such as the Greenbelt could be rezoned by local municipal councils for development without any public notification.
Bill 66 will allow the Province to exempt major economic development projects from any requirement to comply with select planning, environmental and clean water laws, and once these projects have Provincial approvals there will be no appeal process.
I urge the government of Ontario not pass Bill 66 and at a minimum I endorse the following public interest recommendation:
“Remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, which allows municipalities to override provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act.”
I hope that the province does not sell out Ontario's natural heritage to the highest bidder.

20469,/comment/20469,"I have concerns that I  wish for my Provincial representatives to understand and voice on my behalf, regarding  Bill 66.
My concerns are regarding the QUALITY that will remain in Ontario with what is referred to as ""Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act"" as it is currently presented.
I am concerned about the QUALITY of our environment. Both in Green spaces and in our Community.
There are blanket repeals in this act.   I - as a layperson learning - read them as for convenience, not quality life or quality communities.
For ""Schedule 1: Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs"" - ""Remove outdated and time-consuming reporting requirements""
For ""Schedule 2: Ministry of the Attorney General"" - ""Repeal the Pawnbrokers Act.""
Instead of repeal, these acts require (through provincial IMPROVEMENTS) greater support, not a lack or removal of support. Despite perceived ""coverage"" elsewhere.
A significant amount of finance, at every political level, goes towards enforcement. (Police / enforcement agency resources and tools.)
Support to enforcement and consequences deters crime.
As a result it provides citizens a sense of SAFETY and SECURITY - of person, of home, of community.
That safety and security results in positive attitudes, less ""closing in of the wagons"", relaxation, trust.  When we feel that we may trust, when we feel secure, we relax, we are more inclined to go out, enjoy, creating a successful byproduct that we ADD to the ECONOMY! (Restoring in competitiveness to our society through financial freedom- even just in a social coffee or beer at the local shop).
For many years municipalities across Ontario have asked for PROVINCIAL SUPPORT with the Ontario Pawnbrokers Act. (Supported by many news articles sourced online).
To UPDATE the act.
The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police have requested, repeatedly, improvements to the Ont Pawnbrokers Act and support  through implementation and support of a Provincial Electronic Searchable Database to break down borders of cities/communities that comprise our province and thus decrease crime through united deterrent, enforcement and consequences. (""The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police endorses ... attempt to change what Ontario’s top cops call an outdated system, but there is more frustration than hope with this group that has for more than a decade been unsuccessfully calling on the provincial government to change its laws.""  Sourced from Article ""Pawnshop law needed: Police can’t track who sold items""    Ottawa Citizen- 7 Oct 2013. Additional articles for such support may be found online.)
Currently the borders of cities/communities are taken advantage of by the criminal industry to profit from:
-THEFT from homeowners - Break and Enter/Theft
-THEFT of business - from bricks and mortar locations
-Theft of ""Off the Truck""  - of which I have learnt recently is a significant concern in Ontario such that ""Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Canadian Trucking Alliance teamed in 2014"" as this was a concern to the tune of MILLIONS of DOLLARS. (https://www.ttnews.com/articles/cargo-theft-rising-canada)
This results in free profit to the CRIMINAL INDUSTRY (and lost revenue to communities/taxes), that funds GREATER COMMUNITY CONCERNS - Drugs, Gangs and GUNS!
Resulting in an increased need of support  down the road for the consequences of those community concerns.
Municipalities, the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police and citizens of Ontario have sought support from the Province.
Received by deaf ears.
Yet you are a ""new government"".
You may HEAR the call for support provincially to TIMEWARP us to MODERN times in the way that decades ago traffic concerns have been supported.
Traffic has been allowed to progress from 1800's technology and resources of pen and paper, an officer sitting on the side of the road to  ""just stop speeding"", from logging license plates manually as they zoomed by to compare to license plate records - manually - from filing cabinets has been supported.
Enforcement has sought similar support of modern resources and technology to provide ACTIVE, POSITIVE enforcement and consequences for theft as has been provided for YEARS to traffic concerns through the Modern tools of RADAR TECHNOLOGY to stop/deter through consequences for speeding, red light runners, illegal turns....
In the equal way that a computers equipped with a searchable electronic database has been made available to officers, provincially, to confirm the car registration and ownership, that the driver maintains an active drivers license, etc.
Yet
Law enforcement in and between many Ontario municipalities continue to have available mere 1800's technology of manual (paper) for pawnbooks / ledger for second hand use shops/pawnshops/cash for gold - locations criminals sell off stolen items for profit.
Manual file cabinets  are all that is available to maintain records, inefficiently, for items taken into those businesses, resulting in a poor use of resources, thus enforcement and consequences are not encouraged or maintained!
(""No province-wide electronic database No Pawnbroker transactions are generally recorded manually and submitted to police services manually. The large amount of information transmitted makes it difficult and time-consuming to identify suspicious and/or stolen goods, much less link them to specific crimes.""

The CRIMINAL INDUSTRY is PROFITING!
Organized CRIME is thriving in Ontario. UNCHECKED!
Community concerns GROW as thefts from HONEST citizens occur as they are working or at school! As they support society.
Many areas of our province have had a record number of GUN INCIDENTS in 2018.
The PROFIT from theft/selling stolen belongings is NOT going to charity or to school councils! It funds these community concerns!
While this Ontario Govt pledged 25 MILLION dollars to help with ""guns and gangs"",  (https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/ontario-to-spend-25-million-to-h…) the PROVINCE is continuing to SUPPORT THE CRIMINAL INDUSTRY through a lack of enforcement and consequences that provide funds to the guns and gangs.
Removing what few outdated requirements exist as ""many municipalities may have bylaws"".
Yet even when the municipalities do have bylaws in place, the border issue of municipalities prevents success at municipal level, allowing criminals to just drive stolen ""merchandise"" a few KM away and be FREE to conduct business, to gain profit to fund greater crime.
(This perspective is supported with relation to ""off the truck"" as "" it’s a relatively easy way to raise money that is invested in drugs where the rewards are much higher, ..... For instance, criminals may garner $7,000 from a stolen truckload and use it to buy cocaine that they sell in Toronto for $50,000,"" https://www.ttnews.com/articles/cargo-theft-rising-canada)
Likewise, breakin/theft of homeowners, resulting in profit from unchecked transactions through pawnshops/second hand use shops, cash for gold - funds the buyers for those drugs, that cocaine - providing greater profit to the criminal industry!
Funding the guns and gangs that Ontario is now trying to ""help"" with - after the fact.
Citizens need support at the provincial level to decrease profit from home breakin/theft to falling off the truck sales funding greater community concerns!
I encourage my provincial government to STOP THE REPEAL of the Ontario Pawnbrokers Act and to bring enforcement and thus consequences to modern times through the support of uniting municipalities through a Provincial Searchable Electronic Database, ideally a PHOTO database. To create greater success and efficiencies, to support and enable municipalities and your citizens that make up our province as a whole.  To provide tools to hold criminals accountable and provide support and CONFIDENCE in Ontario citizens to then restore true competitiveness through pursuit of community life, greater relaxed, confident environment, therefore funding economical support by citizens thorough choice of greater relaxed spending over hiding behind locked doors at home.
My family was recently broken into and stolen from. The outdated Ontario Pawnbrokers Act allowed loopholes to exist where calls to close them were made over many years.
Yet instead of closing the loopholes it seems that my current provincial leaders are washing their hands of the act all together, likely unaware and thus without consideration to the consequences,  encouraging support to the criminal industry rather than of the HONEST CITIZENS who are victimized as they are out working for a living!
I do not currently feel supported by my province or provincial representatives. Yet the resource cost, provincially, is minimal.
The resource/cost to such a positive, proactive endeavor would provide proactive effects to guns and gangs in earlier stages.
I look forward to your educating my community and I as to how you will support honest citizens in this situation.
Beginning with a re-examination of the Ontario Pawnbrokers Act.
Thank you for your time.

20475,/comment/20475,"As a long time resident of Hamilton/Stoney Creek, I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes outlined in Bill 66. I have lived and worked in this area for many years and have grown to love the social and natural diversity here. I am a freelance graphic designer and also recently returned to school to earn my Landscape Technician certificate from Niagara College. Over the years, I have become increasingly aware of the importance of acknowledging and preserving our natural environment from which we benefit in so many ways.
I am aware that Bill 66 includes a repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and amendments to multiple provincial statutes, including the planning act. These changes will allow municipalities to pass ""Open for Business"" planning by-laws aimed at attracting new major business.
I do not think these changes should be made, especially considering that they compromise transparency and public engagement because they are exempt from public notice, comment and appeal provisions in the planning act, as well as being exempt from key environmental protection laws intended to protect our water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being.
I believe Bill 66  threatens drinking water, wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Furthermore it threatens farmland, including two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt. I believe this will lead to more urban sprawl and undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient.
I consider these changes, including the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act, to be a serious threat to human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals, and as a woman currently receiving treatment for cancer, this is of special concern to me.
My understanding is that the province already has the power to override local planning rules to designate land for development if they want to use it. This power is called a Minister’s zoning order (MZO). By proposing that the new “Open for Business bylaw” be implemented by municipalities the province is trying to distance itself from the scrutiny, criticism and accountability that would normally be directed at them if they had they used the MZO. It also increases the number of likely development proposals that will come forward as the development industry is very influential and often funds election campaigns at the municipal level.
The health of our region depends on valuing our farms, forests, clean water sources and nature and building robust and vibrant communities.

This requires continued protection of the greenbelt (remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66!!!!)  instead of giving in to developer interests, more protection of the environment, and positioning the economy to meet the business opportunities of the future entailed in the environmental challenges the world faces.
Why start paving over prime farmland that provides jobs, and helps curb carbon emissions, and promotes self sufficiency when people buy local. The greenbelt belt provides habitat for wildlife already under extreme threat due to development and habitat loss. We now have the WWF report noting the 60% decline in the planet’s wildlife over the past fifty years. Let us not add to this. The greenbelt provides nature close at hand for many Ontarians, which studies have shown is essential for mental health, and many recreational opportunities.
The Greenbelt helps prevent flooding and is a carbon store in the fight against climate change.
There is more than enough land available to meet the housing needs of the future, through greater density, etc., without destroying our natural heritage. If climate change has taught us anything it is that we need to find new ways of doing things, not to do more of what we did in the past.
Omnibus bills are cowardly and undemocratic. This government continues to show itself beholden to friends and special interests, lacking in values, and bereft of the vision to meet the challenges of the future.

20488,/comment/20488,"As Executive Director for the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust, I am writing to the Premier and Government of Ontario to ask that you keep your promise to protect the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine and reintroduce a new Bill 66 Schedule 10 that protects sensitive environmental lands such as forests, wetlands, natural areas and farmlands on the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine, Lake Simcoe region and in Source Water Protection Areas.
The Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust was formed in 2000 by volunteers involved in the advocacy for the creation of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (ORMCP) under the Harris government with the support of MPP Steve Gilchrist. Steve Gilchrist is a valued past Board member of the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust from 2001-2011. Since 2000, the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust has worked with many levels of government to work within the land conservation framework and land-use planning in Ontario.
A stakeholder panel comprised of members of the development industry, environmental groups, scientists and politicians who reviewed and assessed the ORMCP was a successful element of the consultation and acceptance process. We respectfully suggest that a similar stakeholder panel with public consultations across Ontario should be incorporated as part of the consultation on Bill 66.  Under the leadership of Former Mayor David Crombie, the Co-ordinated Review Advisory Panel “encouraged the government to step up our efforts to curb sprawl, build complete communities, grow the Greenbelt, support agriculture and address traffic congestion. Their result is stronger plans that will help protect the quality of life for generations to come.”
Our concerns about Bill 66 Schedule 10 include the following:
•	An Open for Business bylaw could be passed without public notice or meetings or right of appeal. Our communities across the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt have been active in the consultative process to establish local official plans.
•	The tight timeline for comments during the holiday period does not allow sufficient time for understanding or consultation with the public.
•	No background information is provided about the employment lands issue and why this problem can’t be dealt within the current planning framework
•	There is no information about the prescribed criteria which would be applied by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs.
•	Legal experts at Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) have indicated that once an Open For Business is approved that municipalities can’t require adherence to the policies within the Clean Water Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, The Greenbelt Plan and other local official plans. CELA has advised that “To do so would be unlawful under Bill 66.”
Forests, wetlands, natural areas and farmlands provide healthy habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon, mitigate the effects of climate change, provide rural business and recreation opportunities and clean our air constantly and naturally. Farmlands, forests, water and natural areas disappear forever in urban sprawl.
Clean and abundant water is critical to both human and nature survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our environmental health, increases flooding, erosion and drought. Flooding and erosion events have caused significant increases in insurance claims resulting in hike in insurance fees.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are being threatened. Farming and our local food production are economically important and provide jobs to thousands. Urban sprawl into farmland destroys farm businesses and farming communities. The Land Trust protects both farmland and environmental lands across the ORM and Greenbelt and in the Lake Simcoe protection area.
Allowing the development of employment lands in the countryside, requires the expansion of infrastructure, roads, water and sewer servicing and will lead to higher property taxes for the people of impacted communities and all of Ontario. Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas with strategic marketing not urban sprawl. By building within existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe, we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in existing serviced communities while holding urban boundaries firm.
Please recall Bill 66 and consider these impacts. The Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust is ready to assist in any future consultations on this matter.

20490,/comment/20490,"I have a concern that I  wish for my Provincial representatives to understand and voice on my behalf, regarding  Bill 66.
My concerns are regarding the QUALITY that will remain in Ontario with what is referred to as ""Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act"" as it is currently presented.
I am concerned, as a parent, for the limits of young children in childcare and programs being increased.
I am concerned that our province should have a  greater priority to provide not only ""more"" childcare but QUALITY care to our young developing children. While increasing ratio 1 to 2 additional children under 2 per caregiver in home base childcare (of which there is rarely additional childcare support on site), and from 6yrs to 4 yrs in programs may appear insignificant, the 1:1 needs of such children are immense. Increasing the number of children of younger ages will not support the children's needs.
While ""finding more childcare"" may seem a goal, finding SAFE, supportive childcare is of higher priority.
""More"" child care should come through encouraging and supporting more locations for childcare.
Supporting more child care workers  providing care than warehousing younger children which easily results in neglect, stress, decreased QUALITY care.
Such situations result in future community concerns as children display once at school, requiring greater resources and support by our provincial school system. Resulting in greater community concerns to be supported down the road as youth seek support from gangs, poor choices may be made leading to drug/abuse, supporting more provincial investment required such as ""gangs and guns"" initiative , if children are not well supported to thrive starting when as  young as 2.

I remember the Walkerton travesty well. I have been working with environmental scientists and public servants who care for our parks and environment and have heard concern about the overall direction related to this bill.
The proposed Bill 66 will allow municipalities to completely disregard Ontario's provincial legislation that protects drinking water safety and air quality, the Greenbelt and farmland in the province, any time a development plan promises to create 50 or more jobs (even temporary construction jobs).
Equally concerning is that Bill 66 will allow municipalities to approve such development plans without any public consultation.
The bill sweeps away decades of public effort and government legislation to ensure that Ontario continues to have clean and safe water, air and land and home-grown food for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren.
""Open for Business"" should not be at a cost to people. this bill is short sighted and ill advised. We cannot recover our drinking water and green space once it has been destroyed for the benefit of wealthy developers and polluting industry for a few paltry jobs (and time limited jobs) and short term profit. We need to focus on affordable housing, reducing the carbon foot print by enabling food to be grown locally and green space that science has shown improves overall health and well being of the individuals accessing it and the communities surrounding it.
The government has already taken many steps that put our environment at risk, makes the poor even poorer (cancellation of basic income) and makes me despair for the future of our province. I encourage the government to develop a longer term vision that makes Ontario a safe and healthy place to live and grow...and make decisions for the long term benefit of the bulk of Ontarians rather than short term profit of a few.

As a resident in both rural and urban areas I have seen the effects of poor management and control over environmental concerns, particularly with respect to safe drinking water, the water tables (quarries, industry, selling water etc). Controls were put in place for reasons and should not be randomly discarded or passed over. Additionally, the prospect of opening the green belt or any other swath of good farmland to development is short-sighted. Another aspect of concern is with the heritage laws and the potential to disregard the inconvenient aspects of heritage, eg archeological testing that costs money and delays to development but is very important to telling the story of those who came before. In the past 30 years this aspect of heritage has risen from emergency rescues of a few sites to excavations on a scale that provide scope for truly meaningful research. More recently, the interaction between First Nations, archaeologists and the public around such sites has increased our awareness of history and its effect on the present and future. The positive outcomes of increased knowledge and understanding cannot be enumerated in dollars and cents. I am opposed to Bill 66 in its current form.

20506,/comment/20506,"To the Government of Ontario:
As the implications of Schedule 10 of Bill 66 sank in, it felt as if hope had died.
The reasons given for imposing such damaging legislation on Ontario’s land-use policies, so as to render the province “open for business,” are demonstrably false, as I’m sure many commenters will have gone to great lengths to demonstrate. It seems as if the government has set out to intentionally mislead Ontarians. Either that or it is seriously misinformed or seriously compromised. None of these possibilities is reassuring.
The proposed legislation is draconian and offensive. Ontario’s government was (I hope and trust this to be true) voted into office by the public, the people of this province; it is in power thanks to public actions. Yet in Schedule 10 of Bill 66, that government would put in place a policy allowing land-use decision-making that risks harming many fundamental aspects of citizens’ lives and the environment – with no requirement for public notice or consultation and no right to appeal a decision once it has been made public.
Such a policy might be expected from the governments of North Korea or Russia or China. But Ontario?!
Schedule 10 purports to be about removing “excessive red tape” and “burdensome regulations.” But most, if not all, regulation is in place to protect health and safety. And removing excessive red tape does not require keeping the activity secret from the public. So what is behind Schedule 10? The only possible explanation, if we eliminate incompetence and contempt for the public, is that this government is bending to pressures it knows are not in the people’s best interest, pressures that involve harming our environment, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we rely on to sustain us; pressures that want yet more scattered, low-density, costly-to-maintain urban sprawl at the expense of natural spaces and farmland; pressures that involve permitting industry to set up operations in inappropriate locations; pressures that ignore or dismiss the difficult future we all face if we do not drastically cut our carbon emissions and start thinking like a species that is rapidly destroying its only home (and will succeed in doing so if it doesn’t start doing things differently).
It has been reassuring to learn that many municipalities have made public their disagreement with this proposed legislation and will refuse to make use of the open-for-business bylaw. But not all councils are as ethical or as able or willing to foresee the serious consequences of Schedule 10. This is legislation that would create a patchwork mess of policies and practices in no way better than those now in place. There may well be good reasons for a little more flexibility in current policies, to avoid serious unfairness in certain locales and conditions. But such matters can be analysed and corrected without introducing draconian measures that risk doing irreversible harm across the province.
Premier Ford, during his campaign, promised Ontarians that he would not touch the Greenbelt. I live on the Greenbelt. It was the right decision. This grand sweep of rich farmland and unspoiled nature so close to Canada’s largest population centre, is an asset and resource that other cities and countries of the world would give their eye-teeth to have and protect. Why would any Ontario government try to weaken or damage this envied jewel? Yet Schedule 10 risks doing just that.
With this submission, I ask that Schedule 10 be removed from Bill 66 now. Its potential consequences would leave a legacy that no thinking government should ever want to own.

It is land that provides fresh air and clean water to Ontarians. It is land that so many people access for their mental and physical health. It is land that is home to wildlife.
We can create jobs and have a thriving local economy without developing this land, in this way. Not to mention, jobs are only as good as the quality of life they support, and it is undeniable that quality of life is dependent on fresh water, fresh air, fresh food, and healthy ecosystems. How can job creation be more important than food security? If you can't eat, you cannot live.

Dear Mr. Helfinger,
I am writing on behalf of the Halton/North Peel Naturalist Club.
The Halton/North Peel Naturalist Club recognizes the value of a vibrant economy and the necessity to allow municipalities some jurisdiction over development issues. However we also recognize that the provincial government has an important duty in ensuring that municipalities act responsibly to protect water, farmland, natural heritage and human health. With Bill 66 the Ontario Government weakens such protections and makes it more difficult for democracy to prevail in decision making at the municipal level.
It is critical that we preserve our precious farmland and maintain the protections that currently prevail for the Green Belt, the Oak Ridges Moraine and other areas of natural significance in the province. As Ontario continues to grow the importance and value of farmland and natural space will only increase. It is not acceptable that the fate of farmland and the fate of significant wetlands, woodlands and the habitat of species at risk be left to the whims of local governments.
The people of Ontario have a right to clean water now and in the future. In fact, as we've discovered in the past, this is a matter of life and death.  It is incumbent on the provincial government to  ensure that policy changes never threaten a clean water supply. Bill 66 introduces the possibility that municipal drinking water could be threatened by landfills, sewage systems and the improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
Please remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66

Schedule 3, loosening the limits on daycares, puts our kids at risk in the guise of making it easier for parents to find affordable health care.  There’s nothing stopping daycares from charging the same high fees that they do now, so I don’t see how this proposal would make daycare affordable.
Schedule 5, repealing  the Toxics Reduction Act is also ill-advised. You say that the Federal Chemicals Management Plan will be relied on instead. However, the Toxics Reduction Act requires industries to reduce their use of certain toxic chemicals over time. The Federal Act does not contain any requirements for reduction of chemical use. It’s deceitful to imply that the  Federal Act is the same as the  Toxics Reduction Act.
Schedule 7, repealing the  Wireless Services Act will remove the cap to cancellation fees, and several other consumer protections. This will increase our costs and does nothing to save money for Ontarians.
Similarly, allowing employers to use overtime averaging (Schedule 9) does nothing but rob workers of their overtime pay so that companies can save a few bucks. How is that “For the People”?
And, finally, the  “Open for Business Bylaw” outlined in Schedule 10- this is  the  worst idea in the whole Bill. Over the past several  weeks, I’ve been hearing  several PC MPPs saying that environmental protections like the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, etc. “won’t be touched”. If that  is true then remove that wording from the Bill completely! These environmental regulations were created to  protect us, and by allowing companies to side-step them while removing public consultation or the ability to appeal is a recipe for disaster.

The ""red tape"" that Premier Ford speak of deleting are the carefully crafted Acts and Legislation that have been developed over decades to protect our drinking water, wetlands, farmland and native species.
This proposed Bill is also inherently undemocratic as it overrides the authority of municipalities to use zoning to plan their towns and cities. It also allows decisions to be made without transparency, public discussion or a structure to appeal.
Other concerns about this proposed bill include:
.""open for business"" by-laws would trump critical legal requirements now in place to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and air quality thereby threaten drinking water, pesticide use, and loss of farmland in the Greenbelt;
.It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for endangered species
.It supports urban sprawl which puts municipalities in debt and undermines the effectiveness of public transport
.It overrides the Provincial Policy Statement policies that support green infrastructure and climate resiliency
.It repeals the Toxics Reduction Act
This proposed Bill 66 looks like it was written by development companies to maximize their profits without any concern for the environment, food production, or sustainable budgets. Greedy capitalism at its worse.
It is very sad that such a Bill would be put forth that goes against all the knowledge and best practice evidence about what society must do to minimize the impact of climate disruption.

I feel the negative impacts it will have on our environment, water security, air, and health are far greater than the proposed competitiveness gain.  We as Ontarians should be striving for sustainable living, not competitive gain at the expense of our future.
Bill 66 attacks legislative provisions which currently safeguard environmental quality and public health and safety throughout Ontario.
Bill 66  allows municipalities to create by-laws that trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt including wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent environmental natural heritage and farmland protections set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act, the Greenbelt Plan, the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. The threat to farmland and risk of urban sprawl cannot be ignored. Bill 66 would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure, and climate resiliency. Since by-laws could be passed without prior public notice, it would compromise transparency and public engagement; contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act). Lastly, Bill 66 threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals by repealing the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

It's fundamentally changing the character of the communities in these regions, as well as putting some of the most culturally and environmentally important lands in our province at risk. Schedule 10 of this bill must be removed as it will allow municipalities to override existing legislation and sacrifice the medium and long-term prosperity of our communities for short-term gain. It is also fundamentally anti-democratic, as it no longer requires public consultation for developments.

20555,/comment/20555,"I am alarmed by the sweeping new powers that will be granted to municipalities if Omnibus Bill 66 is passed. While many sections include disturbing changes with impact across all sectors, I am most opposed to Schedule 10 for two significant reasons.  Intended to move development forward quickly, Schedule 10 will allow any municipality in Ontario to pass an “Open For Business” bylaw that will override existing provincial legislation and local planning bylaws that protect our water and our environment. Secondly this bylaw will require no public consultation and permit no appeal process. It will require only the approval of the Minister of Planning
Many of these existing regulations deemed “red tape” by the Ford government are actually the fabric of our safety net developed by all political parties over decades. They are here to protect our public health, our environment, our water sources, our land use  and our future as a planet. Some were put in place as a response to tragedies such as Walkerton. Others have been developed by both the province and the municipalities to protect agricultural resources, to ensure safe and clean water and to protect the forests and green spaces recognized as essential to mitigate the catastrophic impact of climate change.  We need these safeguards. They are not ”red tape”
My second  cause for alarm in this section of Bill 66 is that it permits a municipal council to implement an open-for-business bylaw without public consultation. The risks will not be publically weighed against any financial or economic benefits. According to the legislation there will be no appeals allowed. Furthermore, in the fine print of the current proposed Bill there is a provision that should other pieces of legislation be deemed “red tape” in the planning process, Cabinet can add them to the list of legislation that need not apply to an Open for Business Bylaw.  Amendments need not pass through the legislature.
How does this impact Ontario? The Environmental Law Association in their analysis of  Bill 66 and in particular Schedule 10 explain that in the current Planning Act Subsection 3(5) there are specific policies related to (among other things) density, compatibility, affordable housing, active transportation, stormwater management and low impact development, green infrastructure, natural heritage and water features protection, climate resiliency and natural and human-made hazards. Under Schedule 10 of the proposed bill all of these existing requirements could be ignored in an Open for Business bylaw.
Please remove Schedule 10 from Omnibus Bill 66.
We are dealing with irreversible Climate Change. This Bill is devastating to the future of our province and our planet as it removes the environmental protection we desperately need to preserve the Greenbelt and our safe water as well as our green spaces across the province. We are leaving no future for our children and grandchildren with this legislation.

20557,/comment/20557,"General Comments
The Pembina Institute has concerns on many aspects of Bill 66 and its implications for Ontarians. We are of the opinion that Schedule 10 of the proposed Bill (amending the Planning Act), new proposed regulation under the Planning Act to create an open-for-business planning tool, and open-for-business planning tool could result in real, adverse, and potentially irreversible effects to Ontario’s land, environment and climate, and public health. If Bill 66 becomes law, it would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” zoning bylaws that could allow new and potentially inefficiently located large-scale developments to be approved without the sound environmental protections and evidence-based growth management policies that ensure healthy and sustainable communities — including allowing development in the Greenbelt. The proposed Bill would also dramatically weaken the public’s right to comment on development projects that might affect the environment, including access to clean water, natural heritage systems and agricultural lands.
We appreciate the government’s recent stakeholder consultations with planning and policy practitioners and the business and development industry to hear concerns and feedback on how to wisely expedite location-efficient employment and residential development to accommodate growth in the province. In parallel to Bill 66 and the related regulation and bylaw under this submission, the government is conducting numerous consultations on matters affecting land use planning and growth management in the province, including but not limited to:
i.	potential changes to the Planning Act (over and above the proposed changes in Bill 66), Provincial Policy Statement and Local Planning Appeals Tribunal to support a forthcoming housing supply action plan (ERO 013-4190);
ii.	amendments to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (ERO 013-4504);
iii.	proposed framework for provincially significant employment zones (ERO 013-4506); and
iv.	a new Environmental Plan (ERO 013-4208).
We do, however, have concerns that these efforts are uncoordinated and are moving at a pace that makes it difficult for relevant stakeholders and the public to have a fulsome understanding of how the multiple policy proposals would work in lock-step or get a clear sense of the policy impacts and outcomes. To that end, we encourage the government to take an integrated and coordinated approach to land use planning, economic development, and growth management in such a way that allows stakeholders and the public to meaningful contribute to the policy development process. We believe that Bill 66 takes a piecemeal approach to incentivize employment development, and undermines the building blocks and fundamentals of planning and the environmental policies in the province. That is why the Pembina Institute respectfully recommends the following:
Recommendation 1: Remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66, remove the associated regulation under the Planning Act for the open-for-business planning tool, and remove the open-for-business planning tool. These three policy proposals would permit development to be exempt from substantive provincial land use planning statutes and policies.
Recommendation 2: The Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade should coordinate with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and other partner ministries on inter-related policy initiatives that impact land use and environmental planning, growth management, economic development and housing supply and choice in the province. As first steps:
i.	coordinate and share input received from stakeholder consultation workshops held over fall 2018 and winter 2019, related to the provincial land use planning framework and
ii.	demonstrate how proposed and forthcoming inter-related policy initiatives, would work together.
Recommendation 3: Following the above, prioritize improvements and enhancements to long-term planning statutes and policies such as the Planning Act, Provincial Policy Statement, and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, where necessary, to better facilitate a comprehensive strategy towards employment and residential development while also advancing environmental and public interests.
Recommendation 4: Support and build capacity of municipalities with employment planning by initiating a comprehensive economic development study and strategy for the Greater Golden Horseshoe area. Maintain and enhance standardized tools that enable municipalities to assess land needs for employment and residential development, including the land needs assessment.
Development without an end-game
Currently, the planning process requires development proposals to follow provincial and municipal policies designed to protect Ontarians’ health and quality of life and support a strong economic future, and a key component to that is protecting the province’s natural environment such as the Greenbelt. Under the proposed Bill, should a municipality enact an open-for-business planning bylaw, the bylaw or development projects pursuant to the bylaw would be exempt from essentially all substantive land use, transportation planning, and environmental statutes, such as the Planning Act, Places to Grow Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, Greenbelt Act, and Ontario Planning and Development Act. Provincial land use planning policies are a reflection of Ontarians’ input and values on how to develop and grow our communities in a responsible manner. Some foundational provincial planning policies – the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe – have all been recently updated in 2017 based on considerable public consultation. Given that these provincial policies are developed through a comprehensive public engagement and consultation process, planning policies should not be easily bypassed. Under Bill 66, a development project would not need to conform to municipal planning policies such as official plans or go through site plan approval — all due diligence requirements for any development. Overall, with the proposed changes, development projects could be built without checks and balances, and may undermine the Growth Plan’s overarching vision to strategically grow in areas with existing or planned infrastructure and services.
Public health risks and impacts to our natural environment
Development projects pursuant to open-for-business planning bylaws would bypass obligations to meet critical environmental protection policies that ensure Ontarians have access to clean drinking water and a clean environment, such as the Clean Water Act and Great Lakes Protection Act. Bill 66, coupled with new environmental management practices approved in another recent Bill (Bill 57) would significantly weaken private businesses’ responsibilities to ensure that business practices do not have adverse impacts to Ontarians’ health and natural environment, for example access to clean drinking water. The impacts of weak environmental protections have led to serious public health concerns related to contaminated water. The Clean Water Act was introduced to strengthen protections for drinking water at its source, and a direct response to such concerns.
Bill 66 could allow employment uses in the Greenbelt should a municipality decide to apply an open-for-business bylaw in this protected area. According to a public opinion poll, 90% of Ontarians agree that the Greenbelt is one of the most important contributions to the future of the province.  The Greenbelt’s productive farmland supports rural jobs, a strong agricultural business sector and provides food security. Its forests clean our air. Its soils filter our water, absorb carbon pollution and reduce flooding. That is why exempting major new employment uses from conforming to the Greenbelt Act could have adverse impacts to Ontario’s food security and natural areas. Research shows that a healthy Greenbelt in Ontario generates economic benefits, by supporting 161,000 jobs and contributing over $9.1 billion annually to Ontario’s economy.
In addition, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was created to protect groundwater supplies from contamination. Oak Ridges Moraine provides clean drinking water from groundwater wells fed by aquifers for 250,000 residents and thousands of farms. The sand and gravel soils of the moraine make it particularly susceptible to groundwater contamination which is why development is prohibited in aquifer vulnerable areas and key hydrological areas. Bill 66 puts at risk key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural core areas and natural linkage areas across the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Bill 66 may be inconsistent with and undermine the province’s recently proposed Ontario Environment Plan, which aims to build resilient communities. By permitting development in the Greenbelt, this policy may weaken Ontario’s capacity to mitigate climate change. As an example, protected areas directly absorb carbon. The Greenbelt keeps an estimated 172 million tonnes of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, locked away in its rich soils and vegetation.  This is more than Ontario’s entire greenhouse gas emissions for 2016.
Weakening of the democratic planning process
Public participation is fundamental to land use planning and a key tenet to balancing public and private interests. Currently, provincial and municipal planning processes require minimum public consultations for the public to provide input into a development proposal. Under this proposed Bill, a municipality is not required to hold public meetings if it decides to approve an open-for-business planning bylaw or developments pursuant to an open-for-business planning bylaw. As we understand it, in order for a municipality to use an open-for-business planning bylaw, a municipality must pass a resolution requesting the Minister of Municipal Affairs’ approval, which the minister can do at their discretion. The bylaw comes into force once the municipality has received approval from the minister, 20 days after it is passed, or a later day that may be specified by the minister. However, unlike other current zoning bylaws, the municipality is not required to give notice of or hold a public meeting prior to passing an open-for-business planning bylaw. It is only after passing the bylaw that the municipality must give notice to “any persons or public bodies the municipality considers proper” within 30 days — 10 days after the bylaw has already come into effect. Furthermore, an open-for-business planning bylaw cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. This proposed approach to fast-track development does not, in our opinion, advance good planning principles and in the best interest of the public. As such, we have serious concerns about the potential weakening of the democratic planning process as a result of such new zoning powers.
A fragmented and incoherent approach to economic development
Rather than advancing a regional economic development strategy or approach, this proposed tool may encourage fragmented economic investments across the province and put municipalities in further competition with each other for employment development. As the proposed Bill is written, the Minister of Municipal Affairs has the authority to approve the bylaw in one jurisdiction but choose not to in another, or to impose different conditions across municipalities. This makes for an incoherent economic development strategy for cities that have integrated and connected economies such as those in the Greater Golden Horseshoe.
The proposed open-for-business regulation aims to create job growth by requiring that development projects meet a minimum job creation threshold, but it is unclear how that would be determined. This is in contrast to how planning is currently guided, using evidence-based intensification targets for resident and job densities, which are informed by population and employment growth forecasts.
Planning for Employment Areas
It is important to note that Bill 66 does not just potentially permit employment uses in areas covered by the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan or Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, but rather all of Ontario where a municipality may decide to apply to the minister for an open-for-business bylaw. As a result, employment developments could be approved in areas that have limited public utilities and infrastructure, including poor transportation networks and services, in other sensitive natural areas, or in other areas not intended for employment uses. Allowing employment uses, including manufacturing, without access to existing or future planned public infrastructure, as the open-for-business bylaw could allow, may potentially put a significant financial burden on municipalities to expanding service delivery and infrastructure in undeveloped areas.
Allowing sprawling employment development and ancillary uses instead of encouraging greater density in built-up areas could result in longer commute times, and in turn, increased transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.  In Ontario, the transportation sector is the largest sectoral source of emissions. That is why it is imperative that land use planning policies continue to support strategic development in built-up areas – within urban and town boundaries - with existing and planned public infrastructure that can support business operations, and ensure that sprawling development does not occur in protected areas like the Greenbelt or the Oak Ridges Moraine.
It is critical that the province maintain an adequate supply of employment areas but there is limited evidence that there is any need to make additional employment lands available for development, the ostensible purpose of open-for-business zoning bylaws. In fact, some municipalities have determined that they have a surplus of employment lands, as evidenced by their land needs assessments for employment uses. Presumably, that is why the government’s recently proposed amendment to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2017) “would change the policy for protecting employment areas by allowing employment area conversions to be approved ahead of the next municipal comprehensive review. This proposed amendment would provide flexibility to municipalities who wish to support mixed use development, while maintaining employment area protections where needed” through a Proposed Framework for Provincially Significant Employment Zones.
In summary, the province should continue to protect significant dedicated employment lands for future job growth and guard against ad hoc sprawling and inappropriate employment development in environmentally sensitive and protected areas – as permitted by Bill 66. Moving forward, it is critical that the province provides greater support and resources to municipalities so that they are better positioned with the information they need to plan for their employment needs. A standardized approach to undertake land needs assessments, as part of the municipal comprehensive review, allows municipalities to identify and allocate the appropriate quantity of lands based on projected needs. It is essential that municipalities have the right data obtained through a land needs assessment to understand whether there is a need to expand settlement boundaries to meet growing employment or housing needs.
Details matter, but planning fundamentals matter more
We recognize the need for public policies that allow Ontario municipalities to respond to changing and growing economies and populations and to ensure that development keeps pace with growth — but not at all costs. While further details may be offered in forthcoming regulations regarding preconditions and applicability of an open-for-business planning bylaw, what matters more is that governments do not undermine the building blocks and fundamentals of planning and the environmental policies in the province. Ontario’s regulatory framework must evolve in a way that not only attracts business investments but also protects Ontarians from risks like a changing climate and drinking water contamination, and protects our farmlands and green spaces.
Conclusion
The Bill 66 changes to the Planning Act take us in the wrong direction. The health and vibrancy of our region depends on valuing our farms, forests, clean water sources, nature and building well planned communities. Bill 66 undermines the fundamentals of building healthy communities that work to balance the environment, public health, and economic interests.

20583,/comment/20583,"My family immigrated to Ontario in 1953 from England.  Within a year (October 1954) Toronto and surrounding area was hit by one of the worst storms in our history, Hurricane Hazel.
I was ten years old and vividly remember the storm.  The destruction was enormous with people drowning because they had been allowed to build close to rivers and streams, because there was little or no regulation.
We learned from Hurricane Hazel.  Conservation Authoraties were created or strengthened.  New rules and controls were put in place to stop developers from building on flood plains and wetlands, and destroying sensitive woodlands.  Many of our environmental Acts are a direct result of the destructive power of Hurricane Hazel.
With your proposed Bill 66, your government is going to allow Ontario municipalities to override our current environmental acts.  This allow the southern Ontario development community to build housing or industry wherever they wish if they are employing more than fifty workers, easily done in a housing subdivision.  Your proposal also allows employers to reduce wages and drop overtime pay, allows daycares to run with less daycare staff, and allow corporations to run long term facilities without experience and with less oversight.  Your destructive omnibus bill goes on and on.
In regards to the possible negation of our environmental acts, I have in my lifetime (I am 75 years young) watched the destruction of arable land, the bulldozing of ancient oaks and mature maples, and the backfilling of marshes and streams.  This was done to create asphalt communities for the middle and upper classes.  Developers never even had the decency to construct housing for families with very low incomes.
Happily, in the past two or three decades, new acts and regulations were passed to slow down the ruin of our province.  We now have some protection.  With this proposed Bill 66, your government is quite willing to, again, allow developers to swarm over environmentally sensitive land.
I know the municipalities will be able to opt out if their Councils chose.  Some have already done so!

20588,/comment/20588,"Dear Government of Ontario,
I believe that Bill 66 should and has to be stop before it does any damage to the citizens of Ontario, the Economy of Ontario, and Environment of Ontario. The bill infringes on our precious democracy and laws that hold us together and without them, our society would fall into chaos.
Firstly, this law allows municipality governments to create any laws without the consent of the community and once approved, can not be repealed. Projects also don't have to comply with regulations that were made through the hard work of past governments. For example, new projects or laws can be implemented with disregarding the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, and Lake Simcoe Protection Act, acts meant o not only protect aquatic ecosystems, however, also protect the health of the water for citizens of Ontario. How can a government disregard tragedies such as the Walkerton Tragedy; the E. Coli bacteria outbreak in the water in Ontario.
However, this is the tip of the iceberg. This law, if passed, will derail the economy and growth of Ontario. One of the major things that Bill 66 would bypass is the Greenbelt Act, a key act to not only protect forests, however, also protect the farmland of multiple people. Imagine, hundreds of people forced to relocate and unemployed because of urban sprawl. This might be a reality because of this bill. Also, governments should focus on building apartment complexes near work-spaces and providing work for people to solve other issues such as rising house prices, the time going to work, and homelessness. In addition to this, the government of Ontario should also work on providing better transportation so Ontario can decrease it's carbon footprint, as well as providing more money to companies and more time for employees with their families.
However, probably the most important, the most damaging part of Bill 66 is it's threat to the environment. Bill 66 would cut important regulations, acts, and laws protecting the environment; who doesn't have a word in this; from ourselves. Such regulations include: Toxics Reduction Act, Clean Water Act, Greenbelt Act, 2005, Great Lakes Protection Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016. These acts not only help us protect us from destroying and corrupting our fragile environment, however, it also helps us go on the path for fighting Climate Change, the real enemy. Only by becoming climate-resilient and helping other become it as well, may we not only progress as a nation, however, write another chapter in humanity. The environment is sacred and beautiful, and the mere presence of Bill 66 threatens it for our generation and generations to come.
As I hope the government can see that if Bill 66 is passed, then it would mean the utter destruction and loss for Ontario. This bill threaten the citizens, economy, and environment of Ontario.  Now I will end my comment with a question: How can we progress economically, if there is nowhere to progress? How can we progress if there is no one and nothing left to progress? Finally, if we strip the province of it's citizens of their rights, then what are we? A dictatorship that means on destroying the very fragile land and environment we live in harmony with? For I personally wouldn't want to be apart of this mad and corrupt force.

Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the
Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
Dear Mr. Helfinger and Ontario Government,
Friends of the Rouge Watershed (FRW) is a charitable ENGO with thousands of newsletter subscribers and volunteers in the eastern GTA.  FRW supports Ontario's Planning Act and related provincial laws and policies and the important role they play in evidence-based and public-interest-based planning.  FRW supports evidence-based steps to streamline the planning process, if they are rational, lawful and consistent with the health and sustainability of our watersheds, communities, ecosystems and economies.
FRW opposes Bill 66, Schedule 10 for numerous reasons, including:
1.	It breaks Premier's Fords election promise: ""the people have spoken - we won't touch the Greenbelt""
2.	It undermines rational planning and ""natural justice"" by bypassing Public Notice and consultation;
3.	It is not necessary; most municipalities already have a 25+ year supply of employment lands;
4.	It undermines important public health and safety provincial laws, plans and policies;
5.	It increases legal, economic, environmental and political risks for taxpayers and governments;
6.	It fails to improve Ontario's competitiveness and attractiveness to business.
In a May 1, 2018 Globe and Mail newspaper article, Doug Ford is quoted:  “The people have spoken − we won’t touch the Greenbelt.”  If Bill 66, Schedule 10, is approved, many Ontario residents will view this approval as a big broken promise and a favour to land speculators and developers at the expense of Ontario residents.  Modern businesses and employers are attracted to communities with good planning and transit, and beautiful greenbelts and natural amenities, not more sprawl and traffic.  There are enough existing employment lands and under-utilized urban lands to attract businesses and jobs, and to provide transit-supported affordable housing in the GTA.
Undemocratic
Bill 66, schedule 10,  would allow municipalities to pass open-for-business zoning by-laws without Public Notice, meetings or appeals.  Backroom by-laws would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans which were developed through open public and stakeholder consultation. Court decisions have upheld the public's ""natural Justice"" right to Public Notice and consultation.  Ontario's economic competitiveness and attractiveness to business will not be improved by forcing individuals and communities into the courts and voting booths to challenge undemocratic Bill 66, Schedule 10, zoning bylaws.
Unnecessary
As the attached table outlines, GTA municipalities already have surplus lands for locating new businesses.   With some 2,588 hectares of vacant employment lands and an annual absorption rate  of 71 hectares/year over the last five years, York Region already has a 36 year supply. Durham Region has more than a fifty year supply of vacant employment lands. There are plenty of strip malls on transit serviced roads which could be re-developed to provide affordable housing and small business opportunities while supporting transit.
Undermining the Greenbelt and Water Protection
Bill 66, Schedule 10 zoning bylaws would not have to be consistent with Provincial Policy Statements (2014) under the Planning Act and they would not need to conform with important provincial ""public interest"" laws, plans and policies, including:
•          Great Lakes Protection Act (2015); Source Water Protection Act; Lake Simcoe Protection Act;
•          Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Acts and Plans (2017);
•          Clean Water Act (2006) and Toxic Reduction Act (2009);
•          Growth Plan for the Great Golden Horseshoe (2017).
According to legal analyses, the declaration of a Bill 66 open for business zoning bylaw could prevent the municipality from applying not just one but all of the aforementioned provincial laws, plans and policies.
Undermining Public Health and Safety - Serious Legal, Financial and Political Risks
By facilitating the bypassing of ""due diligence"" laws, plans and policies, Bill  66 Schedule 10 puts municipal and provincial governments at greater legal, financial, environmental and political risk.  In the Walkerton E. coli tragedy,  the Ontario Government of Mike Harris was found partially responsible. Ontario taxpayers have paid most of the damages according to an April 10, 2018 article in the Globe and Mail:
""$65.5-million has been paid to more than 9,200 individual claimants. A further $13-million has been paid to Crawford and Co.(Canada), the adjusters overseeing the compensation plan under the auspices of the courts.""
In its draft submission on Bill 66, Schedule 10, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) states:
""The Provincial Policy Statement, the Acts listed above, and their associated policies and/or plans are vital to the long-term sustainability, health, and safety of the people of Ontario""...
""Bill 66 proposes to override the need to conform to significant threat policies, which were mandated and approved by the Province in Source Protection Plans under the Clean Water Act"" and ""creates risks of more contaminated water illnesses and in a worst case scenario loss of life.""
""the [proposed] changes ... significantly diminish our ability to...  protect drinking water, sensitive lands, and aquatic and natural heritage resources""
""Without the comprehensive tests afforded by the various pieces of identified legislation and regulations, there could be inadvertent and undesirable impacts ...  to adjacent and downstream properties ...   including flooding, groundwater contamination, loss of critical habitat function or linkages, and the loss of productive agricultural lands that provide important environmental functions.""
A 2014 Report for the Credit Valley Conservation Authority (Stormwater Management in Ontario: Legal Issues in a Changing Climate) prudently notes:
""all orders of government can be sued for negligence in relation to their operational decisions, ... each order of government has a strong incentive to consider its existing procedures and systems in light of new information, including ...  climate change.""
In 2013, flooding damage cost Toronto almost $1 billion and Calgary almost $5 Billion.  Even as climate change gathers steam and upstream development leads to more runoff and pollution, our provincial government is spending $Millions to fight carbon pricing / taxing which most economist support as the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon pollution and combat costly climate change damages.  As Governments delay action, our liabilities grow.  Insurance companies and damage victims are increasingly launching and winning law suits against governments, particularly if ""due diligence"" is lacking.
Instead of passing Bill 66 Schedule 10, Ontario should be encouraging efficient urban form and helping municipalities to protect and restore forests and wetlands.  This will absorb carbon and water, and reduce the growing costs of pollution, flooding and erosion.
According to a September 24th, 2018 article in the Calgary Herald newspaper:
""Property and casualty insurance payouts in Canada have more than quadrupled in the last nine years to an average of $1.8 billion. While it’s troubling for the insurance industry, it’s financially catastrophic for individuals and for governments that bear three to four times that cost...
""the Insurance Bureau’s report, Combating Canada’s Rising Flood Costs, says conservation and restoration of so-called “natural infrastructure” - wetlands, forests and floodplains  ... ""is both cheaper and more beneficial""
 
Conclusion
Bill 66, Schedule 10 is a developer's dream, and a potential citizen and governmental nightmare.  Bill 66 Schedule 10 should not be passed.  It is not necessary since most municipalities already have a 25+ year supply of employment lands.  There are already enough under-utilized urban lands (e.g. strip malls) to attract businesses, and provide transit-supported jobs and affordable housing, particularly in the GTA.
Bill 66 Schedule 10 is contrary to important laws and policies for protecting green-space, farmland, water and air quality, public health and safety, and our quality of life.  If it is passed, Bill 66, Schedule 10, will be seen by most voters as a favour to land speculators and developers at the expense of Ontario residents.
Make no mistake, if Bill 66 Schedule 10 is approved, it will increase land speculation and development within the Greenbelt contrary to the Premier's promise that ""we won't touch the Greenbelt"".  It will  encourage costly and inefficient infrastructure expansions and transit-deficient growth.  It will increase pollution, taxes and traffic.  All this is contrary to the interests of Ontario residents.
Sincerely,
Jim Robb,

In particular, Schedule 5 will encourage relaxation of pollution controls and increase the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals for people and other organisms.  Schedule 10 will have long term serious negative effects on biodiversity.  The greenbelt offers secure habitat for many species including a number of endangered species (Jefferson's salamander, red-sided dace, hooded and Canada warblers among other interior forest birds).  It also offers an important corridor for the movement of individuals into suitable habitats that may have been extirpated.  This ability to move among areas of suitable habitat is a necessity for species that live in metapopulations.  There are many other reasons for maintaining the greenbelt in perpetuity.
With an increased need to reduce carbon emissions and a push for local food, loss of agricultural land is critically harmful.  Opening the greenbelt to development puts this land at risk and promotes the expansion of municipal boundaries in a time when they need to be held firm to reduce sprawl and allow sufficient densification for efficient transit alternatives.  The climate crisis requires much more improvement in transportation and loss of local croplands and urban sprawl are antithetical to minimizing emissions and limiting climate change.

20613,/comment/20613,"Minister Clark,
We the undersigned are pleased to provide the following comments on the proposed Open For Business legislation that was recently introduced in the Legislature.
We are the community associations and city councillor for Kitchissippi ward in Ottawa. We have a depth of experience in planning processes.
For over a decade, the Provincial Policy Statement and the City’s Official Plan have directed significant intensification to our ward, which is a mix of “downtown” and inner suburban residential neighbourhoods, significant institutional and private employment centres, and municipal and federal greenspaces, bordered by the Ottawa River, the arterial Carling Avenue, and with a vibrant traditional mainstreet as its heart.
Our communities rely on the many protections built into land use planning processes that have been developed over the years to ensure that residents’ voices are heard in planning, as well as provide the protections and mitigations that have been built in to ensure that intensification is sustainable from a quality of life point of view.
Broadly speaking we are concerned that the protection of greenspace and our natural environment, the important role the public plays in guiding significant new developments, and the requirement that large developments contribute positively to intensifying neighbourhoods should not be subject to ad hoc municipal decision-making. While we have a great deal of respect for the City of Ottawa’s professional planning staff, we are concerned that the Open For Business legislation will make it easier for politicians to bypass important protections and ignore good planning practices when large employment project opportunities are presented to municipal Councils.
We are further concerned that the opportunity to understand this legislation’s significant implications for land-use planning and environmental protection is unduly time-constrained. The public comment period was opened on December 6, 2018 and closes on January 20, 2019; a period of time where local governments and citizens are typically focused on holidays, resulting in very few working days for either to adequately review the proposed changes.
Given that our expertise and community focus is in the area of planning, our comments on the proposed Open For Business legislation are mainly in respect of Schedule 10, Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.Our review has identified a number of concerns specific to the proposed significant exemptions to the current Planning Act.
SCHEDULE 10 MINISTRY OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND HOUSING
Non Application of Planning Act Provisions:
Provincial Policy Statement (PPS)
The purpose of the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) is to provide policy guidelines as to how our cities should evolve. It is meant to serve as a safety net safeguarding the public interest. The current PPS is the product of the Province’s long-standing and carefully crafted land use review process; one that included extensive public consultation.
Authorizing municipalities to exempt themselves from the requirements of this foundational land use planning document is a radical step; one that, if taken, fundamentally undermines the PPS and risks rendering it all but meaningless.
This is in large part because Bill 66 provides no guidelines as to what aspects of the PPS could be waived for eligible development proposals and, at the same time, it short-circuits the public consultation process.
In so doing, Bill 66 opens the door to hurried ad hoc decision-making and spot zoning. Neither is desirable.
Bill 66 increases regulatory uncertainty for businesses, for cities and for residents despite all three stakeholder groups much preferring the opposite.
What’s needed at this stage before Bill 66 becomes law is a fuller description of what the responsible Minister would consider acceptable exemptions from existing policies, legislation and regulations in a municipality’s Open For Business by-law and what, if anything, he would not.
Good public policy would require the incremental benefit of any new law, regulation or by-law to exceed its costs. However, Bill 66 includes no such requirement. Absent a regulatory impact assessment, including cost-benefit analysis, what criteria will assist the Minister in deciding whether to approve a proposed Open For Business by-law? How would the Minister know whether the compromises made for the sake of fast-tracking a development proposal are appropriate?
We have difficulty envisioning any worthwhile large-scale development proposal that requires municipal and Ministerial approval so quickly as to justify minimizing or even potentially excluding public participation in the planning process. To the contrary, the larger and more impactful an Open For Business development proposal is, the greater the need to ensure it receives timely unhurried consideration by all affected stakeholder groups.
In short, Bill 66 merits more careful consideration; including a more fulsome public consultation than the January 20, 2019 comment deadline provides.
We commend the Province for promoting growth and economic development. These are laudable goals in support of strong families, strong communities and a strong Provincial economy. However, we suggest Bill 66 would benefit from additional safeguards that better ensure new employment and economic development opportunities are pursued without eroding core land use, policy planning and governance principles.
Our overarching concern is that to pursue growth at the expense of sound land use policies and planning practices may produce impressive growth statistics in the short term but not necessarily the growth that produces the long-term prosperity and sustainability that we all want. Faster results are not always better results.
Conformity with Official Plans
The concerns we raise with respect to the PPS are even more applicable with respect to the Official Plan.
Ottawa is set to refresh its Official Plan. Like all previous OPs, it will be the product of extensive research, widespread public discussion and collaboration with key stakeholder groups over the next several years regarding current and future land use throughout the metropolitan area. The new Ottawa OP is expected to identify where industrial development should optimally be focussed.
Bill 66 allows – in effect it encourages – cities to override their carefully developed OPs. It enables them to decide on a case-by-case basis which specific development proposals are to be given fast-track approval as well as where they may be built and under what arbitrary conditions. By so doing, Bill 66 unduly politicizes the development application process.
A level playing field is essential to a well-functioning marketplace where all are able to enter and participate on equal terms, subject to the same rules. Frankly, we are somewhat surprised that the Provincial Government would be open to forsaking so fundamental a principle. Neither the Province nor our cities should be in the business of picking commercial/ industrial favourites. Our landscapes are pock-marked with too many resulting craters. The role of government is to create a level playing field with clear rules that all players should follow so that no single applicant is given an advantage over others. Ignoring sound planning rules on an ad-hoc basis can also be seen as an inappropriate subsidy for certain applicants.
Height and density by-laws
Our municipality has undertaken in recent years thorough reviews, that have included significant public consultation, of zoning by-laws and other planning documents that address height, density, frontages, yard and other provisions affecting both residential and non-residential zones. Providing new regulation that could override these planning instruments in an ad hoc manner, without reference to the local context that has informed them, would be a retrograde and unjustifiable step.
Site Plan approval
Ottawa is in the final stages of updating its site plan control approval process to make it faster, more efficient and more economical. It is an object lesson in how to fast-track and otherwise improve business processes without unduly compromising the benefits of public consultation and due process. A similar Province-wide approach strikes us as a better alternative to eliminating site plan control for “Open For Business” proposals.
Proposed Amendments to the Planning Act:
Bill 66 provides for numerous exemptions from the requirements of the Planning Act. Particularly concerning are exemptions from the following:
Sections 34 (10.1) to (10.6)
We are all for reducing red-tape wherever appropriate. However, allowing Council not to obtain information it may need to decide whether to adopt an Open For Business proposal strikes us as both unnecessary and counterproductive.
Section 34 (7)
Section 34 (7) sets out a requirement to make public the particulars for a proposed by-law amendment. No “Open For Business” by-law application, regardless of its merits, should ever be adopted under the cover of darkness. Revoking the public’s right to know in advance of its being adopted is no trivial matter. It should never be done except under exceptionally exigent circumstances, with fulsome justification and appropriate stakeholder consultation.
In creating a large informational asymmetry between stakeholders, Bill 66 unduly reduces the transparency integral to the the checks and balances and the principles of accountability that underpin our democratic institutions. That, in our view, is too a high price to pay for the sake of marginal gains in regulatory efficiency.
No appeal to LPAT
Bill 66 revokes the right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeals Tribunal (LPAT). This is a step not to be taken lightly. The right of appeal is no less a core principle of good governance than the right of the public to timely, comprehensive and accurate information.
Denying the right of appeal a priori undermines accountability and transparency. The right of appeal serves as a process for error correction and for clarifying the law. We urge that this Bill 66 measure be withdrawn.
We would note that all parties supported the establishment of the new LPAT system so we do not understand why it should be so quickly undermined.
No notice or requirement for public meeting
According to the documentation circulated by the Province, planning by-law changes will no longer be automatically subject to public consultation and will be at the discretion of the municipality, requiring public notice only after the by-law is passed.
This is an unacceptable approach to planning for a number of reasons related to principles of good governance and procedural fairness:
Transparency and Openness: Decisions would be made behind closed doors, and the credibility of the planning process would be damaged. This is contrary to principles of good decision-making.
Equality and access: Failing to notify citizens who might be affected by proposals under the act denies these citizens of their rightful opportunity to understand, evaluate and comment on these potential changes. This creates a system based on inequality of access to information and influence, and is contrary of the principles of democracy.
Representation and Accountability: Citizens would no longer participate in decision-making and the decisions taken by public officials would not be subject to adequate oversight.
Trust and Respect: Public trust in planning processes will quickly erode and respect for the outcome of this behind-closed-door decision-making related to planning will be lost.
Other Open For Business provisions
Also of concern is Schedule 5 which would repeal the Toxics Reduction Act by 2021. This would be a retrograde step, running contrary to current concerns and efforts related to preservation of the environment.
Facilitating trade-offs between employment growth and economic development on the one hand and environmental safety and public health on the other should be discouraged as much as is practicable, not encouraged.
We recognize that reasonable compromises may be necessary from time to time. However, when they are, a heavy burden of proof for the necessity of making such compromises should always rest with with those seeking exemptions that put public health and safety at greater risk. In this regard, Bill 66 looks looks to be a large misstep in the opposite direction.
We have similar concerns with respect to Schedule 10’s exempting Open For Business applications from the protections provided under Section 39 of the Clean Water Act, 2006 and the Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015.
We would ask you to take an imaginary journey with us to a water source polluted with toxins from an Open For Business development that has been granted an exemption from the protections of these Provincial laws. Would you be willing to drink? Would anyone? Should anyone ever be put in a position where this is even an option?
If the Province and a municipality approve an “Open For Business” application that gives a developer legal cover to compromise the health and wellness of a community, we would ask where would the legal liability to cover the remediation costs lie? We note that Bill 66 is silent on this.
Conformity with Greenbelt Plan
The proposal to exempt conformity with the Greenbelt Plan, while specific to the Greater Toronto Area, is of concern to Ottawa residents where a similar Greenbelt is also a legacy for future generations, providing greenspace, habitat, recreation space and agricultural lands. We understand and cherish the value the Greenbelt provides in this City, and understand the desire shared by many in Ontario that this important amenity should be preserved.
Conclusion
We are prepared to explore all of these concerns with the Ministry in any form or forum it may consider appropriate, and would be grateful for the opportunity to expand on these and how we consider they might affect our community. My office can help facilitate a conversation by writing to jeff.leiper@ottawa.ca. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

During the election, you promised to protect the Greenbelt and you recently released a “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan which made the same commitment.
Provincial and municipal data show there is enough land already available in our towns and cities for our housing needs up to 2041. There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks..

To increase the number of children allowed in unlicensed home daycares will only increase the risk of injury and death.
How could it possibly make things safer?

This issue hits close to home in Hamilton where my family lives. We are very worried about the negligent and cavalier attitude the Ford government has towards the health impacts of this Bill. It will affect us by the air we breathe, the land we live on and the water we drink. We also worry about other important areas of Ontario like the Great Lakes and Oak Ridges.
If the sitting government can't find a better and more socially responsible way to make the Province more prosperous in a way that doesn't benefit only the very few, at the grave expense of the majority, then it doesn't deserve the position of power it has.

Dear Minister Clark
I am writing to you on behalf of the Champlain Park Community Association, located in the central west area of the City of Ottawa.  We are deeply engaged with Planning and Intensification projects, issues and processes, including by-law development and regulatory frameworks, both within our own community, and more broadly throughout the City.
We are writing to express our concerns related to Bill 66 – Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act . We recognize the need for public policies that allow Ontario municipalities to respond to changing and growing economies and populations and to ensure that development keeps pace with growth.  However, we feel that this bill goes much further than is required to attain that goal and undermines the safeguards and democratic processes that the current planning framework and environmental protection regulations provide.
We have participated in discussions and co-signed more detailed letters with other community associations (letter from Jeff Lieper, our City Councillor, and also from the Federation of Citizens' Associations of Ottawa).
A summary of our concerns is as follows.
•	Introducing the possibility of short-circuiting  processes, by-laws and regulations in the existing planning documents (Zoning by-laws, Site Plan Control, the Planning Act, the Official Plan and Provincial Policy Statement)
•	Weakening or elimination of health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations and protections that could have far-reaching impacts in a broad geographic area
•	Creation of selective regulatory measures creating uncertainty for not only prospective investors but for all Ontarians
•	Weakening of the democratic planning process by:
     o	elimination of the requirement for public consultation
     o	the loss of the right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal
Development proposals that could potentially come under regulation of Bill 66 can have significant impact not only in the zone in which they are located, but also on the surrounding residential neighbourhoods and beyond.  In summary we oppose the introduction of Bill 66 as it is currently drafted and request the opportunity for broader and more detailed public consultation and consideration of the issues that we and others have expressed.
Sincerely,
Lynne Bankier, Co-Chair, On Behalf of the Board,
Champlain Park Community Association (CPCA)

I grew up Woolwich Township, and went to high school in Elmira, and I moved back to the area to raise my child.  As a child I spent time visiting family from the Walkerton area.  Both these towns have a lot going for them, but the terrible water issues they've suffered have left deep scars.
Human beings will not be able to drink the water in our town in my lifetime, and likely not even in my grandchildren's lifetime.  The laws protecting the health of our people and out environment are better than they were, but I expect they could be improved.  Going the other way is simply not an option.  I invite anyone who thinks otherwise to drop by my town and drink the water under our feet rather than the tap water we pipe in from Waterloo.
I agree with our town councillor who expressed anger at the provincial government's implication that Woolwich Township isn't ""open for business.""  And another who said we don't need or want businesses that can't operate within existing laws that protect our water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being.
Urban sprawl is expensive, and I'm lucky to live in a place that has worked hard to responsibly manage growth through regional and municipal planning based on evidence and citizen consultation.
Parcels of land, factories, farms, cities, towns and hamlets aren't islands; they share the environment that supports us all.  Our current regional planning procedures ensure that the use we make of our lands don't harm our neighbours.   We all need a healthy environment.
Kitchener-Conestoga is a predominantly rural riding.  Pesticides are killing off our bee population: we need stronger environmental law.  The farms that surround the settlement areas and knit Waterloo Region together are important if we want to eat.
But the safety of our water and our land is only part of the problem with Bill 66.  Omnibus Bills are never a good thing.  Democracy doesn't serve the public if laws are rushed through willy nilly without making use of the democratic procedures that subject them to scrutiny, so they are properly formed.
I have not had the time to read through the 22 other laws Bill 66 will change, but it is inconceivable that your government would strip away what feeble protections we have in the Wireless Services Agreements Act 2013.  If there are any good parts in Bill 66, they can be pulled out and introduced as standalone laws.
As bad as everything I do know about Bill 66 is, the worst to me is your government's attempt to strip public consultation out of the process.  That was one of the things your predecessors got very wrong. My friend has been trying to set up an appointment with our MPP without success.  This is still a democracy, isn't it?
In case there is any doubt, I am writing this to tell you to withdraw Bill 66.

20635,/comment/20635,"The exemptions in Schedule 10 of Bill 66 threaten to undermine the necessary overarching regulatory framework that ensures municipal decisions adhere to basic standards of environmental protection, to ensure the health of the wider environment in the province. This Schedule should be removed from the Bill.
The province must ensure that local planning and development decisions are taken with prudent standards of due diligence and basic care for the portions of waterways and green spaces within each municipality’s borders. A local interest may not align with the wider, long-term needs of the environment, which affects all Ontarians.
Of further concern is that Schedule 10 would allow “Open for Business” bylaws to be passed without prior public notice or consultation. This does not respect our democratic process, and might lead to the passage of bylaws contrary to the wishes or interests of a community, and with no substantive recourse.
Potentially, this could allow one municipality to take a decision with negative consequences for the health and safety of water supplies downstream, affecting the health and environment not for its residents, but for those of neighbouring municipalities and more distant communities. Combined with the lack of public notice or consultation, this could be disastrous.
I live in a community that gets its water supply from a river. I should not need to worry about the safety of my drinking water because of poor environmental stewardship upstream.  I do not want to walk along the river shore and find dead fish because another municipality exempted itself from important provincial legislation.
Direct protections for large waterways and water systems, as well as key green spaces that act as aquifers, are needed to safeguard the supply of clean water for all Ontarians. We need clean and healthy ecosystems to provide this both for ourselves, and for future generations. This duty to protect natural resources must be taken seriously, as there is no “undo” button if they are destroyed by poorly-planned or short-sighted over-development. The future of Ontario should belong to all Ontarians, not just developers and business owners. Reducing red tape for businesses now is of no benefit if it reduces the quality of life for all Ontarians later.

Schedule 10 is an attack on the existing and necessary Provincial controls on development within the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment. Those controls are there to protect these precious resources for all Ontarians, now and in the future. Premier Ford promised during the election campaign that he would not remove these protections.

I am very concerned about some of the proposed changes and the vagueness of the wording of the proposed bill 66 information available on the ERO for review.
Many of the schedules listed contain no link to the actual act so that I can be informed easily without having to go and search for each individual act.
I also just recently hear about this bill (literally a few days ago) and the changes to some of the acts that are proposed. The time line for the public to review and comment on any of the items in the bill is too short as well as at a very busy time of the year for anyone to take notice or to take the time to conduct a thorough review of any of the proposed changes.
Lastly there are far too many items or schedules included in this one bill for all involved to take the time to thoroughly and thoughtfully investigate what changes this government is proposing.
Why is the government rushing to make these changes in such a short time period...this government was just elected in June of 2018 so why so many changes all at once? I want to know how much time and what kind of resources have they put into the review and decision making process which made them decide to put this proposal forward for public input in order to further move the proposal to the legislation.

We are already having the most rapid decline in wildlife species in history with the rate of species extinction happening more rapidly than ever.

20645,/comment/20645,"Please remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.
This schedule is of concern because it grants municipalities the ability to exempt themselves from important provisions in a host of vital pieces of provincial environmental protection legislation. Every one of these bills – The Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, and others – exist for a reason and purpose, and have been created and passed based on our decades of collective experience as Ontarians. Our water supply, our major waterways, and our key green spaces need to be protected from short-sighted municipal decisions taken out of perceived short-term local interest.  To ensure the long term health of all Ontarians, we need clean water and health, functional, connected ecosystems. Natural systems are large, and most extend across multiple municipalities.
For example, the Oak Ridges Moraine is the aquifer that provides the headwaters for 22 river systems across the GTA, filtering rainwater, maintaining ground water supply, and ultimately feeding clean water into Lake Ontario along a significant section of its shoreline. The Oak Ridges Moraine simultaneously acts as a key ecological corridor, which permits gene flow between plant and animal populations on either side of the GTA, keeping open a connection vital for the long-term sustainability of our southern ecoregions, which contain many species not found farther to the north in the province. Furthermore, it also provides reasonable access to outdoor recreation opportunities for millions of people in the GTA, and as part of the Greenbelt, hosts a growing ecotourism industry. For myself, visits to see family in the GTA also include daytime excursions to hike in this area and visit local cafes and farmers’ markets  - and I always appreciate that I can drink the tap water. Appropriate protection for the Oak Ridges Moraine requires provincial oversight to guarantee coordination among every municipality found along its length.
To ensure municipal decisions are not damaging to the “big picture”, this requires continued coordination and regulation at the provincial level. Otherwise, a local decision made for a short-term local gain can have permanent deleterious effects on the quality of the environment of that municipality’s neighbours, other communities downstream, and the province as a whole.
To ensure future generations of Ontarians continue to benefit from the ecological services of a healthy, clean environment, including clean drinking water, please remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.

20647,/comment/20647,"I am writing because I care deeply for the Greenbelt and water of this beautiful province. When I heard about this Bill I was deeply disturbed. I have never submitted a comment before on a Bill but felt compelled to submit a comment because of the seriousness of this Bill, the the implication it has for the farms, wild spaces, species and water of Ontario.
Having watched the rate of urban development of Toronto and surrounding areas over the last 10 years, I am alarmed to hear of the proponents in this bill that would allow businesses to ignore rules outlined in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act.  And shocked to hear that this bill could allow the Greenbelt to be opened up for industrial development and urban sprawl.
The Greenbelt protects 2 million acres of Ontario farmland, forests, and nature.  It protect beautiful natural spaces that can be saved for generations to come. I value the eco-systems and the species that live in those places. I take great solace in this places, and for them to be destroyed breaks my heart.
It is a kind of madness that would allow those greenspaces to be lost, for money.  What will be lost would be far greater than any money could buy.   There are many other ways that business can be stimulated in Ontario communities, that don't involve irreparable damage to our greenspaces.

In society today, not everyone can be rich. Not everybody wants that. But we need to ensure that ALL Ontarians are given equal opportunity to contribute to society in a way that they are best capable of. This can only be done through education, and support of regional social support services. I am a single mom and an autistic child. My child cannot attend daycare or have a babysitter, making it impossible for me to work  because available jobs only during school hours dont exist. We are on the OAP waiting list for respite services, and I cannot work until that comes through. We have already been waiting nearly 18mths and my savings have been completely drained.
Development is short-term work, it unneccessarily destroys the environment. If we want to create jobs through building, then we need to look more seriously at taking old buildings, areas that are already developed, and figure out how to use those spaces more efficiently. Not every town needs a super centre. Big businesses dont need more support. Society is moving away from this type of consumerism, and are starting to increase demand and support for local farmers, local shops, and small businesses. We need invest in those people. Farmers should be getting our biggest subsidies and tax breaks.
Internet needs to be considered a neccessity. The average person cannot keep up with inflation. Housing is unaffordable: we can scrape by monthly payments but seeing as most housing costs over $500,000 a down payment is near impossible for most people.
Also, OHIP is our provinces crown jewel. We need more support into that. If big businesses (like walmart, loblaws, Bell, etc) can inflate their prices for the sole purposes of increasing or maintaining their profit margins, then they need to be held to a higher standard of environmental protection, benefits for employees, paying into social service programs, and paying their employees a living wage.

Bill 66 affects existing laws and regulations at many Ministries, not just the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks.  It detrimentally affects the protections for workers in many separate regulations, detrimentally affects the protections for children in childcare, detrimentally affects seniors and patients in long-term care, and detrimentally affects consumers protections from wireless carriers. This is not an exhaustive list.
Bill 66 detrimentally affects environmental regulations more than any other. Under Schedule 10 municipalities no longer have to follow the regulations under the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, Greenbelt Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, among many others.
Ontario and its municipalities have experienced the greatest prosperity in the last ten years, without needing to circumvent the environmental protections put in place by previous Conservative and Liberal governments.  Removing these protections now will pit one municipality against another -- if one municipality allows development in a protected area, it creates pollution for all the downwind and downstream neighbours, both in that municipality as well as surrouding municipalities.  There will be increased infrastructure costs for those municipalities that receive the extra traffic from the development, but none of the anticipated revenue.  Bill 66 is not something municipalities have asked for for, nor is it something municipalities need.
Speculators may have purchased land in the currently protected areas. Just having Bill 66 on the table has affected land values. Currently permitted uses for protected areas will become unaffordable, and the pressure on local governments to bypass environmental protections will be great.  I'm happy to see many municipalities have passed resolutions rejecting Bill 66.

The passage of the proposed Bill 66, The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, if approved as introduced to the legislature in December of 2018, will break this promise. Specifically, Schedule 10 of Bill 66 allows The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act to override the provisions of section 7 of The Greenbelt Act, when these two acts are in conflict. Similarly, Schedule 10 also gives similar provision of Bill 66 to override section 39 of The Clean Water Act. Both environmental protection acts are essentially gutted by Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
The Greenbelt Act prevents uncontrolled urban and suburban expansion from compromising food production and ecosystem services, both essential and recreational, close to the huge population of Ontario’s ‘Golden Horseshoe.’ This geographic area contains a significant proportion of Ontario’s best farmland and many landscapes of ecological, aesthetic and recreational significance. It must be protected if the quality of life for the residents of urban, suburban and rural inhabitants is to be maintained. Healthy food is essential and its production close to consumers is an increasingly important factor.
Similarly, The Clean Water Act protects the quality of water for all uses, domestic and industrial, for the highly concentrated population of southern Ontario as well as for other regions of Ontario. Healthy water is not an option, and the tragedy of Walkerton immediately comes to mind when protection of drinking water sources is compromised.
The goals of The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act may be largely desirable, but not at the expense of provincial treasures such as the Greenbelt’s protection of food production and close to home access to natural areas for residents of southern Ontario, and at the expense of jeopardizing the quality of drinking water supplies.
The Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act must be amended to remove its ability to override section 7 of The Greenbelt Act and section 39 of The Clean Water Act.

20669,/comment/20669,"Dundas Valley Tree Keepers (DVTK) Comments on the Proposed Bill 66: Schedule 10
Thanks to a workshop hosted by Environment Hamilton at Knox Presbyterian Church in Dundas on January 15th, 2019, I am better informed about the environmentally destructive powers of the proposed Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, introduced in the Legislature on December 6th 2018) and the ways in which individual citizens and environmental groups can voice their opposition.  As pointed out by EH staff, Bill 66 will open up Ontario’s Greenbelt for industrial, commercial and residential development (Greenbelt Act, 2005), undermine drinking water regulations (Clean Water Act), and regulations aimed to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals that industries are allowed to release into the atmosphere (Toxic Reductions Act).
Speaking as a member of the Dundas Valley Tree Keepers, and on behalf of this group, we have particular concerns about the possibility of residential/ commercial development encroaching on the Greenbelt lands to the west of Dundas (City of Hamilton) and infill intensification in the downtown core, both of which would lead to the loss of trees and wooded areas, if Bill 66 is passed and  Hamilton City Council were to adopt Schedule 10 (Open for Business By-law).
The Dundas Valley Tree Keepers (DVTK) are a group of community volunteers who are passionate about the trees in the Dundas Valley, an area endowed with a large number and variety of trees in urban, rural and natural settings. The group formed after the completion of the first Dundas Trees Count in fall 2007.  It has successfully nominated two heritage trees for inclusion in Trees Ontario’s Heritage Tree Program: a very large tulip tree on Cross Street and a very old Chinquapin Oak in Fisher’s Mill Park at the west end of King Street.
The DVTK have educated the public about the importance of trees to the health and beauty of our environment and the threat of diseases that can wipe out and entire species, such as the ash and elm.  We have conducted guided walking tours, published a self-guided walking tour, and organized public presentations, and conducted tree surveys.
Given the very real threat of global warming, municipalities across the Province of Ontario, need to pass by-laws aimed at preserving and replenishing trees and forests both in rural and urban areas.  Trees are an extremely important environmental asset: they produce oxygen (through process of photosynthesis), improve air quality, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, and support wildlife.  Trees provide food, protection and shelter for many birds and mammals.  Our group therefore strongly opposes the undermining of any environmental legislation (such as the Greenbelt Act) that now protects the valuable resource of trees and woodlands in the Dundas Valley.

Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.
Once gone, farmland and natural areas are gone forever.
Please consider these ideas that I take from and share with others.

20671,/comment/20671,"The Whitevale and District Residents’ Association members are deeply concerned about Schedule 10 of Bill 66, “Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018”.  While Schedule 10 has far reaching implications beyond the Hamlet of Whitevale and the City of Pickering, we are particularly concerned with creating more sprawl under the guise of “open-for-business legislation”, and fear that lands within the Greenbelt could be affected. We recognize that a proposal of a mere strip mall would satisfy the threshold of 50 new jobs required for the open-for –business by law in a municipality the size of Pickering.
Pickering is now in the first stage of implementing Seaton a community that will see the addition of 37,000 new Pickering residents accommodated in Phase I alone. This number will rise to 70,000 by the time it has been built out - almost doubling Pickering's population.
The Plan for Seaton includes:
•	Employment land located along Hwy 407 currently for sale by Infrastructure Ontario (IO).
•	This land has been for sale for some time, however  there have been few sales.
•	Opening up new opportunities for employment outside of this area would directly compete with the sales goals of the Ontario Government.
The addition of Seaton to Pickering's already overburdened infrastructure has been allowed to proceed without planning to accommodate the dramatic increase in population. If Bill 66 proceeds the municipality can move to develop massive tracks of land outside the Seaton area; potentially creating chaos without having to adhere to proper planning principles for traffic, transit and other essential infrastructure required for a successful community.
We are adamant in our opposition to the Bill as we recognize that when it comes to the environment, long term planning is dramatically more important than short term financial gain.
We respectfully suggest that a more thoughtful review of this legislation is essential.

20672,/comment/20672,"To say I’m disappointed to see this Bill in the news again is a gross understatement. When our premier was caught making backroom deals with developers prior to the election, I seriously reconsidered my vote, but reconsidered after seeing him backtrack after public outcry thinking that he was listening.
The fact that we are considering pandering to the greed of developers under the guise of making Ontario more competitive is a farce. It should be about protecting our valuable greenspace and farmland and finding alternate ways to boost their value rather than stripping it for cheaply built homes that come in one of five floor plans.
I thought this government might be different and a little more industrious when it came to seeing value in what we had, but instead we have another government who is willing to sell off our greatest assets to the highest bidder. Shame on you! It makes you no different from the Liberals. How utterly disappointing!
This is a serious issue for me and my family. I can guarantee that if this Bill goes through I will throw my vote at any other party even if that means the Liberals (and that’s saying quite a bit) rather than again supporting a party that doesn’t see the value of our sensitive environment.

Farms used crop rotation to make sure they didn't deplete the soil and could keep growing indefinitely.  I'm all for developing businesses and the economy but why not do something similar for industry - i.e., alternating geographical areas: industry - greenbelt - industry - greenbelt.
Having a huge area open to industry means that it's also open to all the environmental/health problems that industry creates. By having the same-sized area open to industry, but split into two by a greenbelt means that you are taking care of the environment while lowering health costs associated with the poorer quality found in cities and still encouraging economic development.
The last thing the government wants to do is open an area for development - have businesses come in without any regard for the environment - and then have them leave when they've depleted our resources, leaving the government to clean up the mess and pay all health costs that result from their activities!

20688,/comment/20688,"I would like to register my opposition to Bill 66: An Act to restore Ontario's competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts.
I am more than concerned about the implications of Bill 66 and am disturbed to think that my provincial government would consider passing such a broad sweeping omnibus Bill that would threaten our health, our environment, and our democracy--all under the guise of creating employment at a time when our province is experiencing its lowest unemployment rate in 20 years.
Reading through the Bill and all the regulations and Acts that are being amended or repealed, it is very clear that this Bill represents an attempt to satisfy business interests at the expense of those of everyday Ontarians—the very people that the government is supposed to serve.
As the scope of this public consultation regarding Bill 66 is environmental in nature, I will limit my comments to the damaging impacts of Schedules 5 and 10 of the Bill.
HEALTH
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 specifically indicates that under the Bill’s proposed new “open for business” bylaw, new developers would be exempt from key environmental protections and policies including The Greenbelt Act, The Clean Water Act, The Great Lakes Protection Act, The Lake Simcoe Act, and The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act. This is a serious threat to the environment, health, and lives of Ontarians. These Acts, regulations, and policies were put in place to protect our incredibly important green spaces, farmland, natural heritage, and drinking water. Repealing them for new development purposes serves business interests at the expense of human and environmental health.
Furthermore, Schedule 5 suggests repealing the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009, and the regulations that were enacted with it--posing a serious threat to both our health and environment. The Toxics Reduction Act was established to prevent pollution in Ontario by reducing the use and release of toxins by industry in the province. Its purpose does not overlap that of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which serves to gather and record information on toxins released by industries across Canada. CEPA does not focus on preventing the use or release of toxins, nor does it cover all toxic substances identified in Ontario, and this is why Ontario introduced the Toxics Reduction Act. Repealing this Act in the name of attracting new businesses is not in the best interest of any community, and puts our air, water, land, and health at risk.
ENVIRONMENT
In addition to the environmental threats mentioned above, Schedule 10 of the Bill threatens our farmland and environmentally sensitive natural heritage. Across Ontario, we have more than enough serviced land available for development and employment. Opening up our protected green spaces for development would increase urban sprawl, increase property taxes (due to increased costs to provide services to residents over a greater area), and impact our environment and climate resilience. Encouraging unnecessary urban sprawl is irresponsible, especially in light of the urgent need for all municipalities and provinces to reduce their carbon emissions. In fact, green spaces and farmland help sequester carbon, reduce air pollution, and help regulate climate and need better protections—not having their protections removed. Green spaces and farmland also provide valuable flood protection and water capture and filtration services, which help lower infrastructure costs and keep taxes lower. Repealing the Acts listed for new development purposes serves business interests at the expense of responsible development and sustainable growth.
DEMOCRACY
Schedule 10’s amendments to the Planning Act that would create an open-for-business bylaw that would remove the public’s right to be informed of, to be consulted on, and to appeal any new development violates the very essence of what democracy is about. The bylaw would tempt municipalities to violate publicly agreed-upon transportation and municipal growth plans all for short-term gains. It is transparent that this provision has been put in place to hasten and implement deals that would not be supported by citizens who should have the right to participate in decisions affecting their neighbourhoods, communities, and environment.
Bill 66 proposes to amend or repeal regulations were put in place to protect our society. Granting businesses licence to ignore plans, policies, and Acts that protect our environment, farmland, green spaces, farmland, and health (as the Bill sets out to achieve) is a dangerous path to take. Economic development does not have to happen at the expense of environmental protections. Ontario is already open for business: it should not be open for businesses that are wanting to pollute, harm, or destroy our environment. I urge you to remove Schedules 5 and 10 from the Bill.

20691,/comment/20691,"Comments on the Proposed Bill 66 (Environmental): Schedule 10
Thanks to a workshop hosted by Environment Hamilton at Knox Presbyterian Church in Dundas on January 15th, 2019, I am better informed about the environmentally destructive powers of the proposed Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, introduced in the Legislature on December 6th 2018) and the ways in which individual citizens and environmental groups can voice their opposition.   As pointed out by EH staff, Bill 66 will open up Ontario’s Greenbelt for industrial, commercial and residential development (Greenbelt Act, 2005), undermine drinking water regulations (Clean Water Act), and regulations aimed to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals that industries are allowed to release into the atmosphere (Toxic Reductions Act).
I share the general concerns expressed by various local and provincial environmental conservation groups, including Environment Hamilton, the Hamilton Naturalists’ Club, the Toronto Field Naturalists, Nature Ontario, Environmental Defence, and the Canadian Environmental Law Association.
The following comments focus on Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation, which would allow municipalities to create an “open-for-business planning by-law” to circumvent planning requirements and land use restrictions under numerous provincial laws, plans and policies.  Two million acres of natural areas and farmland in Ontario are currently protected under the Greenbelt Act.  As a resident of the community of Dundas in the amalgamated City of Hamilton, I was encouraged by comments recently made by Mayor Fred Eisenberger: he has stated that he is not interested in the proposed ""open for business"" by-law, if it means sacrificing land within the City’s boundaries that is now protected under the Greenbelt Plan. The following scenario describes what could happen in one part of Dundas if Schedule 10 is adopted by Hamilton City Council.   Dundas is blessed by its beautiful natural setting, bounded to the north by the escarpment, to the east by Cootes Paradise and RBG lands, to the south by the Dundas Valley Conservation Area and to the west by the Greenbelt. The Greenbelt protection begins as one approaches the end of residential development along Governor’s Road, where there is a clear transition to rolling hills, agricultural land and wooded areas.  Given the opportunity, developers would be lining up to apply for permits to build housing, commercial/ industrial operations on these greenfield lands.  This is undesirable from many standpoints:  the destruction of scenic countryside, natural habitats for wildlife, trees and woodlots, increase in the number of vehicles travelling along Governor’s Road (more cars on the road contribute to greenhouse emissions); and greenfield development anywhere requires costly infrastructure.  Governor’s Road is currently undergoing a major reconstruction project between Creighton Road and Davidson Boulevard, the street before Pirie Drive (which marks the western terminus of suburban development, bounded by a parcel of land owned by the Hamilton Conservation Authority. This project was based on the premise that the Greenbelt designation would prevent further development to the west.  Governor’s Road provides the only route into downtown Dundas from the west.  Any more traffic than it carries now (resulting from the construction of more housing) would create major points of congestion at the intersections of Creighton Road and Ogilvie Street.  The encroachment of new residential and commercial development onto Greenbelt lands in municipalities that adopt Schedule 10 be hugely detrimental from an environmental standpoint.
I therefore strongly oppose Schedule 10 of Bill 66.

Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act 2018 (ERO #013-4293)
Proposed Open-for-Business Planning Tool (ERO #013-4126)
New Regulation Under the Planning Act (ERO #013-4239)
The Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Alliance (GHFFA) is a partnership between Regional Municipalities and the Cities of Toronto and Hamilton, the farm community and organizations in the Golden Horseshoe that seek to grow and enhance the food and farming cluster of the region.  The Alliance is responsible for the implementation of the Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Action Plan 2021 which identifies pathways for a more integrated and coordinated approach to food and farming in the region.
Since the implementation of the Action Plan, the Alliance has been instrumental in advocating for significant progress at the Provincial and Municipal levels in the development of policy and guidelines in planning for:
	On Farm Secondary Uses
	Edge Planning
Harmonization of policies regarding agriculture in the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Morraine  Plan, Niagara Escarpment Plan and the Growth Plan
Protection of Prime Agricultural Lands through the implementation of the Agriculture Systems Mapping
Urban Agriculture Initiatives including ongoing input to Rouge National Park
Small Plot Farming
We have held workshops to educate planners and economic developers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe to understand the role that agriculture and food production and processing plays in driving a healthy regional economy.
The Action Plan also addresses Economic Development for growth of the Agri-Food and Food Processing Industries in the Golden Horseshoe.  The Alliance has supported:
Food Incubators in Northumberland, Toronto and Niagara College
	Taste Your Future Scholarship Program with Food and Beverage Ontario
	Development of ConnectOn – a data management program for Economic Development
	Recognition of Canada 150 Farm Families Across the Golden Horseshoe
	Serving Up Local – a project to promote local food in Long Term Care facilities
	Serving Up Local 2 – 3 year research project with the University of Guelph
Our collaborative approach to advance our shared objectives, projects and relationships between business, municipalities and provincial ministries helps each stakeholder understand and respond to the needs of the agriculture and food sector.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing circulation proposal for Bill 66 and the associated tools and proposed legislation.  The GHFFA has an ongoing interest in this process.
Stable Governance provides Stable futures
Bill 66 – Section 10 could have some grave consequences for progress that has been made to protect the finite supply of prime agricultural land in Ontario.  While the implementation of the Greenbelt in 2005 was seen to be a boon for some farmers and a lost opportunity for others depending where the line landed, over time, the policies of the Greenbelt have reduced fragmentation of agricultural lands over 1.8 million acres of farmland and provided certainty for the farmers that wish to reinvest in their operations.  Farmers require long term stability in their operations to help transition their farm businesses to the next generation of farmers.  Extreme swings in policy from one government to the next creates uncertainty and instability to these Greater Golden Horseshoe operations.
The lands in Southern Ontario provide the citizens of Ontario with food, fibre and fuel as well as environmental and ecological goods and services.  These lands must be protected for the long term through consistent, harmonized Provincial Policies.  Allowing municipalities to create a patchwork of “exemptions” through this proposed bylaw will fragment further and diminish the best agriculture land in Canada.
Protection of Land, Air and Water
As stewards of the land, farmers have shown their support of the protection of water resources, air quality and protection of high-quality agricultural lands.   The Growth Plan states that a balanced approach to the wise use and management of all resources, including natural heritage, agriculture and water protection will be implemented.
Introduction of Bill 66 would allow “open-for-business planning by-laws” to be passed by municipalities.  Our understanding is that the bill would have the effect of exempting applications under the Planning Act from having to be consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (2014).  This bylaw would allow the applicant to avoid conforming  to important planning, water, agricultural and environmental protections contained in the Clean Water Act 2006, the Greenbelt Act 2005, The Great Lakes Protection Act and the Places to Grow Act and other provincial legislation.  The Alliance finds this move to be regressive and suggests that the government already has a tool – Minister’s Zoning Orders - to accomplish the same thing in extreme cases, should it be required.
In addition, the bylaw would permit municipalities to pass an ‘open-for-business” bylaw if certain criteria are met, one of which would be evidence that the proposal would meet a minimum job creation threshold (e.g. 50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000 people or 100 jobs for municipalities with a population of more than 250,000 people).  The planning tool also states that this tool could be used for “economic growth opportunities” and “prescribed purposes”. These opportunities and purposes have not yet been defined and are to be prescribed at a later date.   The building industry is excited about this statement as they feel new housing developments may now be considered under this bylaw.  The Alliance feels that housing subdivisions and other non-compatible land uses should not be allowed to come up against prime agricultural lands under this bylaw.   The ambiguity that exists in these statements should give pause to all.
Bill 66 proposes to override the need to conform to significant drinking water threat policies which were mandated and approved by the Province in Source Protection Plans under the Clean Water Act.  Eliminating the ability to protect water sources will lead to serious degradation of water sources and a threat to public health
Bill 66 would not require new businesses to adhere to the same acts that existing businesses and municipalities would.  This will be especially important under the Clean Water Act and other Source Water Protection legislation.  Residents, municipalities and conforming businesses should not be expected to pay extra for cleaning up after new industries that are not subject to these regulations in the name of “open for business”.
AgriFood is an Economic Driver for the Province
Sixty-five percent of the agricultural production of Ontario is purchased and processed in Food Processing facilities in Ontario contributing 40 Billion dollars to Ontario’s economy.  Over half of those companies and facilities are located in the Golden Horseshoe and provide approximately 65,000 jobs in food processing alone.  Diminishing the productive land base in Ontario will mean that ingredient production and jobs will move out of the province.
The Alliance supports the Growth plan targets for intensification of urban municipalities.  A variety of housing must be encouraged along with well developed transportation systems.  This growth should not come by development on Canada’s best land.  Firm urban boundaries are required to encourage growth up and not out.  Density makes expensive transportation systems successful tools to mitigate congestion and climate change by keeping cars off the roads and industries located close to major arteries.
The Agriculture System was mapped in 2018 to indicate where the prime agricultural lands were located and the agribusinesses, food processing and service jobs that agri-food network supports.  While the development industry is not in support of the Agriculture Systems mapping, the work to identify this precious resource should not be ignored.
Due Process is Important
In our democratic society, the Alliance values public consultation and providing notice in accordance with the Planning Act.  Bill 66 creates a hostile atmosphere by limiting input and consultation on large projects in a community.  Municipal politicians will be given the opportunity to ignore those who elected them.  All decisions are final and cannot be appealed.  This is not the way we wish to do business – open or not!
Subsection (6)15 of Schedule 10 seems to provide an opportunity to add “any prescribed provision” to the Act in the future.  This statement creates uncertainty that we are not willing to support as any current or future act or policy could arbitrarily be added to the list of exemptions under the “open-for-business” bylaw.
It is unclear how the tool will operate in the context of the current planning framework.  Municipalities have approved official plans with identified and designated employment lands based on full servicing.   In addition, official plans have identified certain lands, based on public consultation where other community values take precedence to, to identify areas that are not suitable for employment lands.  Bill 66 seems to be able to override these approved plans to potentially site new employment opportunities in unsuitable areas.  The use of an OFBPBL should be geographically limited to existing designated employment lands with access to full municipal sewer and water services and proximity to 400 series highways and/or other major transportation corridors.
The Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Alliance are opposed to EBR Registry No. 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool.  Should this tool be implemented, years of land use planning to protect agricultural land and the economy will be undone.  A short-term gain in a few new businesses will lead to long term negative consequences for agricultural land, clean drinking water and breathable air for the residents of Ontario.
There are other ways that could shorten the time for permitting for new businesses.  We feel that implementing concierge services at the municipal level, elimination of duplication of planning approvals at different levels of government and agencies and a “problem solving” attitude will go a long way to expediting appropriate applications for new industries and job creation.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.  You may follow up with Janet Horner, Executive Director, Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Alliance janet@whitfieldfarms.com, should you have any further questions.

(a) to prevent pollution and protect human health and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances; and
(b) to inform Ontarians about toxic substances.
This Act currently requires certain industrial facilities (belonging to a class prescribed in the regulations) to develop “toxic substance reduction plans” to reduce the use or generation of toxic substances within their production processes. Emissions from manufacturing and mineral processing operations are major contributors to greenhouse gases, which in turn contribute to global warming. There are now dire warnings from scientists around the world of the consequences of not drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  That the current Conservative government would even consider removing regulations aimed at reducing pollution is completely unacceptable and irresponsible under the circumstances.  It is a giant step backward in the development of provincial strategies to combat global warming.
I therefore strongly oppose Schedule 5 of Bill 66.

I am asking that proposed changes to the Planning Act be removed from what is essentially an omnibus bill, and considered separately with a separate comment period.
Protecting the environment is hardly mentioned at all with respect to Planning Act proposed changes, and yet a number of paragraphs are devoted to building and site plan issues; this seems strange and short-sighted.  I did not see where ""prescribed purpose"" for use of land was defined - this seems unclear.
I am also deeply concerned that the Bill itself notes a number of excluded sections to various existing Acts, but does not link to that information, so that it is unclear, without a great deal of research, what is being referred to.

20700,/comment/20700,"I wish to comment on the proposed changes to the Employment Standards Act.
First, I cannot see any cost saving to not requiring employers to post the Employment Standards poster in the workplace.
This will not ""put money in the pockets of Ontarians"" since the employer is still required to have a copy of the poster on hand.
It will not ""reduce red tape"" because (supposedly) the employer still has to follow the Employment Standards Act rules.
No, this has to be a subtle encouragement to employers to mistreat their employees and keep them in the dark as to their rights.
This sickens me.
It's not fair, and it's not the Ontario I have been proud of, for so long.
Second, I am disappointed that overtime averaging will once again be allowed.  In lower paid sectors, e.g. service industries, overtime averaging makes it easy for employers to take advantage of employees and vastly overwork them (compared to normal hours) one week and then give them next to no hours for the rest of the month.  On paper it looks fair.  But the body suffers.  Workers get sick, and end up with LESS money in their pockets.

My comments are below and I have gotten my information/comments from Ontarionature.org and I totally agree with the following points. Please do not pass this bill! Ontarians DO NOT WANT IT and please don't make such a short-sighted decision. It also seems this legislation benefits a small portion of Ontarians, particularly the developers who benefit (many may not even be Ontarians). Our Greenbelt and surrounding areas are so special, support us with changes associated with climate change and provide us with local, fresh food. The future is sustainability and to this bill is so regressive and sets us back decades. Please think of future generations of Ontarians and not just developers who want to get even richer over the next 4 years. Doug Ford also promised NOT to touch the Greenbelt because Ontarians showed him how they felt about the Greenbelt - we do not want the Greenbelt developed. Some points I'd like to highlight include:
1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

This has included pushing for greater openness and transparency so that Hamiltonians living in neighbourhoods near the industrial core have information about what their industrial neighbours are doing, what risks and challenges are associated with these activities and, most importantly, what efforts are underway at these facilities to minimize and ideally eliminate any environmental impacts from these operations.  Ontario’s Toxics Reduction Act and associated regulations represents an important piece in the on-going effort to increase openness and transparency and realize progress in reducing and/or eliminating the use and release of harmful substances from industry wherever possible.   Environment Hamilton strongly opposes the proposal in Schedule 5 of Bill 66 to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act and all associated regulations.  Furthermore, because we strongly oppose the proposal to repeal the act and associated regulations, we also do not support the proposal in posting #013-4235 to create a new regulation that sets out ""Planning and reporting changes under the toxics reduction program and Ontario Regulation 455/09"".
We have had the opportunity to review the very detailed submission prepared by the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA).  CELA has undertaken an essential analysis that the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks must consider.    We continue to be deeply concerned about the generation and release of harmful substances into Hamilton’s air, water and land; Hamiltonians deserve to feel safe and healthy in our city and elimination of important protections offered in existing legislation is detrimental.   Having carefully reviewed CELA’s submission, we concur with their call, not only to keep the Toxics Reduction Act and associated regulations in place, but also to enhance provincial efforts to see industries do even more to prevent the release of toxic substances into the environment.    As CELA so effectively points out,
(T)he purpose of the TRA (Toxics Reduction Act) is to prevent pollution and protect human health
        and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and informing
        Ontarians about toxic substances. Pre-TRA legislation in Ontario (e.g. EPA, OWRA) focused on, and
        continues to focus on, pollution abatement, not pollution prevention. This problem explained,
        and continues to explain, why Ontario’s emissions of toxic substances to air, land, and water are
        some of the highest in North America.
We fully support the following recommendations made by CELA in their submission.  Recommendations include that:
1. MECP not repeal the TRA;
2. MECP not revoke the regulations or eliminate any of the planning and reporting requirements of the TRA, including the requirement on industry to prepare toxics reduction plans;
3. MECP proclaim in force sections 11, 15.1, 20.1, 26.1, 30, 38, and 50(1)(o.1)(o.2) of the Act;
4. MECP list under the TRA as substances of concern the 135 substances identified in the 2008 Discussion Paper if they are still present in commerce and the environment in Ontario; and
5. Pursuant to the authority under s. 50(1)(d) of the Act, MECP set targets relating to toxic substances under O. Reg. 455/09. 							                -CELA – Bill 66 submission
Finally, Environment Hamilton is currently preparing comments on the provincial government’s ‘Made In Ontario Environment Plan’.  In that plan there is an entire section focused on ‘Protecting Our Air, Lakes and Rivers’.  The section begins with this commitment from the provincial government:
Ontario’s water and air are life support systems for our province and our people. Pollution in our air and water increases healthcare costs, affects the enjoyment of our outdoors and contributes to lost economic opportunity. We will protect these critical systems by keeping our water and air clean while growing our economy.                                                  - Made in Ontario Environment Plan, 2018, p9
The government goes further by explaining that:
Our plan will make it easier for people to report pollution that is impacting their lives by developing an online platform for reporting incidents that allows photos or video to be sent in, as well as reporting an incident by e-mail, phone or through an app.  Additionally, we will put in place an improved complaint response system that sets out the services Ontarians can expect from inspectors and investigators when they file a complaint, and new standards on the response time they can expect based on the type of incident they report. We will be transparent about pollution incidents and spills, and provide real-time information where it is available so that people can see if a spill or incident has already been reported, as well as the status of the ministry’s response. .                                                                        - Made in Ontario Environment Plan, 2018, p9
Given this focus on improving openness and transparency combined with the expressed desire to keep our water and air clean, it makes absolutely no sense to us that the Ford Government is proposing to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act.  We believe that doing this will only make the aspirational goals set out in the ‘Made in Ontario Environment Plan’ far more difficult to reach.
SCHEDULE 10 – Ministry of Municipal Affairs & Housing & the Planning Act
Environment Hamilton strongly opposes Schedule 10 of Bill 66, which proposes amendments to the Planning Act and an associated proposal to create a regulation that would enable the development of a municipal ‘open for business planning tool’.
At the most fundamental level, we do not believe that there is any need nor do we believe there is any justification to empower municipalities to create an ‘open for business planning by-law’ in the manner set out in Bill 66.  As currently drafted, the Bill would enable municipalities to create such a by-law to pursue ‘job-creating economic development initiatives’, in a manner that would exempt the municipality from having to comply with a long list of essential planning and environmental legislation.  This would undo decades of effort – including that of previous Conservative governments – to build a legislative framework designed to help create resilient communities where economy, environment and social needs are all carefully considered and balanced.  For instance, should the City of Hamilton opt to pursue an ‘open for business planning by-law’ to facilitate a major economic investment, we understand that the undertaking would not be required to:
- Be consistent with provincial interests set out in the Provincial Policy Statement;
 	- Conform to Hamilton’s Rural and Urban Official Plans;
 	- Comply with source water protection policies in the Clean Water Act;
 	- Conform with the Great Lakes Protection Act;
 	- Conform with the Greenbelt Act;
 	- Conform with the Places to Grow Act;
 	- Be consistent with the Metrolinx Act or the Resource Recovery & Circular Economy Act.
This is not the approach to economic development that Environment Hamilton wants to see in our city and we believe a majority of Hamiltonians agree with us on this issue.   Hamilton has learned, through its history, that there is a large price to pay when the environment is sacrificed for economic gain.  We do not want to go back to the days when Hamilton pursued economic development at any cost; we are still struggling to address legacy problems that resulted from this past approach (think Randle Reef – the massive deposit of coal tar contamination on Hamilton’s harbour floor).   We are not alone in our concern; City of Hamilton planning staff have submitted comments on Schedule 10 that reinforce the concerns that we are raising here.  This makes us hopeful that the City of Hamilton will opt not to use this short-sighted tool and even pass a formal resolution to this end, like a growing list of municipalities have already done.  Despite the growing number of municipalities committing not to use this provision, we remain concerned that the ‘open for business by-law’ generates a race to the bottom among Ontario municipalities. The legislation will enable development interests to go from municipality to municipality looking for a place to utilize the open for business by law.   This will put enormous pressure on municipalities that opt not to use the by-law.   At the end of the day, we are all residents of Ontario so what happens in other parts of the province affects all of us. That is precisely why we need a provincial government that sets appropriate higher level rules to guide development in a manner designed to protect essential elements like source water, natural ecosystems, and agricultural lands.
We are also extremely concerned about the threat that an ‘open for business planning by-law’ poses to Ontario’s Greenbelt and the prime agricultural land and specialty crop land within it.  We know that Ontario has already lost too much of its prime agricultural land; we simply cannot afford to lose any more of it, especially as we face an uncertain climate future.   An essential part of successful transformation to post-carbon society is to be able to grow enough food within close range to feed local populations.   In Hamilton, we know that we have already lost too much of our farmland to achieve this goal – we cannot afford to lose any more of it to development that is better suited for brownfield sites or for already designated and unoccupied employment lands within the municipality.
Finally, we are deeply concerned about the manner in which our rights as Ontarians will be compromised if and when open for business planning by-laws become reality.   It is shocking in this day and age to read draft legislation that proposes the elimination of public notice requirements and that condones decision-making behind closed doors.  To make matters worse, Bill 66 also proposes that ‘open for business zoning by-laws’ will not be open to appeal through the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) as would be the case with any other municipal zoning by-law proposal.   This is an eroding of democratic rights in Ontario which, when considered with the threats to sustainable planning, ecological integrity, and drinking water sources that accompany it, constitutes an incredibly dangerous piece of legislation.    It is for this reason as well that Environment Hamilton is so very deeply opposed to Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:
In summary, Environment Hamilton is strongly opposed to both Schedule 5 and Schedule 10 of Bill 66.   We believe this legislation sets a dangerous precedent and that it will serve only to undo important progress that has been made over many years to make Ontario a place that is resilient, sustainable, and liveable.   A sustainable environment is the base on which economic prosperity must be built.   To do what Bill 66 sets out to do is short-sighted and will only serve to ensure economic hardship in the future.

It is always government and the taxpayer that ends up cleaning up the mess, because the polluter goes bankrupt, I would much rather avoid the problem, the human illnesses that result, (that I have to provide free health care for) the unmitigated damages that cannot be repaired in any way or in environmentally friendly way.  Whether it is mercury pollution in the Grassy Narrows areas, a problem for more than 50 years, or the fallout damage to the vermillion water shed (over 4000 square kilometers) we are living with this damage, with extreme levels of pollution that limit our life spans and cause many chronic illnesses.  Wake up and recognize the rules are there for a reason. They make sense.

20707,/comment/20707,"Good evening. I live in Toronto, Canada and the comments by Ontario Nature sum up my views well. Ontarians do not want this bill.
1. It affects every municipality in Ontario. Bill 66  allows municipalities across the province to create “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being. These bylaws would take precedence over municipal official plans.
2. It threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

20711,/comment/20711,"The Council of the Town of Collingwood have carefully reviewed and considered the contents of Schedule 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competiveness Act, 2018, which was read for a first time in December. Council have authorized staff to post the following comments to the Environmental Registry:
Council appreciate that the purpose of this legislation is to provide municipalities with the ability to react quickly to a potential economic development opportunities.  Council would have the option of passing an enabling planning by-law that would reduce the typical time frame and cost of the municipal planning review process.  New employment uses would be able to establish their businesses more quickly and therefore ensue that the Province is competitive with other jurisdictions trying to attract foreign and local investment.
Town of Collingwood Council does recognize that there will be no requirement for municipalities to pass Open-for-business planning by-laws.  Despite being optional; Council does recommend that the Province should amend Bill 66 to provide all municipalities with the ability to establish their own rules and framework under which they could pass an Open-for-business planning by-law.
The framework that the Town of Collingwood would establish would require respect for best planning and environmental sustainability practices, and the principles established in other relevant legislation.  The Town is very interested in ensuring that new economic development does not negatively impact the positive characteristics of the community that make it a great place ‘to live, work and play’.  Therefore, Collingwood’s framework would also set out the type of investments that the community is interested in supporting, which would not be those with potential land use compatibility challenges.
Additionally, the Town of Collingwood’s framework would incorporate requirements for the provision of information to the public and opportunities for public consultation.
Town of Collingwood Council thanks the Province for the opportunity to provide comments on this legislation.  Council asks that the Town be placed on the circulation list to receive any further information with respect to Bill 66.

It does not adequately allow for public study and understanding of the implications of this vast array of schedules and domains, nor does it allow for adequate public discourse, or proper examination in committees or the legislature. The scope of this omnibus bill puts the public at risk, particularly our most vulnerable residents and citizens.

Decades of hard work, by Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments have put in place laws and regulations which protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and residents. Very few Ontarians understand that,  contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act...), the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors. This is undemocratic, and in breach of public trust. Letting big business ignore rules outlined in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act, as well as open up the Greenbelt for development, poses a threat to our land, water, and air.  Bill 66 opens up Ontario’s Greenbelt for factory, retail and residential development, undermines drinking water protection rules and guts rules that help industry reduce the release of toxic chemicals. At a time when Ontarians need forward-thinking government action, Bill 66 basically takes us back 40 years.
I am in complete agreement with the following:
'The proposed Bill is framed as an attempt to cut red tape and facilitate the development planning and approvals process for business. However, looking beyond the rhetoric, ... it could result in real, adverse, and potentially irreversible effects to Ontario’s land, housing, and climate. If Bill 66 becomes law, it will allow new and potentially large-scale developments to be approved without the sound environmental protections and evidence-based growth management policies that ensure healthy and sustainable communities—including allowing development in the Greenbelt. The Bill will also dramatically weaken the public’s right to comment on development projects that might affect the environment, including access to clean water, natural heritage systems and agricultural lands.'...
'Ontario’s regulatory framework must evolve in a way that not only attracts business investments but also protects Ontarians from risks like a changing climate and drinking water contamination, and protects our farmlands and green spaces. The Bill 66 changes to the Planning Act take us in the wrong direction.'
Bill 66 is not in the public interest, and should not be passed.

We will not be consulted, we will not have an opportunity to speak to it before the application is completed and we will have no recourse.

20728,/comment/20728,"I am very concerned that Bill 66 will reduce or eliminate the protection of environmental and agricultural land protected by the Greenbelt  and the Oak Ridges Moraine. There is no correlation between ""competitiveness"" and the protection of sensitive and important environmental lands. In fact one of the main reasons, businesses and people come to the GTA is that there is a healthy and sustainable environment that has been protected through years of community consultation and good planning, which has provided one of the most liveable regions in North America.
There is almost 30,000 acres of ""white"" lands available for development. Current estimates indicate that this will provide enough housing until at least 2041. Therefore, availability of lands to develop is not the issue.
There may be issues around the delays in development however this is related to issues of servicing the lands (sewers, roads, hydro, water, and public transit), not the amount of lands available for development. That is the issue the government should be addressing, There should not be any reduction to environmental protection regulations or regulations protecting the Greenbelt. Please amend Bill 66 to ensure the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine protected area is not reduced.

Both these changes have the effect of reducing the protection unions can provide citizens.

These changes are designed to weaken unions, to the detriment of us all.
I don't think it's fair that ornamental horticulture workers who work for a private sector employee -- like my son-in-law can't get the benefits of belonging to a union, while my daughter who does the very same work, but for the municipality, can.  There are a limited number of municipal jobs.  More to the point, there are some very large horticultural firms which could actually benefit from having unionized workers.

I am proud of the corridor that it provides for wildlife that are already being pushed out of their natural homes and forced to migrate to cities as it is, such as coyotes.
Bill 66 is not good for business or the economy. It will increase taxes for Ontarians as more infrastructure will be needed to accommodate the sprawl. As well as the increased taxes needed in maintenance of this new infrastructure. I would rather see current brown fields redeveloped as it has infrastructure and would also be nearer to public transit.
We do not need the green belt opened for new housing. We need more dense housing near existing infrastructure and transit.

20738,/comment/20738,"I am a resident of Simcoe County, where I also practice law, and I have significant concerns with this proposed legislation. I will focus my comments on Schedule 10 of Bill 66, which would allow municipalities to pass “open-for-business” planning by-laws (“OFB by-laws”).
As it is currently proposed, this legislation would threaten the health and safety of communities across the province, our natural heritage, and local democracy.
The legislation railroads those important health, heritage, and environmental protections our province has put in place over successive governments of all political stripes. This is not ""red tape"" - these are specific check points our society has decided is important.
The legislation is overbroad: as currently drafted, it could result in untenable scenarios in which our muncipal drinking water well-heads could be polluted without a requirement for public notice.
The legislation is arbitrary: its effects don't square with its stated intention. For example, it would result in the centralization of muncipal planning with the Ministry, rather than empowering municipalities on their own.
It is unnecessary-- muncipal zoning orders already exist for those exceptional circumstances this legislation contemplates in its justifications.
And, there is no rationale that justifies overriding the following, as examples:
1. Source water protections in the Clean Water Act regarding significant threats to our drinking water, put in after the Walkerton Tragedy, which would automatically not apply to these by-laws.
2. The “legal effect” section of the Lake Simcoe Protection Act; that is, the section that gives the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan its teeth would also automatically not apply. This would render designated policies under the Plan meaningless.
3. Perhaps most egregious is that Bill 66 contains no requirement for municipalities to provide public notice when passing these by-laws. And there would be no right to appeal an OFB by-law.
Expedience or ease are not compelling objectives that justify placing the health and democracy of our communities at risk.
Yes, Bill 66 would make things 'easier,' in that it would remove a requirement to comply with the safeguards we have for our health, environment, and democracy. That’s not a good reason that justifies this proposed legislation in Ontario.
The language of Bill 66 means that any of the listed provisions (including the protections mentioned earlier) do not apply to an OFB by-law as the default.  Muncipal councils could pass an OFB by-law and then have to put together piecemeal all those safeguards again—the designated policies of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, the source water protection of the Clean Water Act, and likely have to fight with a developer about the introduction of those additional requirements. That’s not easy or expedient with respect to planning goals. What is the rationale for having these exclusions apply as the default?
As a second example, muncipal councils don’t have the jurisdiction to create a right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. This means that residents in communities across Ontario would not be able to appeal an OFB by-law decision in any meaningful way. This runs absolutely contrary to the democratic principles of procedural fairness and public participation and there is no justification for this rights removal in the proposed legislation.
Bill 66 will result in muncipalities facing significant pressure to use it to make decisions that are not in the public interest. Developers will have every incentive to flood campaigns with donations, and wine and dine councillors. Speculative pressures will prey on our communities once more. Financial pressures could pit communities against neighbouring municipalities in race-to-the-bottoms - whichever communities protect less win.
Let’s not play this game – it puts our communities at risk. It asks us to bet the farm for no good reason. We can be open for business in a way that prioritizes the health of our communities, our natural heritage, and our democratic rights. Indeed, we already are.
This is bad legislation. It requires major redrafting if it will be reasonable, specific, non-arbitrary (outcomes related to its stated intents), reasonable with justifiable rationales, and if it won't put our communities' health and democracies at risk.

20743,/comment/20743,"Dear Minister Clark,
On behalf of its membership, the Centretown Community Citizens Association (CCCA) of Ottawa opposes proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, and urges that the Bill be withdrawn immediately.
Instead of trying to strike a balance, Bill 66 irresponsibly pits economic development against the health and safety of residents, the protection of the environment, and the sustainable planning of Ontario’s communities. The Bill will leave lasting negative impacts on the province and weaken Ontarians’ trust in government.
Of primary concern to CCCA members are:
•	Sidestepping the safeguards of the Planning Act, the Official Plan, and the Provincial Policy Statement.
•	Weakening of health, safety, and environmental protections, such as the Clean Water Act.
•	Undermining core governance principles, such as:
•	The elimination of the requirement for public consultation, especially with respect to large, impactful development proposals.
•	The loss of the right of appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
•	The creation of selective regulatory measures creating uncertainty for prospective investors and all Ontarians.
Should Bill 66 pass, the CCCA will work with other local community associations to urge Ottawa’s City Council to vote against adopting “open for business” planning bylaws.
Regards,
Shawn Barber,
CCCA President

20745,/comment/20745,"Please remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.
Ontario's green spaces are important in and of themselves, but they are also important to the future lives and health of Ontarians. The protective provisions of green space legislation should be not only preserved but strengthened.
The Greenbelt preserves farmland and greenspace essential for naturally filtering water and preventing flooding, reducing the impact of extreme storms on infrastructure and stormwater management systems (with these extreme storms occurring on an ever-increasing basis as our climate becomes more erratic). It also helps to combat climate change by storing 86.6 million tonnes of carbon. Importantly, protection of green space also makes financial sense. For example, food and farming in the Greater Golden Horseshoe contribute billions of dollars to the economy and create more than 200,000 jobs, not to mention providing an enormous proportion of Ontarians' food.
It is distressing that Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would allow municipalities to override existing legislative provisions in the Greenbelt Act, Clean Water Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act — provisions that make these benefits possible.

It will endanger our diverse, natural areas that add value far beyond what this nearsighted government can understand. The bill will also allow decisions to be made without public consultation and that is entirely unacceptable. I do not support Bill 66 as it is the exact opposite of what our Province needs at a time when combating climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems should be our top priority.
Bill 66 cannot be allowed to take precedence over critical legal requirements to protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being.
This bill threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
It threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
It threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
It threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
It threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
It would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
It would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
It would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able
to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
It threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic
chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain
industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in
their operations.

Ontario’s Greenbelt is currently at risk with the introduction Bill 66.  This Bill could expedite development of environmentally sensitive lands and negatively affect planning policies such as the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Protection Act.  The Greenbelt has been recognized internationally as an exemplary example of land-use planning.
The Greenbelt contributes to the health and wellbeing of people and wildlife, a prosperous economy, local food, tourism, recreational opportunities, proper land-use planning and natural capital.  For example, it is estimated that the economic benefit of the Greenbelt exceeds approximately $9 billion annually throughout the Province in direct, indirect and induced impacts.  The Greenbelt ensures the protection of fertile farmland and our natural heritage and provides ecosystem services such as clean air and water, climate change and stormwater mitigation, carbon sequestration, and habitat for birds, turtles and species at risk, helping much needed biodiversity.
Once the Greenbelt is paved, the damage is irreparable and our quality of life will be compromised for generations to come.

If the purpose of the bill is to generate profits, think of the world-wide precious drinking water it is threatening instead; if the implementation of the bill is to enhance economic cooperations through new campaigns, think of the reputed recognition Canada and particularly Ontario has received upon our responsibility in caring for nature; if the impact of the bill is to be imagined positive to the employment market, think of the tourists attracted to Ontario by our fascinating natural landscapes which are very likely to be found disappointingly polluted as years fly by.
Therefore, to accept such a bill would be to “facilitate sprawling and unchecked development”, to threaten “sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely”, to put previous “community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes” in waste, and to “sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities”.

Additionally, these bylaws are automatically exempt from key environmental protection laws, plans and policies, including the Clean Water Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act, and several more.
Please note that both provincial and municipal data show that there is more than enough land designated for development within existing cities and towns to accommodate the expected population growth until 2041.  Data also shows there is a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
We need to protect our farmland as it supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened.  I know firsthand that farming is economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
We do not need to open up areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water.  Water is essential to human survival and opening protected areas to development threatens our long term health.  It also increases flood risks.
Natural areas provide habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon and mitigate climate change, provide recreation and clean our air.  These areas are essential and should not be imperiled.

20785,/comment/20785,"Comments on the Proposed Bill 66 (Built Heritage)
Thanks to a workshop hosted by Environment Hamilton at Knox Presbyterian Church in Dundas on January 15th, 2019, I am better informed about the environmentally destructive powers of the proposed Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, introduced in the Legislature on December 6th 2018) and the ways in which individual citizens and environmental groups can voice their opposition.   As pointed out by EH staff, Bill 66 will open up Ontario’s Greenbelt for industrial, commercial and residential development (Greenbelt Act, 2005), undermine drinking water regulations (Clean Water Act), and regulations aimed to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals that industries are allowed to release into the atmosphere (Toxic Reductions Act).  My environmental concerns are expressed in three separate submissions.
As a built heritage consultant and member of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, I was alarmed by a recent ACO communique to members warning of the risks that the proposed Bill 66 poses for Ontario's heritage structures.  In 2005, the ACO after intensive lobbying was successful in strengthening the provisions of the Ontario Heritage Act (OHA) and the 2005 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS).  That work is threatened by Bill 66 (Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act), introduced on December 6, 2018.  Schedule 10 of this bill would enable any Ontario municipality to pass an ""Open-for-Business Planning By-law"" that would allow development of ""major employment and economic growth opportunities"".  Exempting land use proposals from cultural heritage policies in the PPS and Official Plans, would effectively eliminate requirements for heritage impact assessments, archaeological assessments and other measures designed to ensure that heritage assets are considered in planning decisions.
As a resident of the former Town of Dundas (now part of the amalgamated City of Hamilton), I have serious concerns about the potentially negative impact that an “Open for Business Planning By-law” would have on the low-rise, heritage character of Dundas, with a variety of green open spaces.  This was threatened over 10 years ago by the proposed construction of four 9-storey condo towers on the north side of Spenser Creek to the west of Ogilvie Street.  The developer was given an exemption from the 6-storey limitation imposed by the Zoning By-law in exchange for converting the parcel of land between Creekside Drive and the six-storey retirement residence known as Amica Dundas into public open space with  a community centre.  However, once the four towers were completed, the developer applied for a permit to build a fifth tower on the promised green space.  Both the residents of Amica and the Creekside condominium owners were furious and banded together to oppose this audacious plan.  In the end, the matter was resolved to everyone’s satisfaction when City Council voted to purchase the contentious parcel of land and turn it into a public park (finally completed in 2018).  However, if there had been an “Open for Business” by-law in effect, this course of events could have had an entirely different outcome.  What if the developer had simply been granted permission to build five 9-storey towers in the first place?  This would have drastically altered the small-town, heritage character of Dundas, which is one of its greatest assets.
This is just one illustration of the many undesirable scenarios which could happen if Bill 66 is passed and Hamilton City Council votes to adopt Schedule 10.  I am therefore strongly opposed to Bill 66 from a heritage conservation and planning perspective.

20792,/comment/20792,"I wish to comment on Bill 66, specifically in relation to the proposed Schedule 10.
I am a member of several nature clubs, and a retired business analyst. I have lived in Pickering for over 30 years, and commuted to my office in Markham through greenbelt and agricultural lands between 1988 and 2016, where I experienced the growing sprawl of the GTA.
I am opposed to Schedule 10.
My specific concerns are:
1.	Section 10 imperils wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. In the GTA area where I live (Durham Region), it puts the ecological integrity of the Greenbelt at risk.
2.	The province has floated the suggestion that no public notice or hearing is required prior to passing an open-for-business bylaw.  The proposal for municipalities to request an “open-for-business” tool (by-law) will allow local governments to negotiate secret deals with businesses and developers (including, I have no doubt, housing developers) in back-rooms without transparency.
3.	Allowing municipalities to sidestep decades of planning and consultation will lead to a patchwork of standards across the region. Municipalities compete with each other for jobs and housing development. If Pickering sees an opportunity to use Bill 66 Section 10 provisions to get an advantage over other towns and cities, they will use it. There will be a sprawling checkerboard of development – industrial and residential – spreading into today’s green spaces and farmland.
4.	Schedule 10 will let municipalities - without transparency, public engagement or citizen recourse – overturn current policies for land use that have been developed over many decades for the effective protection, management and development of our provincial lands.
5.	Schedule 10, as proposed, gives municipal governments the back-room tools and incentives to swap out agricultural land and natural areas on the greenbelt for industrial land and housing sprawl.  I share the concerns of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, this is a direct attack on the family farm businesses in Ontario.
6.	Some municipal governments and politicians have a history of concerning relationships and deals with developers. For example, I refer to the situation in Pickering related to the agricultural preserve easements which were lifted by the city in 2005 without public notice or consultation in an effort to allow development in the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve. Legal action by the province was required to correct Pickering’s secret deals with the land speculators.

Schedule 5:
The Toxics Reductions Act, 2009, is an important piece of legislation - protecting Ontario families from harmful substances and provided a guiding hand in shifting industry towards safer and more sustainable products. Reducing toxins and shifting towards a green economy is consistent with economies around the world - diverging from Ontario's progressive development not only puts Ontario families at greater risk, it will disadvantage our economy in the long term. Pushing for immediate growth by reducing the pressure on industries to control and reduce toxins is very short-sighted. Long term increases in the cost of healthcare, degradation of our environment, and a general decrease in our quality of life can't possibly be worth the small growth in business that reduced regulation would provide.

Furthermore, opening the doors to development in protected areas such as Ontario's Greenbelts could have significant negative impacts on cities: Greenbelts provide important habitat and wildlife corridors, improve air quality and protect urban waterways, and provide important outdoor recreational options - improving the well-being of urban citizens. Greenbelts also provide a bridge for interaction between urban and rural Ontario.

20815,/comment/20815,"The Province of Ontario’s proposed Bill 66 allows for provincial intervention to remove or weaken protections on safe drinking water, agricultural lands, and democratic consultation.
In 1989, toxic chemicals were found in the groundwater underneath the Uniroyal Chemical site in Elmira. Experts say it will be decades before Elmira's water is safe to drink again. Bill 66 would allow the Province to override the Region of Waterloo’s Official Plan policies that were established to prevent similar toxic destruction of our drinking water. Limiting sprawl is of particular importance in Waterloo Region, where 75% of drinking water comes from aquifers located just beyond the Countryside Line.
Today, more than half of the Region's growth comes from building in existing urban areas. This investment in our urban centres means we can keep growing while preserving the rural communities and farms that make Waterloo Region unique. While I am using Waterloo Region as an example of the negative implications of the proposed bill, other regions within Southern Ontario would be impacted similarly and very negatively.
Planning exemptions granted under Bill 66 would not require notification or consultation with residents. These proposed changes fly in the face of good governance. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (currently being revised as Bill C-69 as the Impact Assessment Act) is already being criticized for its lack of public consultation and public participation. While this act is federal, the fact remains that the public need to be involved and well-involved in development decisions that will impact their region and the environmental services provided by the area. There should be no exemption for providing notifications to residents. In fact, there should be better provisions to provide notification, consultation, and active participation of residents.
I, therefore, reject Bill 66’s implicit suggestion that to grow the economy and add jobs we must accept environmental degradation, pave over farms, and risk the health of our families. Not to mention jeopardizing the lives of future generations of Ontario residents.

We should be moving forward not backward.  At time when we are facing increasing ecological crises around the world, we need leadership from government and industry that is innovative and competitive while also protecting our most precious natural resources.

2. Bill 66 threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would override policies in approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. Bill 66  threatens wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act.
4. Bill 66  threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. Bill 66  threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt. Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. Bill 66  threatens fresh water and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would trump requirements set out in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. Bill 66  would undermine efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. Bill 66  would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. Bill 66  would leave citizens without recourse. Community members would not be able to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10. Bill 66  threatens human and wildlife health through increased exposure to toxic chemicals. Bill 66 proposes to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, which requires certain industrial facilities to consider ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in their operations.

It is disturbing to me that the Ontario government under Doug Ford would try dismember the Acts that were put in place to protect the human health of our communities and ensure that the water we drink is safe and the environment is protected for our and future generations.
Section 5 comment:
I do not support your proposal to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act. This Act was put in place so industrial facilities which use toxic chemicals in their processes would be pressured to swap them out for less toxic alternatives. This is very important to me as a resident of Hamilton. Toxic chemical emitters like the steel industry and chemical industries should be kept in check by provincial government and its Ministry of Environment because without it they will do nothing for the health of the surrounding community, being private companies, to them only the bottom line matters. It is only because of the Toxics Reduction Act, Ministry orders and pressure from the community that the Hamilton airshed is getting better with time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still the worst airshed in Ontario but we’re seeing slow improvements in our community. Doug Ford, you are taking away the people’s right to clean air and water. Come and visit the industrial area in Hamilton where the two steel mills and supporting industries sit. This is how things were done 100 years ago, where industrial growth trumped human health and the environment. We don't want these situations for other communities. The impacts to the Hamilton and Burlington has been high with increased cancer rates and toxic waste in our bay.
Section 10 comment:
Your proposal for “Open-for-business by-laws” is unnecessary and redundant. There is no “red tape” which is stopping businesses from opening up shop in Ontario. Every city has designated areas for industry and plans for growth. There is no need from the province to meddle in city affairs when it comes to city planning. The biggest problem I see in your proposal for Section 10 is the huge environmental impacts it will have on our human population and wildlife. The Clean Water Act was put in place for a reason. Do you think having another Walkerton crisis is a good idea? Your so called “red tape” protects human lives by ensuring we have clean, safe water sources in Ontario and vulnerable ares in our beautiful province are protected. Keep your hands off our Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act and the Clean Water Act. The only “red tape” you’re removing is the obstacles for your Developer buddies who want to build on prime farmland and download the costs onto the cities. We know you wanted to open up the Greenbelt for them and backed off with the public outcry. Don’t think we, the people, don’t see what you’re doing.
This proposal undermines efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Your “Open for business by-laws” would override existing Provincial Policy Statements under the Planning Act that support active transportation, green infrastructure, affordable housing and climate resiliency. That is just irresponsible and wrong.
What I find even more alarming is that this proposal for Bill 66 would compromise transparency and public engagement. Contrary to currant legal requirements your “open-for-business by-laws” could be passed without any prior public notice, behind closed doors. This would leave communities without recourse. This would take away the voice of those living in Ontario communities. There would be no appeal options left for us. We live in our cities and should have a say in what is proposed because not all elected officials represent the whole constituency.
Section 3 comment:
Removing restrictions on home-based child care providers could endanger the lives of children. Yes, it will open up more child-care spaces but at what cost? Children, especially very small children should be given constant attention and care, how will you ensure that the person taking care of 6 children can handle them all and ensure their safety?
Overall, this bill will do more harm than good for Ontarians. It would lead us in the wrong direction. Don’t download important matters of human health and protection onto the cities, they are overwhelmed as is.

20824,/comment/20824,"I object this proposal. The amount of protected land has been diminishing throughout the past couple of years
These lands were listed as protected in order to create a guideline for building new homes, businesses, roads while still keeping our natural surroundings. You realized how important it was back then to protect farmland, natural habitats and wildlife, or else you wouldn't have spent that effort, time and money to make sure these rules were in place. If we take away these rulings that were meant to protect, we will have no farmland, habitats and wildlife left in a number of years. With out these, we cannot survive. If you pay attention, you'll see this is already starting to happen.
If your idea is that we still have farmland and protected wildlife areas elsewhere, so we will be ok, you are wrong. Every government agency will attempt to push it onto some other department and make it their problem to deal with in the future.  Make the right decision now to keep these lands protected, and stop pushing aside the issue at hand. Don't pretend that you don't see diminishing protected lands around you, stop avoiding the issue. Local farmland is incredibly important on so many scales of environmental stability but also economy.
If you are more focused on yourself, let me put it in a way that will affect you directly. If you make this decision now to stop protecting these lands, you'll have limited farmland and natural habitats. This correlates to meaning that you'll have higher food prices from importing food, you'll have low diversity of wild species which means an unstable environment increasing the the unstable weather patterns and increased erosion, increased water pollution. You'll be spending so much time trying to fix these issues; paying into research on how to increase bird/fish/scavenger populations, implementation of these proposed practices, and when you don't get it right the first time that cycle of payment will just keep going. When you realize that communities cannot afford food and the ridiculous amount of import taxes that will come with it you'll start to pay money into feeding communities, creating avenues for food stamps again. You'll spend so much money on researching and implementing how to clean water, reduce erosion, make land habitable again, make land capable of producing good quality food. Things you are already putting money into now now, because you made this mistake already years ago of not protecting enough land to begin with. Save all that time and money, and don't destroy our communities, farmland and environment.
If we don't have any natural land left, we cannot survive. Industry can't survive without sunlight, food and water- so support the basics necessities and stop trying to grow in the wrong sector.

20827,/comment/20827,"This is a duplicitous proposal that directly counters Doug Ford's promise to protect the Greenbelt, albeit, after his initial pre-election proposal to open it to developers was met with outrage. Naturally, this doesn't come as a surprise,  just more proof that the provincial Conservatives are not at all interested in doing what is actually in the best interest of Ontarians, now or in the future.
Effectively opening the Greenbelt to developers and weakening the legislation currently in place to protect prime agricultural land, clean air, and drinking water is a dangerous game. When any intelligent, progressive government should be making strides to conserve natural capital in order to protect ecosystem services and increase resiliency in the face of climate change, Bill 66 would set us on track for the complete opposite.
Living in a port city with a strong manufacturing industry, I am already very concerned about air and water quality, particularly in the summer months. If the Ford government gets its way, any improvements that have been made in recent years are at risk of being undone.
With changes in the manufacturing industry and shifts in population growth, there are ample opportunities to reclaim and remediate existing brownfields, former industrial lands, and countless vacant properties in ways that would be in line with smart, ecologically sensitive developments that will strengthen local economies,  protect valuable resources, offer food security, climate change resiliency, and countless other benefits.
The Greenbelt is one of our greatest assets, and allowing development within its boundaries is unacceptable.

Bill 66, Schedule 10 allows local municipalities to pass open-for-business by-laws, thereby eliminating the need to adhere to numerous plans and acts.  My major concerns are:
(a)	Ontario’s bodies of water must remain clean and safe for wildlife and humans alike.   Because water flows above and below ground from one municipality to another, what one municipality decides to do will impact another municipality.  We must not risk our waterways to impulsive and rushed municipal decisions which can often be influenced by developers and businesses whose interests and focus may not align with Ontarians’ health and safety.  This is an extremely important issue where we must rule on the side of caution.
(b)	Ontarians value the Greenbelt and want it to remain intact without any development whatsoever.  The moment development is allowed on any part of the Greenbelt, the integrity of the whole Greenbelt starts to unravel and with the passage of enough time, no one will be able to tell where the Greenbelt is.  In fact, it will cease to exist and that cannot be undone.  The Greenbelt currently gives us a special and beautiful place to hike and enjoy – away from city sprawl and ugliness.

This bill eliminates the requirement to consult neighbours on changes made to zoning within the greenbelt, allowing developers to do what they want, where they want, without any regard for the citizens who live beside these large polluters.  There will be impacts on ground water, wetlands, and green spaces.  We know through scientific evidence how fragile ecosystems are.  If we destroy them with un-checked industrial development, well, rest assured the water we drink and the air we breath will be contaminated as well.   I do not want to see another Walkerton because developers aren't getting rich enough.
Bill 66 will destroy our environment even quicker than we are currently doing right now.  We need more environmental protections, not fewer.  I don't consider ensuring our communities have clean drinking water as ""red tape"".

20834,/comment/20834,"I am writing to express my grave concern about Bill 66.   Being able to grow new businesses in previously protected spaces, without having to deal with environmental protection laws or negative public opinion might seem like an easy path to financially gain.  However it is incredibly short-sighted as any short-term financial gain would be massively overshadowed by the negative long-term financial, social, environmental and health-related impacts of this bill (in the municipalities where it was implemented and in many surrounding areas).   Yes, we need jobs, but we ALSO need access to safe drinking water, sustainable communities, local food sources and natural spaces to have a decent quality of life.
If this is passed, it has the potential to start chains of events in various regions that can result in long-term damage that no future legislation will ever be able to undo.   The next government’s best efforts will NEVER be able to recreate farmland, purify tainted water, restore lost species or bring full health back to anyone who has injured due to this legislation (as was the case in Walkerton).   Attempts to mitigate damages (such as cleaning up contaminants, treating sick individuals, or importing produce) will end up costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
It has taken years to careful consideration to create the legislative provisions that protect public health, drinking water, natural heritage, critical habitats and prime farmland, and also reduce the negative impact of urban sprawl.   It is completely unacceptable for the government to provide businesses/municipalities with the option of bypassing any or all of this legislation, as well the normal process of public engagement.   A government for the people must allow the people to have input into development, especially if it will negatively impact the health/safety/well-being of the community in the immediate or foreseeable future.
Besides the immense legal, environmental and health implications of this bill, it is ethically inappropriate for the government to even propose such legislation.  Any government that states it is  'for the people' should, at the very least, keep a key campaign promise which it expressly made to the people just a few short months ago (that promise was to NOT enable development in the Greenbelt!)  Doing otherwise severely corrodes public trust in the political process.

20835,/comment/20835,"I have significant concerns about the introduction of Bill 66, and think that as it stands it is a dangerous piece of legislation that seriously erodes the environmental protections associated with development in Ontario. These environmental protections are sensible and any impact they have on the development industry is negligible relative to the benefit they give to the province. I am particularly concerned with Schedule 10. Bill 66 functionally removes the Planning Act as a legislative trigger for archaeological or heritage assessment in Ontario. Under Bill 66 open-for-business by-laws, Subsection 3(5) and Subsection 24 of the Planning Act will not apply. Subsection 3(5) is the section of the Planning Act that gives authority to the Provincial Policy Statement. Therefore PPS 2014, and the archaeology and heritage policies it contains, will no longer apply. Subsection 24 of the planning act states all public work and by-laws passed must conform to an Official Plan. Therefore, archaeology and heritage policies within a municipal Official Plan will no longer apply. These are the two main regulatory triggers leading to archaeological and heritage assessments under the Planning Act. If adopted by municipalities on a large-scale in Ontario, Bill 66 will lead to the destruction of archaeological and heritage resources across the province at a rate not seen since the 1990s. How will the province ensure that archaeological and heritage resources of provincial concern are not destroyed without the required assessment? To say nothing of the fact that removal of the archaeological trigger will directly impact Indigenous communities right to be involved with mitigation of archaeological resources within their traditional territories. The provincial government is shortsightedly opening itself to significant long-term lawsuits that it will lose with this ill-conceived piece of legislation. It will cost the tax payers significant amounts of money, with the only benefit being enriching, in the very short term, a handful of wealthy investors in the development industry.

20843,/comment/20843,"Dear Mr. Helfinger,
RE: 013-4293 Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018; 013-4125 Proposed open-for-business planning tool; 013-4239 New Regulation under the Planning Act for open-for-business planning tool
I strongly oppose several aspects of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. I disagree with the Government of Ontario’s contention that Bill 66 cuts “unnecessary” and “out of date” regulations (ERO posting 013-4293). This is not true in the case of Schedule 10 which introduces “open-for-business by-laws” that would trump critical requirements under several laws that are designed to protect water, natural heritage and human health and well-being and to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement in land-use decisions.
My concerns, in line with and supportive of Ontario Nature, and their ERO submission, are below and I trust that they will be considered with respect to all three relevant ERO postings (i.e., 013-4293, 013-4125, 013-4239).
- Open-for-business by-laws would circumvent fundamental protections for environmental and human health.
- The potential negative impact of open-for-business by-laws is far-reaching and profound. They would override key operative provisions in the laws listed in Schedule 10, undermining fair and consistent application of laws and policies designed to protect drinking water, natural heritage, farmland and watershed health across Ontario, and leaving communities open to unchecked development.
- Open-for-business by-laws would eliminate opportunities for public input on planning decisions.  By-laws passed behind closed doors would trump laws, policies and municipal official plans developed through extensive and open public consultation. Communities would have no recourse to influence or challenge them.
- I question whether there is demand from municipalities for open-for-business by-laws, proposed by the government to make more employment lands available. At the Growth Plan implementation consultation held on November 8, 2018 at Queen’s Park many municipalities indicated that they have a surplus of employment lands.   Since the introduction of Bill 66, many municipal leaders (e.g., in Guelph, Aurora, Burlington, Barrie, Oakville, Hamilton, Toronto) have expressed serious concerns about open-for-business by-laws and the circumvention of laws that protect drinking water, farmlands and natural areas and ensure public input and transparency in decision-making.
- Schedule 10 of Bill 66 would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from governments of all political stripes. Open-for-business by-laws would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and would facilitate sprawling and unchecked development, threatening sensitive natural features and water resources upon which we all rely. Bill 66 would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment and the health of our communities.
I urge the government to avoid similar mistakes and to remove Schedule 10 from Bill 66.

The Ontario Chapter of Sierra Club focuses on protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem, growing and protecting the Greenbelt, and promoting Green Energy adoption in Ontario. Sierra Club Ontario also works on local issues, in coordination with smaller communities in Ontario
Sierra Club Canada Foundation staunchly opposes the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 (ERO #013-4293).
Bill 66 strips away zoning provisions that protect environmental and human health, leaving Ontario’s Greenbelt, farmland, and clean drinking water vulnerable to the abuse of developers.
Created in 2005, Ontario’s Greenbelt is a permanently protected area of farmland, forests, watersheds, and wetlands. It is one of the largest greenbelts in the world at nearly two million acres. The Greenbelt provides us with clean water, fresh air, and local food, as well as recreation. Established to guard against urban sprawl and protect precious agricultural land, it serves as a vital piece of our provincial economy and heritage.
Schedules 5 and 10 of Bill 66 allow “Open for Business” by-laws to circumvent existing planning legislation and environmental guidelines that are vital to keeping our drinking water clean, including:
·      Ontario Planning and Development Act, 1994
·      Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001
·      Greenbelt Act, 2005
·      Places to Grow Act, 2005
·      Metrolinx Act, 2006
·      Clean Water Act, 2006
·      Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008
·      Toxics Reduction Act, 2009
·      Great Lakes Protection Act, 2015
The bill leaves space for further non-compliance by naming any other “prescribed provisions” in provincial legislation.
Public consultation is not required to pass “Open for Business” by-laws, meaning citizens will not be aware of them until they’re enacted. Community members are left without recourse if they take issue with them, as they are not permitted to appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. This is an erosion of transparency and leaves communities in the dark about what’s happening in their own backyard.
Decades of work have gone into Ontario’s land use planning and environmental protection statutes. Bill 66 casts that aside, erroneously labeling it “red tape,” and allows developers to do as they please. This is not efficiency, and it is certainly not stewardship.
Ontarians deserve better.

We will protect and enhance our natural areas, support conservation efforts, continue to conserve species at risk, develop adaption strategies and promote the importance of healthy natural spaces for future generations""
Bill 66 Schedule 10 contradicts this
We are facing a global emergency with climate change and biodiversity loss. But this government wants to pave over farmland and natural areas for corporations and profit? We are in trouble because of growth and profit trumping the environment time and time again.
Agricultural land is a finite resource. Once it is paved over, it is gone forever. According to Ontario  Farmland Trust we lose 175 acres per day in Ontario and we have lost 20% of our farmland between 1976 and 2016.  With climate change we need more farmland not less. Extreme weather reduces production and not only do we need to feed a growing population, we need land to grow biofuels as we move away from fossil fuels. Food security and local food is also vital with climate change.The agri-food sector contributes over 39 billion to Ontario's GDP and employs more than 820,000 Ontarions (1)
Putting development into agricultural areas is wrong and poor planning.  It is deplorable that the local people particularly farmers will not be allowed to give input. Development in agricultural areas limit farm expansion (MDS requirements and negatively affect farmers decision's to invest). OMAFRA has documents on problems between farmers and conflicting land uses ie odour, noise, traffic development pressure etc. We have experienced some of these issues. As well, many farms provide wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration and assist with flooding (water infiltration). Paving farms over and fragmenting farm areas is  wrong.
There are many wonderful environmental and planning policies already in place  yet this bill wants to override these. Smart growth is just that. Keeping development close to town reduces greenhouse gases and keeps farming areas producing food and fibre while providing many environmental benefits. I suggest if you want Trust and Transparency, corporations should follow the environmental and planning policies we all do and do so with the public involved and  not behind closed doors.
Scientists have been warning us for decades about climate change and biodiversity loss. Governments have let us down by not taking these warnings seriously and early enough. People need to wake up to the realities of climate change. I might die of old age before things get too extreme with climate change. My kids won't.  What legacy do you want to leave to your daughters and grandchildren Premier Ford? Please remove Section 10 of Bill 66. Thank you.

Peel Federation of Agriculture is the farm organization that represents over 350 registered farm businesses in Peel.
As the farm community is perhaps the largest stakeholder group to be impacted by the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, we have a vested interest on behalf of our membership to encourage a thoughtful and thought-provoking process.
There has been a lot of discussion about preserving the agricultural land basethrough planning initiatives like the Greenbelt.  It does not mean that we should abandon sound logic.  We have no way of predicting that agriculture will be sustainable regardless of any decision we make.  The success or failure of the industry will be dictated by the marketplace and by the initiative of individual operators.  We should also not assume that because we have a Greenbelt, that it will somehow make agriculture more viable.
If the objective behind Bill 66 is to fast track the development of employment lands in the province, we support the bill because of the simple fact that Employment lands within the Greenbelt support smaller rural communities, thereby contributing to agricultural sustainability.   All too often, we have seen major employers frustrated with the red tape and time required to obtain approvals.  The end result is that these employers relocate.
In some respects, Bill 66 will achieve similar results to a Ministerial Zoning Order.  We definitely would like to see the lengthy delays in economic development due to governmental compliance.
What our Federation would like to see together with our Parent Federation, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture is:
•	Use of the Provincial Policy Statement definitions and language in all Four Provincial Plans.  A lack of consistency across all four Plans leads to confusion for businesses and subjective interpretation by many stakeholders that are involved in any process involving any of these Plans.
•	We would also like transferring the oversight of the Niagara Escarpment Plan from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing .  Business should not have to contact multiple ministries/government agencies for similar provincial plans.
•	Targeting smaller communities for infrastructure and economic investments to distribute economic development, reduce congestion and growth pressures in the GTA.  Growth pressures continue to make life unaffordable and challenging for the average resident.
•	The current pattern of growth is unsustainable.  The Province’s priorities to increase housing supply and affordability, create jobs, reduce red tape, attract new investments, and build strategic partnerships align exceptionally well with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture’s Producing Prosperity Plan.

20852,/comment/20852,"Thank you for the opportunity to give my input.  I wish to express my profound opposition to section 10 of Bill 66, Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act, 2018. For years I have worked with my local municipality to ensure that clean drinking water, healthy air and healthy lakes and rivers are part of the Official Plan under which we make the rules that govern our township.
Official Plans are hammered out over time, and passed, often with a great deal of debate at the municipal and county levels, and follow the direction set down by the Province under the Provincial Policy Statement. It has been developed to reflect the best science that we have available on how to have a healthy environment and healthy, productive communities, on which not only the people of Ontario, but also our businesses rely.
I can't imagine how the provincial government can consider undercutting all the good work that our municipalities have done. In our municipality the council sought input from the public on multiple occasions. The people of our township have expressed their desire for a clean, healthy environment over and over. In our Strategic Plan, for example, a healthy environment was the top priority identified by the people. Now, this work is to be overridden so that businesses can do whatever they want, even if it means destroying wildlife habitat, polluting our drinking water, polluting our air, killing off our precious wildlife and contaminating our lakes and rivers?
Bill 66 would threaten wetlands, woodlands and habitat for Species at Risk across Ontario. We need strong rules to protect these if we want to have a livable province. Bill 66 would run contrary to the interests and desires of the people of Ontario: a 2016 Nanos poll found that 90 percent of Ontarians believe the government is responsible to ensure a healthy environment for all, and 97 percent support the right to clean air and water.
I live in a part of Ontario where tourism is a major driver of the economy. People come here because we have beautiful forests, lakes and rivers. Our tourist operators rely on the health and beauty of the natural world to attract visitors. People choose to live here because it's a relatively clean place. If Bill 66 becomes law, all this will be up for grabs by business interests, and without any recourse for the people who will be affected? Are people not to have basic rights to use even the courts to defend their homes? This is completely undemocratic, and unacceptable.  Citizens have to have recourse when their way of life is being threatened.
I also find it completely unacceptable that Bill 66 would compromise transparency and public engagement, by allowing decisions to be made without prior public notice behind closed doors.
The farmland of Ontario needs to be protected. Bill 66 would undermine our ability to preserve good land for farming. You can't grow food on asphalt! Any legislation that prevents our being able to save good farmland from development is contrary to common sense. Ontario has a large and growing urban population. They need to eat!
Bill 66 would also threaten our drinking water. Since Walkerton, the Province of Ontario has taken some important steps to ensure that our water supplies are protected. That means looking upstream to prevent pollution. It is unacceptable that protections of existing and future sources of municipal drinking water could be overridden,  allowing landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of manure, fuel and pesticides to take place where water sources would be threatened.
We already have too many toxic chemicals in our environment. Bill 66 would allow more by repealing the Toxics Reduction Act. I think of the number of people I know who have cancer. Think of the suffering from this disease, and the health care dollars that are spent on cancer care. Toxic chemicals are implicated in many types of cancer. How in God's name can the government consider allowing more?
Lastly, we need the policies recently developed for climate resiliency. We need, as a people, to prevent more CO2 going into the atmosphere, and we need the province to lead the way. Ontario, like most places, is going to face even more flooding, drought and forest fires.   We also need to prepare for such events, which we know will be ever more frequent in the next decades. We cannot afford to allow legislation that undermines efforts to accomplish this.
To conclude, I hope sincerely, that the government of Ontario will withdraw these aspects of Bill 66. They are not in the public interest either in the short or long-term.

20853,/comment/20853,"Bill 66 should not be allowed to pass based on the following:
-	Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and it’s regulations ensures that industries either: a) have a plan to reduce their output of toxic substances  and b) have a plan to reduce their use of toxic substances. Removing this requirement puts our health at risk.
-	Schedule 10 in Bill 66 Enables municipalities to override provisions in the Clean Water Act, Greenbelt Act, 2005, Great Lakes Protection Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001, Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, 2016 and other provincial statutes.  These regulations keep vital resources safe, protect our drinking water and are key to securing our economic future. Sacrificing the quality of our environment and our communities today will not make Ontario more sustainable now and into the future; it will make Ontario vulnerable and weak. Moreover, it will increase risk for repeat crises such as Walkerton and no doubt lead to expensive clean-ups, remediation and increased infrastructure all paid for at the cost of the taxpayer, not the developer or business.
The Greenbelt secures vital farm lands in climate zones not found many other places in Canada. Our ability to grow our own food is not just best economic practice, but a matter of national security. The green belt also protects many hunting and fishing grounds which are essential to sustaining traditional cultural practices.
-	ERO Number 013-4239: Would permit municipalities to pass an “open-for business bylaw” on the basis of providing 50-100 jobs (depending on municipality size). The following is not required in the municipality’s submission to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and therefore I cannot support the amendment:
             o	No minimum requirement for the duration of those jobs (Full-Time Permanent, part time, casual)
             o	No minimum or expectation for high wage or skilled labour for those “new jobs”
             o	No criteria that the “new jobs” would be filled by local workers (which would directly benefit the municipality)
             o	No requirement to forecast the benefit to the local economy in short and long term
             o	Removes ability for citizens to appeal the decision made by the municipality
I do not support this Bill.

The Greenbelt protects Ontario farmland, forests, and nature. It provides habitat for very important and already endangered Ontario’s wildlife.
80% of Ontarians get the drinking water from the Great Lakes.
Opening the Greenbelt for development, poses a threat to our land, water, and air.
Bill 66 threatens the health of the Great Lakes by opening them up to greater development.
The recently released “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan also makes commitments that would be impossible if Bill 66 becomes law.
Ontario doesn’t need new Walkerton or even bigger tragedy than Walkerton!
The Ontario government under Ford promised to protect the Greenbelt.
Ontarians do not want the Greenbelt open for development!
Bill 66 is not about creating good jobs. It is about rewarding Ford’s big business cronies.

While I agree with the notion of ""cutting red tape"",  I think a lot of it has been put in place to protect consumers and the public in general.  In particular, I find alarming the possible circumvention of the Planning act.  Although I am not a developer,  I see that the process of land development works fairly well in the Region of Waterloo and the outcomes are better, due to the public scrutiny and the control afforded by the Planning Act and the Provincial Policy Statement (2014).
Also, why repeal the Pawnbrokers Act?  I can see it could be updated or streamlined,  but do you really want to create a gray market for stolen goods just for the sake of ""cutting red tape""?
I don't understand all the schedules of Bill 66, but from what I do know, it should not be presented to the Legislature as is.  It won't be as dramatic,  but  careful thought should be given to whatever Provincial Acts and policies need improvement, and the Provincial government should proceed meticulously and carefully.

20864,/comment/20864,"The Glebe Annex Community Association in Ottawa joins the chorus of Ontarians who are opposed to Bill 66. Under the guise of ‘cutting red tape’, this Bill would undermine environmental safeguards and the health of Ontarians, as we would lose important protections for water, wildlife and sensitive natural features set out in the Planning Act, the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxics Reduction Act, and more.
This legislation exists for a reason. The Clean Water Act, for instance, helps protect municipal drinking water from threats such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides. It was created to prevent another Walkerton tragedy – the contamination of drinking water sickened more than 2,000 people and resulted in six deaths.
Bill 66 also undermines democracy. The associated by-laws could be passed without public notice or meetings and cannot be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. They don’t even need to be consistent with municipal Official Plans, which are developed in close consultation with community leaders and stakeholders.
These “open-for-business by-laws” would bypass legal requirements intended to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land use decisions in our communities. They present industry with a back door to develop properties in protected places like the Greenbelt, and threaten the long-term health and resilience of our communities and their residents.

The government must hold true to its word -- words that cross all party lines -- to absolutely protect the Greenbelt.
The government must ensure that any development ahead does so with sustainability as the #1 priority -- development sprawl should not be rewarded with approvals to build.
Affordable housing can be realized through a wiser transportation system which allows for speedier commutes from wider networks, allowing housing interests to tap into communities which are more affordable. That should be the priority for development and economic development versus removing the checks & balances which just open the world to wholesale land development without the wisdom of environmental and resource protection.
The concerns being voiced from municipalities and advocacy groups about the wide-spreading ""greenlight"" that will upend wise planning and lead to overdevelopment must be heard and incorporated into the plans ahead.

The Honourable Todd Smith
Minister of Economic Development, Jobs and Trade
900 Bay Street, Hearst Block
Toronto ON M6H 4L1
Dear Minister Todd Smith,
RE: Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act
Women in Ontario in Water is a diverse group of water practitioners, engineers, and scientists living or working in southern Ontario. The group was formed in 2012 and consists of 67 registered members. Among our contributing members are consulting engineers and EITs, planning and engineering staff from conservation authorities and water related NGOs, PhD students in civil engineering, water management and governance professionals, and environmental scientist consultants.
In response to the Ministry of Economic Development, Jobs and Trade (the Ministry) request for comments on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, representatives from the Women in Ontario in Water (est. 2012) provide the following.
Overall, information provided to-date on the proposed Bill 66 and associated Acts (Proposed open-for-business planning tool (ERO # 013-4125)) and Regulations (New Regulation under the Planning Act for Open-for-Business Planning Tool (ERO # 013-4239)) is limited. However, our main concern is for the implementation of science and evidence-based policies, strong safeguards for surface and groundwater resources, and decision-making founded in meaningful stakeholder engagement.
Section 10 of Bill 66, as currently proposed, addresses none of those concerns. As such, we recommend that if amendments to the Planning Act proceed through Bill 66, that Section 10 be removed in its entirety. Furthermore, we reiterate requests made by the City of Guelph (January 15, 2019) and others that the province undertake formal consultation with municipalities and hold in-person public and stakeholder consultation sessions on potential changes to the Act.  We respectfully request that the Progressive Conservative government uphold platform assurances to protect the Greenbelt in its entirety and pass on a cleaner environment to future generations.
We, the undersigned:
a.	Do not support Schedule 10 of the proposed Bill 66 to remove planning requirements under the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Greenbelt Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, Places to Grow Act, etc. To date, rigorous evidence-based, scientific information or studies regarding the impacts of Bill 66 on areas protected by these Acts have not been provided to the public. More information regarding the potential social, environmental, and economic impacts of Bill 66 and the associated “Open for Business” zoning bylaw is required before informed decisions can be made regarding the proposed Bill 66. These Acts primarily serve to protect our regional ecosystem services; namely, water resources for providing safe tap water and clean recreational environments that support Ontario tourism. Compromising the intentions or ability to uphold these Acts will in turn threaten the safety of our drinking water supplies, our health and the costs associated with drinking water treatment upgrades; and damage tourism and fishing industries in Ontario.
b.	Are concerned for the protection of ground and surface water resources that flow across municipal boundaries and non-market ecosystem services from the Green Belt and southern Ontario that provide an estimated $2.7 billion and $85 billion yearly, respectively, to the province. Schedule 10 would dramatically undermine the integrity of these cross-boundary resources by allowing upper- or lower-tier municipalities to enact an “Open for Business” zoning bylaw, that have far reaching impacts on water quality and ecosystem health beyond municipal borders.
c.	Call for mandatory public and stakeholder consultation as part of the Ministry’s approval process. Are highly concerned about provisions under the proposed Bill 66 which allow municipalities to enact the “Open for Business” zoning bylaw without public meetings or consultation with other stakeholders (e.g. neighbouring municipalities). Due to the far-reaching implications of these bylaws and the provincial government’s own recognition of the importance of meaningful engagement as stated on the Ontario Government Public Engagement webpage (Updated: Sept 5 2018), if amendments to the Planning Act proceed through Bill 66, public and stakeholder consultation must be mandatory.
These comments do not represent the opinions of all members of the Women in Ontario in Water network nor the opinions of our employers. Thank you for the opportunity to comment Bill 66. We appreciate you taking the time to review the opinions of the public during this comment period with the care and attention they deserve. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding Women in Ontario in Water’s feedback.
Sincerely,
Select members of Women in Ontario in Water

I live in the Greenbelt, and these lands contribute to the natural wonder and beauty of this part of our province, and are irreplaceable!
Part of Doug Ford's campaign platform included a promise to leave the Greenbelt intact. I am furious that he is reneging on this now.
This Bill will set back environmental protection by 40+ years - a serious step in the wrong direction.
Once these lands are built upon, paved over, and stripped of their natural resources - they will NEVER return to their current clean, beautiful, bountiful wildlife-sustaining, produce-rich, and soul-enriching state that so many of us currently treasure.
I did not vote for a government that promised one thing and is now going back on that promise and all but willing to ""rape, pillage and plunder"" the natural wonder, beauty and value of one of the most magnificent parts of our planet.

Doug Ford did however promise to not touch the Greenbelt, and this bill change will allow development to happen.
He's giving us the run around and we need more input into this bill before it moves forward.
I believe if one acre of land goes up for sale, the sale should be frozen and Doug Ford held personally responsible. Perhaps a lawsuit would be in order.
We cannot allow this to happen. Doug Ford is moving us backwards, completely disregarding environmental mandates and completely ignoring the importance of the Greenbelt.
Why propose a change to the bill regarding the Greenbelt, if nothing is going to be different?
Please stop this madness before it's too late. Doug Ford's track record speaks for itself.

20885,/comment/20885,"It is clear that in the name of 'opening Ontario for business', Omnibus Bill66 will recklessly dismantle decades of law created to protect the basic rights of the people of Ontario, including the right to:
-  clean air, drinking water and green space
- affordable housing and sustainable communities
- fair notice and consultation with constituents for proposed bylaws that could drastically and detrimentally affect peoples livelihoods and well-beings
- have any appeals process to local tribunals
Opening for business based on Bill 66 will set Ontario on a course that is decades backwards for:
- health and safety laws for workers in this province
- hazardous and toxic exposure and burden to all people
- sustaining and rebuilding a natural environment in need of critical care
- consultation processes and rights for constituents within their municipalities
I've lived my entire life in Ontario and seek to preserve the things we hold dear as Ontarians and Canadians including:
-> the natural environment we have sought hard to conserve,
--> the care and custodianship of the Great Lakes - the largest bodies of fresh water in the world,
-> class 1 agricultural land and the clean ground water needed to sustain production of farms upon this land, and the people and livestock who rely on this ground water for their drinking source.
-> access to safe living care for those most vulnerable such as our elderly and infirm through the long-term care facilities
The proposed overarching repeals in Bill 66 will have deleterious effects upon all people especially those who are too young to have voted for you, and who would be dealing with the fallout of a wrong decision for decades to come.
I am writing this comment because I wish to look my young nieces and nephews, and the children in my community in their eyes and say: I am doing all I can to make this world better for you.
For these reasons and many others that there is not adequate time to formulate a response too, I implore MPPs of all parties to VOTE NO to Bill 66.  Do this so that you may be able to look the vast majority of your constituents who wish to have clean air, safe to drink water and the few green spaces we have left remain protected. Do this especially for those constituents too young to vote for their own future - they do deserve one too.

20887,/comment/20887,"On behalf of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), its 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 740 member clubs, we have reviewed “Bill 66: Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018” (ERO#013-4293), the “Proposed open-for-business planning tool” (ERO#013-4125), and “New regulation under the Planning Act for Open-for-Business Planning Tool” (ERO#013-4329) and submit the following comments.
The OFAH recognizes that environmental policies and approval processes can influence if, where and how development occurs in Ontario. We also acknowledge the potential for duplication and redundancy in policy and approvals that can limit the attractiveness of Ontario for some businesses. The OFAH believes there are opportunities for the province to streamline and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden; however, it must be done in a strategic and targeted way to ensure there are no gaps in important environmental protections. The scope and scale of Bill 66, the proposed planning tool, and the associated regulation have us concerned that such sweeping changes have significant potential to cause irreparable harm to Ontario’s environment.
The proposed regulation suggests that only business-related criteria will be used to determine the threshold for whether or not ‘open-for-business by-laws’ (hereafter referred to as OFB by-laws) would be approved by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH). It appears there is no environmental threshold, meaning that protection of some environmental values will be completely dependent on whether or not the development meets the business-related criteria. If development under an OFB by-law will not be subject to environmental policies with equivalency in prohibitions to those removed in Bill 66, then the OFAH cannot support these changes. A by-law that allows development to circumvent environmental protections for wetlands, headwaters, wildlife habitat and other features is unacceptable.
Our concerns are focused on Schedule 10 of Bill 66 that proposes to eliminate the application of the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, Greenbelt Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, Places to Grow Act, and the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act as it relates to the proposed OFB by-laws. Each of these statutes and their related regulations and policies have varying degrees of necessary protections for the environment and other values. There may be some duplication or redundancy where efficiencies may be found; however, some of the protections offered have no equivalency for certain development scenarios in Ontario. Completely removing the application of multiple policies will result in inadequate protections, increase risks to important values, and is a significant concern.
The PPS has broad application across the entire province and provides provincial direction to municipalities in developing official plans and making land use planning decisions. The PPS is critically important for the protection of wetlands, wildlife habitat and many other important natural heritage features not adequately protected under other statutes. If OFB by-laws have the potential to allow development to occur in or adjacent to wetlands, deer wintering areas or other important ecological features where development should be restricted, then the OFAH cannot support the proposal.
The PPS also requires that prime agricultural lands be protected and designated for long-term use for agriculture because these areas are finite and relatively rare in Ontario. The agricultural industry provides important jobs and plays an important role in Ontario’s economy. A reduction in prime agricultural lands will constrain the long-term potential for agri-food exports, local food production and Ontario’s long-term food security.
Although much of the other legislation listed above is limited in geographical scope, it applies to areas of Ontario that have experienced significant reductions in ecological features (and associated functioning) and those remaining on the landscape are highly strained. The proposed OFB by-laws would completely circumvent multiple conservation and growth plans for these specially protected areas. Conservation organizations such as the OFAH have worked very hard to restore degraded ecosystems in these areas, and the proposed OFB by-laws have the potential to negate decades of work.
We cannot understate the value of healthy natural areas and productive prime agricultural lands, not only for the environment but also to provide enormous contributions to the economic, social, physical and mental wellbeing of millions of Ontarians.
Eliminating the application of so many environmental protections has garnered significant opposition because it appears to be a relatively drastic means to achieve the stated intent of streamlining approvals. It appears to go well beyond efficiencies and head towards minimizing, or even eliminating, environmental oversight. It is imperative for the government to show that OFB by-laws will not result in gaps in protection for important environmental values. The OFAH recommends that MMAH, in consultation with the other relevant Ministries (e.g. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry), undertake a comprehensive analysis to offer a transparent demonstration of what potential environmental protection gaps could occur if Bill 66 becomes law and is implemented. Only then can the public and stakeholders truly understand the potential implications of the proposed changes and offer informed feedback.
As stated previously, the OFAH completely supports a review of the approval processes for development in Ontario to look for efficiencies and offer enhanced business certainty; however, the review must be comprehensive and transparent enough to show the trade-offs between business certainty and any negative consequences (environmental or otherwise). We strongly recommend that any efforts to streamline approvals must use strategic and targeted measures guided by an impact analysis. The analysis should illustrate where redundancy exists (and can be addressed), as well as identify any legislative gaps in protections that would occur as a result of proposed changes. To our knowledge, such an impact analysis has not been completed, or at least not released publicly as a part of this consultation.
The OFAH also has concerns about the proposal to remove the requirement under the Planning Act for consultation or advanced public notice for development in the event of an OFB by-law. While the removal of consultation may reduce the potential time required for approvals, it will undermine the ability for municipalities and the province to determine the impacts of a proposed development and erode public confidence in government impartiality in the regulatory process.
In conclusion, the OFAH supports strong legislative oversight of development in Ontario, particularly as it relates to environmental protections. Decision-making on development today must adequately consider the environment and other critical values needed to sustain us tomorrow. While we also recognize the need to establish an efficient regulatory system to minimize unnecessary burden on business development, it must be done in a responsible way. There are many examples of how insufficient environmental policies have resulted in permanent impacts or enormous costs to make things right. The aftermath of experiences like Hurricane Hazel, Hamilton Harbour, and Walkerton should serve as sobering reminders that strong and preventative environmental policies often end up being the most cost-effective solutions. Finding efficiencies should not come at the expense of effectiveness. We cannot allow short-term business development opportunities to compromise the long-term health and prosperity of Ontario.

Home daycare limits on the number of children. How many children must die in order to get cheaper daycare?
Businesses will, in some cases, not post employment standards and REQUIRE workers to do more overtime over 44 hours per week average.
Toxic chemical regulations were introduced for valid reasons. If they are reduced or cancelled, it will allow businesses to ignore their responsibilities. They may save private money in the short term, but in the long run, Ontario citizens will be paying for cleanups instead. In other words, you privatize profits and download costs to the public purse. Personally, I do not believe that this will make Ontario more competitive.
Long term care is already a risky business for residents. As a senior myself, I certainly do not think that lowering administrative reports will improve things.

20896,/comment/20896,"I strongly oppose this extremely short-sighted, omnibus legislation as it puts the health, safety and well-being of every resident in the province in jeopardy. Contrary to what the government seems to believe, regulations that protect our health, well-being & safety are not just ""red tape"" that is somehow makes the province less economically competitive: business cannot thrive if its workforce is sick...or dead. It cannot thrive if our infrastructure is regularly out of service as a result of environmental disaster or overwhelmed as a result of allowing development that doesn't fit provincial and municipal plans and guidelines. It cannot thrive if our ecosystem is in decline. It cannot thrive if residents have all moved away because Ontario municipalities have done away with everything that made them comfortable places to live. It cannot thrive if the water supply is dwindling and/or contaminated, if soil is toxic and can no longer grow food, and breathing the air makes people sick. It cannot thrive if babies die in childcare while their parents are at work.
The fact that this is being called a ""consultation"" is a joke. Meaningful consultation requires providing the public with the information necessary to provide informed input. Providing an overwhelming list of significant regulatory changes without a shred of explanation as to why the change is deemed necessary or supporting research that outlines the implications of the changes, makes providing informed input difficult, if not impossible.
That said, I feel confident that I can provide informed input on the following:
1. The Open For Business Planning By-Law represents the PC government's breaking of its election promise to protect the Greenbelt. Giving municipalities the opportunity to enact legislation without any public notice, public consultation process, or possibility of appeal that allows developers to ignore regulations including those outlined in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act poses a threat to our health and well-being, to our ability to produce our own food, to the viability of the agriculture industry, to safe drinking water, to good air quality, and to our ability to survive the extreme weather conditions that are becoming more prevalent. There is considerable data showing how business, growth and development do not need to come at the expense of our drinking water, our clean air, or our protected natural areas.
Allowing municipalities to rubber stamp development--without any public consultation process--that doesn't fit with the province's transportation plans, growth plans, and municipal Official Plans, and without an examination of the design and technical aspects of a proposed development to ensure it is attractive and compatible with the surrounding area and infrastructure and contributes to the economic, social and environmental vitality of the municipality, sets the province up for development that will prove costly to municipalities and to the quality of life of their residents, while setting precedents that will facilitate further development that negatively impacts municipalities and their residents. Official plans, developed in consultation with residents, ensure development contributes positively to the fabric of the municipality by ensuring adequate greenspace, appropriate public infrastructure, preservation of heritage properties, and provision of housing. It is not useless ""red tape"": If development has a negative impact on the fabric of a municipality, it will make the area less attractive to business and potential employees.
The Clean Water Act was put in place after the tragedy in Walkerton, Ontario where seven people died from e-coli poisoning -- and people there are still feeling its effects. The regulation requires land use planning decisions to protect drinking water safety and the health of the people of Ontario. 80% of Ontarians get our drinking water from the Great Lakes. Bill 66 threatens the health of the Great Lakes and safety of our drinking water by allowing developers to ignore the various protections currently in place that help protect the health of some of the planet's most important bodies of fresh water.
The Greenbelt protects Ontario farmland, forests, and nature. It provides habitat for wildlife and productive farmland that supports rural jobs, and a strong agricultural business sector. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, severe weather such as floods, wildfires, droughts and ice storms caused $4.9 billion in insurable damage in 2016. The costs in the first six months of this year alone is $350 per household. These costs would increase considerably if these spaces were lost to residential development. The Greenbelt and Ontario’s natural heritage are our strongest assets for growing food, preventing flooding, ensuring Ontarians have clean drinking water and providing habitat for wildlife – ecological services that amount to an estimated $2.6 billion per year, according to a recent study. The Oak Ridges Moraine is similarly important.
2. Restrictions on the number and ages of children home-based child care providers are permitted to care for are in place to prevent more children from being killed while in home-based childcare. If you want to make it easier for parents to find more affordable childcare, fund more childcare spaces. If MPPs have the money to spend on increasing housing subsidies for yourselves, then you must have money to keep our children safe.
3. The Toxics Reduction Act - Unless you provide evidence that these regulations are redundant, then I will assume that repealing this legislation will result in a perpetuation and possible increase in the use and production of toxics that currently pollute our air, our land, and our water and undermine the health and well-being of everyone in the province, and therefore should not be repealed.
I do not support the attacks on the well-being of the province proposed in Bill 66.

We have made several submissions in the last year relating to the subject lands and the limitation in being able to develop the lands due to their ongoing inclusion in the Greenbelt Plan. As noted in the letter below and the full submission which has been forwarded to the Minister (over 1,000 pages so we have not included in the online comments), Bill 66 would allow these lands to be considered to be removed from the Greenbelt Plan rather than waiting until 2027. This is a clear example of how Bill 66 could assist a landowner, who has municipal Council support, to provide for appropriate and needed land development without any adverse impacts.

Dear Messrs. Ford, Clark and Jacobs:
RE: 	Request for Removal of Lands from the Greenbelt Plan and Specialty Crop Area
	Northwest Corner of Barton Street and Fifty Road, City of Hamilton
	OUR FILE 1736A
We are retained as the planning consultants for Avatar International and 1800615 Ontario Inc. with respect to their lands located at the northwest corner of Barton Street and Fifty Road (the ‘subject lands’) in the City of Hamilton. These lands are approximately 4 hectares (9.9 acres) in size and are located adjacent to the City of Hamilton Urban Boundary within the City’s “Lower Stoney Creek” area (see Figure 1 attached). The lands are currently designated ‘Protected Countryside’ on Schedule 1 and ‘Niagara Peninsula Tender Fruit and Grape Lands’ on Schedule 2 of the 2017 Greenbelt Plan. These lands are currently vacant and are surrounded by residential (Foothills of Winona Subdivision) and institutional (St. Gabriel Catholic Elementary School). They are not farmed and cannot be farmed given their physical location and size.
Our client was actively engaged in the Province’s Co-ordinated Land Use Planning review process and the Province’s Agricultural Land Base Mapping review. Throughout the processes, our client has been seeking the justified removal of the subject lands from the Greenbelt Plan Boundary and the Specialty Crop Area, both of which have been supported, on numerous occasions, by City of Hamilton Planning staff and Council.
As the new Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing and Member of Provincial Parliament, we are writing to provide you with the detailed information and analysis submitted under the previous government in support of these requests for your information and consideration as part of any future Provincial Greenbelt and Agricultural Land Base reviews. We have also provided this information to Donna Skelly the new local Member of Provincial Parliament for the Flamborough-Glanbrook riding.
HISTORY OF THE REQUESTS
Our clients were actively engaged in the Provincial Co-ordinated Land Use Planning review process seeking the justified removal of these lands from the Greenbelt Boundary. These requests were supported by City of Hamilton Council, who endorsed the removal of these lands from the Greenbelt Boundary in 2015 and also made separate comments to the Province, through the Co-ordinated Review, that these lands be removed from the Greenbelt Boundary. These requests were based on professional planning opinion, by both the City’s Consultant (Dillon Consulting) and MHBC Planning, on behalf of our client; and, ground-truthed scientific evidence provided by both the City’s consultant (AgPlan Limited, who conducted a LEAR in 2003) as well as an independent consultant retained by our clients to study their lands (DBH Soil Services Inc.).
Submissions and correspondence on these matters have been provided to the Province, for consideration, throughout the various commenting windows. We have included a detailed chronology of the materials submitted under the previous government, as part of this package. We have also provided an update to this chronology, which includes additional correspondence since the original submission was made, up to and including information from February 2018.
The requests are quite simple:
1.	Remove the Subject Lands from the Greenbelt Plan
2.	Amend the Agricultural Land Base Map by removing the Specialty Crop Areas designation
ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION FOR REQUEST FOR REMOVAL FROM GREENBELT BOUNDARY AND SPECIALTY CROP DESIGNATION
As noted, above, considerable amount of detailed analysis has been undertaken by qualified professionals and experts in the fields of planning and agrology. Ultimately, the planning analysis undertaken by MHBC and DBH Soil Services and the City of Hamilton’s consultants (Dillon and AgPlan) arrived at the same conclusion, being that the Subject Lands do not constitute Specialty Crop and should not be within the Greenbelt Plan Boundary. A summary of the justification provided in these reports is highlighted below:
Planning Opinion (Dillon Consulting)
•	Connects residential development planned in neighbouring areas;
•	Concerns with retaining viable farms in remnant parcels;
•	Potential Rapid Transit Route along Barton Street;
•	Adjacent to Highway 8 potential transportation corridor expansion;
•	Potential multi-modal hub north of the area;
•	Contiguous with existing urban boundary;
•	Existing servicing in area;
•	LEAR (2005) did not identify these lands as specialty crop;
Planning Opinion (MHBC)
•	Small parcel size and fragmentation from agricultural operation renders lands not viable for agricultural use;
•	Lands are located in an area identified for future urbanization and are surrounded by urban development;
•	Adjacent land uses (school, residential) pose land use compatibility issues for specialty crop production;
•	City of Hamilton Council passed a resolution which supports the inclusion of these lands within the urban area and has directed staff to initiate the identification of these lands as a strategic growth area for future development for urban areas through the City’s GRIDS 2 process (GRIDS 2 forms part of the City’s Municipal Comprehensive Review);
•	Lands are comprised primarily of Class 4 soils, in accordance with the Canada Land Inventory, and referred to as ‘Non-Prime Agricultural Lands;
•	LEAR assessment undertaken for the City identified the area as having low potential for specialty crop production;
•	Surrounding context is urban in nature;
•	The lands are contiguous to urban land that contributes to forming a complete community;
•	Surrounding development has been designed in consideration of the potential future development of the subject lands including the extension of municipal services and roads;
AgPlan Limited Report (2003)
•	Relative closeness of the urban development increases the probability of conflict over some of the practical necessities associated with farming;
•	The proposed Lower Stoney Creek Expansion area currently has a restricted and relatively lower potential for specialty crop production for the Study Area;
•	Soil capability of the former Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth is relatively lower when compared on the average capability of agricultural lands in other Counties or Regions in Central to Southern Ontario;
•	Need to use Lower Stoney Creek lands for agricultural purposes is diminished given existing economic conditions for agriculture in Southern Ontario;
•	Significant differences in agricultural activity and agricultural potential are present within the Study Area;
DBH Soil Services Report (2016)
•	Subject lands have not been used for specialty crop for at least 8 years and, within the past 8 years, the Subject Lands have been used in diminishing capacity and area for the production of common field crop;
•	Existing soil materials on the Subject Lands are predominantly CLI Class 4 lands, or lands considered as Non-prime Agricultural Land;
•	The Lands are immediately abutting an area of active development (new school and subdivision to the west and north). Agricultural lands, particularly Specialty Crop lands, that are located in areas of active development or adjacent to developed areas are prone to additional risks/challenges including trespassing, vandalism, traffic and complaints concerning common farm practices such as the use of pesticides, fertilizers and manures;
•	Subject Lands lack artificial tile drainage, irrigation or topsoil layer, leading to lower soil capability;
•	Adjacency to a major arterial road with connection to the QEW highway leads to potential traffic conflicts when moving farm equipment;
•	Comprise 4.0 hectares of land, well below the 10 hectare minimum lot size for Agricultural Specialty Crop Zones as indicated in the City of Stoney Creek By-law No. 3692-92 (June 2015);
•	Have no potential for agriculture in the existing condition; and,
•	Have great potential for conflict between any potential agricultural operation at this location and the adjacent developments.
These reports have all been made available to various Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs staff. In March of 2017, this information was presented by City of Hamilton’s General Manager of Planning, Jason Thorne, and Director of Planning, Steve Robichaud, to Sharon Bailey of OMAFRA.
Copies of the Dillon Consulting Report and the DBH Soil Services Inc. report as well as MHBC’s previous justification letters are all included in the chronology binder, for your information. Additional supplemental mapping which provides contextual evidence for the above, including the location of existing and future urban development and transportation infrastructure adjacent to and surrounding the Subject Lands was also provided. These are included with this letter for easy reference, in addition to be contained within the chronology binder.
SUMMARY
With surrounding land uses including residential and institutional; and, a major arterial road and planned transit hub in the immediate vicinity, it is very clear that this area is urban in nature, with limited viable farming opportunities. Despite extensive justification and numerous submissions made throughout the various commenting periods by both our client and the City of Hamilton, which include analysis by both professional land use planners and agrologists that provides evidence that these lands are not Specialty Crop and should not be within the Greenbelt Plan Area, these requests were not appropriately considered by the Ministry and what is at the very core a historical mapping error has not been rectified. The effect of this is that these lands have been rendered essentially undevelopable for any type of use until such time as the Plan is reviewed again as urban uses are not permitted and agricultural uses are not viable due to proximity to sensitive uses. Under the current in-force legislation, this would not be permitted to occur until approximately 2027; however, we would appreciate any assistance you may be able to provide to advance the justified removal of these lands in advance of the next Provincial review.
We thank you for the opportunity to bring this matter to your attention and are available to meet with you to present and discuss this information with you and your team if you wish. We would be pleased to discuss this matter with you and provide any further information you may require.
Yours truly,
MHBC

20900,/comment/20900,"I believe the proposed decision by Premier Doug Ford to open-up the Greenbelt in Toronto to developers is NOT a smart plan! There was reasons why the Greenbelt was established. To set aside a vast nature area to preserve wilderness, protect critical species at risk and continue to allow farmers a secure place to grow crops from the effects of urban sprawl! Given the big size of Toronto, having a protected area from the greed of commercial and residential companies is important to help us reduce our carbon footprint. In addition to promoting people to take part in recreational activities as well as enjoying nature leisurely. I urge you please don't open the Greenbelt to the desires of businesses!!!

I would ask that you, my public representatives oppose ""Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018"" for the sake of us your fellow citizens, both current and future, regardless of political affiliation. This bill which apparently exists to ""stimulate business investment, create good jobs, and make Ontario more competitive by cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date."" will very likely have unintended if not entirely opposing effects. In order for Ontario to be competitive, Ontarians must be healthy and as it stands Bill 66 is more of a ""scourge"" than a ""salve"" to the people. Through reading this document one can see many vital regulations simply being cut.  This is likely because this bill doesn't deal with the true scope of our problems and therefore it simply cannot present us with the solutions we are in need of. It is clear these policies require further examination and improvement, but it is also clear that more collaboration with the scientific/specialist community is needed. For example, with circular economists, ecologists, researchers etc. to encourage a more nuanced approach to the many challenges that we are facing here in Ontario.

20903,/comment/20903,"I’m writing to voice my complete opposition to this legislation, which would erase decades worth of good, safe, and essential environmental protections in Ontario. I am deeply disturbed that our government has coined this proposed legislation ""open for business"". It reaffirms my belief that our current provincial government is only capably of short sighted thinking and analysis.
My understanding is that the legislation is configured to leave the final decision to ignore/disregard environmental legislation is up to municipal councils. This is completely inappropriate. Anyone who has ever thought critically about the environment can tell you that there are no borders to ecosystems. Leaving a single municipality responsible for making decisions about projects with environmental impact is irresponsible and unfair. Not to mention that it leaves municipal councils in a conflict of interest - balancing the environment against development charges, tax income and ""investments"" into the local community that result from new developments.
Of particular concern to me is the risk to erasing The Clean Water Act which was put in place after the tragedy in Walkerton Ontario where seven people died from e-coli. Major improvements to the protection of this essential resource were implemented in The Clean Water Act. This is the area in which I work - municipal water system design. My job as a professional engineer is to safeguard public health and safety. Not just for today, or tomorrow, but for the long terms. For generations to come.
The Ontario government under Ford promised to protect the Greenbelt. The recently released “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan also makes commitments that would be impossible if Bill 66 becomes law.
Please do the right thing and advise the Ministers responsible to reverse the profound environmental rollbacks proposed in Bill 66.

     This does seem to simply things at OMAFRA at all. Particularly disturbing is that the Farm Business Administrator could be a third party corporation other than Agricorp which is already not perfect. This section needs to be clarified and simplified.
Schedule 2
    Would the repeal of the Pawn Brokers Act not make it much easier for criminals to fence the results of their crimes?
Schedule 10
      Agricultural land is a scarce and precious non renewable resource which must be protected throughout the Province.
      Residential, commercial, and industrial development must take place on lands that are properly located, serviced, and zoned.  Municipal Corporations with appropriately designed Official Plans and Zoning Bylaws should be able to draw investment.
     The Open for Business Planning Tool quite clearly and deliberately overrides the protection of agricultural land. This is also the opinion of many Professional Planners employed by Municipal Corporations.
      It is not acceptable to locate residential, commercial, or industrial development on lower priced and unserviced agricultural land.
      Therefore it is recommended that Schedule 10 of Bill 66 the Open for Business Act either be amended so that it does not override protection for agricultural land or that it be deleted in its entirety.
      It is hoped this is helpful. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this very important issue.

Remove outdated and time-consuming reporting requirements under the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Act, including ones required for loan guarantee programs.- this reporting ensures that things are done with respect, with care and without recklessness. Removing them will mean decisions will be made without the kind of care that will keep farmers, the environment and business safe and prosperous.
Enable amendments under the Farm Registration and Farm Organizations Funding Act to simplify delivery of programs and enhance responsiveness. - Simplicity does not always mean better. In fact, it often means things are lost or left unattended.
Schedule 3: Ministry of Education
Remove restrictions on home-based child care providers, including allowing additional children, to make it easier for parents to find affordable child care. - HOLY F!!!!! Are you out of your minds? Ask any parent who stays home....limits on the number of children that can be cared for as CRITICAL to ensure quality day care! This is a monstrous proposal!
Lower the age of children that authorized recreation programs can serve from 6 to 4. - WHY? To help with day care? Or to help Ontario become a leader in sports and rec? This does not make sense!
Schedule 5: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks
Repeal the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 by 2021, remove the toxics reduction plan in 2019 and rely on the robust and science-based Federal Chemicals Management Plan
NO!!!!! The Toxics Reduction Act is in place to care for citizens of Ontario! Removing it is also heinous!

Schedule 7: Ministry of Government and Consumer Services
Reduce where operating engineers are required to supervise. - NO We need confident that engineers have signed on off projects. Not have professionals who are accountable opens the public up to disaster, accidents and excess costs.
Schedule 9: Ministry of Labour
Amend the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA) to reduce regulatory burden on businesses, including no longer requiring them to obtain approval from the Director of Employment Standards for excess hours of work and overtime averaging. - This is outrageous. There is no administrative burden that superceds safety and health.
Stop requiring employers to post the Employment Standards Act (ESA) poster in the workplace, but retain the requirement that they provide the poster to employees. NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
.
Schedule 10: Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing
Introduce a new economic development tool and remove planning barriers to expedite major business investments and speed up approvals by about two years. NO! Planning barriers? They are planinng regulations that ensure health and safety, environmental and ecological services will be maintained, and business will not run over the rest of the province.
Schedule 11: Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities
Amend the Private Career Colleges Act, 2005 to reduce administrative burdens. - What are these burdens? Extra paperwork? They are in place for safety and security.
I am horrified that the current provincial government is proposing these changes. I believe they are giving only superficial credence to all the things that make this province great, and subsuming all these great things under the guise of better business. I am embarrassed to be living in Ontario when I read  what is being proposed. These ideas are short sighted. We are living in times of a global economy, global ecology and global science...but we are stuck with provincial politics; with decisions being made to promote political dynamics that are not well thought out. Indeed, that are faulty.

20911,/comment/20911,"Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018, ERO number 013-4293
Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation would allow municipalities to create an “open-for-business planning by-law” to circumvent planning requirements and land use restrictions under numerous provincial laws, plans and policies.
It would undermine everything we have learned – sometimes under tragic circumstances – about how to protect our environment, and the health of people and communities across Ontario.
We do not want another disaster like Walkerton, or unnecessarily put more stressors on our farmland, natural heritage system, our rivers’ headwaters, native wildlife species and their habitats, the Great Lakes, Lake Simcoe, The Oak Ridges Moraine and Ontario biodiversity.
The fact that provincial government is choosing a course that we can reasonably know will add stressors to an already stressed environment is obviously a very serious issue. At this point, these problems are knowable. The consequences for the environment, human health and indeed climate change are predictable. How we now choose to proceed raises profound questions about our collective obligations to one another, to our society and the entire ecosystem. It raises profound questions about the choices this provincial government is making now as reflected in discussed Bill 66.
“Open-for-business by-laws” can bypass legal requirements intended to ensure fair, consistent and transparent public engagement with land use decisions in our communities.
In other words, these “open-for-business by-laws” would turn back the clock on many years of good planning, community input and strong leadership from previous Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments. They would sidestep laws and policies intended to protect the long-term health and resilience of our communities and their residents by facilitating sprawling and unchecked development in areas that are home to sensitive natural features and the water resources upon which we all rely.

Bill 66 allows municipalities to evade these environmental protection policies for either 50 jobs or 100 jobs, depending on the population within the given area. Prior to approving this Bill, what are the impacts resulting from development in sensitive areas? It is possible that the number of affected water supplies or endangered species will exceed the benefit of 50 or 100 jobs. Consider if these jobs are temporary of permanent because it's very likely that the negative impacts affecting residents or sensitive features will be permanent and potentially irreversible. Municipalities may not have the technical staff to properly assess the potential impacts associated with a proposed development that may create 50 or 100 jobs. Also, municipalities will not be required to post a notice or hold a hearing prior to passing the open for business by-law. This approach is undemocratic and weakens the framework of provincial level plans that have provided strong guidance to municipalities in Ontario.

I oppose the changes in Bill 66 that will result in:

– Critically important agricultural land and greenspace being developed and destroyed.
– More urban sprawl and poorly conceived development.
– Employees working significant amounts of overtime without pay.
– Lower wages for unionized construction workers in many sectors of the economy.
– Less protection from dishonest business practices by wireless companies.

I am one of the 90% of Ontarians who support the Greenbelt. I support the protection of valuable arable land for farming. I support the protection of green space for recreation. I support the promotion of density in urban areas so we can protect our surrounding natural environment for future generations. Once the greenbelt is paved or developed it cannot be undone. We know that land use is one of the three key drivers of climate change. We also know, as per the IPCC's SR15, that climate change has reached a do or die moment. Quite literally we are fighting for the survival of our species. The greenbelt must stay green. We need the environmental services that it provides. It is a carbon sink, it protects the wetlands that provide habitat, clean our water and prevent flooding, it is the breadbasket of our region.
Legislation that deregulates protection of this valuable area is woefully misguided to the point of stupidity. Ontario has lands where it makes sense to develop. Our urban areas have enough space for additional industry and manufacturing jobs. The housing crisis can be solved within urban boundaries where it makes sense for transit and employment opportunities. Protect our green space for the millions of people who depend upon it now for clean water, clean air, climate regulation, healthy food, and recreational opportunities, not to mention the significant benefits these provide to the economy. Protect it now for us but also for our children and grandchildren. Be remembered as a government whose legacy was truly for the people, a government responsible for creating a better future. Not as a government blinded by partisan politics, backroom business dealings, and a terrifying lack of understanding of the implications of the climate crisis.
I support the Greenbelt
I support the Clean Water Act
I support the Great Lakes Protection Act
I support a clean, green present and future for all of us

20937,/comment/20937,"Hello,
I am a Conservative and have been for many years.  I am disgusted that this government would lie during the campaign regarding a changes to any policy regarding the Green Belt.  There are enough available areas to develop without compromising areas that protect habitats and watersheds.  Changes to these areas can happen in short weeks, but take decades to return to nature.
Acts should only be repealed or replaced out necessity.  There are more than enough areas to develop; the government has not proven, nor investigated that there is a requirement to open the Green Belt.
This Bill does not need to include any change to policy in our protected areas.  Thus, Bill 66 should be amended to remove any change to policy regarding the Green Belt.

20938,/comment/20938,"I would ask that the government withdraw this ill advised omnibus piece of legislation.  The democratic rights of local citizens should not be taken away under the guise of making Ontario competitive.  My specific concern is with the way this legislation undermines community planning by local citizens working hand in hand with their elected local Councils.  We expect our elected Councils to be responsive to the concerns of the citizenry that elects them.  We live in our communities and have the right to plan them properly.  This legislation allows Councils and the provincial government to ignore a range of Ontario regulations that are in place to protect the planning process in communities.  No elected body or government officials should be allowed to ignore the requirements of the Clean Water Act 2006, the Greenbelt Act 2005, the Oak Ridges Conservation Act 2001.  No locally elected Council should be allowed to ignore proper notification and meaningful consultation with its public on important planning matters.  No legislation should take away the right of appeal to by-laws made under the Planning Act and acts like those mentioned above.  Competitiveness, efficiency and local democracy can go hand in hand.  Bill 66 in its current draft form takes away the rights of citizens in order to be efficient. The Government of Ontario should never allow this to happen.  The citizenry expects their elected government to protect their rights, not limit them in favour of giving a free hand to private corporations to develop Ontario as they see fit.  Please withdraw this undemocratic piece of legislation.

20941,/comment/20941,"To whom it may concern,
I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill 66 which, if passed, would undermine many critically important pieces of legislation that were created to protect the people of Ontario. Cutting and cancelling these important protections in the name of economic “competitiveness” will endanger lives, hurt our long term economic interests, and lower the quality of life in the province.
I oppose the changes in Bill 66 that will result in:
– Less protection for drinking water sources.
– Critically important agricultural land and greenspace being developed and destroyed.
– More urban sprawl and poorly conceived development.
– Employees working significant amounts of overtime without pay.
– Lower wages for unionized construction workers in many sectors of the economy.
– Daycares with more children and fewer staff to look after them.
– Less qualified caregivers in public schools and daycares.
– Less protection from dishonest business practices by wireless companies.
– Long term care homes being operated by companies with no experience and with less oversight.
Gutting important regulatory safeguards in the hopes of creating a few jobs is incredibly short sighted. Bill 66 will not make Ontario more competitive – but it will endanger our health, our communities, our environment and our future.
For all of these reasons and more, I oppose Bill 66.
Sincerely,

20942,/comment/20942,"Bill 66 is environmentally harmful and undemocratic for the following reasons:
1.	It threatens drinking water across Ontario through circumventing policies that are put in place specifically to preserve clean drinking water for municipalities. This is harmful for the environment, including aquatic life, and will also cost more money in the long-run by creating the need for more intensive water treatment methods across the province.
2.	It threatens important animal habitats for species across Ontario, such as wetlands and woodlands, through bypassing vital regulations for environmental protection.
3.	It allows industry to ignore agricultural protections, which will lead to urban sprawl, and is completely unnecessary considering there are unused land plots in most municipalities in Ontario that could be converted into usable land for business.
4.	It threatens the Greenbelt, which is an area in Ontario important for both the environmental health of the province and its citizens, and also within the culture of Ontario as being a place of natural beauty and heritage.
5.	It overrides efforts to make Ontario communities more livable, sustainable, and resilient through allowing industry to ignore policies that support active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure, and climate resiliency, which is especially important currently as climate change will continue to create more drastic environmental situations within Ontario that communities must contend with.
6.	It compromises transparency and public engagement through allowing by-laws under the Act to be passed without public notice. It also leaves citizens without the ability to appeal the by-laws, which is extremely concerning within a democratic system.
7.	It allows municipalities and industries to bypass more than a dozen environmental regulations that have been created within the last two decades, which is completely undemocratic. If the government believes those regulations to be no longer necessary, then they should repeal them through proper procedure, in a way that is transparent and open for debate, rather than create an Act that allows these regulations to simply be circumvented.

20950,/comment/20950,"Bill 66 constitutes an affront to both the environmental conservation and democratic processes of Ontario. The creation of “open-for-business” by-laws will allow for the circumvention of established environmental regulations by municipalities wanting to attract commercial activity. This is problematic, as businesses that would be enticed by minimal environmental regulations are businesses that would most likely:
1.	Threaten drinking water through the overriding of policies in already approved water source protection plans, which are created to protect the drinking water of Ontarians from the toxicity of landfills and sewage systems
2.	Threaten the conservation of wetlands, forestry, and other habitats for at-risk species through circumvention of the protections in the Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act
3.	Threaten farmland through the circumvention of agricultural protections as laid out in the Provincial Policy Statement, leading to further urban sprawl
4.	Threaten conservation areas and farmland within the Greenbelt through the municipality-sanctioned circumvention of protections
Not only would the implementation of “open-for-business” by-laws endanger public safety and environmental conservation, but there would be no way for citizens to appeal the implementation of said by-laws, as such laws would be unappealable through the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

20958,/comment/20958,"I am providing comment on Bill 66, also known as the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act.  As written, the bill would allow municipalities new power to bypass protection acts including sections of the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, the Greenbelt, and Lake Simcoe Protection Acts.
I care deeply about the Greenbelt, Lake Simcoe,  the Oak Ridges Moraine and clean water. It is home to farmland, forests, watersheds and wetlands. The Oak Ridges Moraine is the rainbarrel of Ontario providing drinking water to over 250,000 Ontarians and feeding many river and streams that flow into Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe.
Cutting red tape can be effective if it delivers services to the public more effectively, but this is a public gift to a small group of property developers and the benefits will not benefit the public. Worse, it is at the expense of our safety, and the quality of life we are able to enjoy and economic opportunity that would be harmed by unmitigated development. Rather than support the health and future prosperity of Ontario, Bill 66 effectively wipes out decades of progress made in protecting water, farmland, natural heritage, and in prudent land-use planning meant precisely to ensure that our province is able to meet the demands of a growing economy far into the future.
Your government did not get elected on this platform. After hearing from Ontarians that they did not want to see the Greenbelt threatened by development, your government wisely promised not to touch that land. Now, Ontarians want to see that commitment fulfilled.

20962,/comment/20962,"This Bill is very concerning to me and my family, and my family in future generations. Many of the provisions in the act would permit unilateral, irreversible, and incontestable changes in the fundamental character of Ontario. Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act and deregulation of the Clean Waters Act would permit the potential fouling of water and soil resources on which Ontario depends for safe drinking water, safe food production into the future, and clean air on which we all rely. Notwithstanding pressures from agricultural and industrial lobbies who stand to increase short term profitability marginally from looser regulations, the long term effects of remediation or loss of agricultural land for the future, of making our water sources unfit for drinking or irrigation, and of health care expenses for treating environmental illness (e.g. E. coli poisoning in Walkerton, respiratory and cardiac conditions in northeast Hamilton) will all impose future costs on every Ontarian for the short term benefit of a few.
Development of livable human environments requires a degree of advanced planning and of stability that seems to be completely ignored by this bill. Livable human environments do require employment opportunities, but they also, especially in cities, require opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment, for healthy living, for rearing children in a safe and stimulating place, and for a vibrant cultural, recreational and natural environment. It is worth remembering that people are what municipalities are all about. Planning should be about creating places where people want to live and work, and it is those people who generate most of the distributed economic activity that actually sustains the urban area. People want a stable, predictable living environment in which to establish their lives. This legislation creates anything but. If people are forced to live in a state of constant uncertainty about their own immediate surroundings because an economic elite controls or overrides the planning processes, Ontario will become a much less desirable place to live.

There is also a surplus of land for new businesses and we should be encouraging investment in these areas. By building within our existing towns and cities throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe we can increase the supply of affordable housing and jobs in our existing serviced communities while holding firm on urban boundaries.
Protected farmland supplies local food and enhances food security at a time when prices are rising and supplies from other countries are increasingly threatened. Farming is also economically important and provides jobs to thousands. Sprawl onto farmland destroys farm businesses and farm communities.
Water is critical to human survival. Opening areas that have been protected for the safety of our drinking water to development threatens our long term health and increases flood risks.

Now, more than ever, we need to safeguard and protect our farmlands, wetlands, forests and other sensitive areas.  Bill 66 goes in the completely opposite direction.  After decades of work by many to protect the environment, instead of continuing in this imperative direction, Bill 66 would allow municipalities to pass by-laws to get around crucial protection plans, such as the Greenbelt Plan, and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, to allow new development.  These plans were made to protect the environment, conserve our resources for our future and are highly regarded by most Ontario residents.
Farmland is precious and in very limited supply.  In Ontario, we are blessed with the fertile lands below the Canadian Shield.  Every day, living in Durham Region, I witness more and more of this precious arable farmland and accompanying woodlots being eaten up by sprawling development.  These lands are needed for our food supply both now and in the future and we cannot get it back once it has gone.  Development has to be reined in here to protect farm land and forest.  Bill 66, however, is both wrong and foolish as it enables the bypassing of safeguards that were set to protect these very lands.
Ontario is also blessed with the beautiful Oak Ridges Moraine - a sensitive area extremely important to safe water supply and natural heritage and it needs protection from development.  it also provides much natural habitat and recreational enjoyment for many.
All of Ontario's forests and wetlands need protection from development.  They provide habitat for wildlife, including many sensitive species and clean our air and water.  They, too, are precious resources in short supply and we must protect them.
Ontario must be LIVEABLE.  Unfortunately, Ontario is increasingly feeling less and less liveable, particularly in the GTA.   There's too much concrete, too much traffic, too much development and not enough green space and open areas, and not nearly enough truly natural areas.  Small subdivision parks, while helpful,  are certainly no substitute for the ecosystems we see in large tracts of natural forests and wetlands.
The premier and government said during the election campaign that they would not open up the Greenbelt.  I urge the government: do not open up the Greenbelt.  Do not allow municipalities or others to go around the Greenbelt Act.  Do not allow municipalities or others to get around the Oak Ridges Moraine Act and the other important protective Acts.

20985,/comment/20985,"Re: Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
Dear Michael Helfinger:
The overall objectives of Bill 66 are fine:
•	stimulate business investment
•	create good jobs
•	make Ontario more competitive by cutting unnecessary regulations that are inefficient, inflexible or out of date
Provisos on the objectives:
•	We shouldn’t give away too much to get businesses to set up – businesses should not need to rely on public largesse in the form of free environmental assets, lowered standards of care, etc.
•	No one needs cumbersome regulations, but businesses should still have to demonstrate that a proposal is well-planned; otherwise any initial benefits (e.g., jobs) will be short-lived and the public will be stuck with remediation costs
Schedule 3
•	It seems fine to allow home-based child care providers to take on additional and younger children as long as there is some way we can make sure the care of each child meets our highest standards
Schedule 5
•	I’m concerned about repealing the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009
•	How do we ensure the objectives outlined in that legislation are met?
•	If all of the objectives of the 2009 legislation are covered by “the robust and science-based Federal Chemicals Management Plan,” then perhaps Schedule 5 represents a gain in efficiency
•	But why not have a measure that would ensure ongoing provincial oversight of application of the federal plan?  The federal plan was only launched in 2016.  What if the federal government should weaken its protection or find itself unable to enforce standards?
•	I would suggest we not repeal, but instead pass an amendment to the Act that gives precedence to the federal legislation and regulations except in instances where there appears to be a gap in protection against toxics
•	There is a statement in the Government’s summary (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4234) that “the Toxics Reduction Program has not achieved meaningful reductions.”  Wouldn’t that suggest we need more protection rather than less?  It seems premature to stop the provincial effort before we are sure the federal plan will cover the same range of chemicals and apply at least the same standards to business operations
•	The exemptions outlined at https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4235 – allowing voluntary planning/reporting on toxics by some facilities, no planning/reporting by others; as well as a requirement for annual reporting by some facilities – seem quite uneven, unless the point is that all provincial reporting on toxics will be stopped by 2021 when the Act is repealed (not entirely clear)
•	There is a statement (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4235) that federal action will have been taken by 2021 “on many toxic substances.”  Again, shouldn’t we keep the provincial statute in place until it is clear all the toxic substances currently covered by provincial measures are in fact being covered as well or more effectively by the federal government?
•	Have the federal and provincial governments agreed that federal agencies will take charge of managing toxics in Ontario?  If we drop the provincial effort, we should ensure there is a seamless transition to federal responsibility
Schedule 8
•	Modernizing and streamlining administrative requirements for the operators of long-term care homes seems fine
•	But again (as with Schedule 3), we need to ensure administrative relief doesn’t compromise the quality of care: there is already evidence that the care of our elderly is not as effective and compassionate as it needs to be
Schedule 9
•	In theory, individuals should be able to decide the hours they are willing to work – but that assumes they are in a position to say no, which may not be the case given financial exigency, precarious employment, etc.
•	Individuals need to have their jobs protected by agreed societal standards
•	Otherwise, why not, for example, say that each employee should be able to decide whether they want to accept dangerous working conditions as well?
•	Rather than removing approval by the Director of Employment Standards for excess hours of work and overtime averaging, the Director should have a reserve ability to intervene if reasonable standards related to the health and well-being of employees are being circumvented by individual businesses
Schedule 10
•	I think this section could have been written more clearly: it’s not really clear to the reader what is intended by terminology such as “non-application of listed provisions”; as well, merely listing numerous sections and sub-sections leaves the intent and effect of the section opaque
•	Close reading suggests that the Government proposes to relieve municipal decision-makers of any need to consider potential negative environmental effects when they approve specific development projects – and that they can carry this ad hoc approach into lands and waters previously protected from development (e.g., greenbelts)
•	It is not really an effective economic development/planning tool if environmental and related human resources that are also vital to our economy (agriculture, tourism, healthy habitats, thriving species, clean water, open spaces, etc.) and are not being taken into account:
•	The planning regulation described at https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4239 doesn’t require a municipality to address any economic factors related to the natural environment (e.g., alternate economic uses)
•	The only protection of environmental and related assets takes the form of a potential intervention by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to protect “matters like public health and safety” when endorsing these ad hoc development decisions – but he/she would have to move very quickly (20 days is not much time): https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/013-4125
•	I would strongly urge the Government to find another way of expediting municipal planning decisions related to new businesses.  Again, the point is not to frustrate businesses, but they need to understand that thorough planning is actually better for long-term growth and profit: allowing deterioration of our natural environment creates costs that have to be borne down the road by governments, by the public and by businesses as local assets are lost or decline
Overall:
•	Providing the public with a risk assessment of the proposed measures would give some clarity on the measures as well as a baseline for monitoring their success/failure (allowing us to remedy any downsides and capitalize on any upsides)
Thank you for your consideration.

RE: EBR Registry # 013-4293 for input on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018
Thank you for the opportunity to submit feedback on the proposed Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018. The York Region Federation of Agriculture (YFA) represents 700 farm members in York Region, most of whom are directly impacted by the Provincial Plans that would be impacted by Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
YFA recommends that Schedule 10 be removed from Bill 66. It is critical that all Acts that protect the permanency, health, productivity, and profitability of Ontario’s farmland and the agri-food sector are retained in full and without exception.
Before addressing the proposed amendments to the Planning Act in Schedule 10 of Bill 66, we emphasize that Ontario only has one landscape. That means that the full range of landforms and land uses found across Ontario; agricultural, industrial, rural, residential, natural heritage, commercial, cultural heritage, mineral extraction, etc. must share that landscape. Ontario’s agricultural areas not only provide us with food, fibre and fuel, but also a broad range of environmental and ecological goods and services that benefit all Ontarians. To fulfil their role and function for all Ontarians, Ontario’s prime agricultural lands must be separated from non-compatible land uses. To do otherwise, as Schedule 10 of Bill 66 proposes, will be “death by a thousand cuts” for the family farm businesses, farm input supply businesses and food processing businesses located throughout Ontario.
Agriculture is Southern Ontario’s principle resource-based land use. Protecting Ontario’s prime agricultural areas for their long-term agricultural use is a key provincial policy objective, noted not only in the Planning Act [section 2.(b)], but also in the Provincial Policy Statement, the Greenbelt Plan, the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and the Niagara Escarpment Plan. Retaining our finite and shrinking agricultural lands for the production of food, fibre and fuel is critical, and supportive of Ontario’s family farm businesses, farm input supply businesses and food processing businesses.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 is a direct attack on the family farm businesses, farm input supply businesses and food processing businesses located throughout Ontario. On-farm production of food underpins a broad spectrum of rural and urban businesses. Farm input supply businesses provide the goods and services farm businesses depend upon; seed, feed and fertilizer, farm equipment dealerships, building supply retailers, not to mention veterinarians, banking, insurance, etc. There are numerous food processing businesses located throughout Ontario, but concentrated in the Greater Toronto/Hamilton area, dependent on the fruits, vegetables, grains, oil seeds, livestock, poultry and fish grown and raised by Ontario farm businesses.
In 2017, Ontario’s family farm and food processing businesses contributed $39.5 billion in GDP and supported 822,483 jobs. Agriculture and agri-food is the number 1 economic contributor to Ontario’s overall economy. Jeopardizing these stabile, recession resistant businesses and jobs runs counter of an “open-for-business” mindset. Agriculture is a business. This proposal presumes that agricultural land should no longer be preserved and protected for agriculture to make way for commercial and industrial businesses. By putting Schedule 10 forward, the Ontario government is suggesting that agricultural businesses should be shut down and paved over to make way for industrial development.
While Bill 66 claims to “give businesses more flexibility to create jobs right here at home”, Schedule 10 forgets and abandons the businesses that are already here in our agri-food sector. As noted, agriculture and agri-food are Ontario’s number one employer economic.
YFA appreciates the Ontario government’s intention to cut red tape and be “Open for Business”. However, there is another way that does not compromise our agricultural businesses, our clean water, and strategic land use protection. Agri-food is the recession-resilient answer to economic growth in this province.
The primary principle behind land use planning is to group compatible uses together, while at the same time separate non-compatible land uses. The widespread practice of dedicating large, contiguous tracts of agricultural land solely for agricultural uses is to facilitate their viability, and to ensure that non-compatible uses, which are detrimental to agricultural viability, are located elsewhere. Agriculture in the 21st century needs large, contiguous tracts of agricultural land reserved for agricultural uses. It minimizes complaints from non-farm neighbours over agricultural odours, noises, dusts, etc. While none of these “nuisances” pose a threat to public health or safety, they nevertheless to do present a temporary inconvenience; manure odours, dusts from planting, tilling or harvesting, noises from livestock or farm equipment operating at odd hours to avoid impending adverse weather.
Locating industrial facilities outside of urban settlement areas benefits no sector of the economy.
Municipalities will be faced with the need to service scattered sites located at some distance from fully serviced settlement areas. Neighbouring farm businesses have to contend with incompatible uses adjacent to them (industrial odours, noises, dusts, etc.). Facilitating scatted industrial sites also facilitates the fragmentation of a finite and shrinking resource, Ontario’s prime agricultural land, which provides Ontario’s agri-food processors, retailers and restaurants with safe, affordable, locally produced (greenhouse gas benefits) and close to market food. A mere 5% of Ontario’s land base is currently capable of supporting agricultural production. Between 2011 and 2016, Ontario lost 319,700 acres of agricultural land, or the equivalent of 175 acres/day over that 5-year period. Going back to the 1996 census, Ontario has lost 1.5 million acres of agricultural land.
Agricultural land not only provides us with safe, affordable food, but also provides a range of ecological and environmental services that benefit all Ontarians. In alphabetical order, these services include aesthetic and recreational space, air quality (carbon sequestration, climate regulation, oxygen production), biodiversity, nutrient cycling, pollination services, soil erosion control and water cycling (flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, purification, retention).
Facilities located outside the urban envelop will face a lack of services, or higher costs to service their site, plus longer distances for inputs and outputs; distances to shipping points, etc. Furthermore, employees will live at some distance from these remote and scattered facilities, leading to longer commute times and reliance on private vehicles as these new sites will not be served by public transit.
YFA urges the provincial government to enhance agri-food growth in Ontario by showing farmers and food businesses that we are “Open for Business” by:
o	using the Provincial Policy Statement definitions and language in all Four Provincial Plans. A lack of consistency across the Plans leads to confusion for businesses and subjective interpretation by the many stakeholders involved.
o	adhere to the designated greenfield density targets of “not less than 80 residents and jobs combined per hectare” and implement this requirement as soon as possible. In addition, OFA would welcome the adoption of fixed, permanent urban boundaries to contain urban sprawl.
o	transferring oversight of the Niagara Escarpment Plan from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH). Businesses should not need to contact multiple ministries and multiple governing bodies for similar provincial plans.
o	targeting smaller communities for infrastructure and economic investments to distribute economic development, reduce congestion and growth pressures in the GTA. The growth pressures will continue to make life unaffordable and challenging for the average resident, not to mention the pressure of developing agricultural land; Ontario’s most important resource.
o	the current pattern of growth is unsustainable. The Province’s priorities to increase housing supply and affordability, create jobs, reduce red tape, attract new investments, and build strategic partnerships align exceptionally well with our Producing Prosperity plan, and OFA has solutions that will mutually achieve our objectives.

20991,/comment/20991,"RE:EBR#013-4293 Bill 66, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act 2018
The Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA) welcomes the opportunity to provide comments to the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, 2018 (Bill 66).
Our organization is member-based, non-partisan and non-profit and focused on providing leadership on issues affecting the public's health and strengthening the impact of people who are active in public and community health throughout Ontario. Created in 1949, OPHA has a long track record of offering evidence-based public health expertise in diverse federal and provincial policy initiatives.
We appreciate the government’s actions to support business investment and create quality employment, and we recognize this as a key element of healthy, sustainable and complete communities. At the same time, we strongly urge that the provincial government consider the impacts of Bill 66 on the public health and safety of residents of Ontario and the health of the environment that supports human health.  OPHA strongly urges that the province consider our recommendations and address the concerns that we have identified below, prior to this bill proceeding through the legislative process.
OPHA’s comments, outlined below, relate to three schedules contained within Bill 66:
•	Schedule 3 – Amendments to the Child Care and Early Years Act, 2014
•	Schedule 5 – Repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009
•	Schedule 10 – Changes to the Planning Act, 1990
Schedule 3: Amendments to the Child Care and Early Years Act, 2014 (Ministry of Education)
1.	OPHA recommends that the Province consider the public health (infection control, food safety, and general sanitation) and safety implications of reducing the restrictions on home-based child care providers and authorized recreation and skill building programs and maintain existing child care and after school adult-child ratios.
Bill 66 would increase the number of children that can be cared for under the age of two in both licensed and unlicensed home child care settings. OPHA recognizes the efforts to enhance child care availability to families by increasing the total number of children under the age of two that can be cared for by home child care providers. However, we have grave concerns about the implications for children’s health and safety. We strongly urge the government to evaluate the effects of this legislation on child safety and developmental outcomes. For example, the proposed changes will not adequately address issues of access, affordability, and quality child care for families. Similar to our high quality education system, a child care strategy that prioritizes accessibility, affordability and quality is best addressed through a government system that ensures universal access to high quality care.
In addition, there may be implications to infection prevention and control due to the proposed amendment to paragraph 4 subsection 6 (4) of the Child Care and Early Years Act, 2014, which recommends the reduction of the age restriction from six years of age to four for registration in authorized recreation and skill building programs. Authorized recreational and skill building programs are not proactively inspected for food safety nor infection prevention and control by local public health units. With immunization follow-up doses for several diseases (e.g. measles, pertussis, and chickenpox) not occurring until a child is between 4 – 6 years, coupled with the potential for decreased hygienic practices and larger numbers of children congregating in one location , there is the potential for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases. Facilities that are not required to be inspected may not have the administrative (e.g. policies on when to exclude ill children) or physical (e.g. appropriate disinfectants) infrastructure to prevent infections. By lowering the age from six years to four, a potential increased infectious disease risk will occur for children 4-6 years attending these programs. Consequently, OPHA recommends that neither of these changes to regulatory measures be implemented.
Schedule 5: Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 and Regulations (Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks)
1.	OPHA strongly urges the Province not to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act.
As noted in our submission to EBR#013-4235, OPHA strongly urges the Government not to repeal the Toxics Reduction Act. The Toxics Reduction Act and Regulation 455/09 under the Act have increased protection of public and environmental health by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and informing Ontarians about toxic substances. Ontarians are exposed to hundreds of chemicals every day through the air we breathe, the food and water we consume, and the things we handle.  Some of these chemicals have the potential to cause adverse health effects and may play a role in the development of chronic diseases such as cancer.
OPHA strongly supports regulatory action to reduce the public’s exposure to toxic substances. Requirements under the Toxics Reduction Act and Ontario Regulation 455/09 for facilities to quantify and report on the use, creation and release of toxic substances within their facility helped inform industry, workers, consumers and the public on chemical exposure in communities and workplaces. Preparation and reporting of Toxics Reduction Plans helped manufacturers identify cost-savings, and worker and environmental protections, that also enabled them to showcase their commitment to sustainable business practices.
Leading up to and following the enactment of the Toxics Reduction Act in 2009, OPHA was pleased to be part of the Ministry of Environment’s Multi-Stakeholder Group that brought together industry, non-governmental health and environmental groups, and First Nations to work on regulations and frameworks towards full implementation of the Toxics Reduction Program. With a two-pronged goal of preventing pollution by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances and informing Ontarians about those substances, the Toxics Reduction Program achieved results to protect Ontarians from exposure to toxics substances.
2.	OPHA recommends that the Province consider the value-added elements of the Ontario Toxics Reduction Program beyond what is provided by the Federal Government’s Chemical Management Plan
The Toxics Reduction Act requires regulated facilities to report on the use, creation and release of regulated substances and to prepare Toxics Reduction Plans. Regulated facilities are required to make this information publicly available. They are also required to identify whether they will be implementing the Plan or actions within it. In this way, facilities are encouraged and incentivized to make reductions. Many facilities identified that there would be financial and environmental savings from implementing their Toxics Reduction Plans.
While OPHA supports efforts to avoid duplication between provincial and federal regulations, it is important to recognize the value added by the Toxics Reduction Act to further reduce toxic substances, including cancer-causing agents, in Ontario. Existing federal requirements through the National Pollutant Release Inventory and the Chemical Management Plan have limitations.   A 2018 report by the federal Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development identified that despite ongoing efforts, the Federal government still had gaps in selected areas such as enforcement to effectively control the risks of toxic substances. These can leave our population and environmental health at risk.
The federal Chemical Management Plan does not require that regulated facilities prepare a Toxics Reduction Plan. At the same time, it is not clear that the reporting requirements under the National Pollutant Release Inventory will adequately capture the reporting of creation, use and release of the many thousands of toxics substances that people are potentially exposed to in Ontario.
3.	The Toxics Reduction Program achieved significant results in reducing the creation, use and release of toxics substances in Ontario
According to the 2017 Minister’s Annual Report on Ontario’s progress to implement the toxics reduction program, there have been measurable decreases, year over year, in levels of toxic substances used and created by regulated facilities in Ontario.  The report reported that between 2015 and 2016, across all regulated facilities, there was a:
•	""6% decrease in use of toxic substances;
•	2% decrease in creation of toxic substances;
•	9% decrease in the amount of toxic substances contained in product;
•	 2% decrease of substances released to air, land and water; and
•	3% decrease in the levels of carcinogens being released to the environment.”
4.	The Toxics Reduction Program could do more to protect Ontarians from exposure to toxic substances and support businesses through full implementation of Regulations under the Toxics Reduction Act
While the Toxics Reduction Act has achieved some results in protecting Ontarians from exposure to toxic chemicals there is the potential to do more, and a need to support Ontario businesses to achieve the intended goals of the Act. This work could provide important economic benefits, create new markets, and support employee health and safety. Similar legislation has shown to be effective in other jurisdictions in the United States that have required toxic reduction plans. The province could evaluate more effective opportunities for toxics reduction to protect the health of Ontarians and the environment while reducing barriers for business.
The Act had provisions that could better address workplace exposure to toxic substances. The Toxics Reduction Act also focused on reducing toxic substances in consumer products. There are also provisions under the Act allowing the government to establish toxics reduction targets. More substantial toxics reductions, consumer and worker protection, and public ‘right-to-know’ could be realized if these provisions were to be fully implemented under the Toxics Reduction Act. Finally, the Toxics Reduction Act had a Living List Framework for reviewing and updating the list of substances prescribed under the Act, whereby anyone could nominate a change to the list. In order to be effective, this framework must be easy to navigate and supported by provincial resources to ensure that the list remains current and includes all toxic substances, including ‘substances of concern’ to which Ontarians are exposed.
Schedule 10: Changes to the Planning Act (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing)
Community design is central to promoting the health of all Ontarians, reducing the burden of preventable diseases, and decreasing health care costs. For example, physical activity, healthy eating and protection from exposure to contaminants in our air, land and water are achieved and promoted by healthy and complete communities that are compact, pedestrian-friendly, transit-supportive, and contain a mix of uses that support daily living.
Healthy and complete communities also entail the protection of the natural environment, which provides innumerable benefits such as breathable air, fresh water for drinking, climate-resiliency, protection from flooding, droughts, and extreme weather, and rich soils to grow our food.  Healthy and complete communities support health care savings through cost avoidance.
1-	OPHA recommends that the Province remove schedule 10 from Bill 66 given the environmental and public health impact of proposed development. In particular, two areas of existing legislation are highlighted from a public health perspective:
a.	Importance of provincial policy for environmental health protection.
Should the proposed changes take effect, it would be important that municipal, public health and environmental authorities be granted the ability to assess potential risks and hazards to health and the environment. Bill 66, as currently drafted, allows local municipalities to exempt new economic growth opportunities from all existing municipal and provincial regulations and public consultation. These mechanisms were put in place to protect the environment and health of Ontarians. In by-passing established regulations, the creation of 50 or 100 or more new jobs for smaller or bigger municipalities respectively could come at the cost of irreparable damage to the environment and public health.
The links between health and the environment (both natural and built) have been well established. As such, current regulations recognize the importance of evidence-based approaches and support building healthy and complete communities that consider climate change mitigation and adaptation. These regulations protect and promote health through better air quality, protected drinking water supplies, reduced urban heat islands, mitigation of vector-borne diseases, and increased community resiliency, physical activity and general well-being.
For example, it is critically important to the health and safety of Ontarians that no development occur that could impact access to clean drinking water.  Section 39 of the Clean Water Act currently requires all Planning Act decisions to conform to policies in approved source protection plans that address significant drinking water threats prescribed by the Clean Water Act (e.g. landfills, sewage systems, and the storage or handling of fuel, fertilizers, manure, pesticides, road salt, organic solvents and other substances on lands near wells or surface water intake pipes used by municipal drinking water systems). This important provision must remain applicable to all municipal planning and zoning decisions in order to protect public health and safety.
In addition, conservation of natural heritage features such as the Greenbelt addresses climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration) and adaptation (mitigating flood risks). For example, the Greenbelt actively stores carbon, with an estimated value of $4.5 billion over 20 years; annual carbon sequestration is valued at 10.7 million per year[i]. Benefits of greenspaces are communicated within the ‘Preserving and Protecting our Environment for Future Generations: a Made in Ontario Environment Plan’ which identifies the government’s commitment to protect the Greenbelt for future generations[ii].
Consideration should also be given as to how the review of Open-for-Business By-laws for major employment developments will be aligned with other Provincial initiatives related to regulating industrial greenhouse gas emitters.
Bill 66 has the potential to increase environmental and health inequities between municipalities. For example, if an action is taken that negatively impacts the quality of a river upstream in one community, it could pose a risk to people and the environment further downstream in another municipality. The potential challenge with Bill 66 is the removal of various policy mechanisms designed to equitably support local municipal policy decisions for the benefit of the environment and the health of residents across Ontario.
b.	Protecting the role of municipalities in planning community structure, healthy communities and planning feasibility.
Future major employment uses support the achievement of healthy and complete communities.  This will ensure that new large employment developments consider healthy development matters and can be well integrated and connected to the community.
Current growth in any sector should occur in a logical, comprehensive form that does not put undue strain on our food, transportation, or infrastructure systems. Exempting certain developments from this policy may increase the overall risk to public health. Locating employment uses outside of the transit system causes inequities for those who cannot afford to drive. Permitting employment uses in rural areas may facilitate development sprawl, leading to further traffic issues on roads. Allowing employment and industrial uses in agricultural and natural heritage areas can affect the viability of farms, the quality of surrounding well water and land use compatibility issues for adjacent residential uses.
An unintended consequence of Bill 66 as currently drafted can be an increased cost for municipalities by negating long-term planning for street network design, road capacity, and transit route planning.  It could permit the development of employment lands outside the designated employment zoning identified within long-term municipal planning documents. These lands would not have been considered when forecasting and budgeting for the long range water and waste water plans, or transportation (including transit and active transportation) plans. This could have unanticipated costs for the local municipalities that may well go beyond the benefits gained through increased employment.
There are potential unintended consequences of the proposed Open-for-Business Planning Tool. Checks and balances, as well as opportunities, that could be achieved through adherence to local planning polices, such as the official plan, would be lost.  For instance, lack of planning controls could result in loss of protection of the urban boundary, leading to the potential for land speculation and unrestricted growth. The lack of site plan control could result in missed opportunities to promote a vibrant public realm that could benefit communities; for instance, active street fronts, landscaping, provision of trees, active transportation pathways and connections. The removal of density bonusing may result in lost public goods (i.e. trails, local services, parks, etc.). These could have population health consequences through unhealthy built environments, contributing to higher health care costs, as well as costs to the municipality in meeting long-range planning needs.
2-	OPHA recommends that the Province clarify the employment requirements to ensure good quality jobs are created that contribute to healthy communities.
Bill 66 has the potential to allow for employment uses that do not meet the density targets required to create healthy and complete communities. The job creation thresholds proposed in the Regulation (50 jobs for municipalities with a population of less than 250,000 and 100 jobs for municipalities with a population greater than 250,000) seem low in light of the overall employment targets considered in some of the existing provincial and municipal planning legislation.
OPHA supports a reduction in processing time for sustainable employment uses that generate high quality jobs that are not land intensive. However, the proposed legislation has not provided definitions for major employment uses that trigger the new tools. Many major employment uses do not meet the density criteria for new uses such as warehousing and manufacturing that rely on technology rather than staffing for the production of goods. This type of employment use will not provide enough meaningful employment opportunities to warrant the measures offered in Bill 66. Consider opportunities to prioritize higher targets of employment that offer conditions for workers to connect with their communities, access existing community and health services and provide good quality of life.  Consider also conditions of the sustainability of employment overtime so that the employment targets are long term, and not reduced after a few years.
While Bill 66 has the potential to contribute to the Ontario economy by promoting employment and growth, it is essential that the potential negative impacts to human health and the environment be considered. It is also important to highlight that, from an economic perspective, a healthier population equates to lower health care costs. The health care costs already make up the largest proportion of Ontario’s expenses and a growing and aging population will increase demand on the health system. Supporting public health and environmental health legislation has the potential to reduce those health costs. OPHA urges the government to assess these important environmental and public health consequences of Bill 66 that will offset any short-term economic benefits prior to its continuation through the legislative process.
As the regulations stand now, OPHA is gravely concerned that important components of the Planning Act will be weakened through the introduction of Schedule 10. This opens the doors to municipalities to override existing environmental regulations to develop in protected green space and aquifer recharge zones. Such change threatens the environmental protection controls that have been put in place to avoid a repeat of what happened as a result of the contamination of the water supply in Walkerton. These control measures include, for example, the Clean Water Act, Greenbelt Act, Oak Ridges Moraine, Environmental Sensitive Areas, Niagara Escapement controls and Planning Zones, the Source Water Protection Plans and wellhead protection zones.
The volunteer members our Environmental Health and our Built Environment Workgroups have pooled their knowledge and expertise to assess the impact of the regulatory changes highlighted above. We strongly urge the provincial government not to proceed with these changes due to the negative consequences for the health and wellbeing of Ontarians and the environment. We would be pleased to talk about other options to address the government's policy goals while not removing critical health protection measures.

20995,/comment/20995,"Sierra Club Ontario - Peel Group submission to EBR registry re Bill 66
I am writing this submission as Director of Sierra Club Ontario - Peel Group.
Ours is an active group of volunteers that has been engaging and empowering citizens in environmental stewardship since 2004. Ontario's Greenbelt, forests, watersheds, and natural areas are vital to our health. Our agricultural lands are essential for our food security. Good water quality and quantity are an absolute necessity. An open-for-business policy must ensure these basics are protected by law.
We do not support the proposed amendments to the Planning Act, specifically, adding a new section 34.1 which would allow local municipalities to pass “open-for-business” planning by-laws that could bypass the Clean Water Act 2006, Great Lakes Protection Act 2015, Greenbelt Act 2005, Lake Simcoe Protection Act 2008, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act 2001, Places to Grow Act 2005, or the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act 2016. We do not support the cancellation of the Toxics Reduction Act 2009 or the removal of the toxics reduction plan.
An ""open-for-business"" policy must engage all stakeholders in consultation to ensure changes do not put people, property or our natural environment at risk. The province should pursue ongoing consultation with Conservation Authorities and Municipalities to effect any necessary changes.
Economic development projects should occur within settlement areas where water/wastewater, transportation, and communication infrastructure are well established. Within the current boundaries of urban expansion, as allowed by the existing Places to Grow Act, there is plenty of opportunity for development and densification.
Urban sprawl is costly and inefficient, wastes energy, spreads air pollution and is detrimental to our health and the health of our natural environment. Economic opportunities outside urban boundaries are readily available in Agriculture, Conservation, Sustainable Energy, Heritage and Tourism and can be designed to support local communities and enhance the health and long term sustainability of our natural environment.
Schedule 10 of Bill 66 is not in the public interest and does not adequately safeguard the health and safety of the people of Ontario. If Ontario is to be open for business, we should proceed with smart growth that provides a healthy balance between environmental and economic needs, and that respects, and protects in law, all Ontario communities and our natural environment.

A repeal of the TRA would allow industry to use and create toxic chemicals into the environment.
This is a reckless bill to propose. It is bad for our environment, bad for our water, our air and our health. This is an attack on legislative provisions that were thoughtfully put in place to protect public health and safety. I did not vote for the Ford Conservative Government. The values of this government do no align with mine and I do not agree with their undermining of the current land and water protection acts.
This bill will not create sustainable jobs rather, create low wage, temporary construction jobs. It will lead to low quality, hastily built homes and buildings that will become a burden to homeowners and tenants. The aftermath of this bill if passed will be owned by the people and the municipalities and the PC government will assume no responsibility. Now is the time to focus on urban area intensification to create livable, walk-able, sustainable cities.

21010,/comment/21010,"I spend time in two very different municipalities in Ontario . One is mostly rural and the other is in a municipality with some of the worst air quality in Ontario. I therefore have a vested interest in every issue in this poorly thought out piece of proposed leglislation.
1. The province needs to set the highest standards and not choose the lowest common denominator which would allow ""open for business by-laws"" to  become the most important factor. Bill 66 is a flagrant attempt to appease those businesses which are already responsible for poor air quality, plundering water resources, creating urban sprawl , dumping toxic waste etc. Citizens have been working with municipalities to create municipal official plans that go even further than the most stringent legal requirements that have been put in place to date. These critical legal requirements protect water, natural heritage, farmland and human health and well-being.
2. I travel frequently on the fringes of the ""Blue Belt"" and understand the fragile nature of our water resources. Bill 66 threatens drinking water across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws are detrimental to policies for  approved source protection plans intended to protect existing and future sources of municipal drinking water. There are continual threats from sources such as landfills, sewage systems and improper handling of fuel, manure and pesticides.
3. Bill 66 undermines federal policies and programs that protect wetlands, woodlands and habitat for species at risk . Provincial policies are supposed to enhance these programs with special consideration for some of the unique features of each province. ""Open-for-business by-laws""  would circumvent protections for these important habitats and species set out in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) under the Planning Act. The Bill could also create conflict with neighbouring provinces who are currently working in harmony with Ontario on these issues.
4. Bill 66 threatens farmland across Ontario. Open-for-business by-laws would bypass
agricultural protections set out, for example, in the PPS. This could lead to more urban sprawl.
5. Bill 66  threatens two million acres of natural areas and farmland across the Greenbelt.
Open-for-business by-laws would override protections for natural heritage and farmland set out in the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.
6. Bill 66 threatens freshwater and the ecological health of the Lake Simcoe watershed. Open-for-business bylaws would over ride the requirements of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan.
7. Bill 66 shows the utmost contempt for citizens, municipalities, and organisations who have been steadily improving the quality of life in Ontario communities. These combined efforts have made communities more livable, sustainable and resilient. Open-for-business by-laws would override PPS policies supporting active transportation, affordable housing, green infrastructure and climate resiliency.
8. Bill 66 encourages a lack of transparency and public engagement. Contrary to current
legal requirements (Planning Act, Clean Water Act), the by-laws could be passed without
any prior public notice, behind closed doors.
9. Bill 66 would leave citizens without recourse and the ability to appeal open-for-business by-laws to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
10.Bill 66 proposes the repeal of the Toxics Reduction Act. I have first hand knowledge of current community liaison committees which work with local industrial facilities to explore ways to reduce the use and emission of toxic chemicals in their operations. Reducing toxins often creates a higher quality product so that in the long term businesses become more competitive. The citizens of Ontario unlike the proponents of Bill 66 understand such concepts

Re: Bill 66 – Ontario Provincial Government Proposed legislation
Recommendation: That the South Lake Simcoe Naturalists recommend the Province of Ontario immediately abandon this legislation and implore that they not proceed to try and pass Bill 66 in the Ontario legislature.
The South Lake Simcoe Naturalists are very concerned about Bill 66 proposed by the current Ontario Government that would give municipalities a so called tool to override existing important natural and cultural heritage, environmental and health and safety existing legislation. The current Ontario government wrongly sees the current land-use planning process as impeding economic development, in support of jobs through a purported “open for business planning bylaw”.
From our review most of the Bill 66 proposed will roll back important aspects of existing legislation such as the Clean Water Act (adopted after the Walkerton tragedy), The Greenbelt Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Act, Places to Grow Act (Growth Plan), etc. and is ill-conceived. The wide-ranging Omnibus nature of this legislation is truly concerning and obviously lacks balance and a full understanding of real on the ground land-use planning implications. A central concern is that this proposed Bill would allow municipalities to pass a by-law to place employment uses and secondary uses such as residential and commercial anywhere in Ontario without conforming to these important Acts, and indeed contravene their own recent existing Official and Secondary Plans arrived at through extensive local community consultation and good planning process. We would obviously strongly disagree with this. Many other commentators, legal advisers and media and academics have detailed these serious flaws in this policy move and proposed Bill 66 including concerning municipal Zoning change implications. Also, there is lots of additional information and analysis easily available on the internet, including the detailed Bill 66 itself, which anyone can search. We implore Provincial M.P.P.’s and Government staff personally undertake their own review of this legislation and legal and academic review that are also available in the public domain (legal review - Aird & Berlis LLP, Stikeman Elliott LLP, C.E.L.A. etc.)
It is noted that no public notice or hearing is required prior to the passing of the open-for-business planning by-law proposed. From our inquiries, the provincial government is now advising that the fundamental powers and responsibilities regarding decisions approving development projects is with the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. This was historically the case, and from experience, will ultimately result in some cases further high-level legal fighting, and municipality representatives facing angry residents at the front line of controversial, scientifically and socially indefensible developments at their local neighbourhood level, by a municipality who would support this tool. Similarly, provincial responsible agencies (M.O.E.E. and M.N.R – new names) and Conservation Authorities will have to deal with idiosyncratic breeches scientifically delineated Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine land-use problems and the later deleterious results of impacts on Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes in Southern Ontario! Despite the Province calling it a planning tool to empower municipalities, it will force local public community members to act against their municipalities more than is presently the case. Ultimately, it is difficult to see how this local purported community-based decision making, further top-down directive driven is helpful to anyone, including the Province itself. It is not, and a slippery slope “prescribed” based process, which none of us need.
The Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine Acts and Plans are established integral components of land use planning in Ontario that complement the Growth Plan to encourage smart planning in York Region. We want and need all our local municipalities (consistently across the Region (and the entire Southern Ontario landscape) to champion the priorities within the existing land-use planning process resulting in the reduction of sprawl, protection of natural and hydrological features and agricultural lands, and conservation of wildlife through the developing confirmed landscape ecology principles of existing policy and legislation at the local and provincial level.
Indeed, with this Bill 66 it would seem apparent employment uses could be built anywhere in the province without following our well-established public planning process in Ontario. This is poor planning! Our members research, and our own knowledge of our local area and municipalities confirm that there is an excess of economic development land here, and in cities across the Greater Golden Horseshoe, that have been identified for that use. There is no need for this legislation, the appropriate lands are already identified as we have previously advised, in existing approved municipal Official and Secondary Plans, including in the South Lake Simcoe regional area.
In this South Lake Simcoe Region the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine Act and Plan, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and Plan, and Clean Water Act existing complete provisions, critical to the health of all our communities, and the wildlife we share with them, must not be undermined.
Regarding the Greenbelt in Southern Ontario, it has protected 1.8 million acres of farmland, local food supplies, the headwaters of our rivers and important forests and wildlife habitat for over 12 years. We are advised that it generates 9.1 billion dollars in revenue each year, creating 161,000 local jobs across 28 municipalities. It ensures our food security by providing us with local food, encouraging young farmers to step in. Its continued clearly defined and defensible boundaries must not be tampered with, for clarity for developers and all the people, wildlife and natural and cultural landscapes of Ontario.
We have broadly consulted and advised that municipalities, upon review especially of Schedule 10 of Bill 66, stand with us and many others opposing this proposed Bill 66. We are advised that many Ontario municipalities have rejected supporting this Bill 66 by Resolution, Guelph, Burlington and Halton Hill among others, and the Aurora and Town of Georgia in our Region that we are aware of at this point. We support these municipalities decision in this regard. As many other individuals and organizations have noted our communities are not “red tape”. Similarly, our wildlife, rivers and streams, local food security and the future health and well-being of our children is also not simply red tape. The provisions of existing Ontario Land-use planning and zoning are there for good reason.
Many of our SLSN members are small business people themselves, professionals and others, and are involved in community organizations, and active in social, cultural and natural heritage organizations in our municipalities.  At the end of the day, it is up to the local municipality representatives to speak up for their citizens for good, rigorous and open planning process, and defend the integrity of the policy, existing legislation Acts discussed previously above. Many of them are, against the Province to protect our existing Ontario landscape, wildlife and natural habitat and farmland. Therefore, we thereby request the Province of Ontario immediately abandon this legislation and implore that they not proceed to try and pass Bill 66 in the Ontario legislature. We request formal notification of any and all future actions taken by the Province of Ontario regarding the proposed Bill 66.

21013,/comment/21013,"I join several progressive municipalities in their opposition to this regressive legislation, including the City of Hamilton and the City of Guelph. (See website links).
Like thousands of other Ontarians, I have worked for many years on pro-environment legislation, including the Greenbelt Act and the Places to Grow Act. Although the Conservative government doesn't realize it, we have come a long way in our understanding of good planning so now is the worst possible time to rollback decades worth of good, safe, and common-sense environmental protections in Ontario.
Letting big business ignore rules outlined in the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the Toxics Reduction Act, as well as open up the Greenbelt for development, poses a threat to our land, water, and air.
The Clean Water Act was put in place after the tragedy in Walkerton Ontario where seven people died from e-coli poisoning -- and people there are still feeling its effects. Safe water is critical to public health; we cannot risk another tragedy.
The Greenbelt protects Ontario farmland, forests, and nature. It provides habitat for wildlife and productive farmland that supports rural jobs, and a strong agricultural business sector. Ontarians do not want the Greenbelt open for development.
80% of Ontarians get our drinking water from the Great Lakes. Bill 66 threatens the health of the Great Lakes by opening them up to greater development.
The Ontario government under Ford promised to protect the Greenbelt. The recently released “Made in Ontario” Environment Plan also makes commitments that would be impossible if Bill 66 becomes law.
There is sound data that shows how business, growth, and development do not need to come at the expense of our drinking water, our clean air, our protected nature areas or farmland.
I'm also very concerned about other changes in this omnibus bill, including labour laws.  For more info, see website link.
Please do not revert to 1950s thinking. Advise the Ministers responsible to cancel any debate about Bill 66.

21014,/comment/21014,"I do not support any part of Bill 66. It will usher in policy that endangers the environment as well as the physical well-being of all those who depend on the environment to live (in case you aren’t aware, that is all of us). The danger this bill poses to the contamination of waterways is of particular concern, as well as the cutting of regulations regarding the level of environmental and archaeological survey that must be conducted prior to land development. This bill is not the way forward, it will only contribute to the environmental crisis that we are facing.

21015,/comment/21015,"I am deeply offended by many of the provisions proposed in Bill 66.  In particular the proposal that improving Ontario's competitiveness requires removal of basic democratic processes and acts which represent a long-term investment in the our health, the health of the environment, and the health and long-term economic growth potential of the region.
Specifically:
Schedule 10 needs to be removed.
1. The Toxic Reductions Act, The Clean Water Act, and the Greenbelt Act, Lake Simcoe Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and Great Lakes Protection Act are critical in maintaining the health of the environment which feeds Toronto and protecting the long-term investment in the land surrounding the city.  These acts represent a long-term investment in health and economic potential of the region, and to bypass them is very short-sighted.
2. Further, as currently proposed, there is no opportunity for public input into the process when ""open for business"" bylaws are created.  I find this deeply offensive.  There needs to be public notice, these bylaws need to be debated in the open, and there needs to be an appeal process.  Municipalities should not be given unilateral power to put in place bylaws with such significant repercussions.
Further:
I am also very concerned about Schedule 7, the removal of protections for upholstery and stuffed articles, Schedule 5, the repeal of the Toxic Reductions Act.  I also have some strong reservations about the implications of the recommendations under Schedule 1.

21016,/comment/21016,"Reducing child care adult-to-child ratios is not about creating affordable child care spots and is absolutely unsafe, irresponsible, profiting at the expense of children. This government should be ashamed that it values private business profit over child safety.
It is simply petty and ridiculous to include the removal of employer obligation do display resources and posters for employees to access support and know their rights.
The removal of environmental regulations including ones established to regulate toxic waste management is both idiotic and short sighted.
I cannot comment strongly enough at my contempt for the clear “private profit” over public safety/interest, private care operator profit over child and long term care patient safety, and corporate resource destruction over environmental protection biases this bill articulates.
In no way shape or form should this bill move forward and the government should be held liable for is negligent and harmful proposal against Ontario in the name of private profit. Individuals will be harmed, put at risk and marginalized in favor of business. This is absolutely despicable.

21017,/comment/21017,"This legislation contradicts what Doug Ford said during the election campaign - that he would not touch the Greenbelt!
Bill 66 undermines evidence-based city planning, threatens drinking water and removes protection from toxic chemicals.
It is not legislation that addresses the environmental challenges of today - it is out of date.
Because of a lack of protections for our drinking water sources, the Walkerton tragedy occurred and 7 people died. We developed source water protections to ensure that it will never happen again but Bill 66 will allow developers to get out of any responsibility for maintaining safe drinking water!

I am making this comment in despair because I know it won't make any difference.
But for the sake of form I'll state my position. Don't do it. Don't give local municipalities the power to decide. They can too easily be corrupted by big money developers.
The only answer is hard-non negotiable boundaries for our green spaces.

21021,/comment/21021,"As a concerned and committed citizen of Ontario, I appeal to our provincial government to repeal Bill 66 and leave in place theToxics Reduction Act, 2009.
If enacted, Bill 66 would roll back the legislative provisions that safeguard environmental quality and public health and safety throughout Ontario, and would leave citizens susceptible to a declining quality of life and to unreasonable increases in municipal taxes.
Repealing the Toxics Reduction Act, 2009 (TRA) is a terrible idea. The TRA is not duplicative of requirements under federal law on control of toxic substances. Repealing the TRA would undermine drinking water protection rules and gut rules that help industry reduce the release of toxic chemicals. I support the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA)'s Submissions on Bill 66, Schedule 5 (TRA Repeal) to Michael Friesen of the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. With Ontario’s emissions of toxic substances to air, land, and water being some of the highest in North America, we should leave the TRA in place.
The exemption of ""Open for Business"" zoning bylaws from key environmental protection laws, plans and policies, including the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Protection Act, Lake Simcoe Protection Act, Metrolinx Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, Ontario Planning Development Act, Places to Grow Act, Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, puts public health and safety at risk. Our government proposes to further endanger citizens by also exempting these “Open for Business” bylaws from public notice, comment and appeal provisions in the Planning Act.  Ontario must not override environmental protection laws, and citizens must retain their right to comment and appeal.
Bill 66 opens up Ontario’s Greenbelt for factory, retail and residential development, just when people are realizing that global warming makes Ontario’s farmland a rare global resource that is becoming more valuable over time.  At a time when Ontario needs forward-thinking government action, Bill 66 basically takes us back 40 years.
With regard to factories and stores, it is inconvenient and expensive to build them in the greenbelt. Employment lands should be located within urban boundaries close to infrastructure that supports businesses.  Allowing employment uses in the greenbelt or other protected lands, as the Open for Business bylaws would allow, would put a huge burden on municipalities and utilities to provide services and upgrade roads. These services are expensive and building them will cause property tax increases and make it even harder to build public transit.
The Open for Business bylaws would allow developers to use their considerable financial influence to compel municipal officials to make planning decisions detrimental to their constituents.  We already have enough well serviced land within urban boundaries to meet development needs of businesses and housing providers.  As part of the Ontario government’s housing consultation, the province is asking whether there should be more flexibility regarding the conversion of existing employment lands in urban areas to residential development. Some municipalities have identified surplus lands for new employment uses. In cities like Kitchener and Hamilton where factories have shut down there may be an excess of serviced employment land near new transit lines where conversion makes sense. In some newer greenfield communities, developers own unserviced employment lands they want to build subdivisions on. Ontario does not need to convert protected lands to factory, retail or residential development and it would be a waste of money and of opportunity, to do so.
It’s important for municipalities to do the analysis to understand if there is enough employment land for complete communities or an excess of land. The Growth Plan employment land policies move us towards complete communities where people can live, work and play. If conversion of employment lands proceeds as part of the housing reforms that come out of the current provincial consultation underway, municipalities may be permitted to rezone employment uses approved under the Open for Business bylaw to residential.
As a result there is no demand or need for new lands to be designated for “business” on the Greenbelt, in the Lake Simcoe watershed or on the Oak Ridges Moraine. We can just use the surplus employment lands in towns and cities across the region.
Finally, the province already has the Minister’s zoning order (MZO) which gives it the power to override local planning rules and designate land for development if they want to use it.  By proposing that the new “Open for Business bylaw” be implemented by municipalities the province is trying to distance itself from the scrutiny, criticism and accountability that it would normally face when using the MZO. It also increases the number of likely development proposals that will come forward as the development industry is very influential and often funds election campaigns at the municipal level.
Breaking the promise not to open up the Greenbelt, Lake Simcoe Watershed, the Oak Ridges Moraine and source water protection areas to new development shows a fundamental disrespect to voters. The health of our region depends on valuing our farms, forests, clean water sources and nature and building robust and vibrant communities. Bill 66 is damaging to the health of Ontario citizens and our environment.

This bill would be destroying the safety procedures we have put in place and would be even going as far as working on restricted and protected land. The Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine are in question as well the Great Lakes and other valued ecosystems. This includes all municipalities! ‘The world’s largest permanently protected green space’ is something we should be proud of upholding, not developing it for a few jobs. It would make more sense to make more jobs surrounding the Greenbelt. Also, water protection rights are at risk here, which is a main concern to many - the two-thirds of the 2.5% of water that we can access as drinking water should not be jeopardized for 50 jobs. Environmental technicians could be hired to take care of the land, ultimately, providing plenty of job opportunities for Canadians. To avoid more deforestation, we need to protect the farmland we have. This bill greatly endangers the health of our current farmland. If this bill were to pass, then politicians could make plans to override natural heritage and protected land and waterways behind closed doors. Let’s protect our environment wholeheartedly and stop Bill 66.

It also increases the number of likely development proposals that will come forward as the development industry is very influential and often funds election campaigns at the municipal level.
Breaking the promise not to open up the Greenbelt, Lake Simcoe Watershed, the Oak Ridges Moraine and source water protection areas to new development shows a fundamental disrespect to voters. The health of our region depends on valuing our farms, forests, clean water sources and nature and building robust and vibrant communities. Bill 66 is damaging to the health of Ontario citizens and our environment.

21055,/comment/21055,"Premier Ford,
Bill 66 is a travesty for the residents of Ontario. It undermines all that constitutes democracy. It delivers a message to the residents of Ontario that their opinions don’t count, that their safety is unimportant to our newly elected government and that you are willing to do whatever it takes to get what you want. I believe that is tyranny.
Removing all protectionary Acts from the development process opens the door for chaos in Ontario, not growth. Your quest to satisfy developer demands could undermine environmental stability for generations to come. It is unfathomable how any measure included in Bill 66 is justifiable. This Bill is not a means to an end, it is destruction of important farmland, forests, wetlands and habitat, the function of which you don’t understand or appreciate. Your role is to listen to the constituents of Ontario, the message is very clear, Stop Bill 66.

21061,/comment/21061,"My main concern with Bill 66, are the changes to the Planning Act.
It makes environmental & water related protections, which are there to ensure public health as well as the health of our environment, elective rather than mandatory.
I am an Indigenous person, and understand that we share ecosystems with neighboring municipalities. Their decisions will inevitably impact my territory. By providing a by-pass around regulations and environmental related policy, local municipalities can ignore the safeguards which were created to reduce risk & mitigate impacts.
Also, I have concerns with municipalities current lack of consultation with First Nation communities in decision making that may impact their rights. And providing a fast-track process would put First Nations inclusion/partnership/participation even further at risk.

21064,/comment/21064,"I would like to express my opposition to the weakening of environmental and development regulations contained in Bill 66.
Land supports human life in a number of fundamental ways – it provides places for us to live and food for us to eat, filters the air we breathe and the water we drink, and is at the heart of almost all our activities, both economic and recreational. Good planning has long been essential in balancing the ways that we use land, so that our communities can grow intelligently and we can all benefit from a system that works to provide what we need for the long term.
Bill 66 threatens to veto much of the excellent planning that has been done in Ontario in the last several decades. This planning is designed to guarantee a future where the people of Ontario can continue to drink safe water and breathe clean air, eat our incredible Ontario produce and enjoy successful careers in agriculture, and live somewhere where they have access to both a good job and a place to spend some time in nature.
By allowing municipalities to bypass plans such as the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Act, and the Clean Water Act, the current government is proposing to place the immediate desires of developers above the long-term good of the people of Ontario. Existing planning and legislation provides plenty of land for development, both residential and economic. To provide jobs and homes for the citizens of Ontario, there is absolutely no need to open up lands that have been protected for their agricultural and environmental benefit to Ontarians.
When Doug Ford stated during his campaign that he would open up the Greenbelt for development, there was immense public outcry, causing him to walk back his remarks and commit to maintaining the integrity of the Greenbelt. Clearly, the public does not want these lands to be developed. The current government, therefore, is clearly not working in the interest of the average Ontarian as they now go ahead with dismantling Greenbelt protections. Whose interest are they working in?
It is the role of the government to ensure that the people of Ontario are able to live in a safe environment. Bill 66 threatens to make our drinking water less safe, increase the ability of industry to dump toxic chemicals into our environment, reduce protections for the health of our lakes, and limit our access to healthy, local food. It threatens longstanding careers in agriculture, beloved natural areas, and quality of life for millions of people. It does not serve the interests of the people of this province, and should not be passed into law.

21067,/comment/21067,"As is the case for many Ontarians, I am very concerned about this proposal and the effects it may have on our environment. First of all, restoring Ontario's competitiveness, if that's really the goal, is about a lot more than just environmental protection ""hurdles"", and in any case, the kind of developers that would be attracted to the prospect of flouting all sorts of ecological protection regulations are not the developers we really want to attract. Second, how much will this really contribute to economic growth? 100 new jobs in a municipality of hundreds of thousands of people (the proposal is very vague about the type of job covered by this bylaw) is not economically significant to the point where it is worth risking significant environmental damage.
Polling has shown that around 90% of Ontarians support the Greenbelt Act, and I am sure that many are also in favour of drinking water protections, especially after the Walkerton tragedy. We have this legislation for a reason.
Furthermore, the idea that any development covered under this bylaw is not subject to public consultation or appeal is a direct attack on Ontarians' democratic rights, and sets a dangerous precedent for the future - if we can make environmental protection effectively void, what else can we get rid of in the name of ""economic development""?

No one believes that is a good idea. Not in the interests of building affordable housing, and not in the interest of creating employment. Those are lies.
This is an obvious and irreversible land grab, money grab, and it is ill-advised.
We fought for years to get these lands protected. We are paying attention to what you do next.

21072,/comment/21072,"Hello,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to Schedule 10 of Bill 66.
We have come so far to protect our surrounding environment and habitat. We have elevated ourselves by setting up check and balances to protect our well-being. It has become the envy of many friends around the world and it makes me proud to be living here.
I am very saddened to think that anyone would so easily give up this sanctuary and destroy it for any reason at all.
Please do not allow Bill 66 to pass or go any further.
If we do not have our health, we really don't have anything

21075,/comment/21075,"It has come to my attention that this current Ontario Provincial government is planning to make major changes to the laws governing and protecting our 'Green Spaces', the areas designated for 'Heritage Sites', the Environment (specifically water sources and resources), as well as other areas committed to being 'A Benefit for Future Generations'.
I would submit that this government very carefully review the details of the reasons these laws were originally made so that no one (young, middle-aged or senior, rich or poor!!) would be adversely affected by any changes made - I am thinking specifically of the very major and unfortunate incidences in Walkerton in 2000, which could be very easily repeated if the current laws re - 'water, & other environments concerns' are changed to suit (specifically) developers and others who wish to build on 'open land'.
Our wonderful country of Canada, and our beautiful province on Ontario is blessed with many resources, all of which are not as abundant or pristine as they were even fifty years ago.  It would be to the benefit of the current government, as well as to the populace in general, to do everything in its power to protect and preserve these irreplaceable resources, and to give future generations the opportunity to continue to live with clean air, fresh and easily accessible water, green spaces with their wide variety of trees and forests, undisturbed heritage sites, and the great variety of other aspects of nature as found in its 'natural' state.
I trust that this government - and future governments, too!! - will look beyond the 'dollars and cents' to the heart of this land and do their very best to help preserve all that we still have! :)

21079,/comment/21079,"Ontario does not need its competitiveness restored. There are plenty of opportunities for economic growth and housing within the existing Planning Act and Official Plans of towns and cities in this province.
Bill 66 is an instrument of deregulation, to over-ride, by-pass and/or blatantly disregard hard-won environmental protection legislation, such as the Clean Waters Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, and Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act.
I do not want Bill 66 to remove the protection of the Planning Act and Provincial Policy Statements for significant built heritage resources and/or cultural landscapes anywhere in the province, nor threaten our Greenbelt, sensitive natural habitat, and important farmland -- some of the richest on the continent.
What decade, nay, what century is the current provincial government envisioning? Based on the implications of Bill 66, the government is unaware of the threat of climate change; of strategies to minimize Ontarians' carbon footprints; to build homes, cities, towns, and jobs for the 21st century!
Millions of future Ontarians will still need clean drinking water and healthy Ontario-grown food. They will need jobs and homes and services located close together and accessible by foot, bike, or public transit -- not sprawling distances best crossed by personal car.
Bill 66, and by implication, opening up the greenbelt to development, may seem like a great solution to those like me, who cannot afford to own a single-family house in the same city my parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and I did previously! But I gladly choose a different dwelling, and lifestyle, because wiser, denser use of precious land is required in the 21st century.
Opening up protected tracts of land to development and more urban/suburban sprawl is not the right answer; it is a short-sighted quick-fix which will benefit the wealthy, not the many.
How about, to spur economic growth, the government instead examines policies and bills which would:
- shorten, not lengthen, the increasing gap in wealth and opportunity between have-and have-not Ontarians?
- stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and those dependent upon it, like the auto sector? If public transit was further improved, the money Ontarians spent on cars would still be spent in Ontario - maybe on home ownership? Maybe on saving money and investing it?
- create jobs in the green/carbon-free industry
- rather than focusing on the cost of hydro-electricity in Ontario, incentivize solar and wind power, and energy conservation, and density?
- put a focus on cleaning up the Great Lakes (especially Erie) - that creates jobs, don't you know?
As a matter of fact, the Planning Act and PPS has spurred growth in the cultural heritage and planning industries! Jobs!
Jobs are important, earning a living to keep a roof overhead is essential, equally is clean water, air, and land.
Take the long view, Honourable Premier, and turn your critical lens not on deregulating policies of conservation, but on your - and our - legacy, on how you and we will answer the only question that matters, the one OUR children, grand-children, or great-grand-children will ask us, ""did you do everything in your power to stop climate change?""

The people of Ontario value strict protections on our drinking water, environment, and agricultural land. The longevity and success of any civilization is dependent upon a strong and healthy environment.
If Bill 66 does not address rapid income inequality, the removal of subsidies and tax breaks to multi-million dollar corporations, and better incentives for small businesses, then no amount of rollback on environment protections will make Ontario ""Open for Business"".
What will we tell our grandchildren, we had the opportunity to secure them a better future but chose to make some of ourselves rich instead?
This government needs to make sure we are building a better future for all, not just some.

The destruction of the Greenbelt that is allowed by bill 66 will affect the region's ecology, and it will make us less able to adapt to climate change. Our health depends on the water, and it will stress water in the region.
I do not think this bill reflects the value of our communities.
