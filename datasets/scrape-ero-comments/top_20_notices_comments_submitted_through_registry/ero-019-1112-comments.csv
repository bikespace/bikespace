40415,/comment/40415,"I live in central Ontario in a rural location and occasionally have had bears on my property and in the neighbourhood. During my forty years at this location, I have only had two inconviences caused by bears, #1. A bear stole a bag of chicken food from my hen house #2. A bear flipped a bee hive over. Neither of these events were of any great concern to me. I have much greater concern about being shot by a bear hunter while I or my family and friends are walking or working in my 150 acre forest. The spring bear hunt doubles the chance of me being harmed by a bear hunter. As a hunter, I am disgusted with the unethical aspect of the spring bear hunt. This hunt endangers sows and cubs. The use of bait is not only unethical, it also endangers the public who happen to hike by these baited sites. It also contradicts the Bear Wise slogan - a fed bear is a dead bear. I have had offal dumped by bear hunters beside the road bordering my property. The drastic reduction in MNR enforcement staff over the last 20 years leaves this proposed hunt virtually unsupervised. In my callow and ignorant youth, I actually participated in the spring bear hunt so I know exactly how this hunt is conducted. The spring bear hunt is unethical and dangerous for the public. I do not support this proposal.

40445,/comment/40445,"I live in Whitestone township north east of Parry Sound. The area where I live has had a trial spring bear hunt for the past few years.
I spend a lot of time in the bush in this area and I can tell you that the bear population is definitely in a major decline. I am seeing very few bear signs in the bush and the local dump may have one or two bear visitors in the summer where it used to have several.  I’m not sure who’s informing you about bear numbers. Between the fall hunt and the proposed spring “hunt” there are a total of about four and a half months to kill bears. What other game animal has that length of season? Climate change and winter flooding of dens is a major concern for denning mothers and cubs, not to mention people who vilify bears and shoot them if they deem them a nuisance. This proposal is about money and not about sustainability. Please rethink your ideas regarding bears and hunting them when they are in a starvation state coming out of dens in the spring. Thank you.

40446,/comment/40446,"I believe that this type of hunting should not be designated as an annual season. Right now there may be a healthy population, but that means there was a time it was at risk. I believe such a hunt should be determined  every year. Not a slated annual hunt. Plus I also think killing an animal for trophy is not sportsmanship. I know there are people who eat bear meat and I have no qualms about the hunting for food. I just think that whether a bear hunt is to happen or not should be an annual calendared event. People may feel they are entitled to one. Rather it should be determined by the population growth and sustainability study each year

 Overall this is an excellent proposal.  However I am one of a very small number of nonresidents landowners who will be devastated if the part to exclude me from bear hunting without an outfitter is included. Nonresident landowners who take advantage of Ontario's wonderful bear hunting opportunities is a small reward for those of us who love Ontario so much as to actually buy property and pay taxes in your amazing province.  Please do not take this opportunity away from me.  It is a privilege I am very grateful for and appreciate.

I would like some more clarification on who all will require a “licence to provide black bear services”. I live in Northern Ontario, and due to the fact that hunting and fishing camp owners had their bear hunting tags significantly reduced in the last year, most choose to only provide bear hunts in the fall.  Spring time is very busy for camps with walleye and pike fishing open and it is not feasible for a camp to guide bears with such limited amount of tags. I live in an area around several hunting and fishing camps that do NOT offer the spring bear hunt.  As a resident I set up my bear stands near my home, which is also in someone’s BMA.  I have 3 bear stands and baits that I actively use for myself, my family and close friends.  Does this now mean that I will require a “licence to provide black bear services”?  My friends and family come help me bait, so it is not a guided hunt. I do not agree with this proposed change.

40485,/comment/40485,"“Bears are intrinsically social, they need to be social, but our species has not let them do so because of our own profound fear.” ~ Charlie Russell
Even though a criminal charge is in place, Mother bears will be killed during the hunt, leaving their orphaned cubs to starve or be killed by predators. Cubs are born in the spring as well as in the Fall. Already with the fall hunt population decreases, a male bear is still required to produce a cub. Reintroducing the spring hunt will do even greater damage. It renders anonymous all those animals that run for their lives, their hearts filled with panic and their eyes, at times, blurred by real tears. In some cases, whole families perished. Who died first? The mom? Or did she first see her little ones gunned down? Some hear the sounds of a mother crying for her little ones. The memory of the piercing wail never goes away.
But our lives go on uninterrupted; the sound of a shotgun dies out soon.
And if the assurance of “a healthy population” is not enough, then the perennial, all-encompassing claim of “public safety” is dispatched to justify the slaughter. Bears are “destroyed”, because they are “aggressive”, “dangerous”, “food conditioned” and “habituated”. Their very presence in urban areas posed a danger to the public. It is a case of choosing a lesser evil: bears must be killed, so they don’t kill us. To survive, we need to keep our urban habitat free of wild influences; we need to keep “the savage world” at bay.
These are fictitious, self-serving arguments to soothe pangs of conscience. After all, nothing works better than fear-mongering; nothing works better than justifying cruelty as an unfortunate price to pay for ensuring a greater good. But let’s dispense with the falsehoods, just for once. Keeping the public safe? What danger to the public does a bear pose when in their natural home?  None, of course. Their deaths prove nothing, except for our capacity for cruelty and indifference.
And what about the notion of so-called “nuisance” or “problem” bears being a danger to the public? Making such a claim would require supporting data, but such data are lacking.
Why do we kill bears, then? As Charlie Russell, a renowned bear expert, argued, our irrational fear of bears sets the stage for antagonistic relations with these animals. Removed from nature by the civilizing process, we live in fear of some of its most magnificent creatures, bears among them. The fear of the unknown magnifies the real danger: “We are the source of food for bears,” “What if is a bear encounters small kids playing on the playground?” “What if someone is mauled or killed?” Indeed, what if, what if, what if. The mind comes up with scenarios and the imagination stokes fears. Irrational ones.
As Lynn Rogers, a researcher who studied black bears for over 50 years, says that most people expect a bear to behave aggressively rather than what a bear ends up doing in reality. In other words, the danger might not be real, but the fear of an non-existent threat persists anyway. And it is this distorted perception of fear that both instigates and justifies the lethal conservation policies.
The psychology of risk perception illuminates the irrationality of our fears. We have an inflated perception of risk when facing situations over which we have little control.
These approaches are the legacy of a hunt, trap and kill mentality. The legacy we can’t free ourselves from. In their book Animals’ Agenda: Freedom, Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age, Mark Bekoff and Jessica Pierce discuss the “knowledge translation gap”. Our adherence to misguided attitudes and practices allows us to justify causing harm to animals, despite the preponderance of science on animal cognition and emotions. They have different types of social behaviour that possibly parallel early human behaviour. They are not solitary, aloof animals, as often portrayed. They have impressively complex social relationships based on alliances formed with other bears and, once rules are established, they can do well in overlapping home ranges. We are bound to co-exist with black bears, and so we owe them to learn about their way of acting when our paths happen to cross. It can be done. “Bears can read our emotional communication [and] it’s not that hard for us to understand how a bear communicates”, Kilham says. Charlie Russell’s decades-long peaceful relationship with bears has proven that. Knowledge, tools, resources are available to us. We need the will.
In the end, we owe bears respect. No bear should die because of a heathy population. There are no “nuisance” bears; there are no “problem” bears. These words are labels of convenience that we use to hide our discomfort with nature.
As a resident of Ontario and as the public I don't consent. In fact remove the bear hunt all together just like they did in 1999.

40499,/comment/40499,"As a person from Ontario's North, I strongly oppose making the spring bear hunt permanent. The proposal focusses on anticipated social consequences, i.e. 'continuing to provide opportunities for hunting and trapping', and indicates that anticipated environmental consequences are neutral. In addition, the proposal indicates that ""The harvest of bear cubs and female bears accompanied by a cub would remain prohibited."" However, the reality is that the spring bear hunt has resulted in more orphaned cubs (who do not stand a chance of survival without human intervention) and this is not acceptable. Hunting also affects the numbers of potential breeding female bears (i.e. reducing the numbers). These are not 'neutral' consequences, they are negative consequences.
I do support the elimination of the Fall bear hunt in the Bruce Peninsula.
The province should be protecting these animals - and the environments that they live in - rather than focussing on recreational hunting.

40501,/comment/40501,"Our family is appalled by your decision to allow a Spring Bear Hunt in Ontario. For us this is both a political and a moral issue.
The Conservatives, under Mike Harris, cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt  years ago because of the extreme cruelty in leaving hundreds of tiny orphaned bear cubs to die a slow death of starvation.  How can your government possibly justify reinstating this throwback to another era?
We find it hard to believe that you are unaware of the following facts:
*    Attracting bears with food bait when they are coming out of hibernation and obviously very hungry to be easily picked off by a hunter sitting in a nearby tree blind is hardly hunting, rather it is target practice.
*    Your government states that ""it will remain illegal to kill a female bear with cubs"".  This assurance is disingenuous given that it's rare to be able to see a bear's genitals or lactating teats from a tree blind at a distance.  Furthermore, mother bears approaching a food source where there may be other bears send their cubs into hiding before approaching the bait.
*    It was why, in 1999, the Spring Bear Hunt was cancelled when MNR staff revealed that over 270 bear cubs were orphaned each year and left to starve to death as a direct result of the hunt. A former MNR staff member indicates that this number is low and that it was more likely closer to 1,000 cubs that died.
*    Your government indicates that there has been an increase in the black bear population and that Ontario is home to a healthy and sustainable bear population.  In fact, the black bear population has not increased.  To the contrary, the 2007 Annual Report of the Auditor General of Ontario conveys that 'despite the cancellation of the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999, government bear hunting data show that bear populations are likely not being maintained at sustainable levels and that every year, hunters kill more female bears than allowed by law'.
*    In attempting to justify the Spring Bear Hunt, you have stated that ""public safety is paramount and Ontarians should feel safe in their communities"".  If, in fact, your real concern is public safety, you would acknowledge the studies that have conclusively shown that the greater number of bears killed, the greater number of human-bear conflicts and complaints. A report by Dr. Edward A. Tavss of Rutgers University http://www.bearsmart.com/docs/Tavss-v4.pdf on a dozen communities across North America included data from Ontario which shows that there has been a bear hunt every year in this province, with generally increasing numbers of bears killed annually, and a corresponding increase in the number of complaints.
*    On the other hand, the report shows where jurisdictions have implemented conflict prevention and education strategies, there has been a significant decrease in bear conflicts and complaints.  The Elliot Lake Ontario community is one such example. The year before public education and bear resistant containers were introduced, there were 500 nuisance bears and three shootings. Using the Bear Wise model program, in 2004 this was reduced to 87 nuisance bears and no shootings.
*    Given these results, we are shocked that your government has abandoned the Bear Wise Program and instead plans to use an inhumane, ineffectual and highly controversial lethal approach to bear management in Ontario.  Our consternation is shared by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario in his 2012-13 Report where he criticizes the gutting of the Bear Wise program, a program which successfully reduced human/bear conflicts.
Policy must derive from logic and compassion, not political opportunism. We urge you to cancel the ill-conceived plan for a Spring Bear Hunt and immediately re-instate all elements of the highly-effective Bear Wise program.
I look forward to your response to these concerns and your assurance that, unlike previous Environmental Bill of Rights consultations conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, this one will be transparent and fair.  It will be closely scrutinized.

40502,/comment/40502,"I live in a hunting region - what a plan sounds like on paper and how it actually works in real life are two different things.  Hoping that a hunter will have ethics and not shoot a female bear or even a small cub is idealistic.  Even experienced hunters who are there for the thrill of a kill and not for the food the animal provides, will shoot first and think about what they are shooting later.  Is this wrong and against the rules - absolutely - but it still happens.  No matter how many surveys they fill in, you can't control it. Their ability to extend their hunting practices into the spring and put young cubs and their mothers at risk is not a can of worms you want to open.  Nuisance bears are laughable as an excuse to open up a spring hunt - if there is a truly dangerous situation, that bear can be dealt with at the time.  If tourism is something you really want to promote, have a wilderness experience to witness wildlife, take pictures - don't kill it just for the thrill of it.

40507,/comment/40507,"I find the proposal to be an excellent step forward.  The black bear numbers in Northwestern Ontario are abundant, bordering on excessive.  To ensure a healthy population, numbers need to be properly maintained which I believe can be achieved with ethical hunting opportunities in spring and fall.   The moose population in Northwestern Ontario is on a steady decline due to calf fatalities. Reduced bear numbers will hopefully increase moose numbers and keep the bear population healthier due to more food for less bears.
   As much as we need to protect our natural resources, including the bear population - we also need to protect our tourism industry and those who rely on it to make a living.  The proposal to eliminate un-guided hunting opportunities for non-resident property owners and close relative hunters is right on target.

As with all regulations there are always going to be people who don't follow the rules, and in remote areas this is harder to regulate and enforce. The argument that it is regulated and all hunters will follow the rules doesn't wash with me. In this day and age people don't need to hunt bears to eat. I know outfitters put out bait in their areas to draw the bears in. (I have seen it with my own eyes). When bears come out of hibernation they are going to be hungry, so this seems extra cruel. Give the cubs a chance to get through the summer and grown up a little.
Bass season doesn't open until spawning season is over to help make sure that there will be fish babies that grow up for future fishing seasons. Why would we make the rules different for bears, whose young needs care for longer before than can survive on their own?

We were disheartened, shocked, and disgusted by the proposal of open hunting on black bears in Ontario. We are all too familiar with hunters mistaking females for males leaving ophaned cubs to slowly perish. That this government promotes such atrocious practices, often accomodating wealthy Americans who cannot kill as such in their own state, under the guise of ""ustainable wildlife management activity"" which it certainly is not. This action would pander to the  Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters group while clearly contradicting the wishes of the Ontarian/Canadian public-according to documented surveys/censuses. The time has come for government to lead through wisdom, honour, compassion and strength for the benefit of the majority rather than through greed, nepotism, bloodlust and egocentricity for the few. We are entering another paradigm shift building inclusion, kindness, growth and life. Lets opt for that and forego the deathly spiral we're currently endorsing. Lets encourage your boys find other healthier way to relieve themselves and feel like men, shall we? Certainly this would reduce the need for sadistic acts (for genuine hunters only kill for food and that is done quickly, cleanly and only for the amount they can eat not to encur suffering and horrific deaths) and encourage far more constructive, satisfying behaviors worthy of adult males. Lets work to lift us all out of the violence-laden world we currently live in and make this world a better, more intelligent, compassionate and creative one.

40742,/comment/40742,"It is ethically wrong to hunt during a time when females are nursing because of the orphaning and subsequent death of cubs. This is unpreventable as hunters and conservationists are unable to assess the nursing status of bears due to the bears' parenting behaviours. So even if it is regulation to not hunt nursing bears, this is impossible to implement in the field due to bear behaviour.
It is wrong to hunt bears during a critical time for them physiologically due to insufficient available food to maintain body weight during a period of depleted nutrients following hibernation and nursing.
Bears are extremely vulnerable in the spring because of their concentration in limited habitat areas and reduced physical condition following hibernation.
Hunting vehicle activity has a negative impact on stream fisheries in the spring due to rutted roads and silting in high-erosion soils.
There should not be different ethical standards for popular game hunting such as deer than there are for bear hunting.
All aspects of hunting bears is unethical, particularly baiting, which congregates bears into unnatural situations; is inconsistent with the concept of fair chase that is applied as an argument in favour of hunting; predisposes bears to become nuisance bears by habituating them to human-provided foods, particularly during a season when young are learning feeding practices from their mothers.

With the inception of the trial hunt I have witnessed a significant drop in bears roaming the town looking for food. As an outdoors person I have noticed a change in bear behaviour. With a spring hunt in effect the bears have become afraid of human contact and will now run from a human or the sight of a vehicle. Before the implementation of the spring hunt bears were very bold and not afraid of humans.
    This will benefit tourism and bring in much needed income to our region. The hunt will also improve the moose population due to predation on calves in the spring. I see no cons to the implementation of a spring bear hunt.

Your proposal states that hunting of female bears accompanied by cubs will be restricted.  What if the cubs are still in their den? What if they are not seen with the mother? How will hunters know? You risk subjecting bear cubs to slow starvation or predation.
Your proposal also is further limiting the hunting season in Bruce Peninsula due to declining bear numbers there.  Bears, as apex predators, are an important part of the ecosystem.  Limiting the hunt is not enough if you truly want to prevent further decline in numbers.  You need to simply stop the hunt.

So the pilot program is doing what it was designed to do but the question is whether we can sustain these results without depleting the resource. Perhaps we can limit the season in years of bad crops both mast and domestic when female Bears won't gestate at least in WMUs heavily hunted.
Maybe open the season for 4 years and cancel it for 2 in hard it WMUs. Ontario is too big to have a blanket season for all WMUs. It may be time to get a bit specific on hard hunted WMUs.

I wish to comment on the proposed permanent status of the Spring Bear Hunt, as I am totally opposed to such a proposal.  The regulations do not adequately protect young cubs from being orphaned and left to die a slow death from starvation out in the wild.  We, as a province, need to protect these animals and respect their right to live and breed in the wild, without harassment and fear of death from hunters who either don't know how to distinguish male from female, or don't care, or don't realize that female mothers hunt and forage without their cubs nearby.
I am in agreement with Camille Labchuk, executive director of advocacy organization Animal Justice, that the government's measures don’t offer meaningful protection.  As she has said, hunters struggle to distinguish between male and female bears even at close range, adding that challenge all but ensures the issue that prompted the Spring bear hunt cancellation in the first place is bound to surface again.  “This is a death warrant for innocent baby bear cubs who will be orphaned and die when their mothers are gunned down by hunters after emerging from hibernation in the spring,” she said. “It’s deeply disappointing that the current government has so little regard for the majestic creatures with whom we share this province.”
I am also in agreement with Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner who called the government’s wildlife conservation record “spotty” and urging a broad-based approach to the public consultation process.
“Any decision to reinstate a permanent spring hunt must be based on science,” he said in a statement. “Hunting of any species cannot be driven purely by economic interests and should only be considered if the population is healthy. Consultations must include First Nations, scientists and conservationists.”
Hunters are able to hunt the black bear in the Fall; this is enough hunting of this animal.  Let's allow our black bears to be able to raise their cubs in peace for the first two years of their life and leave our bear free to roam in the Spring to forage for food after a long winter, free from fear of being hunted down and free to raise their cubs humanely.  Just ask the only bear rehab and orphan facility in Ontario, ""Bear With Us Sanctuary and Rehab center, just outside of Huntsville, run by Mike McIntosh, without any government funding, how many orphan cubs he has had to pickup each Spring to attempt to nurse back to health, if possible,  and how many female bears shot haphazardly that are left to suffer or die needlessly.  Literally thousands of bear cubs over the years have been left to the same fate.... a slow death.... and mother bears have been shot indiscriminately  by hunters.
Let's not honour the mighty dollar and allow that to be the prime reason to allow this ridiculous Spring bear hunt goes forward permanently.  Businesses have others ways to make money than this needless exploitations of our helpless bear population.  This proposal makes me sick and I am disgusted that the government has not seen clear to make decisions that are humaneand based on wildlife science regarding our animals that we have left in this province.
I don't wish to support any proposal that allows any type (permant or non-permanent) Spring bear hunt and I hope you will reconsider this proposal by speaking to those who are on the front lines of the torture that occurs to these animals like ""Bear With Us"" (Mike Mcintosh) and Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as longtime Bear experts in the field such as Dr. Lynn Rogers (bear.org) and Dr. Ben Kilham (kilhambearcenter.org)  before this proposal goes into law.

#1 sustainable management: this under utilized species must be managed to remain healthy and sustainable. The best way to do this is by regulated harvest of the animal. This manages the species at no cost to the taxpayer and actually generates revenue for the province of Ontario. Maintaining a balance in the black bear population is important not only for the black bear population but also the populations of prey animals they feed on and the other predator populations that rely on those prey animals as well.
#2 reducing human-bear conflicts: managed bear populations reduce the number of conflicts with humans which come at a cost to the taxpayer and can put residents at risk.
#3 economic benefit: from the trapper who feeds his family with bear meat and earns money from the hide, to the outfitter who guides hunters, to the service industry who cares for the hunter the continuation of the spring bear hunt keeps money moving in our province and the fees and licenses collected by the government add to our provincial coffers

MILLIONS of wild animals are killed every year in the U.S, Canada and worldwide. This must stop. I suggest you do the research. It's only a few keystrokes away.
The Spring bear hunt is particularly egregious. Mother bears come out of their dens in the Spring with their young cubs in tow. To kill a mother bear while in the presence of her young and to take away the only source of the young cubs' survival is unconscionable.

40978,/comment/40978,"Spring hunts of black bears can kill mother bears, leaving orphaned cubs to fend for themselves. Some cubs are only a few months old and still nursing or are yearlings who are still dependent for another few months. Most orphaned cubs suffer from starvation, predation or exposure.
Some wildlife managers falsely assert that spring hunting spares mothers with cubs because nursing mothers are the last bears to emerge from the den. However, Tom Beck, a retired bear researcher for the Colorado Division of Wildlife—along with a cohort of five other Western states wildlife managers—says that males emerge from dens a mere two to three weeks earlier than females, meaning females with cubs go unprotected.
Spring bear hunts orphan cubs!
Black bear cubs, usually born between December and February, emerge from hibernation with their mothers in April and May. Mother bears care for and protect their cubs until they are 16 to 17 months old; the family breaks up typically between May and July of the cubs’ second year.
Wildlife managers say there is no way to prevent the killing of nursing females during a spring hunt. Even when states prohibit the take of nursing females, hunters kill them unintentionally: Females forage at great distances from their cubs, and if pursued by hounds, a mother will leave her cubs in a tree. Additionally, females do not bring their cubs to bait sites.
Hunters have difficulties determining the sex of bears even when they use bait or hounds, are attempting to avoid shooting females and are in close proximity. Researchers themselves have difficulties determining sex, even at short distances.
Spring bear hunts do not reduce conflicts with nuisance bears
While some wildlife managers believe that spring bear hunting is necessary to reduce the bear population and thus avoid conflicts, hunters, trappers and wildlife control agents often remove the wrong bears—they kill the individuals not involved in nuisance behaviors. Bear-resistant trash cans, hazing programs and other humane methods work better to solve problems.
Bears who come into urban areas are most frequently adult females with cubs or subadults who purposely do so to avoid aggression by other adult bears, usually males; association with people is a deliberate adaptive strategy to keep their cubs alive.

40980,/comment/40980,"As someone who works at a wildlife rehabilitation centre, I see the effects of humans on wildlife on a daily basis. In addition to personally witnessing the devastating impacts we have on other species, the science is clear that wildlife populations across species are in decline. That enough should be reason to take action to protect those with which we share our planet.
It's reprehensible to me that the province I live in would consider allowing a hunt when bears are most vulnerable. Mothers foraging for food after a long winter to support their young - babies which will be left to starve to death when hunters shoot her, not knowing she's female. Let's face it, that happens all of the time.
Instead of constantly considering the rights of the few hunters, why not consider the rights the rest of us have to live in a balanced system that values fellow species. I am not against hunting. I grew up in a family that hunted responsibly, took the time to learn about the animal, its natural behaviours and tracking on order to avoid errors. A nursing mother would NEVER be shot. And animals were eaten, taking only what was reasonably consumable. Will these hunters be eating bear, for the most part, that's unlikely.
The Conservative government needs to do what is right for everyone not just the base base that supports it.
As we now have stricter laws to protect domestic animals, please ask yourself why this any different. Starving babies is nothing less than cruelty. And baiting stations aren't hunting, they're just a way for rednecks to shoot something. Disgusting. I do not support this.

40983,/comment/40983,"As a teacher I have had the opportunity to meet a variety of biologists with a variety of interests. They have spent many hours explaining to my students the importance of protecting the environment and animals. When I read about the introduction of the bear hunt again, I was very interested to know the guidelines especially the importance of hunting young females. Hunters are anxious to hunt any bear they see regardless of age or sex. Since I have gone to Algonquin park for the last 25 years, I have heard about the problem of bears going outside the boundary of the park, now they will be subject to hunting by uneducated hunters. I also know there is a rescue centre located in northern Ontario for cubs who have lost their mothers. Menacing bears are a problem solved by educating the public which the provincial parks do well.i don’t think the problem of the menacing bears has to do with the abundance of bears or overpopulation . In fact , I was told that many of the Algonquin bears are dying due to lack of food or changes in their environment eg. logging or pollution.( These may be bears outside the park boundary? ).
Therefore I encourage you to make sure that hunters are well educated about bears before granting any licenses to avoid reckless hunting practises. I would love to say no hunting of bears but I know that is not the question. Natural selection seems to be doing its jobs quite well without hunters.

Re: black bear Spring hunt in Ontario
I personally do not like the thought of a Spring bear hunt for a number of reasons. Firstly, I’ll state as an animal lover I find killing animals for sport offensive. While I would never engage in this type of activity, I can understand those who would hunt an animal for food, I. e. a deer. But I can not fathom why anyone would consider eating a Spring bear. They’ve been hibernating, so are not in robust condition and so can hold little allure for the dinner table.
Secondly, sows emerge with very young cubs. Putting sows in a position to be shot by baiting, trapping or happenstance, not only removes her from the breeding population but dooms her cubs also. You can put a moratorium on sow hunting but you cannot enforce it. What concrete measures are being put in place to ensure cub retrieval, rehabilitation and rerelease into the wild? By having a 6 week hunt, you are putting sows and young cubs at risk for far too long a window.
Thirdly, this is 2020. It’s time to think of wildlife as more than objects to shoot and kill as trophies. Perhaps it’s time to to get a more realistic attitude towards what the public really wants, ie. eco-tourism, than catering to a select few who crave blood sports. If you had the courage to promote a more sustainable use of our bears as ‘tourism poster animals’ instead of dead rugs and gallbladders, you would realize an equal, if not, greater revenue. It would be nice if Ontario was known for live Black Bear viewing similar to Churchill claim to fame with polar bears, than as a bear shooting capital.
Lastly, by allowing a double hunt, ie. Spring and Fall, you put undue pressure and stress on the species between den emergence and hibernation. How can you justify this?  Why would you shoot them in the Spring and for what reason when they are at their most vulnerable? What’s being done with the carcasses? If you as a Ministry are not thinking about ALL outcomes of your actions, you have no business reinstating a Spring bear hunt. Ontario wildlife should be worth more alive than dead.

41012,/comment/41012,"Please make the spring bear hunt reinstation permanent. There are many benefits including but not limited to the ones I'm going to list.
1. Population Management
Nursing sows and Cubs cannot be harvested which means mainly males will be. This allows the cubs a better chance of survival as the males prey on them and out compete for food.
2. Human and Bear Conflicts
Harvesting a portion of the population after hibernation means that there will be less bears competing for natural food sources therefore less bears hanging around towns and people's yards. The males that are sought after by hunters and trappers are the most likely to do this as they're the most aggressive.
3. Reduced use of taxpayer money
Harvesting potential nuisance bears before they cause an issue saves money for police and MNRF being called to a scene as well as relocation costs and costs related to educating the public on dealing with bears.
4. Revenue
An additional season means more tags purchased. Along with that means more more spent on hunting gear, groceries for trips, butcher fees to get the animal processed and royaly fees on hides that are sold through an auction house.
5. Employment
There are many outfitters and guides provide people with the experience of bear hunting and charge for their service. This may be a significant portion of their income

I am potentially against some of the changes in outfitting requirements. I will clarify depending on citizenship.
I do not support any change that would force the immediate relative of a resident of Ontario to have to use an outfitter.  A Hypothetical example that could apply to my immediate family.  If my Son who grew up in Ontario, but moved to Alberta for work last spring, wants to come home for a week in the upcoming spring or fall and hunt Bear with me, I think he should be allowed to come to the traditional family hunt camp and participate without needing an outfitter, and I shouldn't need a special guide license or special type of license to hunt bear, or small game.  I think this same logic should also apply to buck whitetail deer.  It would seem logical to me that the Ontario Relative should have purchased the same license as the species being hunted, simply to ensure compliance with current hunting regulations.  In other words, you have to be licensed to participate in hunting a particular species.
Over the counter licence and tags should encourage Canadians to come home to their home province and spend time with family and friends.
Bears are not a species governed by a tag allocation and draw process, so why would we further restrict a non Ontario resident but Canadian citizen?   If you are meaning to enforce these terms for non resident aliens such as US citizens, then that would be acceptable to me.
I believe that Canadian Citizens should be able to hunt Bear, Deer, and other species not governed by strict tag allocation draws in Ontario with friends rather than having to use an outfitter.  I have friends in Saskatchewan I have hunted with, and it was a great experience.  I would never have gone if I had to pay the expense to go thru an outfitter.

The spring season is when black bear mother's and their cubs emerge from their dens - if we allow the killing of the mothers, what will happen to their cubs? Will they be killed as well? This would ultimately result in a decrease of the overall black bear population. Furthermore, black bears are interconnected with other species where they live - killing these magnificent animals will cause ripple effects on other species throughout Ontario.

Please re-consider the review of the spring bear hunt in Ontario. Our wildlife deserve protection, as they have had, in our increasingly humane focused society. This is a concern major concern to me.  In the spring hunt, slow-moving mother bears who have just emerged from hibernation are easily targeted often leaving orphan cubs as collateral damage.
There is no scientific backing for the re-opening of bear hunting season and frankly, sets us backwards 20 years. We can do better and our wildlife deserves better. I would be deeply disappointed and frankly appalled if we were to allow hunting of this nature in our province again.
Thank you.

41150,/comment/41150,"I think the Spring Bear Hunt should be cancelled. It is cruel and barbaric. You say that the killing of mothers with cubs is prohibited but nursing sows are killed during the spring hunt. We live in an area at the edge of the Queen Elizabeth II provincial park. There are a lot of hunters around. Many have no respect for the animals or the land. Last year we talked to one guy that said he had heard there was a mother bear with cubs that had been seen on our road, and that’s what he was after. Disgusting. Also, mother bears leave their cubs sometimes to go get food. They can be shot then, with no cubs in sight and the cubs are left to starve. This is why bating should be illegal. Orphan cubs are being found and brought to wildlife rescues after their mothers have been shot. Numbers have increased since the spring hunts. The mothers are being shot. God knows how many cubs are not found and left to such a cruel and horrible fate; starving to death. Why not just continue with the fall hunt? Is that not enough? And why are you trying to make the season so long? It’s just not right. You should be protecting these beautiful animals. Also one last point, using dogs to hunt bears is barbaric. This should have been banned years ago. How anyone can think this is ok is being me! This 2020, not 1920. Using dogs in spring is also another reason for a sow to become separated from her cubs, again allowing for her to be killed and cubs orphaned. You need to reconsider the spring hunt.

They're generally gun happy and are willing to shoot at anything that moves. Kill now, check later. Thus saying, if a female bear/mother bear is shot in the spring, her cub is left to survive on its own, which I'm pretty sure with all the predators out there, the cubs chances are next to slim. There are hunters out there nowadays who are shooting moose for the fun of it leaving them to the predators to dispose of. They have no intention of harvesting the moose for their families or anyone else to benefit. No, they're just gun happy. It's these kind of people that will go out and shoot female/bears and her cubs just for their greedy fulfillment to kill if you continue to allow the spring bear hunt to go on. I'm sure the camps and tourism will continue to benefit without the spring bear hunt. After all fishing season is year round basically. Then there's deer and moose season, not to mention bird. I'm sure with all these seasons of hunting, the camp owners are still prospering quite well. But it's all about the almighty dollar. That's what tourism is all about. Getting rich.

If there are bear concerns in human areas, its because humans stole their land and put garbage there for them. You shouls not be killing them because of humans own mistakes. The best we can do is relocate the bears if need be, there should never be reasons to kill an animal just because it exsists in your space.

41240,/comment/41240,"While I support the return of the spring bear hunt, the general focus of this proposal, I do believe that MNRF has little clue as to the health of bear populations in Central and NE Ontario. I say this knowing that population monitoring has been scanty to nonexistent and poorly designed from a geographic perspective.
The absence of registration of harvested animals vs reporting leads to inaccurate harvest information from a segment of the harvester population.
The number of bears dispatched in the ""protection of private property"" is much higher in rural NE Ontario than is reported and likely exceeded the legal harvest in the absence of a spring hunt.
The problems with the fall hunt are numerous. Moose hunter groups buy one bear license for the group and once that is filled by chance they purchase another to cover their next harvest. August hunting is during the recreational forest use period where trail walkers, berry pickers and portagers are put at risk.
Reducing the distance from a maintained trail or road to 30m from 200m is an attempt to support hunters who fear entering or leaving the bush in the dark with encased firearms. 30m is a dangerous distance for firearms discharge relative other travellers including highway travellers.
There is no protection for sows with cubs in fall. Young of year cubs orphaned in August will die by December.
Fat laden fall bears are essentially trophy bears by weight and far less desireable for consumption leading to potential for wastage. I'd prefer the fall hunt was cancelled with the return of the spring hunt.

My brother and I have been fortunate enough to participate in the ""pilot project"" spring bear hunt for the past 3 years (2017 - 2019) in WMU 37. Although we live in the Niagara region in Ontario, we have extended family that live in  WMU 37. They have graciously extended invitations to us to come and participate in the pilot project spring bear hunts and it has been an awesome experience for us. Through the spring bear hunt, our families have grown closer together, which we value very much.
In addition to being able to participate in this hunt with our families, we also really value the opportunity to travel to northern Ontario, to be in the outdoors and see another part of the great province of Ontario. The spring bear hunt provides this opportunity for us.
The spring bear hunt also provides another hunting opportunity for many Ontarians. As I'm sure you're well aware of, people have many different work schedules these days and busier or slower times of the year. In our cases, the spring is a much better time for us to participate in a hunt like this. In the fall, our schedules are simply too busy to participate in the fall bear season. With no spring bear hunt, we would not be able to hunt for bear at all.
Above all, the greatest thing we enjoy about the spring bear hunt is the meat that we are able to procure and feed to our families. It's great to participate in our hunting heritage and it more then just pulling a trigger. I get way more satisfaction out of what happens after that moment. When we are able to harvest a bear, we butcher and process the meat ourselves and I wouldn't have it any other way. It's awesome to go to the freezer and pull out safe and healthy meat to feed your family, meat that you harvested and processed yourself. As I said before, without the spring bear hunt, we would not be able to participate in a bear hunt in Ontario and provide this to our families.
I do disagree with some of the changes to non-residents. I know that there are quite a few American hunters that have bought large parcels of land (150 acres plus) in and around the area that we hunt in WMU 37. They have invested in these properties and have built small ""camps"" that they use for hunting opportunities as well as vacation destinations for their family and friends. They currently participate in the spring bear hunt by hunting on the properties that they own. They already pay way more for a bear license and they come to Ontario, spend money and support our economy. I would be concerned that by making them use and pay a licensed bear operator to hunt on land they own, some of these people might make the decision to not come to Ontario to hunt bear anymore, possibly even to sell this land they own, and no longer come to Ontario to hunt or vacation at all!

It is enough of shooting and killing for money and sport, as well as food. There is enough to eat including loads of healthy plant-based options such as legumes, grains, starches, fruit, vegetables in abundance without killing animals which is primarily for sport and money. The money this supposedly bring in will just be partly spent on enforcement and monitoring, administration costs. The best solution is to listen to the majority of Canadians who are against the Spring Bear Hunt every year and put an end to the Spring Bear Hunt. It is treacherous to allow this killing, the animals don't need to be culled. They are living in the Wild in nature, humans shouldn't go and follow them in there under the guise of doing a service. There are mother bears and cubs, male bears it is impossible for adrenaline filled, possibly alcohol filled people to exercise correct judgement in who they shoot and conservation officers can't be everywhere.  This costs more money than it gets, if you want tourism then go do another activity and take hike or go find another activity do a real sport like soccer or volleyball and not killing. Canadians don't want to be living in places which promotes, encourages and fosters killers who in turn are living amongst us and are conditioned to be violent as Government support them, so they as a result are excused to kill by the authority figures which is supposed to protect Canadians and Wildlife instead of creating and encouraging killers. I think we are out of the old century and in a new century where animal abuse, killing shouldn't be increasing and is not the norm.  It is outrageous that the government is constantly coming up with new ways and ideas to kill more wildlife I think this is getting old and it would be a breath of fresh air to see the government and ministry of wildlife to get with the times and stop the killing.

41301,/comment/41301,"opposition to the spring bear hunt
Ontario is one of the few places in the world that allows hunting while wild animals are reproducing. This inhumane spring hunt was brought back five years ago by the then Minter of Natural Resources, Bill Mauro (now Mayor of Thunder Bay). The purpose of the hunt is mostly to attract American tourists since traditionally Canadians have not hunted bears. Natural Resources and Forestry Minister John Yakabuski now plans to make the hunt permanent. It is part of their great economic development plan for the north.
Bear tourism and the killing of animals by baiting isn't hunting. It requires few hunting skills and little effort. A garbage can is put in the bush with various concoctions to attract bears close to where the tourist sits in a stand and can hopefully distinguish a sow from a boar. Some Americans hunt with dogs. The object is to get a big boar whose size is posted to the Boone and Crocket website. Sows before coming into feed usually hide their cubs which are orphaned when the sow is killed. Note, the government has made it illegal to kill sows but only with cubs. Neither the government or the operators assume responsibility for orphaned cubs.
Further, the placing of bait in the bush conditions bears to human garbage and scent thereby reducing their natural fear of humans. The widespread spring bear baiting throughout Northern Ontario is the ideal boot camp for training nuisance bears. The selective killing of larger boars (trophy animals) results in a behavioral change of junior boars who now have greater access to females. Normally, the boars would fight off or kill junior males attempting to mate. Sort of like having a teenage house party with the parents away, leaving the booze and waiting to see what happens nine months later.

41331,/comment/41331,"This excerpt was taken from an article titled The Return of Ontario’s Spring Bear Hunt by Andisheh Beiki
""Hunting in the spring is unfavourable because it is a time of vulnerability for bears and other animals that have endured winter and lost body mass. Bears are hungry when they come out of hibernation, there are newborns that must be nourished, and mothers are anxious to feed their young. As a result of these concerns, it remains illegal to hunt bear cubs and female bears with cubs. However, it is not easy to distinguish a bear’s gender at a distance and often, bear cubs are kept hidden in safety, so it is not always clear if a roaming female has cubs or not. Consequently, hunters may unknowingly shoot mother bears, leaving their cubs orphaned and doomed to suffer and die.
The practice of baiting is another contentious subject that has deterred many from the idea of a spring bear hunt. To make an easy shot for hunters, baiting stations are used to attract bears in the spring. But baiting also discourages bears from pursuing natural food sources and increases the likelihood that they will search for nourishment near areas of human establishment.
Most importantly, the return of the spring bear hunt is demonstrative of the persistence of a contradictory relationship between humans and other animals, and the paradoxical way in which we express interest and adoration toward certain non-humans and yet turn to aggression when they impact our preferred ways of life.
We wish to reduce human-bear conflict by means of violent force and yet, we feel obliged to spare mother bears and cubs due to their particularly fragile circumstance. Perhaps we must first address the moral conundrum with which we are faced – are we in fact concerned about bears and their interest in their own lives or are we only concerned as far as their presence serves humans?
Discussions of spring bear hunting in Ontario appear to have ensued without much consideration of solutions that would be in the best interest of both humans and bears. If we as a province made the decision to ban the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999 partly due to its inhumane nature, then it would make sense for us to attempt to resolve human-bear conflict through alternate non-lethal means.""

41399,/comment/41399,"I wish to express my dismay in regards to the proposal of re-opening bear hunt in Ontario. Black bears provide a number of ecosystem services. By eating fruits they act as seed disperser for many plants. They keep insects populations in check by eating their larvae and, thus prevent outbreaks. And, by consuming vertebrate herbivores they prevent these species from overgrazing. Overall, the presence of a bear is a very good sign that an ecosystem is healthy, which, in turn, makes our lives healthy as we depend on the environment for our day to day resources and for our enjoyment. I am therefore troubled to hear the news of a move towards re-opening spring bear hunt in Ontario. As we are facing an age of extinction, we should focus on taking species off hunting lists and not putting them on. While black bears are not considered species at risk, much of their habitat, particularly in southern Ontario has been lost to agriculture and urbanization. Bears living in and around this area are barely scraping by. Hunting will only exert more pressure on these individuals and will create more “problem animals”, as they will be forced to seek shelter away from the protection of the forest and venture closer to habitations to get away from hunters. Hunting is not the most effective solution for human-bear conflicts. Proper waste management and disposal, together with public education are! The Government of Ontario should consider re-directing efforts towards solving these problems and not exacerbating them. In addition, I am not clear about how the Government of Ontario intends to assure the safety of female bears and their cubs, given that Conservation offices in the Province are currently understaffed.

I would more strongly advocate for a complete ban of both the spring and fall hunts until the science suggests that the population is sustainable. A hunting season could then be reviewed from a position of strength in terms of the population rather than risk further declines with a limited hunting season. I am at least heartened that the health of this bear population is being investigated and that positive changes to their management are being proposed.

     As a wildlife research scientist I have had many years of experience with black bears in northern Ontario.  The thought that female bears with cubs will not be shot is outright ridiculous.  I know for a fact females are shot here in the spring even though they have cubs. Enforcement does not exist here.
    ""The black bear population is healthy in Ontario"",  we are told.  Well we were told the moose population was fine but now there are very few if any in our wildlife management area, yet they still sell licences to kill off the few remaining moose.  The M.N.R supposedly did moose population counts and look what happened.   The black bear population numbers is just a guess at best.  No actual or factual information on their numbers is available at least that I am aware of.  However, numbers do not really matter unless it is dollars in someones pocket, who cares about the black bear.  Lets just kill it into extinction without even finding out how many there are first.  Money and politics dictates which wildlife animals will pay the price.
    There are all kinds of excuses to continue this sadistic practice of killing bears; they are a nuisance,
they are dangerous, they are in my yard, they eat my garbage, but these are just reasons used to support the real motive.  Black bears are killed just because one group in our society can not let go of their Neanderthal  ways.  Shooting black bears for sport  or any animal for that matter is sadistic.    If you need to hunt for food to survive, that is another story.
     Someone who enjoys killing our wildlife, yes it belongs to all of us should do a self evaluation.  If you cannot enjoy our wilderness and the creatures that belong there without always killing something.   ""What is wrong with you?""
     I live in northern Ontario and every year I enjoy Gods great wilderness without killing, and I do not need to carry a gun while I am in the forest.  I was a hunter of moose since our family needed it to survive, but now there are none.
     The spring bear hunt should not take place.  Female bears come out of their den just as early as male bears.  This I know for a fact.
     The Black bear population will be destroyed  if there is not more enforcement.  The truth is black bears are killed here illegally and no one cares because it is being done by ""so called trappers"" or rural homeowners who shoot and shut up.
   So how many black bears were killed here in 2019?  Who knows?
     The Black bear deserves our respect and protection before it is to late.  I like my wildlife alive, not mounted and stuffed just because one person says so.

It has come to my attention that the Ontario government is planning on making the spring bear hunt permanent. This is an appalling idea and there is no good reason for such a barbaric practice at any time and especially in the spring.
Hunting animals in the spring puts their young in peril when the death of the mother leaves them abandoned. A bear cub is often treed while the mother feeds, and she will be killed by hunters not knowing she has cubs. Whether that concerns them or not is problematic.
Furthermore, the use of dogs to chase, tree and harass bears should be immediately halted.
The government should publicize their evidence that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety. What does affect public safely is education: monitoring human behaviour regarding providing attractants and feeding has the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflicts with wildlife.
A report should be created and published on any efforts by the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province.

No bear has ever behaved in a threatening way.  Common sense tells us to keep our dog leashed, so that he doesn't chase.
There are so many myths out there regarding bears.  Why anyone would decide that a spring bear hunt is a good idea is beyond me.  You can't tell the male bears from female so you will undoubtedly be leaving orphaned cubs to fend for themselves, which will mean starving to death or falling victim to predators.

While hunting in this region is still a family tradition, it is no longer a viable tourism option. In the past 15 years,  commercial hunt camps have become a thing of the past here in central Ontario, replaced by tourism operators that focus on a thriving environment, the sustainability of our ecosystems and pride in the health and diversity of our local wildlife.  This has become a viable draw for experiential tourism operators.  There is no longer a need to kill wildlife for commercial tourism needs.  The current generation of destination travelers and adventure seekers do not want to use guns.  An Instagram feed and photography workshops would bring in more tourism dollars than killing bears.

This bear was shot by a neighbour and this incident reported to the MNR. One could argue this problem bear was more accurately a people problem -- it was the availability of easy food that attracted this bear to our yards and our collective carelessness that led to its unfortunate but necessary demise.
Baiting bears is not sporting. This is a ridiculous practice, and outfitters regularly set out bait to attract and then shoot bears.
It is common knowledge that mother bears often stow their cubs when they go searching for food. It is inevitable that cubs will be orphaned. The lucky ones may be sent to wildlife refuge centres -- which are scarce in this province and underfunded. The unlucky ones will be left to starve or be killed. Wounded adult bears who are not cleanly killed will also be inevitable.

For these specific safety concerns, there are other ethical ways of chasing bears out of civilized areas - such as training dogs to scare bears away and/or enforcing and educating residents on proper behaviour to avoid attracting bears in the first place.
This will also increase the amount of abandoned cubs if their mothers are being hunted in the early spring. This will ultimately create a higher cost for wildlife sanctuaries to take care of the increased number of abandoned cubs.

-	increased opportunity for residents to “eat local” and “eat organic”
-	great revenue stream for the provincial government and local outfitters
-	revenue stream for spin off businesses as a direct result of increased tourism
-	reduction of pressure on moose calves (a notable concerned in Ontario about the decline in moose numbers and calf recruitment)

This proposal will do little to redistribute the opportunities and in fact will likely result in a marked decrease in license sales and participation.  Nonresident landowners that now participate in the hunt will not likely continue to do so if they are required to pay additional fees to a guide.  Provided further, nonresident landowners do not receive any priority in availability of permits so this proposal will not redistribute opportunity.  The minor agency expenditures required to issue validation certificates and permits should be more than off set by the price of the permit.  In addition, this proposed restriction will limit the ability for landowners to manage, or participate in the management of wildlife on their own properties.  As a nonresident landowner I have hunted 13 years and have harvested 11 bears.  In doing so I have paid thousands of dollars in license and permit fees, not to mention fuel, food and other associated expenses.

Bringing back the spring bear hunt will help keep the black bear population in check, which may in turn help with the declining moose population (the increased black bear population has been observed to directly impact moose calf mortality) and very importantly, revenue from the hunt will go toward helping Ontario wildlife through OFAS licensing fees as well as helping small northern businesses and communities who have been adversely impacted by the cancellation of the bear hunt.  I have personally witnessed an increase in human-bear conflicts over the years among myself and my colleagues and members of the general public and believe that a full return to the spring bear hunt can help minimize these conflicts as the bear population is kept to a sustainable level; this in turn will help minimize needless harm to both bears and humans.

As for non-resident land owners no longer being able to hunt and having to go to an outfitter, that was a great decision.  Thank you!

I don't think that having them purchase a licence to provide hunts is going to solve the problem because they are doing it under the table and there is no paper trail to follow and they are hunting on outfitter BMAs that we pay for and manage so that we do not over harvest.  I think any resident hunter that has a bear hunting licence should not be able to hunt on an existing BMA owned by an outfitter.  That might solve the problem.  There are BMAs that are vacant and those are the areas that resident hunters could hunt.  I know that this next issue is not on the EBR but it deals with harvest levels.

The Ontario government also wants to change rules so hunters do not have to report whether they hunt in spring or fall.  This would make it much harder to study the impacts the hunt has on the bear population.
Please release information to the public about the impact the spring bear hunt has had on people, bears, and other wildlife.

I was very concerned, once again, when I read about the announcement concerning reinstating the Spring bear hunt. In 1999 the spring bear hunt was finally cancelled. The hunt was cancelled to protect bear cubs from being orphaned when their mothers were accidentally and /or illegally killed.
In 2013, the spring bear hunt was reintroduced as an experiment ostensibly to reduce human-bear conflict.  However, the government’s own science showed that human-bear conflict had nothing to do with the spring hunt. In reality, the number of nuisance bear interactions increased when wild food crops, like berries and nuts, were not readily available due to drought or other poor environmental conditions.
The decision to implement a spring bear hunt by our Minister of Natural Resources must be impartial and based on sound, evidence based, scientific data which would be applied to every other species were it not considered as “profitable”. Appeasing hunters and other special interest groups should not be the primary goal of wildlife management policy.
  
Arguments against the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt:
Hunting bears in the spring does not reduce human-bear conflict.  The government should heed the results of their own science and appointed committees. Complaints do not reflect the number of nuisance bears in the population. The number of bears that were in conflict with humans and which were consequently trapped did not increase following the cancellation of the spring bear hunt in 1999.  The number of complaints about nuisance bears that occurred after the spring bear hunt was cancelled, was due to local controversy and an increased reporting effort.
It is difficult for hunters, even seasoned bear hunters, to tell the difference between male and female bears from a distance, and females leave their cubs in nearby trees while they forage. Inevitably, female bears are killed in the spring bear hunt.
Orphaning cubs threatens the black bear population, which has one of the lowest reproductive rates of all species. Female black bears do not generally start reproducing until they are 6 years old. 70% of orphaned cubs die before they reach one year of age. Black bear cubs stay with the females for protection and to learn how to forage for approximately two years. Killing the female also eliminates that generation of dependant cubs which cannot survive, or over winter on their own.
Arguments against bear baiting:
Baiting bears can increase the number of nuisance bears. Human attractants are a known cause of nuisance bear activity in populated areas. Bear baiting is begun well in advance of the legal hunt. Female bears teach their young how to forage, females that are not accidentally killed after using bait sites teach their young to take advantage of bait and other human food.
Females with cubs are more susceptible to being attracted by bait because they emerge from the den in Spring in poor body condition relative to other bears.
It can be difficult to identify and therefore avoid killing females around bait piles because mother bears stow their vulnerable cubs in trees while they forage.
Baiting bears goes against the notion of “fair chase” – there is nothing ethical or culturally significant about luring bears and shooting them from blinds as they consume unnatural food. 
 
General Recommendations (Preferred):
Immediate closure of the spring bear hunt and immediate ban on all bear baiting.
Proper consideration of evidence based science when making management decisions, instead of politically based motives that only provide the economic evidence in support of the decision.
To reduce human/bear conflicts by supporting programs which teach people to manage their waste
 
Alternative To Preferred Recommendations:
If the hunt is to continue, thereby ignoring current science and research which does not support reestablishing the spring bear hunt, in order to appease a political base as demonstrated by the explosion of “business opportunities” for multiple hunting organizations in Ontario, here are my recommendations. :
The Spring Bear hunt should last no more than 30 days, from June 1 to June 30.
Baiting must stop after June 30 and not to resume again until Sept 1st, two weeks prior to the Fall Hunt.
Baiting should be a minimum of 2km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after the hunt.
Fall Hunt should begin Sept 15 and end October 30 throughout the Province.
Hunting with dogs must be strictly Prohibited.
Female bears with cubs must be actively protected during the Spring AND Fall Hunt.
The Ontario government must hire additional Conservation Officers for enforcement of the above recommendations.
The decision to allow a Spring Hunt must be reviewed annually, considering evidence based science confirming the population is healthy and not driven purely by economic interests. Consultations must include First Nations, scientists and conservationists and not simply relying on the “science” provided by vested interests.
Having the Minister of Natural Resources, as stated by his own words, be more concerned about tourism, those hunting industries that support small business in northern and rural Ontario, forming committees such as the BGMAC to “improve big game management in Ontario”, read support for the above groups, and not look to maintaining the health and longevity of all species supporting the ecosystem in Ontario, including the “profitable” ones, is not what was intended for this Ministry. Economic development and business opportunities for Ontarians belong to other government ministries.
""We are listening to the concerns of northern Ontarians and the tourism industry that an ongoing pilot spring season creates economic uncertainty,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""A regular, monitored spring bear hunting season would enable tourism outfitters and camp owners to better plan their operations for the entire year, while also allowing hunters to better plan their activities and support local businesses.""
How about this Minister, charged with protecting all of our natural resources, try taking the long view, and base the decision, on when to allow a bear hunt, on sound proven evidence based scientific principles and then perhaps all those interested parties will still have a hunt to “profit” by in their futures.

As secretary of the Ottawa Valley Chapter of Safari Club International we are pleased to comment on this issue. Our view is simple. Please ensure all wildlife management decisions in the future are based on fact/ sustainability, not emotion. Follow the recommendations of wildlife biologists, not special interest groups that will do everything in their power to curtail Canada's hunting heritage. As such we support the reintroduction of the Spring bear hunt and management decisions that have been made on the Bruce Peninsula.

Our poor, poor planet is much too close to her tipping point for us to be enacting policies that will only serve to push her over the edge.

41507,/comment/41507,"Personally I find the spring bear hunt to be unethical regardless.  Cubs are born in hibernation, the bears wake up looking for food (SURVIVAL) and are still in a groggy state from hibernation.
The following is more info I copied and pasted from a facebook post:
Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance. (In my opinion baiting should be banned in its entirety)
Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

Here are two of my reasons: 1) the extreme cruelty to animals which will result from the orphaned baby bears. This happened during the previous spring bear hunts and for sure it will happen again. Studies showed that most hunters don't distinguish between the male and female bears (or perhaps don't care). The mother bears often keep the babies at a distance when she thinks there may be danger so the hunters don't see the bears. Wildlife rehab facilities will tell you that there will be a surge of baby bears if the spring bear hunt returns.
2)There is no need for this hunt. The public has not been given statistics that show that there is a significant increase in the population of bears which poses a danger. Why? Because the statistics don't exist, I expect.

41528,/comment/41528,"Bears are generally very timid creatures and do their best to avoid humans. The likelihood of a bear attacking a human is remarkably low and bears that are habituated to human presence are even less likely to behave aggressively towards people.
Hunting in the spring is horrific and cruel because it is a time of vulnerability for bears and other animals that have endured winter and lost body mass. Bears are hungry when they come out of hibernation, there are newborns that must be nourished, and mothers are anxious to feed their young.
It is not easy to distinguish a bear’s gender at a distance and often, bear cubs are kept hidden in safety, so it is not always clear if a roaming female has cubs or not.   Hunters will unknowingly shoot mother bears, leaving their cubs orphaned and doomed to suffer and die.
Bear baiting is another contentious subject that should deter the idea of a spring bear hunt.  To make an easy shot for hunters  (what is the point of this blood lust sport), baiting stations are used to attract bears in the spring.  Baiting also discourages bears from pursuing natural food sources and increases the likelihood that they will search for nourishment near areas of human establishment.
Using education, bylaws, aversion, monitoring and evaluation, we can enhance human-bear coexistence.  There is no evidence that a reduced bear population would be less likely to search for food around human habitat especially when you allow bear baiting.

41531,/comment/41531,"There are many concerns around the idea of hunting a species as important to the eco-system as black bears.  This is a species that once roamed widely throughout our entire province.   Humans, roads and development of land away from how that land evolved has curtailed their population to a large extent already.
When we lower the natural balance, particularly with a top predator, there are negative impacts that cascade downwards through other species.  The research on this is very clear.  Outcomes are dire.  Additionally, hunting in the Spring, when bears are more vulnerable and when females are travelling with young cubs, puts the species at an extreme disadvantage - some might consider this a clever tactic.  However, it reads as a set -up for extremely negative publicity for a controversial, some would say cruel, practice.  This would put Ontario in a very poor light to wider society.
Since the bear hunt has been determined to have no bearing on public safety - that is to say, that culling bears does not lower their interactions with humans, most of which are completely the fault of  humans, this also is no reason to allow for a second hunting season for bears.  IMO, hunting this species directly after they emerge from hibernation is much more likely to cause negative interactions through the later part of the season rather than lower them.
 As a form of population control, hunting is an extremely clumsy method and unlike natural selection, has impacts that are not easily kept in balance.   Furthermore, those who hunt bear for meat are foolish to do so in the Spring when the bears are at their lowest weight in the whole year.  Consequently, It is my position that we should follow the science on this matter and only allow a bear hunt in the Fall.

Already this province has too few officers to enforce the law.
So many of the hunting practices employed today are barbaric.  On the whole, I am opposed to hunting.  The extinction rate of animals on this planet is staggering.  I think we should do what we can to protect them.  To quote Ghandi, ""The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated"".

41570,/comment/41570,"I support the return of the spring black bear hunt as proposed in the ERO number 019-1112 posting. Here are the main reasons why I support this hunt.
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry (OMNRF) has a mandate to manage all wildlife including big game animals in Ontario for the wise use of the resources by residents and in many cases non-residents. This mandate also includes the management of the resources for the social and economic benefit of all Ontarians'. This mandate includes ensuring there is a sustainable population of the resource in this case, black bears. This proposal is in keeping with the wise management practices of this mandate.
After proper consideration has been given to the need of the indigenous people of this province, the focus must shift to the next wise use of the resource. If there is a remaining surplus of wildlife that could sustain a hunt, strong consideration must be given to how that resource is to be utilized. I have lived in northern Ontario and it is my opinion that the black bear population is thriving and abundant.
To under utilize this resource is a waste of the wildlife as well as the time, energy and taxpayers’ dollars that has gone into managing that specific species. Additionally, black bear, can have a negative effect on other wildlife such as moose calves that may be targeted as prey of the black bear.
The OMNRF has used hunting as a tool of management for wildlife for many years. This method has proven to be efficient and cost effective. The use of this management technic has minimal staff involvement, other than enforcement by the Conservation Officers. This tool of management provides an opportunity for residents in Ontario (and sometimes non-residents) to be directly involved in the management of the species.
Allowing a spring hunt for black bear will bring badly needed revenue into the WMU’s where the hunts are to take place. Living previously in northern Ontario I know that many of the outfitters in the past have relied heavily on the spring hunt to provide finances. This spring flush of money is required to help them make it through until fishing season and the fall big game hunts. All these outfitters are small businesses that rely on hunting and fishing seasons to pay their bills.
These are the same outfitters providing jobs for staff to run their camps which in turn stimulates commerce in those northern communities. These are the same communities where chain franchises hope to prosper through hunters making use of their services. Whether that is the local Tim Hortons or Canadian Tire or grocery store or gas station, hunters spend their money at these places which also helps to stimulate the local economy and provide employment.
These are the main reasons I support the proposal for a spring black bear hunt to be established as proposed in the ERO.
I want to make one final note. I am not a black bear hunter and do not intend to become one. I am not a big game hunter either. I do not currently live in one of the WMU’s that has a proposed black bear hunt. I am not a black bear guide or owner of a black bear management unit parcel of land. I hunt mostly migratory birds and small game such as wild turkey. Therefore, this proposal once passed will not affect my hunting practices and the outdoor recreational activities that I pursue.
I support this proposal for the reasons I have listed and believe that this is the right course of action for the OMNRF to take related to black bear management in Ontario.

41572,/comment/41572,"There is no doubt the Black Bear population has decreased significantly over the past decade, a fact which has been determined through the Barbed Wire Trap Study. I live on the Northern Bruce Peninsula and have spent a great deal of time in many large expanses of land between Wiarton and Tobermory, including Provincial, Federal and private lands. I have worked extensively in forestry over the past decade on the Northern Bruce Peninsula. In addition I have performed invasive species management work for various agencies on the Bruce Peninsula. As such I am in the backcountry on a regular basis for work, as well as being an avid hiker/explorer in my spare time. I would estimate I spend an average of 50 hours a week in the forest, and have done so each week for the past decade and a half in the forests throughout the Peninsula. I wanted to emphasize this because it ties in to observations I have developed over the past decade or more. I have always had a deep appreciation and a fascination of black bears and thus have paid close attention to the sign I see in the forests I frequent throughout the County. Ten to fifteen years ago bear sign was abundant, on the Northern Bruce Peninsula especially. Sightings were a frequent and regular occurrence as well as sign such as tracks, scat, claw marks on trees and root digging done by bears (such as squirrel corn).
At one time I lived in Dyer’s Bay (which is prime black bear habitat). Sightings were at the very least a weekly occurrence and often a daily occurrence as little as 10 years ago in that area. I am in Dyer’s Bay quite regularly now for both work and play and drive through each day on my way to work and haven't seen a bear in the area for 3 years now. There is sign in the bush but nothing like what it used to be. Johnsons Field has consistently been an excellent spot to see bears over the years as it is surrounded by Crown Land. Bears are seen on rare occasions there now, but very infrequently.
I often hear of local residents shooting bears out of season and disposing of the carcasses, which is hearsay but I am quite certain still a significant factor in the populations decline.   Human encroachment has increased via new housing and increased tourism (which in areas like Dyer’s Bay has increased hugely in recent years) as well as road mortality, the reduction of Beech nuts as a late summer food source, legal hunting that occurs, and the various effects climate change has on bears (such as hibernation and winter energy stresses), have all contributed to the scarcity of the Peninsula's black bears.
I myself am a hunter and believe in harvesting game for sustenance, but I think maintaining a healthy population is where the line should be drawn before any more tags are handed out.  The existence of a species quite obviously takes precedence over the right to hunt it.  The spring bear hunt has always puzzled me. The animals are in their worst condition of the entire year, having gone through hibernation and lost a large percentage of their body weight and overall condition. Sows have been feeding cubs for weeks before emerging and would surely be quite thin. It doesn't seem like a good time to harvest an animal under the circumstances. It also seems highly plausible to me that sows must get shot who have cubs, but perhaps aren't with their mom at the moment she enters a hunters line of sight thus effectively harming bear numbers in an even greater way. The use of bear bait also creates problems, I understand most bear hunters hunt using some form of bait.  I have certainly encountered many bait stations in my travels. They often feature human junk foods that lead to habituation and ill health (for example, at one pile there was a 60 gallon drum full of chocolate cake). An increased proportion of the bear diet is unnatural and unhealthy foods.  This will affect fitness over time. It also allows bears to develop habits and tastes which can progress into them becoming problem bears.
I am pleased to see that the OMNR is recognizing the rapid decline of this genetically isolated population and taking measures to improve the situation, however it seems that between the findings of recent studies and all the other factors facing bears in this area that drastic measures should be taken, time is very much of the essence in order save the Bruce Peninsula bears. Hunting should be ceased entirely in the Northern Bruce Peninsula until the population has increased and stabilized.
Thank you kindly.

41610,/comment/41610,"Killing is not conservation and the history of hunting seasons on all wildlife every where have proven to be disastrous. The minority of people that receive joy from killing animals have more rights for opinions on non scientific basis for promoting hunting season. Plus, to direct this on a focus of the tourism industry is a profound defect in the creative process of the ERO. Issues like this are to appease the minority base of the ""hunter"". Cross that boundary and don't look back and design tourism programs for photo ops and educational programs with policies of conservation without killing and permit the predator/prey populations to flourish and create the balance that nature meant to be. I have seen the disturbing videos and other graphics that the ""hunters"" post on social media and the animals are always made to suffer. This is animal cruelty in the worst possible scenario. So I'm thinking that giving opportunities for public comment is a smoke screen for a decision that has already been made. Humans have become allowed to become basers to trigger into the automatic kill mode as a first resort and that is evident in the violence that is pandemic across the globe. I am an advocate for non violent and  measures of balancing the wildlife population everywhere by letting nature take it's course and stop the senseless killings of all wildlife and voila the predator/prey balance of animals will become as nature intended. If the ERO were factoring in non biased scientific data then this issue would not be an issue. The opinions of hunters and their non scientific assessments of numbers counted on their fingers of wildlife is not an intelligent basis for animal specific hunts. I am attaching a video showing a Toronto Bear hunt video where the Bear is baited (not fair and not hunting) and the arrow does not kill the Bear instantly so there is much torture and suffering experienced on the Bear's part...ANIMAL CRUELTY. HUNTING IS NOT A SPORT. SPORT IS WHEN BOTH SIDES KNOW THEY'RE IN THE GAME.

With the increase in the forest cover in adjacent counties since WWII, black bear movement is less restricted by lack of continuous suitable habitat. Black bear observations are now fairly frequent in Grey, Simcoe, and Huron Counties suggesting that migration is possible. Also if the fall hunt on the Bruce is closed I believe that black bears may be de-valued to nuisance animals instead of game animals resulting in animals being killed, unreported, and abandoned.

Sows with cubs Need the utmost protection during the spring and fall hunts and a life long bear hunt ban and fine for those who fail to comply.

I disagree with the proposed changes, for the following reasons:
- it is difficult, if not impossible for hunters to distinguish between male and female bears. Specialists have difficulties determining male to female without the comparison being readily available.
- the issues that prompted the original cancellation have not been resolved in any way shape or form.
- even though the goverment ensures the population is healthy they do not have a very good record in regards to wildlife conservation
- reasons cited for making the hunt permanent seem mainly economic, which is a very dangerous basis for any wildlife management policy. These animals should not be looked at as money makers.
- ophaned cubs when their mothers are killed inevitably also die. With this idea in mind it is crucial to realize if the cubs cannot grow to adulthood their populations will continue to drastically decrease until they become endangered in those regions.
Please rethink the reasons these bans were put into place initally as it was done with a valid purpose.

The abuse of hunting/fishing/trapping rules by locals and visitors with cottages/ hunt camps is out of line. I do long hikes on Crown land weekly and see the carnage left behind by illegal hunting. I  reported illegal hunting (found a shot and dismembered baby bear in the woods by a road) some years ago and nothing was done about it. My experience with local OMNR was sadly disconcerting. I know by hearing locals talk at local community events/Legion that little effort is made to identify a sow during spring bear hunting when baited. In past spring hunts, there were repots of baby bears wandering around on their own in the bush (mother bears not seen) locals are defiant of the hunting regulations. As well, bear meat is rarely eaten nowadays.  I object to the Spring bear hunt. You know darn well you do not have the staff or the funds to monitor the spring bear hunt. Sure you might catch the occasional illegal hunter and OMNR gets good  news coverage for ""doing your job"" but let us be realistic...you are not seeing most of the illegal hunting.

41688,/comment/41688,"The Spring Bear Hunt should be abolished rather than continued. It is unethical and highly immoral for hunters to be hunting bear in spring, when bears are just out of hibernation. They are extremely hungry, weak and highly susceptible to baiting stations. Baiting bears is not hunting, but entrapment for an easy kill. Baiting is a practice that should also be banned in Ontario.
The issue of public safety to potential attacks has been blown way out of proportion by the media and supported by a small vocal group of special interests in the province. Bear encounters and attacks have been sensationalized by the media and have created an unrealistic fear of bears.
There have only been 7 black bear attacks resulting in deaths by 4 male bears in over 100 years in Ontario. By comparison from 1964 to 2010 there were 12 fatal attacks by dogs in Ontario according to the Canine Research Council. Many of the bear encounters reported as attacks are “bluff charges” resulting in no physical contact with the person. There has never been a black bear attack resulting in a fatality within a community anywhere in Canada. Of the few black bear attacks in North America over half have involved unleashed dogs.
The Mike Harris government had the good sense to abolish the spring bear hunt in 1999, in response to the genuine concerns for female bears and their cubs, in response to statistics that supported a high incidence of orphaned cubs due to females that were mistakenly and deliberately killed by hunters. The fact of the matter is that ALL bears are at risk, and deserve to be protected. Unfortunately, the Liberal government chose to ignore their own science that found no evidence that a spring bear hunt reduces human / bear conflicts, and reinstated a spring hunt pilot project in 2013. I believe along with many others that this was done in response to public safety but as the result of pressure that was brought by hunters and those who operate hunting expeditions and for economic reasons. The Ministry pulls in millions of dollars in revenue from hunting licenses and tourism.
Your proposal unfortunately includes very little if any mention of the Ministry's interest in protecting the right to life of black bears just out of hibernation. It just confirms business will be as usual in continuing where the previous liberal government left off in allowing for an official spring hunt that makes it possible for hunters and hunting expedition companies to continue killing bears in spring. If you care about the opinions of ALL Ontarions in this matter, you will also be giving serious thought and consideration to feedback that calls for a reinstatement of the ban of the spring bear hunt. This decision should not rest solely on what is right and best from an economics point of view, but must take all factors into consideration to be truly fair.

If any honest hunter wishes to take the life of a bear they should at least only hunt in the fall where the chances of killing a mother bear with cubs would be minimized. If the spring hunt goes ahead then the dates should be moved to start June 1st to 15th as by this time more cubs stay with there moms and honest ethical hunters would not kill a mom with her cubs present. I am well aware that there are hunters who follow the rules and try to be ethical about taking a life of a wild animal. My brother is one of these hunters and lives off what he kills. I am concerned of the hunters that will not report what they kill, that will kill a few bears and only report the largest one they kill. I also wish bait stations on crown land would be illegal. I have come across bait stations while hiking and feel these are very unsafe as they are not marked  and are ethically disgusting and put my own and my families  safety at risk. If this spring bear hunt goes thru then any Hunter should have the license fee increased to cover the cost of having more officers being hired to protect and enforce the rules are  being followed as I know there are many disgusting humans out there poaching, and lying about what they have killed.

2.  The current regulations allow black bear hunting in the township of Keppel.  I assume this is intended to manage the bear population that conflicts with the high density and growing population of cottagers and full time residence along Grey Road 1.   Reducing the bear season will have a negative effect and increase the number of human interfaces as bears search out cottage garbage.
3. Farmers and land owners on the Bruce Peninsula have a very negative relationship and low trust factor with the Ministry, because of past bear practices.  The high density of farmers in the area have significant bear issues, crop damage and loss of farm animals.   It is believed that the larger black bears that are not native to the BRuce,  were imported by the Ministry (from algonquin area).  THe larger black bears have caused an imbalance in the bear population and increased human / Bear conflicts.
4.  I have heard anecdotal evidence of black bears being poached, and not properly harvested or reported (rather just buried in a hole) in the above areas.  This benefits no one.
5. Bear remain an effective predator and increase faun mortality, and are in direct conflict with deer hunting opportunities which is a much larger economic draw to the area.

41734,/comment/41734,"I oppose this proposed change. We have a corona virus problem that comes from this hunting business or this type of hunting business.
The sprung bear hunt was cancelled  many years ago for good ethical reason. The ethical aspect of why a spring bear hunt need not to occur as not been addressed and still stands.
Attacking wildlife is depraved. Fittingly, Ontario elected a depraved government but not because it wanted this depravity; the Conservative government was elected for other reasons that have nothing to do with supporting animal cruelty.
The  hateful stories going around to demonize bears need to stop: we need to learn to live with our wild life and learn to respect it. Hunting bears in the spring does not help to accomplish this objective.
Bear parts end up in China and feed the devastating corona virus that is set to kill so many. That is nature fighting back against hunting but things need not to be this way. Gun manufacturers need to be held accountable for the war on the wildelife and its conaequences. I urge Ontario's Government not to side with lies that are just so harmful in so many ways. Moose populations are going down and you need to stop hunters to rectify the problem.
It is time to stop the spring bear hunt once and for all, just as it is time for China to close down its exotic meat markets that create a demand for our bears' penises.

I fully support the passing of the proposed spring bear season as it addresses past criticisms of the original season that was abolished in 1999, as well as provides certainty to the guides and outfitters that rely on the hunt's stability.
I believe that the banning of shooting cubs and mothers with cubs addresses the primary concern of orphaning bears, which was a major talking point of animal rights advocates at the time of its abolishment.
I also feel that the addressing of bear population concerns in the Bruce Peninsula through a shortened season shows the province's thoroughness in analyzing the capacity for a spring season in other management areas.
Thank you for your time

I applaud this reversal of the bear hunt regulations, it gives our family much more quality time in the outdoors with the opportunity of harvesting and consuming delicious drug free meat. I have known for years that a previous P.C. gov. stopped the hunt strictly for political gain. This is a practice that must be stopped when it comes to our natural resources ! Decisions must be based on sound management principles!
I live in the Wiarton area and cannot believe a shortened season is proposed, we have more bears now than ever with sow / cub sightings being a common thing. In my backyard there are two sows with 5 yearling cubs and a number of large boars that play football with garbage containers. These only represent confirmed sightings. Neighbours for miles around report the same thing.
There have never been any studies in this area and for that reason I cannot accept the shortened season. The real issue here is a total lack of MNRF people resulting in crystal ball management for our area.

Because of this, several friends and family members have ventured into Ontario.  Several of those people have come to experience bear hunting.  They, in turn, have shared their stories and encouraged others to experience Ontario and bear hunting.

41766,/comment/41766,"I possess a hunting licence and do harvest animals in Ontario for consumption.  I am also the host of Hinterland Who's Who, Canada's longest running public service announcements - featuring messages of responsible stewardship of nature and conservation of wildlife. I managed a wildlife education centre with Ontario's largest collection of captive native wildlife, including black bears.  I am not a member of OFAH because of my awareness of their misrepresentation of data and facts surrounding wildlife.  I do not agree with organizations who promote hunting opportunities at seemingly any cost to the overall well being of natural systems as a whole.  They appear to have too much power in influencing the OMNRF in decision making around harvests than they should.  There are many independent hunters who believe in ethics and science/fact-based conservation measures as a priority, over providing hunting opportunities.  I am frankly shocked that the proposed changes are even being considered, as I was when the pilot spring bear hunt was brought into effect.   Many species are decisively not harvested when mothers have vulnerable young, who would be put at risk of suffering from starvation if their mothers were killed.  Why this principle is not being applied to black bears is beyond me.   It is a blatant disregard for ethics.  I keep reading that hunters are prohibited from shooting mother bears with cubs and this infuriates me for several reasons.  I have worked with black bears in captivity , as well as with OMNRF bear technicians in the wild and neither myself nor the techs could accurately differentiate male bears from female bears in the field.  It is also common knowledge that mother bears stow away their young ones while they go foraging, so hunters who shoot lone bears could very well be killing mother bears unknowingly.   I am obviously strongly against the proposed spring bear hunt or the continuation of the pilot spring hunt.  If it is determined by research and science, and not due to pressure from the OFAH or other special interest groups, that a hunt is required to keep bear numbers in check, then all tags should be issued for a fall hunt, when young cubs have grown significantly and stand a better chance of survival.  I expect my province to make decisions based on research and ethical practices only.  Thank you for considering my comments.

2. A bear coming into a bait site will almost always approach from downwind and will detect the presence of the hunter In tree stand from as much as 1/4 mile distant.
3. Bear bait sites are contaminated with human scent from the bait, the hunter and the outfitter who places the bait  Bears that frequent a bait site, perhaps during the night, and not harvested will have learned to associate a food source with human scent. These bears will in all probability become nuisance animals if the opportunity arises at remote campsites or in rural and even urban residential areas. They will have no fear of humans and could become a threat to humans.
4. Females with cubs will typically hide the cubs before approaching a bait site if at all suspicious of human scent.
5. A Conservation Officer will not check a bait site if a hunter is present so as not to disturb the hunting opportunity or to avoid being shot by accident and therefore will have little opportunity to inspect whether or not a female will cubs has been harvested.
6. A hunter who has either accidently or purposely shot a female bear with cubs is highly unlikely to report his mistake to OMNRF or to even retrieve the animal for fear of being found in contravention of the law.
7. Spring bear hunting can be successful without using bait since in early spring bears typically feed on grass and other plants and can be found in open areas such beaver meadows, hydro and has right of system etc. A hunter would be better able to determine if the bear is accompanied by cubs.
Bait hunting is simply unethical and unnecessary.
8. MNRF should consult with leading bear research scientists within and without the organization and not rely heavily on advice  from outfitter or hunter organizations who will have be biased towards reinstating the hunt for monetary or recreational opportunity  reasons.
9. A study of the relationship with bear baiting and nuisance bears and even  attacks on humans by bears should be conducted by radio collaring or other means to determine the association if any before launching a permanent spring hunt.

41771,/comment/41771,"I am totally opposed to bringing back the spring bear hunt. AS A MODERN, PROGRESSIVE, EDUCATED SOCIETY are we so foolish to bring back the spring hunt when we very well know that there are possibilities that bear cubs could be left orphaned and left to die a slow death from starvation? Are we too morally blind to realize that? Sows do not go around in the spring carrying placards. They leave their cubs in brush or up trees as they go foraging for food, sometimes to baiting stations. The risk of killing sows who have cubs is too great to justify bringing this immoral hunt back.
Bears are primarily vegetarians and rarely do male bears kill cubs. They are also not responsible for the decline in moose populations. Climate change, clear cutting and logging, aerial spraying, failure to establishing a moratorium on hunting are some of the main reasons for declining moose populations. These are some negative  propaganda that pro hunting groups are using to justify bringing back the hunt.
We can achieve more economic benefit by establishing eco tourism which includes wildlife watching. We need to have advertisement campaign in Europe and Asia and we will be able to attract a lot of tourism which will bring money and help conserve the wilderness and wildlife we have that many countries have lost.

41826,/comment/41826,"January 28, 2020
I would like to provide comments on the “Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season”. I am neither opposed to, nor in favour, of the Proposal. I am not a hunter, so bear hunting has no direct impact on me. I am not opposed to hunting. I understand and accept the recreational aspects of hunting. I am well aware of the economic benefits created by bear hunting, particularly the significant non-resident hunting that occurs through many tourism operations. I am an avid user of the outdoors in Northern Ontario and participate in activities where I have come into contact with black bears.
I believe that all harvest of natural resources, such as wildlife, fisheries or forests must be done in a sustainable manner which allows firstly for the continued existence of healthy populations and secondly for economic prosperity. Ontario contains a significant wealth of natural resources. These resources make Ontario a great place to live and have been the life-blood of communities throughout the history of the province.
I have read a discussion of bear ecology and tactics associated with dealing with so called “nuisance bears” as published by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry on the internet at https://files.ontario.ca/mnrf-cr-black-bear-ecology-life-systems-intera….
I am aware, because I live in Northern Ontario, that when humans and black bears come into contact there can be conflict.  Humans recreate in wild areas and live in places that are increasingly rural, therefore natural habitat for bears and recreational and living space for humans overlaps in many circumstances. For this reason, bears often become what some people see as a nuisance and, in some cases, I believe people perceive that due to the circumstances of conflict, that the bear population is quite robust and perhaps even too high.
I read that black bears are omnivores, meaning that they eat both plants and animals. Approximately 85% of a black bear’s typical diet is plant material, while the remaining 15% is made up of animal protein. Black bears will eat almost anything, such as grubs from a bumblebee nest, bird eggs, ants, voles, grasses and berries (L.J. Landriault, 2000). Berry crops account for a large part of a bear’s diet and the potential for nuisance bear activity increases in years when berry crops fail and the animals search for alternate food sources (L.J. Landriault, 2000). I understand that occurrence rates for human-bear conflict can be closely tied to the health of berry crops, with bears straying into rural and urban populated areas in search of alternative food supplies during times of low berry availability. I suspect that this may lead to a misunderstanding of bear population numbers (a perception that numbers are higher than they actually are) when human-bear conflicts increase.
The material that I read also speaks to the reproductive rate of black bears.  Female black bears in Ontario may produce their first litter when they are five years old, but the average age of first reproduction is about six in central Ontario and seven in northern Ontario (L.J. Landriault, 2000).  In the past in Ontario bears were considered a threat and even had a bounty placed on them until 1961 (Ontario 2009).
I note from the introduction to the Proposal that “Ontario is home to a healthy black bear population”. I see no evidence to support this statement within the Proposal, either in the details of the Proposal or within supporting documents. I would have thought that following a seven-year “Black Bear Pilot Project” that any “Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season” would include an analysis of information gained through the pilot project and an assessment of the health of the black bear population. I see no such analyses in the Proposal.
I looked at the Regulation Proposal Notices for the “Black Bear Pilot Project” from February 25, 2014 and October 30, 2015 - EBR Registry Numbers 012-0981 and 012-5485. These Proposal Notices contain the following wording:
“The proposed pilot would provide additional data with which to assess the impacts of the spring black bear hunting season and help inform long-term black bear management activities. The pilot is also expected to increase the economic benefits derived from bear hunting for tourist outfitters and local economies. The pilot would begin in the spring of 2016 and end June 15, 2020”.
“The five-year pilot would include efforts to assess the impacts of an early black bear season in reducing human-bear conflicts in northern communities. Generally, the pilot would be assessed in a number of ways including: monitoring the number of bear hunters and the number of bears harvested, tracking the number and type of calls to the Bear Wise reporting line, working with municipalities to identify changing trends in human-bear encounters and to explore ways to reduce human-bear interactions, stakeholder perspectives, economic benefits, and other associated factors (e.g., variation in spring green-up date, and variation in availability of natural foods)”.
This wording from the original Proposals supports my expectation that I would see evidence of  “additional data” and information related to the “number of bears harvested” in the current Proposal.
In the supporting materials for the current Proposal, I see a document titled Black Bear Management Framework. This document shows that it was updated in December 2019, so I assume that it forms the current basis forå managing black bear in Ontario. I did a further document search and found a document titled Enhanced Framework for Black Bear Management in Ontario. This document is dated June 2009 and appears to be quite similar, so I assume that the December 2019 document represents an update of the previous “Enhanced Framework”.
The 2019 Black Bear Management Framework includes guiding principles which include the statement: “Harvest management strategies must recognize that black bears have an inherently low reproductive capacity relative to other harvested large mammals and that, as with other long-lived species, population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females”. Later it goes on to say under Challenges that “The black bear’s inherently slow rate of recovery from low population levels increases the risks for local populations where harvest pressure and other mortality are high”.
Another document I found separately, titled Backgrounder on Black Bears in Ontario, and dated June 2009, contains a similar statement that “black bear populations are vulnerable to over-harvest because they are a long-lived animal, reach sexual maturity relatively late in life, have a low reproductive rate that is physiologically dependent upon environmental conditions (food), and are most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females. For these reasons, their harvest must be managed carefully”.
The 2019 Black Bear Management Framework contains a myriad of Strategies and Tactics for the management of black bears and their population. These appear to be very similar to those in the 2009 Enhanced Framework.
There are several Strategies and Tactics that relate to monitoring, managing and harvesting black bear populations.
Tactic 1.1.1 states “Establish and maintain a network of population monitoring stations across black bear range to monitor population trends. Utilize recent advances in technology (e.g. DNA sampling and analysis) to validate and enhance population monitoring techniques”.
Tactic 1.4.1 states “Use landscape level and ecological considerations in the development of black bear population objectives and determination of sustainable harvest levels”.
Tactic 1.4.2 states “Finalize a system of ecologically-based harvest assessment indicators to provide tools to assess and manage the impact of harvest on black bear populations on the landscape”.
Tactic 1.5.2 states “Include local objectives that identify cultural, economic, social and biological management considerations of black bear as an important part of the natural ecosystem, an opportunistic predator, a big game species, and a source of human-wildlife conflict”.
These are the kind of tactics I would expect to see and I would expect that the Ministry of Natural Resource and Forestry would be funded to undertake them. Since these tactics have been in place since 2009, I would also expect to see some results and would expect to see the results used to develop and rationalize the Proposal.
The challenges listed in Section 5.0 of the Black Bear Management Framework seem like the kind of topics that would be addressed in the “Proposal to implement a regular black bear spring hunting season”.
I wonder why the “Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season” does not include information related to any assessment of the population that has been done that would support the opening statement of “Ontario is home to a healthy black bear population”. And also why there is no mention about how the black bear harvest system is managed to ensure not only economic and recreational benefits, but also the sustainability of the population. These are things that are suggested as tactics in the Black Bear Management Framework.
I note the Proposal includes restrictions on hunting in the Bruce Peninsula due to concerns regarding the health of the black bear population.  What is this based on and was similar information used to determine that the populations are healthy elsewhere?
I also do not see any discussion of harvest strategies. I read about the basics of the harvest system in the legislative supporting material. This does not provide a clear explanation of how the Ministry uses knowledge of the population to decide how many bears should be harvested or how to allocate harvest opportunities amongst competing interests.  I understand that any Ontario resident purchasing a bear-hunting license is entitled to harvest a bear. Doesn’t this mean that there really is no control at all over the number of bears that could be harvested? What about non-residents harvesting bears through resource-based tourism operators? Is there an allocation and control system in place to manage the number of animals harvested and the impact on the population? How many bears were harvested during the Black Bear Pilot Project? Is that harvest number sustainable in the long term?
The Black Bear Management Framework speaks to the low reproductive rate of black bears and the potential vulnerability of the population to over harvest. It would seem to me that it would be paramount to have an assessment of population health and a corresponding harvest allocation and control system in place to ensure the long-term sustainability of black bear in Ontario. An assessment of population health would include factors spoken to in the Black Bear Management Framework such as population distribution, sex ratio, age ratio and the rate and impact of commercial, recreational and subsistence harvesting.
I respectfully suggest that prior to finalizing the Proposal as presented, that additional work is required to provide the following:
1.	A robust assessment of black bear hunting over the past 7 years of the “Black Bear Management Pilot”, including an estimate of the rate of harvest.
2.	An accounting of the health of the black bear population in Ontario.
3.	A discussion of the harvest allocation system, with a clear explanation of the methodology for the control of harvest.
This information should form the basis of a revised Proposal with much stronger rationale and actual evidence of analyses to support decision-making.
Without such additional information, I submit that there is no basis for the statement “Ontario is home to a healthy black bear population”, which is the underpinning for the Proposal. As written, the Proposal appears to have no rationale for what appears to be a relatively unlimited harvest of black bears.
I am concerned that with the combination of an historic fear of bears; common human/bear conflict situations; a perception of high populations: and low reproductive capacity of black bears, that the bear harvest program in Ontario could be leading to a potentially lethal reduction in the bear population.
As I stated at the outset, I am not opposed to hunting. In fact, I believe there are many positive benefits to the harvest of natural resources, based on wise management using appropriate information and controls. I believe that this can be the case for bear management in Ontario, but I am not convinced by anything written in the Proposal or contained in the supporting materials.

41830,/comment/41830,"The spring black bear hunt instituted as a limited two-year pilot project in 2014 and expanded and extended for five years in 2016 may become a permanent fixture in Ontario unless enough opposition is rallied.
A Brief History
A spring season for hunting black bears was cancelled in 1999 when the Ontario Progressive Conservatives faced evidence of increased orphaning of bear cubs among other environmental concerns. In 2014 the season was reintroduced by the Ontario Liberals in response to alleged conflict in communities; by 2016, the government had changed their tune to the economic boon of such a hunt, with the alleged conflict as a secondary argument often not even acknowledged. Now, under the Ontario Progressive Conservatives once more, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is proposing that the spring black bear hunting season be made permanent.
The Concerns
There are a great deal of issues surrounding the existing spring bear hunt that have not been addressed appropriately. While Coyote Watch Canada strongly oppose the spring bear hunt and believe it should be cancelled, there are issues that must be considered if it is to continue. The list below was created in conjunction with information from Bear With Us Sanctuary and Rehabilitation Centre for Bears in Ontario and The Fur-Bearers.
Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

And knowing it is regulated closely and hunters follow the rules and show great respect for wildlife and nature as a whole. This is much better than packaged factory meat and should be a right for people , hunters too, in Canada to humanely harvest their choice of food as much as anyone does in a grocery store...

I am 20 years of age and grew up in Michigan. My family built a cabin in Ontario because we enjoy the beauty that all of Ontario offers. I grew up traveling and hunting in Ontario with my family. Our family has been hunting bears in Ontario for well over a decade now. My family lives off of the meat and it impacts our family greatly. I recently purchased property in Ontario by my family's cabin hoping to build a cabin there someday and teach my children how to bear hunt. But the reason why I bought this property so early in my life was for the advantage that I may bear hunt. If you guys change these rules for Americans I would have to hunt with a guide and I cannot afford to do that. So if you guys were to change the rules of bear hunting I feel like I would have to sell my property because it would no longer have the same value to me as it once did. I hope this can help you guys make your decision and how this would impact me and my family for years to come.

41852,/comment/41852,"As an Ontario resident that spends a great deal of time in the outdoors across the province, I would like to express my strong opposition to the proposed reopening of the Ontario spring bear hunt. There is no logical reason for opening the hunt after all these years. Hunters have ample opportunity to engage in their activities at other times of the year and without the risk of orphaning bear cubs when sows, with their cubs treed at another location, are shot, especially when lured to bait stations. For legitimate hunters who believe in the principle of fair chase, the entire practice is regressive and abhorrent.
I have read some unsubstantiated comments from a small number of hunters who claim that black bears are having a detrimental impact on moose populations, but I have searched diligently for any evidence that that claim has any veracity at all and I can find none. It would appear to be just another baseless claim that some hunters are using to justify the return of the hunt for their own self-interest.
I urge the Government of Ontario not to step back into the dark ages of wildlife management by reinstating the spring bear hunt.

41853,/comment/41853,"As someone who cares about Ontario's wildlife, I am disappointed to learn that this government is now proposing a permanent spring bear hunt. At the time of the proposed ""pilot"" project I also submitted a comment in opposition and I am doing so again today. As wildlife populations are plunging all over the world due to habitat loss, over-hunting, poaching and other environmental factors, I find it unconscionable that our government would even consider this decision. It is my understanding that it is illegal to kill a mother bear with cubs, however, considering that there is a large number of cubs that are orphaned every year, it seems to me that those that hunt seem to be ignorant of the fact that mother bears often hide their young cubs while they go foraging for food...this being the case, why does the government allow the hunt to start so early in the year? It goes against all reason. Also, where is the information on how many bears are being poached each year? Is there somewhere we can find that out? I do not know how anyone can make the statement that the Ontario black bear population is ""sustainable"". It seems to me that there are too many unknown factors to make such a statement. We are also at risk of forest fires here in Ontario and we have seen what devastating effect fires can have on wildlife populations by simply watching the news unfold in Australia. The ""value"" of our wildlife is priceless and we must do all we can to protect it.

41859,/comment/41859,"I am apposed to the implementation of a spring bear hunt for the following reasons:
If we want to maintain a robust bear population for hunters It remains prudent to not place stress  on bears emerging from hibernation.
Furthermore, distinguishing a female  from a male is problematic since the cubs are not always visible as the mothers often tree the young when they smell human presence. This leaves orphaned cubs  if the mother is shot which would otherwise contribute to the bear population for the following year's fall bear hunt.
Females with cubs feeding on bear bait habituate to human food and become future problem bears which puts them at risk of being killed by conservation officers.
While the intent  of the change in regulation appears to create a hunting opportunity in the spring and subsequently stimulate economic activity in rural Ontario the concept is not based on sound science, and would be a detriment of the species.
Bears are most vulnerable during the spring coming directly out of hibernation

41860,/comment/41860,"I have owned property in Ontario for 17 years and started bear hunting about 14 years ago.  It is one of the main reasons I purchased property in Ontario and it has been a family tradition to engage of all aspects of the hunt with my family.  I highly oppose the changes to keep non residents from doing there own hunt.  I would like to list some points that probably overlooked in the recommendation.
1. its a family tradition that my wife and child always get involved in the baiting and hunting part each year.  We have 2 properties so we both can draw a tag to hunt.
2. Over the last 14 years I have brought in 20-30 other hunters who hunt with my neighbor who is a resident and has a BMA.  Most of these people come back every year or every other year.  he provides hunts to these customers and it helps him earn a living and run a business.  He does not advertise ot attend shows but is pretty full almost every year.
3.  My family is far more selective on the bears we shoot than hunters who just come up to shoot a bear.  Each year we pass many bears and only pursue trophy animals.  Most years my family will harvest on of the largest bears at camp even though there are many other hunters that come to hunt in his BMA.  This will become much more difficult as my local outfitter does not bait the same way as me and does not put the time into the process as I do as its just a job for him.
4.There is no shortage of bears in our area so we are not hurting the population and always try to maintain to harvest the mature bears.  There are only 3 hunters in our area and the baits are spread out as well.  In fact only one local Canadian hunts bears in our area as most Canadians are not interested in bear hunting.
5.  We do not hunt in his BMA.  Our baits are many miles apart so rarely are we pursuing the same bears.
6.Each year I help my local bear guide with the BMA locate bait for his upcoming season since I have many connections in the states for good bear bait.  This has happened for many years!
7. This is meat that my family lives on and we consume the meat for many of our meals.  If we would hunt through the outfitter this becomes much harder and we will end up having to take smaller bears.
The other parts of the new initiative I don't have any issues with but we would like to remain with the possibility of hunting on our own and letting non resident property owners continue this great tradition.

The killing of bears for sport and for presumed 'control' is unethical and illogical and contrary to modern management practices.  Just as some still want to hunt elephants, rhinos, swans and other charismatic wildlife,  there exists in Ontario a small percentage of society that has an outdated understanding of bear biology and is being manipulated by misinformation provided by hunting clubs and commercial interests.  Bears are not a real threat nor a necessary disturbance and people are often surprised to learn that injuries in bathtubs or by cars in Ontario are magnitudes more likely than from a bear even when encountered in the wild.  We do not outlaw or shoot bathtubs and cars.  Moreover, people are surprised to learn that bears are sentient beings with feelings, experiencing pleasure and pain the same as, or analogous to, ourselves.  Furthermore, people are surprised to realize how much pain and suffering is caused by hunting and that bears are wounded and certainly rarely die instantly from being shot.  I've been involved as a professional with bears for 30 years and have grown up in Ontario with them in my front yard as a child, have encountered hundreds while on foot in the wild, read and study the scientific literature about wildlife, and of course design and teach our biodiversity and conservation courses and can say that the spring bear hunt is the wrong thing for us to do to these animals.

41918,/comment/41918,"I am an adult Ontario resident. I request that any spring bear hunt be abolished permanently..
The risk of errant bullets especially around unmarked bait sites makes me afraid for my safety and for that of my friends and loved ones who enjoy outdoor recreational activities such as camping, hiking, canoeing and photography. Further my love of being in nature extends to ethical ecotourism where one may have the opportunity to see wildlife without concern of seeing injured or dead animals due to hunting or hearing shots.
I also suggest that the practice of baiting be banned both during, and after or before any hunting season. Baiting indiscriminately attracts many species; baiting poses an increased danger to non-hunters especially when the sites are unmarked and unregistered.
Crown land is held in trust for everyone - not just hunters.
Government should base bear hunt decisions on good science and on recommendations from  wildlife biologists/conservationists. And, as the government established and concluded a bear hunt pilot project in past years, the data, results and conclusions should be made easily publicly available.
Human-bear conflicts are caused by human behaviour that leaves food sources around that then attracts bears (such as garbage and birdfeeders)-in other words, hunting of bears cannot be justified using the excuse of human-bear conflict.
Of great importance is that a hunter cannot tell whether they are shooting at a smaller male bear or at a nursing female in May as cubs are too young then to forage for food with their mother-thus leaving those nursing females foraging alone, and their cubs left alone, at great risk
One further point is that using dogs to assist the hunting of bears(of other wildlife) should be banned immediately as such practice is cruel, harmful to wildlife in general, and adds even more risk to the great many residents and tourists who enjoy recreational activities in nature.

41925,/comment/41925,"RE: ERO number 019-1112
I totally oppose hunting of Black Bears, this includes killing Bears in the spring.
I need to state my point of view before I can address the bear killing issue.
First, the Earth birthed life and remains its sole support. Life subsequently  birthed humans. Thus the Earth is primary, life secondary and humans tertiary. I believe it self evident that all life is inherently valuable, and within appropriate qualifications, equal. Second, the catastrophes of climate breakdown combined with life’s collapse and biodiversity loss weigh heavily on both the Earth and my mind. We need to proceed with the utmost caution and do nothing that has even a small chance of further disrupting the natural world. In fact, much restoration is in order. The precautionary, weight of evidence, reverse onus, and do least harm principles ought to be foremost in our planning.
I totally oppose hunting of Black Bears, this includes killing Bears in the spring for the following reasons:
- This killing is just plain wrong;
- It does not appear that problem Bears are reduced by a spring killing;
- many cubs are orphaned, and left to die a miserable death;
- It is both unethical and immoral to kill a vulnerable and hungry Bear in the springtime, especially when there’s a good chance that cubs are involved. That it’s done over food baits in what amounts to a shooting gallery just makes it worse, if possible. Keep in mind, however, that, in any case, there is no right way to do a wrong thing;
- On the second page of the ERO document the nonsensical reason of providing certainty for the killers is raised. Certainty is fine: cancel the hunt.
- Despite the MNRF’s choice of words, this is a killing, not a ‘harvest’, as harvests can only occur after a sewing;
- Education has proven to be the best method of reducing Bear/human conflicts;
- Many of the Bear/human conflicts are human caused; the problems with garbage and human encroachment into the Bear’s territory come to mind;
- It is reported that in less than 50 years 12 people in Ontario were killed by dogs, while in the last hundred only four people were killed by bears (So, where’s your open season on dogs?);
- it would appear that politics and revenue not Bear science is the driver behind the push for a spring Bear kill;
- Those who love to kill things are also drivers;
- It is unethical and immoral to kill any other large game animal in the spring. The same logic applies to Bears;
- If the killing reduces populations in the Bruce, so it must also elsewhere;
- It is stated that the anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral. This is not possible as additional animals will be removed from the population;
- Black bear populations throughout Ontario may be affected by the predicted effects of climate change due to rising air temperatures and decreased precipitation. This could contribute to increasingly frequent droughts and less food for bears leading to increasing human-bear conflict and, potentially, reproductive failure in bears. Therefore humans will have to leave areas in which they’ve encroached on Bear habitat.
I totally oppose hunting of Black Bears, this includes killing Bears in the spring.

How does a hunter identify whether the bear he is targetting in his sights is a male or female?  The cubs do not hunt with the mother.

Please reconsider continuing with the spring bear hunt.  I am a scientist and see no benefit to society in purposely orphaning bear cubs.
The bears will incur a large weight loss during hibernation and will be ravenous when they emerge in the spring.  The females will be driven harder to find food due to the body composition loss from cub rearing and will be more active in searching for food.  Couple that with the practice of ""baiting"" and they become easy targets.

As a Canadian who prefers to vacation in our beautiful wild spaces within Canada and who cares deeply about our wildlife, I urge you not to extend the hunting season of black bears in the Spring.
I understand that there is already a Fall hunting season.  My family does not feel safe out in nature during hunting seasons (even where I live) and I would assume that most people feel the same way.  I would not want to hike or explore anywhere during hunting season.  Also, I am concerned that this Spring hunt could result in more cubs being orphaned and generally upsetting ecosystems.  Females with cubs must be protected, not hunted.  And since, they often forage without the cubs nearby, it is difficult for hunters to know if the bear they are hunting has a cub.
Where can the public consult your report regarding the pilot project and see the proof that the project yielded the desired results regarding human conflict with bears?  Would it not be wiser to educate the public to prevent such conflict?  Also, have you conducted any studies regarding how this Spring hunt impacts recreationalists such as myself?  This surely would have an economic impact on Ontario rural communities.

41977,/comment/41977,"I am totally opposed to implementing a regular bear hunting season.  It is particularly odious the hunting season is being proposed by an environmental arm of government whose priority should be conservation, not ""management"" which is simply an excuse to kill bears and support the bear hunting industry.  There are more jobs and sustainable economic growth in conserving.  Here are my concerns:
Hunting is inhumane because it creates a huge number of orphan cubs which usually results in the cubs' death as well.  It is usually impossible to know which females have cubs because  most often cubs are hidden while the mother forages for food.
If any hunting is permitted, change the season to June 1 - 30 to protect females with cubs and the cubs.
The public has a right to information.  It is imperative the results/evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones, of the pilot project  and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts)  need to be released to the public.
Baiting should be forbidden.  If baiting is permitted,  very stringent limits (as to length of time, place, etc.) and enforcement of those limits must be implemented to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets, etc.  from bait piles that attract wildlife.   All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.  Baits are very dangerous and, I repeat, should not be permitted.  Bear hunters represent a very small % of people using the outdoors; i.e., policy should favor recreationlists.
It is important that enforcement be improved with increased funding, infrastructure and increased number of conservation officers.  These improvements should be made public.
The use of hounds and dogs to chase, tree and otherwise terrorize bears should be immediately halted.
It is important the government acknowledge that education and enforcement of human behavior, attractants and feeding has the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict between humans and bears; and to acknowledge as well that bear hunts are not an effective solution to safety of communities and avoidance of conflict between bears and humans.
There is a need for more information to make better informed decisions and policy.  The government needs to research and report on:
a)  the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists' safety, freedom to explore and expectations.  Bear hunters represent a very small % of people using the outdoors whereas recreationalists represent the overwhelming majority of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.  Recreationalists needs must be prioritized if policy is to be rational.
b)  What are the efforts of the Ontario government to increase non-consumptive sustainable ecotourism in the province?   A federal government report many years ago showed ecotourism and other non consumptive recreation was not only more sustainable but more economically efficient (creating more jobs and more taxes) than activities such as bear hunts which destroy the natural environment, no matter how well ""managed"".  A report detailing the province's efforts to increase non consumptive ecotourism in Ontario and evaluating the benefits of those efforts is critical to making informed decisions and policy.  Taxpayers expect their provincial government to pursue the most effective and rational policies based on sound research and information.

How is a hunter to know if a female Bear has Cubs if they are too young to be at her side. I am concerned these bears will be destroyed and the pain and suffering of the Cubs is unnecessary. If the Bears need to be hunted then make it a week in the fall. Give the Cubs a chance to grow and survival. Are hunters monitored for proper hunting practices. Are the Bears destroyed by rifle or bear traps? Are bears given a fair advantage with hunters on foot versus being chased or corralled by ATVs?

42008,/comment/42008,"I am strongly opposed to making the spring bear hunt in Ontario permanent.
One argument often made in favour of bear hunting is increased human safety but there is no clear evidence for that. The truth is that the danger posed by bears is hugely exaggerated by media and by those who want to garner support for bear hunting. As a wildlife photographer who has spent many months and years with both black and grizzly bears, I know firsthand that virtually every encounter between humans and bears is benign. While the media reports extensively on the rare encounter that results in human injury, no coverage is given to the thousands and millions of encounters where bears just go about their business without bothering anyone.
In fact, baiting bears for the convenience of hunters can readily lead to increased human-bear conflict because food-conditioned bears continue to seek out sources of human food. Every conservation officer knows that the best way to be safe in bear country is to keep food and other attractants away from bears, not putting food out intentionally as is done during bear hunting in Ontario. Since the location of bait stations does not have to be publicized and since they can be placed as close as 500 m from human habitation, a person unaware of the bait could easily stumble across the bait site and find themselves in a dangerous situation.
Baiting bears and hunting bears at their most vulnerable when they have just emerged from hibernation is not even remotely congruent with the hunter concept of fair chase.
Bear hunting, especially spring bear hunting, inevitably results in far too many orphaned cubs.  In spring, mother bears emerging ravenous from having lost up to 40% of their body weight during hibernation often stash their cubs safely up a tree because the small spring cubs may not be able to keep up with her as she forages some distance away. She is unlikely to bring her cubs with her to a bait station to keep them safe from the other bears attracted by the bait.  Spring cubs are still too small to need much milk so the female's mammary glands are not obvious as they are later in the season. For all these reasons, it can be virtually impossible for a spring hunter to detect whether the bear he is killing has cubs that will be left to slowly die.
One argument in favour of the spring hunt is economic benefit. Bear viewing and photography can bring in far more revenue than bear hunting as has been shown in British Columbia. https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/wildlife-tourism-more-profita…
https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/is-b-c-s-trophy-hunt-for-grizzly-b…
Bear viewing does not require baiting and so does not food-condition bears. It is non-consumptive; the same bear can be viewed repeatedly by many ecotourists whereas a bear can only be killed by one hunter once. Ontario has much considerable for development of commercial bear viewing opportunities. https://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/13133
I do support the proposed reduction of bear hunting on the Bruce Peninsula; hunting there should be banned altogether given the declining bear population in that area.

42010,/comment/42010,"There should not be a spring bear hunt at all in Ontario. Wildlife populations are suffering due to hunting. If the purpose of the bear hunt is to encourage the moose population to grow, there should be stricter regulations on moose hunting, and not the allowance of bear hunting instead. Furthermore, bears rarely kill moose, and the blame should be placed on clear-cutting animal habitats, which reduces moose population. If the concern is about human and bear conflict, evidence clearly shows that bear attacks are rare. The government should be increasing public education about bears and how to interact with our indigenous Canadian wildlife instead of encouraging hostility towards them through hunting. If the hunt is to continue, stricter regulations should be put in place. A big concern surrounds mother bears foraging without their cubs in early spring, leading to cubs being orphaned if she is killed unaccompanied by them. This is also why hunting with dogs should be banned. Female bears with cubs should be looked after with more scrutiny, and more Conservation Officers should be hired to do so.

And what remained for those fur bearing animals who may survive the first blasts of spring? Bears are left maimed and injured, Cubs are left motherless to roam, starve and die because a governing body left strongly that their bear mother was a threat all the while sleeping in her den! If a human mother and child were targeted for such a horrendous event people would be bare arms!!! Human population control sounds absurd...but yet the people can choose to control the population of every animal native to Canada! YOU Sound like a bunch of Americans if you ask me! AND for those lucky enough that survive the spring hunt you allow hunters to BAIT the remaining bears 6 months later in the fall, at a time when they are most vulnerable as their bellies need filling for what was to be a long harsh hibernation!!! There are far more pressing issues in this world that need fixing LEAVE THE BEARS ALONE, the fall hunt season is enough to keep your so called population control in check! Think of the size of your family the next time you think population control...
The circle of life has no need for guns, rifles and or hunts....it’s human interference and control that feeds havoc and that’s what you are doing...creating HAVOC!

I am a registered hunter and it is clearly obvious to me, and many others, that hunting bears in the spring when cubs are born is unacceptable.
Regardless of regulations, mothers with cubs are regularly shot, leaving more orphans. This is an appalling tragedy which is easily fixed.

42056,/comment/42056,"I am so against the hunting of black bears in Ontario in the Spring.  The momma bears shot will mean certain death for their baby bears who may be only a few KG in weight and are stashed up high in a tree a few miles away from where she is foraging for food.  Hunters will only know they killed a momma bear after she is dead.  This is so wrong!  Also your proposed time line is too early.  Hunting should not begin in May but rather June 1st - 30th to give the babies a chance with their momma to grow and gain more weight.
I'm a dog lover and have always had dogs, but using dogs to chase a bear into a tree is cruel and should not be allowed.  She will be shot and only then discovered she is a momma bear.  It's bad enough for hunters to use bait traps and high powered rifles but the use of dogs is cruel, unnecessary and should be banned.
Also setting bait traps near residential housing is completely ridiculous.  A person who walks their dogs, would be so upset to have their dog caught in a bear trap only to watch their beloved pet die, or any other companion animal.  These should be strictly monitored and controlled miles away from residential housing.

However, in order to have good quality and quantity of hunting opportunities, regulations are a necessity. We do not need to hunt and gather for our food anymore, although a majority of hunters do eat what they kill - which is good. But hunting is now a sport, not a necessity.

42068,/comment/42068,"I strongly believe that the time has come to completely abolish the Spring and Fall bear hunts in Ontario.  If the hunt is to continue in some form then it is imperative that truly effective protection of female bears with cubs, in both Spring and Fall hunts, be implemented immediately.  If the Spring Bear Hunt continues it must be reduced to a maximum of 30 days, from June 1-30.  By this time bear cubs will be large enough to accompany their mother while foraging, which should reduce the number of females shot in error.
The Fall hunt, if it continues, must be limited to no more than 45 days, from September 15 to October 30.  All bear hunting with dogs must be banned - this is simply medieval.  If baiting is to be allowed, it must stop immediately after any Spring hunt and must be fully cleared up.  Baiting cannot begin again until 2 weeks prior to any Fall hunt, i.e. September 1 at the earliest.
There are insufficient Conservation Officers to properly manage the bear hunts and enforce the regulations i.e. the Ontario Government needs to hire more people and better educate hunters on bear sexing and habits.  People who live in bear country need to better understand bears and their behaviour.  Human/bear conflicts can be better managed by people taking good care of any waste that might attract bears.

If you can't truly protect mother bears emerging in spring with nursing cubs then the spring hunt should be abolished.  Also false and grossly misleading to say that the spring and fall hunts are  well-managed and sustainable, if no statistics on how many mother bears and their cubs are killed or die of starvation every year?  No matter climate change, deforestation, habitat loss or future environmental consequences, the Gov't and pro-hunting lobbyists are destroying our precious natural resources and wildlife for what - money and politics as usual, instead of badly needed protection and conservation efforts?   In the interim, if the spring and fall hunts are allowed to continue, however, many critical changes are needed, such as:  both hunts should only last 30 days, and baiting should only begin 2 weeks before and finish completely by the end of the month, June 30 and October 30, respectively. Hunting with dogs is a savage assault on wildlife, sport has nothing to do with it... and should be banned. No surprise then that the Ontario Gov't badly needs to hire more more enforcement and Conservation Officers.  And the only way to limit human/bear conflicts is to educate and manage people better by making them manage their waste more efficiently... and with more understanding and compassion learn to live with wildlife rather than destroy it.

Allowing hunting of Black Bears to continue, in the spring, many cubs will be left orphaned and baiting will put humans and other animals in danger.  Aside from my previous comments, not cancelling the hunt, will continue to upset, our already upset ecosystem.
Please see the below facts, about the hunt, provided by the Animal Alliance of Canada
Facts about hunting bears in the spring:
In certain areas of Ontario bears will be hunted 5.5 months of the year.
Bears hunted in the spring are vulnerable and less able to defend themselves because of weight loss during hibernation.  Most bears lose 15 to 30% of their body weight and females with newborn cubs may lose as much as 40%.
Although it was illegal to kill a mother bear with cubs, the Minister’s own staff estimated that 274 bear cubs were orphaned in the spring as a result of the hunt.  The newly introduced spring hunt also makes it illegal but hunters have a great deal of trouble determining whether the bears they kill are male or female and whether the females are nursing mothers.  This new hunt will orphan baby bears who will suffer a prolonged and agonizing death by starvation.
I urge the Progressive Conservatives of Ontario step up to the ""Progressive"" part of their namesake and stand up for the animals and the environment that we share with them, as opposed to just being concerned with the small amount of tourists that the spring Black Bear hunt brings.
Please do the right thing and cancel the hunt

42125,/comment/42125,"The Ontario Spring Bear Hunt should be abolished. According to world renowned wildlife scientists, since 1970, 2/3 of the world's wildlife has disappeared. We are not immune to this in Ontario or the rest of Canada. According to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources own website, the survival rate of bear cubs is much higher in southern Ontario. 25% die in the 1st and 2nd years, opposed to northern Ontario where 55% of cubs die in the 1st year, 75% in the 2nd year. Bears have the lowest reproduction rate of any land mammal. Many adult bears die as a result of fights, road kill, starvation, non hunting interactions with humans and sometimes sickness. The population of bears in Ontario, 75,000-100,000, has not increased since 1999. Bear diet consists mostly of nuts, berries, vegetation, insects and grubs, but if they can't find enough to satisfy their hunger, they will eat deer fawns, moose calves, spawning suckers, or any carcasses they may find. This is part of the natural food chain process. So much for the misguided premise of saving the environment or conservation. We can co-exist with bears. Many towns and people have learned to do so. The best way to reduce human/bear conflicts is to ensure people manage their waste. Bears have never been a threat to human life in Ontario. Since 1881 (139 years) only 10 people have died as a result of bear attacks. The Ontario Government absolutely needs to hire more conservation officers to enforcement hunting laws. In 2013 when the Ontario pilot spring bear hunt was proposed by the former Liberal govt., I viewed the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources website, under Enforcement. I found all the charges laid by the OMNR and convictions from 2007-2012. There were 47 individuals convicted. Many violations go undetected unless the OMNR does a blitz, because there are not enough enforcement officers. In November of 2007 they had 2 blitzes. On one blitz, in Kenora, the OMNR laid 115 charges. In the other, in Bancroft, they laid another 67 charges. These hunters were most likely convicted in 2008. Here are the reasons why 47 hunters were actually convicted. 1. Hunting while intoxicated. 2.Having open liquor in vehicles. 3. Having loaded firearms in vehicles. 4. Shooting down roads. 5. Shooting after dark. 6. Hunting in Provincial Parks. 7. Trespassing and hunting on private property. 8. Shooting from boats, ATV's and vehicles. 9. Not having a hunting licence. 10. Having an unlicensed firearm. 11. Using another hunter's seal. 12. Careless hunting (one hunter was charged with shooting another). 14. Possessing or transporting illegally killed moose or dear (out of season). 14. Illegally hunting bear. 15. Killing of a sow and her cubs. 16. Abandoning killed animals.  If the hunt is to continue other changes must also be made. It should last 30 days, June 1 to June 30. Baiting must stop after June 30 and should not resume until September 1st, 2 weeks prior to the fall hunt. Baiting should be a minimum of 2 km from the nearest residential area and garbage must be cleared after the hunt. The fall hunt should begin September 15 and end October 30. Hunting with dogs should be banned. Females with cubs must be “truly” protected during the spring hunt and the fall hunt.

   I intrinsically feel that the proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations will negatively impact the population of black bears in the area. Female bears with cubs are unprotected and are commonly mistaken for males and shot. The orphaned cubs cannot survive without a mother, so they die as well. Steps need to be taken to give mother bears and their cubs a protective barrier from hunters mistakes. If the hunting season is going to exist, it should be done ethically. The time frame of the season should be moved from May 1- June 15, to June 1- June 30. This would provide more protection for mothers and cubs.

We are proposing to reduce the bear hunting and trapping season to one-week from May 1 to May 7 in WMUs 82A, 83 and 84 (and to close the fall season) to support the long-term sustainability of the local black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula. The proposed shortened season is intended to continue to allow for a limited hunt, while reducing human-caused mortality (particularly on female bears).
Why are you even considering a hunt when you know that the bear population has been reduced in this area? Doesn't it make more sense to suspend the hunt until the population has returned to a sustainable population?
We are proposing to eliminate special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-resident immediate relatives. This would redistribute opportunities to tourism industry businesses and simplify licensing processes. Non-resident landowners or immediate relatives of Ontario residents will no longer be eligible to obtain a black bear tag and validation certificate unless they are hunting through a licensed bear operator.
In my opinion no one other than someone from Canada, either a citizen or indigenous person, should be allowed to hunt on our lands.
We are proposing to require individuals or businesses to have a ‘Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services’ to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area. This proposal is intended to improve fairness to all those offering bear hunting services by addressing the issue of persons providing black bear hunting services to residents within the same Bear Management Area where a licensed bear operator is authorized to provide services.
To have more of a sustainable business, current bear hunting services/stakeholders should be encouraged (through grants) to expand their business line to include more of an environmental/educational piece.

Females have cubs, who will most likely become orphaned if foraging mother gets killed
Orphaned cubs most likely will have no chance at the only life they are given
There should be evidence published as to the 'advantages' of black bear spring hunting [actually hunting should not have a place in modern history as food is abundant and there is really no need for hunting wild animals unless some people consider it a sport to aim from a safe place at an unsuspecting animal; I consider modern hunting a 'sport' for cowards who want to indulge in blood lust and just kill for killing's sake]
To make this spring hunting an even more cowardly 'sport', baiting and harassment of the bears and their cubs is absolutely despicable and to consider 'hunting' a cub is really an activity below the belt
Instead of hunting the black bears in spring, try to educate people regarding co-existence.  It IS possible with a little good will.  Instead of killing, try understanding wild life and the mothers' needs to protect their young-they do what natural instinct tells them to do. Something humans don't seem to grasp.

As a lifelong resident of rural northern Ontario, I have always been an opponent of this repulsive hunt as have the majority of my fellow voters, taxpayers and stakeholders in the areas impacted. This is, once again and as has always been the case, a cynical and venal effort on the part of those very few who wish to profit from the killing of bears for “sport”—outfitters and the provincial government included—at a time when sows are still caring for cubs too young to survive when their mother is killed for the sake of a handful of dirty dollars and some sickening “fun” for a few individuals, many from the U. S., who do not represent the values or traditions of Northern Ontario in any way. This hunt was stopped for good reason, backed up by science and supported by strong majority local opinion and to overturn that original ban would be to ignore both in favour a small profit for a very few individuals and more shame for the province of Ontario.

42361,/comment/42361,"Black bears are remarkable and beautiful creatures.  Just their intelligence alone is sound justification to impose an outright ban on the annual government sanctioned slaughter.  In experiments, captive black bears show that they can perform numerical tasks, including distinguishing the number of dots on an image.  This is no small feat, shared only with a handful of primates, possibly crows and ravens, and, oddly enough, honey bees.  This new research shows for the first time that bears and other animals that have been neglected by cognitive scientists may show abilities similar to species more like humans.  How the collective wisdom of a provincial government (or federal for that matter) can sanction their pointless destruction is a head-scratcher of mammoth degree.
It never fails to bemuse me that science spends billions and billions of dollars in an attempt to determine if there is life existing beyond our planet and at the same time governments allow humans to destroy it here.  If a single cell life form of the most simplistic makeup was uncovered on another planet or moon it would be one of the single most important discoveries ever uncovered.  And yet here on Earth we actively allow some segments of the population to terminate the lives of the most beautiful and complex creatures.  And for what!?  To harvest body parts and create ""medicine"" of dubious worth in an effort to comfort the aging human male's loss of virility?  To display in their homes the ""trophy"" of the body parts of a murdered exquisite animal?  How can we as a collective continue to sanction and support the archaic and barbaric practice of trophy hunting?
Come on Ontario!  Let's evolve together into a live-and-let-live mindset and instead of slaughtering these fantastic creatures, we should study and enjoy them.  As James Madison said, "" Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.""  Knowledge is dictating that humans have done enough damage to the natural world and if we continue to destroy it, it will be at our peril.

42383,/comment/42383,"Hunting black bears in Ontario, is not only is environmentally wrong and dangerous, but cruel. Spring is when many animals, including black bears, awake from hibernation. Often times with newborn cubs. When you kill a sow, her cubs are left alone, while still nursing. They will either be killed themselves, or starve to death. When a sow is approached, she will be aggressive, and will stop at nothing to protect her cubs. If you hunt these, you are entering her territory, and has has the right to attack you. Hunters will just be endangering themselves.
Many municipal areas in Ontario are working towards preventing bear encounters with humans by putting up fencing. So by saying that a mass killing will help eliminate the problem of city encounters isn't accurate, when the problem is already being fixed in a more humane action. Also, in Ontario, barbed fences are being placed to collect fur samples to do further research on the bears. This benefits us because researchers can identify why exactly the animals are entering the city, and solve the problem. By killing them, there will be less bears for potential research and problem solving.
In two years, when the pilot project ends, clearly the Ontario Federation for Angers and Hunters is going to plea to keep it forever. This will be a problem because the black bear is one of the slowest reproducing mammals. Only reproducing about 2-3 cubs in their lifetime, only when the sow is about five years old. That is, only if she feeds enough in the summertime. In addition, the species will quickly become critically endangered, thus leading to a break in the natural food chain. There will be an increase of deer, salmon, some insects (such as; yellow jackets, bees, and ants), and moose.
In many areas, such as parks, and lakefronts, bears have been accustomed to human contact. Therefore making them less afraid of humans. Though they have been known to attack, typically only slapping, causing scratches and welts. So it wouldn't be very hard for a hunter to approach a bear and shoot it. They are usually timid animals, unless threatened, teased with food, or their cubs become endangered.
So in conclusion, we can help end the spring bear hunt. It's wrong for the environment, and not fair to the bears. Hunting for their fur is just plain selfish. Plus, there are plenty of other foods to eat, you don't have to hunt and eat the bears. There are other ways or controlling the bear population, not via murder.

I am strongly against the proposal to make the bear spring hunt permanent. It would be cruel and tarnish Ontario's image for tourism.
Females with cubs must be protected. This is very difficult as cubs are often treed or kept away by their mother while she looks for food. To protect female bears and their cubs, the current season of May 1 to June 15 needs to be changed to June 1 - June 30.
Baiting should not be allowed. In addition, the use of dogs to chase and harass bears should not be allowed.
A report first needs to be created and released to the public on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety. Bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario. Also, another report should be created and released to the public on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.

I understand the need to keep the population controlled in areas where ""problem bears"" have become a nuisance and a danger, but otherwise I see no need in continuing the practice of bringing in/allowing ""big game"" hunters to come here and kill bears ""for sport"" in the aforementioned ridiculously cowardly baiting practice.  I am strongly opposed to this practice and sincerely hope my voice will be heard and my comments considered.

While The Fur-Bearers strongly oppose the spring bear hunt and believe it should be cancelled, there are issues that must be considered if it is to continue. The list below was created in conjunction with information from Bear With Us Sanctuary and Rehabilitation Centre for Bears in Ontario and Coyote Watch Canada.
Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

This rule change will have a negative impact on me.  If I was aware of this potential change I would not have purchased my property.
My career has taken me out of Ontario for few years at a time, internal company transfers or job opportunities that will change my residence status for hunting purposes.  I have returned several times and so have many hunters in my situation.  This is quite common, especially for people (25-35) trying their best to provide for their families, by doing this we become non-resident hunters by definition for the period we live outside of Ontario.
I purchased my property specifically for hunting and to ensure I meet the Non-resident hunting requirements moving forward.  This was a considerable investment.  I am a capable hunter and do not require a guide or outfitting service.
I fully support hunting outfitters, for new hunters (both resident and non-residents), and people who do not own their own land, or they want to hunt somewhere new.  However, I do not think this change will benefit people that own land or hunt with an immediate relative have already have, A) a immediate relative that is experienced, and/or B) An established place to hunt.  These two factors make using an outfitter unnecessary.  Also the closest outfitter will not be able to easily get into my camp to assist or support me.
Please do not change this hunting requirement.  You are adding a control and an extra step where it is not needed.  If non residents would like to use an outfitter they always have the option to do so, please keep it that way.

Displaced people born and raised in Ontario.

The spring bear hunt is unnecessary and outcome of it is always large number orphaned cubs that later die by starvation.
It is not true that killing bears helps manage human/bear conflicts. The best way to manage it is to make sure people take care of their own garbage and waste.
There are better ways to attract tourist to Ontario than trophy hunting.  Report should be made how bear hunt affects other recreational activities in Ontario, how  safety of other people who want to enjoy outdoors is affected by small number of hunters.

42501,/comment/42501,"Yet again, after living in Northwestern Ontario for 68 years, I am compelled to try and 'knock some sense' into my provincial government's head regarding the spring bear hunt.
This issue has been quite bipolar when it comes to reasoning, but the FACT still stand true: female bears with cubs MUST be protected. A hunter eagerly seeking a kill WILL mistake the sex of a bear, as mother bears keep cubs frequently treed, or kept away from their mother while she forages. I HAVE WITNESSED this many times over the decades. Motherless cubs dont stand a chance of survival on their own.
Baiting should never take place - again, it certainly attracts bears, especially females with treed cubs. Baiting is also a sham method of 'hunting' and the use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately deemed illegal. I HAVE WITNESSED this harassment of bears, and the damage inflicted on dogs by a self-defending bear. The whole picture is one of a complete, cruel calamity.
The spring bear hunt is nothing but a cheap, money-making, destructive resource extraction in the name of 'controlling wildlife, public safety' or to simply support a few wildlife outfitters who neverendingly bemoan their inability to wantonly reap wildlife, particularly bears. They only wish to wallow in this proposed 'economic boon'.
An argument of safety for the public is also far too lame; as since the time of my grandparents who homesteaded in the boreal, the same advice remains:  it's all about common sense with foodstuffs; make noise and leash your dog when walking in the bush; and respect the bear!
The  proposal to make the spring bear hunt a permanent raping of a very necessary resource - necessary for the hope of a continued, balanced food chain in the boreal forest - is utterly unconscionable!

42514,/comment/42514,"One bullet can kill a whole family....  Hunters have difficulties determining the sex of bears even when they use bait or hounds, are attempting to avoid shooting females and are in close proximity. Researchers themselves have difficulties determining sex, even at short distances.  Spring hunts of black bears can kill mother bears, leaving orphaned cubs to fend for themselves. Some cubs are only a few months old and still nursing or are yearlings who are still dependent for another few months. Most orphaned cubs suffer from starvation, predation or exposure.
While some wildlife managers believe that spring bear hunting is necessary to reduce the bear population and thus avoid conflicts, hunters, trappers and wildlife control agents often remove the wrong bears—they kill the individuals not involved in nuisance behaviors. Bear-resistant trash cans, hazing programs and other humane methods work better to solve problems.
Bears who come into urban areas are most frequently adult females with cubs or subadults who purposely do so to avoid aggression by other adult bears, usually males; association with people is a deliberate adaptive strategy to keep their cubs alive.
Hunting black bears is a cruel, unsustainable solution to overpopulation concerns. And with more hunters,  it will be hard to keep track of how many bears are killed. The hunt could easily spiral out of control.
Bears play an important role in the environment. ...Their diets range from ungulates (like deer or elk), small critters, insects, nuts and berries. Their role in keeping the population of ungulates controlled helps plant life stay healthy and happy by regulating the amount of biomass they eat. Happy bears mean happy trees and therefore plants and animals that rely on the trees. Bears also tend to prey on the weak or sick, leaving the remaining population healthy and strong for the next generation.
But the benefits of bears don’t stop there. Along with bigger prey, bears eat insects, helping to regulate their populations from booming and therefore over consumption in the ecosystem. Because their appetite is rounded out with berries, their scat turns into the perfect fertilizer for the new seeds of bushes to re-emerge, helping endemic plant species sustain. Their heavy bodies and roaming nature mean they break downed logs and speed up the process of decay and nutrient return to the soil.
Please cancel the hunting of this important and necessary creature.

“Black bear populations are vulnerable to over-harvest because they are a long-lived animal, reach sexual maturity relatively late in life, have a low reproductive rate that is physiologically dependent upon environmental conditions (food), and are most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females. For these reasons, their harvest must be managed carefully.”  Coupled that with the lack of proper statistics or inventory of the number of black bears in their various habitats in Ontario, adding a permanent spring season is NOT careful management but a sure recipe for future sustainability problems!!

42546,/comment/42546,"As a former bear hunter and bear hunting guide in the province of Alberta I am 100 percent Against re opening of the spring bear hunt. I have witnessed on far too many occasions when mother bears ended up being shot and killed leaving the the young spring cubs orphaned to die a slow death. You can be as carefull as you want but unfortunately this will happen. I've seen the cubs up in a tree after the sow was shot, once there was three cubs hidden in a culvert and they only showed themselves half an hour after the hunter shot the mother. Even bait stations are no guarantee. Yes they give you plenty of time to look a bear over but a smart sow or one that knows other bears are coming to the same bait station will not bring her cubs but rather leave them hidden far from the bait station. So my experience is and morally I would never again agree to a spring bear hunt. At least in the fall the cubs may be large enough to survive if they lose their mother but never in the spring. Thanks

The Spring bear hunt was previously cancelled because of issues with killing mother bears and leaving orphan cubs. Baiting in the Spring exacerbates this. Banning the hunting of mothers with young will not prevent orphan cubs, who are hidden while their mother is foraging. Furthermore, hunting bears does not reduce issues with 'nuisance bears'. I strongly oppose extending the Spring bear hunt.

We certainly don’t do this to problematic human animals, why exactly are non human animals killed because we can’t or won’t live among them? We need to find better solutions to what is often a human created problem. I grew up around bears wandering around and I never heard of anyone getting hurt or killed by those bears. Why?

42572,/comment/42572,"This is terrible -  having read the OFAH's position on the Spring Bear Hunt, listing ""adventure"" and ""an experience akin to spiritual awakening"" - I cannot say there is any compelling evidence that this hunt should be reinstated.  I am 33 years old now, and remember actively campaigning against this hunt in eighth grade. Its ban felt like a step towards a more humane culture. This new proposal feels like the opposite.
The simple fact is that bears are part of our environment as Canadians, and hunters who shoot them for sport are not in fact contributing to real efforts towards sustainability and environmentalism. You cannot say in one breath, that shooting bears is for sport and adventure, and in another, make claims that the hunt is a necessary culling event.
I support regenerative farming and even hunting of animals for food - but let's call a spade a spade here. This is armed individuals, shooting beautiful, powerful animals for the thrill of it. We are all horrified by images on social media of hunters in South Africa shooting and killing lions, cheetahs, etc, just for sport, and the Spring Bear Hunt is no different.
Surely we can recognize this for what it is and work towards other, less cruel practices to generate profit for Ontario. It is worth noting that the ""benefits of the spring bear hunt"" document produced by the OFAH focuses almost entirely on benefits for the hunters, with no regard for the fact that mother bears are frequently shot , leaving their cubs orphaned and vulnerable to the cannibal bears that the document references to (whom the OFAH also wants to hunt). Also of note is TR-28 document surveying expenditures relative to the SBH pilot takes no account of the humane treatment of the bears involved, the environmental impact of the hunt, or the impact of the hunt on the public perception of the Ontario government for reinstating the hunt.

-Baiting should not take place as it goes against the conservation golden rule which is to not feed the animals.
-If baiting is to continue , baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
-All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
-Hunting license fees should increase so as to be able to support the hiring of my conservation officers or in other words boots on the ground to monitor hunting actitivies.
-The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.

42613,/comment/42613,"Re:  ERO # 019-1112 – proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations
I am writing to you with regard to the consideration currently being given to increasing the bear hunt season in Ontario.
It is unclear why any consideration, other than an increase in permanent employment, is being provided to extending the hunt to spring as it is the time that the starving mother bear emerges with her cubs and is the most vulnerable time for these creatures.  I understand that it is illegal to hunt/shoot a mother bear or her cubs, but it happens, and if the mother is killed/mortally wounded, the cubs will die too.  Bear baiting should not be permitted:  in the spring it is an especially huge draw for a starving mother, and if it persists it becomes an easy source for the mother who will teach her cubs to go to this particular source of food, making all of them easy targets.  In addition, if bear bait is staged close to unwitting humans, it may very likely result in increased human/bear confrontation and the increased probability of bear death – all of which is unnecessary and certainly not sporting.  If bear baiting must occur, then a registry should be implemented.  I have personally come across bear bait less than 1 km from our cottage and on our walking trail (in the Parry Sound area), and it was clearly not being monitored. In addition, spring is a time that many people can actually be outside in the woods/up north, before the arrival of the black flies and mosquitoes, and the introduction of bear bait and hunters to this situation makes everything more dangerous for everyone.
I also question why dogs are permitted in this hunt.  The use of dogs increases the danger of both the dogs and the bears being hurt, certainly adds to the terror of the bears, separates mothers from their cubs, which increases the risk of bear/cub mortality, and tips the balance in favour of the hunter when, as described in the MNR’s information,  “matching…wits” during a bear hunt (Hunting Species information https://www.ontariotravel.net/en/play/hunting/hunting-species/black-bear) .
I note that the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry includes protecting Ontario’s diversity while promoting economic opportunity in the resource sector.  I believe that your black bear management background material highlights that much of the human-bear conflict that is used as a reason to support a hunt occurs due to human encroachment on bear territory.  Population growth and distribution will only increase the pressure on the bear population, which means that the need to ensure sustainability of the bears must be borne out a hunting policy that balances the need for protection of the black bar population and human economic needs and recreational pursuits.
I request that you consider a total ban on bear hunting in the spring.  If this is not deemed possible due to the need for stability of economic development, then a deferral of bear hunting until and only for the month of June should be the timing and maximum period for the reasons stated above:  not to victimize mothers and cubs, not to encourage the teaching of ill-fated feeding habits (bear bait) to the cubs, to minimize bear-human conflict which will certainly result in increased bear/bear cub mortality, and to allow the necessary weight gain that begins in earnest in July to ensure that the bear population remains healthy.  From an economic perspective, this would be a permanent seasonal employment opportunity:  one month in late spring/early summer and again for a couple of months in the fall.
The issue of conservation officers must also be considered.  There must be adequate numbers of trained ministry staff to ensure that appropriate policy is followed and that deterrents to violating the policy are provided.  Maintaining policy that reflects the ecological importance of the black bear and their vulnerability due to their respective longevity, and which supports biodiversity and economic sustainability, is a worthy use of taxpayers’ dollars.  Similarly, a broader dissemination of information about the importance of black bears, their vulnerability as mothers and cubs, especially in the spring and early summer, the rules around hunting and bear baiting, including a clear presentation of when and how black bear hunting may occur, is critical to successful black bear population management, and it is in the interests of all Ontarians to be informed and supportive of balanced policy.
I look forward to any information you may provide to my questions and ask that I be kept informed of the discussions and outcome of the review of the black bear hunting season in Ontario.

42616,/comment/42616,"Spring Black Bear Season - The Black Bear Spring Hunt is a great idea for Tourism as long as by bringing it in, it doesn't interfere with  the allocation of Form 33's.  If by bringing back the Spring Bear Hunt closes tourism to the north because of less allocations of Form 33's that we are previously allotted, then all that's being accomplished is the Closure of Tourism to Northern Ontario. The non-resident hunters bring new money to the region and support local businesses.  The non-resident hunters pay more for their hunt which includes accommodations and higher licence fees which benefits the MNRF, and provincial and federal taxes. Non-resident hunters benefit the local outfitters so they don't have to close their businesses and they bring new money and support all local businesses such as service stations, restaurants, sport stores, and grocery stores, etc. Resident hunters have all these amenities at their disposal and don't bring new money to the area. Resident hunters also hunt on BMA's while non-resident hunters are hunting and ruin the paying customer hunts so they don't return the following year.
The proposal of non-resident landowners or non-resident immediate relatives of Ontario residents having to obtain a validation certificate, benefits the licensed bear outfitter and the provincial government. It will benefit the MNRF by getting them a quicker report.
Non licensed guides should never be able to benefit from providing guiding services in Licensed Bear Management Areas.  Licensed Bear Management Areas should have first opportunities at any vacant BMA's.
Private farm land within a BMA should not be restricted. Outfitters bringing their non-resident hunters to hunt on private farm land are assisting the farmers in limiting crop damage.  By doing this for the local farmers on their BMA, the meat is being used whereas if the farmer is allowed to shoot them they can leave the carcass to  rot which is a waste of our natural resources. To benefit the MNRF, these bears would now be registered instead of not knowing how many bears have been harvested by the farmer.

Black Bear females have small litters and begin having families at the age of 6 years old. With the current killing of Black Bears this species will become extinct according to the findings of your own
OMNRF!
Trophy hunting in Ontario is now legal spring and fall to the shame of our province!

42649,/comment/42649,"Here in Northern Ontario, we never had a problem with bears, and only on rare occasions did we see any of them.  They would break into campers occasionally, or could be seen at land fill sites, but never in town.  The lodges outside of town thrived because the bear hunters were around in the spring and the fall, and made use of the lodges and restaurants.  Because the restaurants and lodges were open, people from town would also drive out there for meals or the occasional night at a lodge.  Once they cancelled the spring bear  hunt, it wasn't too long before the wilderness lodges started going out of business, and once well known restaurants closed down.  After a few years, we started having bear sightings in the town, and now, after so many years, the bears come into town and walk the streets.  Bears have been found close to schools, and no one can go out walking and feeling safe as they never know when they will run into a bear (or  more).  This absolutely shows that the bear population got out of hand when left to its own devices.  The population is large, and the food supply can't keep them fed, so they come into town.  Then, to add insult to injury,  the MNR stopped coming out to bear calls in the towns and cities.  They need to have the spring bear hunt back and KEPT GOING for all time!  The human population shouldn't have to fear for themselves and their children and pets, because bears are overrunning the streets of towns and cities.  It's now started to show a bit down south, so ""now"" finally, the  powers that be, who probably all live down south, are realizing what a threat the bears can become, if left to continue to overbreed and overpopulate.

Bears are very misunderstood. I live in Whistler BC and tourism has greatly affected the bear population here. Again, where there is money to be made some will take advantage. Deaths of female bears by hunters essentially guarantee cub deaths and limit future generations the female bear woild have nurtured. I do understand that there are times when a bear does need to be killed for human safety though that is very, very rare and usually human caused especially with black bears, such as improper garbage disposal and negative encounters which escalate as the bear will come to expect that as a food source.
I've gotten involved with a local Wildlife group to help educate visitors to the area so that they do not cause unnecessary deaths of these beautiful misunderstood animals. They peacefully live among us, sometimes without humans knowing just how close by they are. They adapt, and do all they can to avoid conflict. Once again though I will say there are exceptions though in my experience, there are very few.
I'm not against anyone truly harvesting an animal for food which they need for their family IF they do so humanely and are certain they are not taking a female away from new cubs coming from their first den.
Please do NOT allow more hunting. See above in your article, human caused bear decline (especially female bears) was noted in the one area.

42666,/comment/42666,"Dear Madame/Sir
Making changes to the wild Black Bear population by the introduction of hunting is a potentially risky business for the existing Bear population. Animal populations reach a stable threshold based upon a very tricky to predetermine set of circumstances and any artificial fluctuation in their population can result in a rapid and runaway spiral downwards as the point at which population stabilizes is a narrow window of opportunity for the entire existing population.
If the population were suddenly artificially reduced below a certain point, there is a very good chance that it could result in the population falling below the threshold that iteratively results in a stable population model over time.
With any sudden fluctuation in population, the effects upon population change over the course of years can shrink or grow before stabilizing again although if the population falls past a certain threshold, the possibility of a permanent reduction in their overall population is a very likely possibility. Playing these numbers with an animal population is a very risky proposition. Easily as risky as it would be to other animals in the biosphere if their population were to explode, which is highly unlikely as it has already settled into a cycle of stability given the fact that the rules governing hunting have not been changed for some time, therefore, there are few factors outside of their existing biome that affect their population.
Placing these Bears in the risk of sudden population decline as a result of resuming the regular hunting season could spiral out of control and potentially eradicate their population below the stability maintaining threshold leaving Ontario with far less or even no Black Bear population.
Please understand that it is very risky to play with these numbers where it involves the living nature of a population at risk.

Human interventions in ""conservation"" efforts - killing animal A to save the population of animal B - always fails because human intervention is the problem.

42681,/comment/42681,"I do not support the reintroduction of the Spring Bear Hunt for the following reasons:
While Ontario is the natural territory of black bears, it is also home to a growing population of humans and their expanding settlements, which bring them into occasional contact with those bears.
Dr. Herrero, a bear expert at the University of Calgary, reported in 2011 that bear-caused fatalities have increased largely in lockstep with the continent's human population growth and subsequent rise of recreational activities. Between 1900 and 2009, there were 63 deaths by bear attack recorded in North America, of which 44 occurred in Canada.  Improperly stored food and garbage was involved in 38% of those incidents. According to StatsCan, there were 155 homicides in Ontario during ONE YEAR in2014, with a total of 516 in Canada.  That same year, there was an estimated 115,000 black bears in Ontario, compared to 13.8-million humans. Since that time, the human population has increased again ... and again.
I would suggest the growing piles of half-eaten fast food meals and associated containers, thrown from car windows after the vehicle’s occupants have eaten their fill, pose a much bigger problem than black bears.  This form of thoughtless unintentional ‘bear baiting’ attracts bears whose acute sense of smell is attuned to food odours, and they are especially hungry after hibernation. Searching for food is a daily concern.  Instead of ‘managing’ the ‘sustainable black bear population’, it is time to manage human behaviour as it relates to the thoughtless convenience practised by the members of the ‘human tribe’ whose growing numbers and associated activities are not so sustainable, or ‘bearable’ within the context of the finite natural environment.
Ontario’s data reveal human-bear ‘occurrences’ range from sightings to contacts and fluctuate mainly according to food availability in the wild. Ill-timed frost and/or a poor berry season affect the bears’ search for food.  A spring bear hunt is not the solution.  Only in those cases where a bear shows deliberate predatory or stalking behaviour toward humans should a bear be killed.
Black bear management needs to focus on reducing human-bear conflicts by investing in coexistence education. Ontarians and tourists can safely share the landscape with black bears and other carnivores; we only need to make sure we have the resources to teach them how. Once again, re-introduce and scale up the Bear Wise Program.
Baiting bears during a HUNT can exacerbate the number of nuisance bears by teaching them that they are rewarded by following attractants laid out by people. Human attractants are a known cause of nuisance bear activity in populated areas. Bear baiting is begun well in advance of the legal hunt, and not every bear that uses the bait is killed. Since it is not legal to hunt female bears, and female bears teach their young how to forage, females that are not accidentally killed after using bait sites teach their young to take advantage of bait and other human food. Baiting only INCREASES the likelihood of bear encounters, so STOP BAITING them.
Black bear management needs to focus on reducing human-bear conflicts by investing in co-existence education. Ontarians and tourists can safely share the landscape with black bears and other carnivores; we only need to make sure we have the resources to teach them how. Once again, re-introduce and scale up the Bear Wise Program. Tourism is safer for bears and people. Examine the opportunities presented for bear-watching by operators such as 'Grizzly Bear Ranch' in B.C. https://grizzlybearranch.ca/
We have a small cottage southeast of Parry Sound, Ontario.   Occasionally, bears wander through our property, so we are careful never to leave any garbage outside.  We don’t put up bird feeders because the seeds attract bears … but a bear was shot on the veranda of one home several years ago, simply because the residents had put up a bird feeder, which was discovered by the bear.  “A fed bear is a dead bear”, as this example demonstrates.
Knowing that bears have a keen sense of smell, we store food in containers inside the cottage.  When we see a sow and her cub standing on the rocks in front of our cottage, we know this is their home.  We have a responsibility to maintain ‘their home’.  We have watched a black bear roll in the brush next to our cottage, then lie there looking up toward the sky for few minutes before wandering away. We understand they are wild animals, so we avoid them as much as they appear to avoid us, but we also realize they represent a native species which belongs here. We saw bears on different occasions until the summer of 2017.  Since that time, there have been no sightings at all, and we are concerned about their survival.
The Spring Bear Hunt results in orphaned bear cubs. There is no denying this - wildlife rehabilitators can attest that some hunters make mistakes and kill mothers with cubs even though regulations were designed to prevent this from happening.
In 1999, the Conservative government cancelled the spring bear hunt in recognition of the fact that we can't put a price on any number of cubs that starve or die of exposure after being orphaned due to government regulations. Indeed, protecting wildlife should be at the heart of any management plan or action.
Bear cubs are orphaned when females are killed.  It is too difficult for hunters to tell the difference between male and female bears, and females leave their cubs in nearby trees while they forage. Inevitably, female bears are killed in the spring bear hunt.
Orphaning cubs threatens the black bear population, which has one of the lowest reproductive rates of all species.  70% of orphaned cubs die before they reach one year of age. Female black bears do not generally start giving bear until they are 6 years old. Appeasing hunters and other special interest groups should not be the primary goal of wildlife management policy.
Around 2013 or 2014, following repeated budget cuts, the provincial Bear Wise program was no longer able to effectively engage northern communities to prevent conflict with bears in times of wild food shortages.  Re-introduce that program, please.

42725,/comment/42725,"It is disheartening to learn that the Ontario government is proposing changes to the black bear hunt that will allow it to continue, possibly indefinitely.  The spring black bear hunt was initially adopted as a 2-year pilot project in 2014, and has continued to be extended, even though there are many issues of concern and strong opposition to this hunt.  Discoveries from the 2-year pilot project have never been made public. This information must be available for public review before our government continues the black bear hunt or considers changes to it.
Of great concern is the fact that the black bear hunt has little to do with community safety and more to do with the game of hunting.  Black bears are not a threat to public safety, where there is proper education about these creatures of nature, and when people manage food waste responsibly.
If the Ontario government’s decision to continue the hunt is based on economic benefits, then it is important to prove that this decision is based on fact.  This is possible by accumulating data and providing a report, for public review, which compares the economic benefits of black bear hunting to that of other outdoor tourism activities in Ontario.  It is difficult to believe that bear hunting would be a significant driving force in Ontario's economy.  What a sad state of affairs for our province if this is the case.  If so, it's time for Ontario to begin a concerted effort to increase animal and eco-friendly tourism in our province to ensure a sustainable and healthy ecosystem.
It is also a big concern that the Ontario government is choosing to simplify reporting and licensing processes, thereby reducing government oversight of the hunts.  Baiting should be discontinued, as should the use of dogs to chase bears.  Finally, the protection of females and cubs must be a priority if Ontario is serious about respecting and protecting wildlife.

Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.   All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.
Also the government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.

In regards to the proposed bear hunting rules, to improve fairness, I am opposed to forcing non-resident landowners to be required to hunt with a licensed bear operator.  Please consider my reasons for;
1. BMA 35 has only 1 licensed bear operator in my area, who has a waiting list of at least a year in advance.  He has a limited number of validations, so the the chance of being able to reserve a spot with him is very limited.
2. The licensed bear operator is well over an hour and a half away from my cabin. We have a remote cabin, only accessible by a 3 mile boat ride, which is then followed by 60+ mile drive on a gravel road away from the licensed operator.  No one is hunting/managing the bear population near my cabin. The operator for our area offers lodging, but why would I stay somewhere else?  Since non-residents are not able to be licensed bear operators, would you consider changing this rule?  I'd consider becoming a licensed bear operator.
. As a non-resident, I've really enjoyed the bear hunting opportunities over the past few years, especially allowing me access to spring and fall hunting, and being more selective on the quality of bear to harvest.  But last years rule change, of making me pick between spring or fall, made things more difficult, and unfortunately I spent less time at the cabin and in the woods.
4. I take this privilege very serious and I'm committed to being a good steward of your resources.  My friends and I invested into your hunter safety and PALS courses too.

What is unfair???
A Ontario resident can hunt black bear without a outfitter. They can hunt black bear and not pay a dime in provincial tax. They have a reduced cost for black bear tag because they are living Ontario.
I am a Canadian citizen that currently resides outside of Ontario. I own property in Ontario and travel back for hunting every year. I pay property tax on my land every year, I pay the non resident black bear tag fee, Now you want me to pay a black bear outfitter to hunt my own property. There is not even a outfitter providing service in the area of my property.
These changes are unfair to non-resident land owners. The current rules are fair for all. A non-resident property owner is paying more overall for a single black bear tag. There is no current unfairness in the current system.
Please do not change the current rule of non-resident property owners. The land owners use there property to hunt and are pay more already to hunt there own land.

Nor should we consider a licensing system to include hunting guides. If we want to prevent a decline in hunter activity we need to promote participation from all members of society including first time hunters and those of ethnic backgrounds. Imposing a license on guides defeats the initiative to recruit interested novices and those of lesser monetary fortune.
      With Millennials more interested in after school activities and indoor video games we will see a gradual slide into a much less funded Natural Resources sector. The consequence of a limited flow of monies to conservation will end in wildlife and habitat suffering in the long run. Not to mention essential jobs to protect wildlife and and much needed conservation projects. Something we all can ill afford.

This proposal is completely unfair to land owners that purchased property in Ontario for recreation and hunting purposes. As a land owner who is paying provincial land tax on my recreational property this proposal would no longer allow me to hunt my own land. I would have to find a Outfitter that would let me hunt my own land? Are you kidding me? Property was purchased for the purpose of hunting it. I should not nor should I have to get a outfitter to hunt my own land.
Non-residents land owners are allowed one tag per pin number or other words one tag per deed of land. Why are you restricting it even more with having to get a outfitter that not even in the area. Lots of WMU property in Ontario don't have current outfitters. Private land owner in those area would not be able to get a outfitter do to the lack of one.
A non resident land owner can currently hunt the WMU where their property is located. They are allowed one tag for that owned property. These new proposed restrictions are unfair to property owners. My non resident family can not get tags for my property the owner only can pull a tag for himself to hunt.
With these proposed restrictions you are essentially removing all rights for a non-resident land owner who wishes to hunt their property. You will be requiring a private land owner to go through a outfitter to hunt their own property. This is a completely absurd and a absolute violation of the the land owner rights.
Non-resident land owners are paying property tax, non-resident fees for hunting tags, and will now be paying a outfitter for hunting their own property.  Sound like its time to go to a different province and spend money there.
This proposal is far from being fair. It is poorly laid out and completely one sided. There is no improvement to fairness. Obviously this was developed by a one sided agenda.

42825,/comment/42825,"ERO 019-1112 Spring Bear Hunt SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED
The Spring Bear Hunt results in orphaned bear cubs. Hunters make mistakes and kill mothers with cubs even though regulations were designed to prevent this from happening. Although bear hunters advocate  killing bears as a tool to reduce human-bear conflicts, the ministry's own advisory committee found that hunting doesn't have that effect. With a fall hunt already allowed, there is no justifiable need to kill bears in spring as well.
In 1999, the Conservative government cancelled the spring bear hunt in recognition that orphaned bear cubs were left to starve or die of exposure. Why make the same mistake again?
Hunters are allowed to bait bears with junk food and garbage all summer long leading up to the fall hunt. For years I have been told that garbage should be kept locked up to prevent conflict with bears. Why are hunters breaking that rule???  Surely this will lead to human-bear conflict and should be banned. At the very least, human food as bait should not be allowed to occur within 500m of trails or roads.
I oppose your proposal to reinstate the hunt permanently. I do agree that non-residents and their relatives should not be given special opportunities to hunt.
Black bear management needs to focus on reducing human-bear conflicts by investing in coexistence education. Ontarians and tourists can safely share the landscape with black bears and other carnivores; we only need to make sure we have the resources to teach them how.

If you add up the money we spend in your country during the bear season  it would outweigh the amount of money you think your outfitters will gain from eliminating tax paying Nonresidents the right to hunt on our purchased recreational land in Canada.  The reason we have purchased land in Canada is so we can enjoy the wonderful outdoor activities such as Bear, deer and Waterfowl hunting that your country has to offer, if this is taken away from us it will be an economical hit not only because of us not visiting the country but many of other Nonresidents Landowner Hunters that use these seasons to go to Canada and spend money.  The more regulations you put on Nonresident LANDOWNERS the more likely we will sell our land and find property to buy that is closer to our residents.
Please reconsider this proposal and VOTE NO for eliminating Nonresidents to hunt their own property.

42843,/comment/42843,"For the record I have hunted in Ontario for over 60 years and as an avid outdoors person find the thought of the Spring Bear Hunt unethical to say the least. Hunting over a slop pail is not hunting to my mind. The return of this hunt is not justified by the small overall financial impact on the Northern economy.
The current hunting seasons for Black Bear leaves nursing young vulnerable as the pilot project season along with the extended fall season starting Aug 15 in many WMU’s puts bears ‘under the gun or bow’ for much of their time out of the den.
The Harris Government cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt based on facts and science compiled over decades that was provided by its own research biologists.
No other game animals are hunted when they are nursing their young offspring so why would this make sense for our Black Bears.
Most hunters want to be ‘ethical’ but it is difficult to know even hunting over hung baits that a female may have stashed her cubs nearby while she comes to a bait pail. This is not hunting but rather just shooting and why  it is illegal to bait for other wildlife.
The last year of Spring Hunt there were over 200 orphaned cubs turned in to the 3 wildlife rescues in Ontario (Aspen Valley, Bear With Us & Lakeland Lodge east of Sudbury) These of course represented only a fraction of orphans.  So it is likely that hundreds of others were left to die a lingering painful death by starvation.
Apart the ethical reasons for not killing bears in the Spring many lodges and outfitters were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to refocus and transition their businesses into other areas such as Ecotourism after the hunt was cancelled. So many took the cash and want the hunt back too.
Tourists from all over the world look forward to viewing our wildlife and bears in particular as many of their countries no longer have the diversity of wildlife we have here in Ontario.
The 2003 Nuisance Bear Committee having a broad membership including hunters and tourist operators definitively agreed that the Spring Hunt had little or no impact on the amount of so called nuisance bear activity in Ontario.
The OFAH where I ended a 30 year plus membership over this issue has used the new credo of Fake News to try to convince the government and Ontarians that a return of the hunt would be a good thing for Ontario.

I agree with the elimination of special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-resident immediate relatives. While limiting licensed Ontario Bear Hunting Service providers to ensure population management levels- these special opportunities should not exist.
Ontario's Bear Management Areas and the License to provide bear hunting services should apply to not only those providing outfitting services to Non-resident hunters but also those providing outfitting services to Resident Hunters. The BMA System, set up to appropriately manage population levels, should not be changed but expanded to include all hunters(resident & non-resident) utilizing bear hunting services. The fact that only Bear Hunting Service providers wishing to outfit Non-resident hunters was the only commercial tourism business requiring licensing and Crown Land fees was extremely unfair. Anyone wishing to utilize and operate a Bear Outfitting service should require a License to Provide Bear Hunting Services and hold a Bear Management Area with the appropriate population management planning.
My last comment is: this Management Area planning and License to Provide Hunting services should also be applied to Deer hunting service providers in the NW. The fact that for over 20 years the MNRF has allowed unregulated/unlicensed outfitting, over harvest and every imaginable abuse of outfitting/hunting privilege for the most sought after North American Big Game Animal- Whitetail Deer, is dumbfounding.

Please consider the following rational, and please continue to allow non-resident Ontario landowners to hunt bear without an Ontario Outfitter.
1. The Bear population inside the BMU which I own land and hunt is very healthy. This BMU has no Ontario outfitters. To my knowledge there is only one Ontario resident that hunts bear in this BMU. Disallowing me to hunt within the BMU which I own land will have ZERO impact to the Ontario bear population but will negatively impact the Ontario economy, as i will likely no longer bear hunt in Ontario due to this change
2. The Ontario bear harvest by non-Ontario resident landowners is insignificant and has no impact on the health of the Ontario bear population.
3. There is a positive economic impact to Ontario by allowing non-resident landowners to hunt bear without a Outfitter:
  A. Property taxes paid to Ontario
  B. Non-Resident license fees paid to Ontario
  C. Every year friends accompany me to Ontario to bear hunt. These friends hunt with, and pay a local Ontario Outfitter to hunt in his designated BMU (not the same BMU that I own property, and am allowed to hunt). I will likely discontinue bear hunting in Ontario if the proposed change go through and I will no longer bring friends to hunt bear in Ontario. The Outfitter they utilize will suffer financially due to this change. THIS ISSUE IS SIGNIFICANT, PLEASE HIGHLIGHT WHEN MAKING YOUR FINAL DECISION.
  D. Significant money is spent in Ontario each year by myself as a non-residence landowner, and by the friends that accompany to me to hunt bear inside Ontario.  This includes gas, groceries, alcohol, and various other items. This will cease if the proposed change is approved.
I see no rational for the proposed change and do not believe this is a change that needs to be made. It will not have a positive impact to Ontario, to the bear population, or to Ontario's Outfitters.
Ontario is an awesome place to own land. I strive to be a good steward of the land and have been pleased to support Ontario economically.

It is not like a 100-years ago when human population was at manageable numbers and natural wildlife was at healthy numbers as well.  Please consider banning hunting for bears as well as all wildlife!

I purchased 400 acres about seven years ago. Spent $100,000 CN in the local Economy building a camp on that property. Pay tax’s on that property and developed land. Helped repair road and pay for road repairs that are forest roads owned by the MNR filling all the proper paper work with the MNR. Continue to support the local economy with purchases of gas, groceries, insurance, non- resident fishing and bear tags, hired local contractors for repairs.
I receive to trash service. No road maintenance no fire service no emergency services for the tax’s payed.
I’m allowed currently to file for one non-resident special bear tag that only the property owner can use.
I’m allowed to hunt in the WMU where my property is located only. I hunt my own property.
You want me to now pay for a outfitter to hunt my own land. This is a completely unfair proposal obviously developed by someone that wants more money.
I continue to contribute to the local economy but if this goes through those days are over.
This is not a fair proposal and to label it as such is a scam. Did you even notify all non resident land owner or just the ones that applied for a bear tag. I’m willing to bet you did not. Non-resident land owners that don’t hunt would not even approve of this

I am a Canadian Citizen and landowner in the Town of Bruce Mines.      This provision seems to go against the intentions of the revisions as it will negatively affect the tourism industry, as simply put, if this change to the regulation is made, my relatives, friend and I won't come to the region to hunt.   Each year we travel to the region, pay for multiple nights of lodging to hotel and camp ground operators, buy groceries, buy meals at the local restaurants, and purchase gas and other supplies.
Further, we are all landowners in the area and pay taxes into the local communities.  If we are forced to use a guide, we will choose to hunt elsewhere, and will likely sell our properties.  This will in turn depress land value and reduce the tax roles of the communities.
We recognize the value of guides to the hunting community and seek to avoid conflict with the guiding industry.  As such we make every effort to structure our hunts to have minimal impact to their activities and livelihood.   We do this primarily by hunting mid-week on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
Lastly, if we are forced to take our tourism dollars elsewhere, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will also lose the non-resident license and tag fees that we pay each year.

42941,/comment/42941,"I had some additional thoughts regarding my opposition to the proposed change of no longer allowing non-residents landowners/tax payers the ability to bear hunt.
Bear hunting is so much more than just harvesting a bear.  It truly is a labor of love.  I enjoy the entire process; of getting bait, scouting, hauling bait, establishing a bait site, checking cameras, setting stands, etc.  When I hunt, I want to do it my way.  Having to go through a guide services eliminates all this fun for me.
Plus, their is not a guide within at least a 90 minute commute from my remote cabin.  When I take vacation time from work, I want to be at my remote cabin, not at a guides cabin/room with other unfamiliar hunters & guides.
Finally, hiring a guide service is just not within my financial budget or desire.  I won't spend $1,500+ extra fees (recovery, meat processing, freezer storage, gas, boat, etc.) to hunt a bear with strangers in an unfamiliar location.
The idea of just showing up, at a baited site & stand, by someone else, who has had other hunter(s) sitting there the week or two before, just is not how I will bear hunt.  I simply would not buy a bear license or hire a guide (economic impact) if this proposed change takes place, which means one less hunter managing the bear population, which also impacts the moose, deer, etc. population (environmental impact.)
In closing, please do not take away the privilege to allow non-resident landowners to get their own validation certificate to hunt bears.  Thank you for your consideration.

- The ""Proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations"" are supposed to be based on evidence regarding the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts). This evidence needs to be released to the public prior to the adoption of the proposed regulations.
-  Females with cubs must be “truly” protected during the spring hunt and the fall hunt
- Females with young cubs forage for food while the cubs wait for mom on a tree. Thus, females with cubs are shot and the cubs are orphaned. Those kills are can never be reported accurately.
- The current season runs from May 1 to June 30. It should be changed to Jun1 1 to June 30, when the cubs are old enough to forage with mom---this will ensure the protection of females who have cubs and the cubs themselves
- Baiting should be banned; if it is allowed, then
     - baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season
    -  more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
    - Baiting should be a minimum of 2 km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after hunt
    - All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
- Thne Ontario Government should increase its enforcement capabilities through funding, infrastructure, and hiring more Conservation Officers---and it should report to the public on such efforts and expenditures.
- The government originally stated in 2014 that a spring bear hunt is about community safety. However, the government´s own evidence demonstrates that the spring beear hunt has no impact on human conflict with bears. What really mitigates and prevents human-bear conflicts is education and enforcement of human behavior, attractants and feeding (such as bird feeders and garbage). Thus, the government should publicly state the fact that the current spring bear hunt is not about public safety but about yielding to the hunting industry and profiting from the hunt.
- Bear hunters represent a very small percentage of people who enjoy recreational activities in the Ontario wilderness. Yet, our safety, freedom to explore and expectations are impacted by that small minority. Our government should create and release the impact of the spring bear hunt on our safety, freedom to explore and expectations.
- I believe that Ontario would benefit more from non-consumptive ecotourism than from consumptive ones. Our government should create more non-consumptive ecotourism activities and create and release a report on them.
- Our government should immediately ban the use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears

I recognize that the Bruce area bear population faces manage challenges from humans, and does not need any stress put on it. Also, animals are unpredictable, and in the spring mothers are often separated from cubs for times, and the risk of killing a mother bear accidentally is too great to allow a hunt. A spring bear hunt would result in orphan cubs starving and dying, as well as potential for orphan to seek out food and interact with people, creating another risk. There is not genuine need for a spring hunt, only a desire, and the risks to human-animal interactions and the bear population health, and thus ecosystem health is too great. There are other ways to increase tourism spending and economic activity, without a spring bear hunt. Perhaps developing more wildlife viewing tours, making some changes to other hunts, etc. Killing more key species at a sensitive and important time of year is not the way to increase tourism or economic development when other options are available.

- Organizing festivals is a proven method of attracting tourists to any region.
- Increasing tourist accommodations in areas like Tobermory could also be an alternative, as this area is notoriously difficult to find accommodation in during the summer - people want to visit, but campsites and hotels get booked up extremely fast due to low supply and high demand.
While my examples require more investment than opening up a bear hunting season (which would theoretically be free), the number of tourists these methods would attract would be far greater, and create far more economic benefit.
The proposal already states concern surrounding the black bear population in the Bruce Peninsula. Why would we hurt the population further when there are much more effective ways to drive tourism to the region, without killing anything?

As a property owner I pay over $1000.00/yr on property taxes which supports your local communities. In addition I've taken an old neglected farm and spent thousands of dollars in improvements on the home plus reworked the neglected fields. We have dedicated over 9 acres to wildlife food plots for which deer, bear and all other wildlife feed on a daily bases. In addition to over 20 acres now being farmed by locals. The cost to maintain food plot fields is well over $1000/yr. We purchase food, supplies as well as dinning out on weekends when we visit though out the summer. This in addition to the $225/each for licenses. We have seen absolutely no decline in bear or deer population if anything the numbers are thriving. We shoot only mature bear and deer. The age of bear taken is over 12 years old. The deer are at least 4 years old.

1. BMA 35 has only 1 licensed bear operator in my relative area, who has a waiting list of at least a year in advance. He has a limited number of validations, so the the chance of being able to reserve a spot with him is very limited.
2. The licensed bear operator is well over an hour and a half away from my cabin. We have a remote cabin, only accessible by a 3 mile boat ride, which is then followed by 60+ mile drive on a gravel road away from the licensed operator. No one is hunting/managing the bear population near my cabin. The operator for our area offers lodging, but why would I stay somewhere else? Since non-residents are not able to be licensed bear operators, would you consider changing this rule? I'd consider becoming a licensed bear operator.
3. As a non-resident, I've really enjoyed the bear hunting opportunities over the past couple of years, especially allowing me access to spring and fall hunting, and being more selective on the quality of bear to harvest. But last years rule change, of making me pick between spring or fall, made things more difficult, and unfortunately I spent less time at the cabin and in the woods.
4. I take this privilege very serious and I'm committed to being a good steward of your resources. My friends and I invested into your hunter safety and PALS courses too.
5. I've been coming to Canada for nearly 25 years to enjoy your wilderness opportunities. Being able to bear hunt is one of the reasons I chose to buy a new property in Canada last summer, and I paid over $40,000 in HST last year to purchase the new cabin.
I really enjoy my time in the Canadian wilderness, and the privileges you share with non-resident landowners (tax payers.)
I spend thousands of dollars in Canada on licenses, bait, gas, meals, hotels, etc. on multiple trips every year. I just don't see how this is a good economical/business idea to try to improve fairness.

43014,/comment/43014,"The Harris Government cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt based on facts and science compiled over decades that was provided by its own research biologists.
  No other game animals are hunted when they are nursing their young offspring so why would this make sense for our Black Bears.
  Most hunters want to be ‘ethical’ but it is difficult to know even hunting over hung baits that a female may have stashed her cubs nearby while she comes to a bait pail. This is not hunting but rather just shooting and why  it is illegal to bait for other wildlife.
  The last year of Spring Hunt there were over 200 orphaned cubs turned in to the 3 wildlife rescues in Ontario (Aspen Valley, Bear With Us & Lakeland Lodge east of Sudbury) These of course represented only a fraction of orphans.  So it is likely that hundreds of others were left to die a lingering painful death by starvation.
  Apart the ethical reasons for not killing bears in the Spring many lodges and outfitters were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to refocus and transition their businesses into other areas such as Ecotourism after the hunt was cancelled. So many took the cash and want the hunt back too.
  Tourists from all over the world look forward to viewing our wildlife and bears in particular as many of their countries no longer have the diversity of wildlife we have here in Ontario.
 The 2003 Nuisance Bear Committee having a broad membership including hunters and tourist operators definitively agreed that the Spring Hunt had little or no impact on the amount of so called nuisance bear activity in Ontario.
  The OFAH has used the new credo of Fake News to try to convince the government and Ontarians that a return of the hunt would be a good thing for Ontario.

Science has proven that these are sentient beings - not objects for us to kill, torment and torture. Public sentiment is turning against this type of treatment of all animals. It is time for this province to join the 21st century and to take a proactive and progressive leadership role in protecting wildlife.  Instead it wants to appease hunters by making the Spring bear hunt permanent. I say an emphatic NO to the hunt.
Additionally -
In order to prevent poaching, cruelty to animals and illegally hunting, the Ontario Government needs to hire more people for enforcement, this province needs more Conservation Officers.
Bears (a few individuals) do occasionally prey on moose calves but this is “not"" common.
The best way to reduce human/bear conflicts is to manage people by making them manage their food waste.
Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
If you have to continue with hunting bears
The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
Baiting must end (how is this fair?!) I guess there is not fair in life especially that of animals just trying to exist while humans infringe constantly on their territory and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
There should be strong deterrents and heavy fines for infractions and breaking laws regarding wildlife. This includes types of bait, traps, poaching, cruelty etc.
The Government must consider the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.

43025,/comment/43025,"We are deeply concerned by the intention to proceed with expanding the spring bear hunt without any evaluation of the two pilot projects initiated since 2014.  The purpose of a pilot project is to test and evaluate an idea, and provide insight and data before proceeding at a larger scale.  It is alarming that the government would propose extending the spring bear hunt without having conducted, and made publicly available to Ontarians, a thorough review and evaluation of the 2- year pilot project from 2014-2016, and at least some analysis of the initial results from the 2016-2020 pilot project.
The Ministry assured Ontarians in 2016 that the extension of initial  pilot project would provide additional data with which to assess the impacts of the spring black bear hunting season and help inform long-term black bear management activities.  This has not been done.  Consequently, there is no biological or socio-economic basis for the decision to expand the spring hunt, raising questions about the sustainability and socio-economic impact of such a decision.
There is, however, a great deal of evidence linking a spring bear hunt with an increase in orphaned bear cubs, and  Ontario cancelled the annual spring hunt for black bears in 1999 in response to concerns from Ministry biologists over orphaned cubs starving to death.   The Conservative government at that time acted appropriately and decided "" ….to move to end the spring bear hunt because [our government] will not tolerate cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly shooting mother bears in the spring"" (John Snobelen, Minister of Natural Resources, 19 January 1999).
The two pilot projects to date have produced no monitoring of the impacts of the hunt on the bear population or the survival of cubs, and there is no evidence to suggest that anything has changed since 1999. A spring hunt will kill nursing females and their cubs will be left to die of exposure, starvation and predation.
The sustainability of the black bear population is dependent on the survival of female bears and their cubs. Indeed, the hunting of most species is prohibited while their young are still dependent. This principle is understood by many Ontario hunters who refuse to hunt black bears in the spring because they respect the relationship between mother and cub and leave them alone to raise their families. A spring bear hunt is unethical because it is widely considered unacceptable to bait bears as they emerge from hibernation, and it always results in young cubs being abandoned and left to starve in the woods.
Bear rescue groups are reporting an increase in the number of cubs being rescued, and a study by Ministry staff in 2008 reported that the practice of suspending bear bait, which theoretically should help hunters better identify a lactating female, failed due to the inability (or impatience) of hunters to positively identify the sex of a bear before shooting.
The proposed expansion of the spring bear hunt is unethical and unsupported by science. Without a robust evaluation of the two pilot projects, there is nothing to suggest it the proposed hunt will be biologically sustainable or economically viable.
We do appreciate that – unlike your Liberal predecessors – the current government is not misleading Ontarians by suggesting a spring hunt will reduce human-bear conflicts.
However, without an evaluation of the pilot projects there remain serious concerns about the unethical  orphaning of dependent bear cubs, and the government of Ontario’s commitment to science-based wildlife management.

Those who have done their research know that hunting for ""population control"" is a myth, and that the populations are deliberately increased to promote hunting and to sell hunting permits.

43027,/comment/43027,"Issues regarding the proposal to eliminate special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-resident immediate relatives.
The true undermining issue is here that the government has failed to eliminate individuals from splitting property up into different ownership.
Example:  A group of non-residents buy a 20 by four foot lot and then split that lot into four different lots creating four different deeds allowing four people to hunt a whole WMU.
Example: A individual buys a one acre parcel and then split it into four properties and other friend, family’s members buying those new divided property allowing four people now to get special bear hunting tags to hunt in that WMU.
Here are some solutions that could fix the issue without causing unfair treatment to non-resident land owners.
A solution to this problem is limiting non-resident to only hunting their own land.
Another solution is to only allowing property to be split so many times and non-resident can still hunt the WMU where their property is located. This eliminates having a property split creating multiple deeds.
Another parameter that could be put into place is limiting size of property that would qualify for a special bear tag. Example Property with 10 acres or more qualify for a special bear tag.
Another example would be only allowing a property under a certain size to be split so many times.
Other problems in your proposal:
It’s not a fair proposal to non-resident land owners that don’t take advantage of the lope poles.
It’s benefitting one party only the outfitters causing an unfair advantage.
It’s unfair to non-residents that hunt their own property only.
It’s unfair to non-residents that hunt in WMU where outfitters have not developed their area.
There are areas that outfitters have that do not use there outfitting license. Because it’s too far for them to travel and handle the outfitting.
This proposal could easily be made fair to all parties involved. I understand that outfitters would be mad by a group of non-resident land owners hunting in a WMU that only own a sliver of land and it split ten way to Sunday. This is absolutely unfair.
 It also unfair to the non-resident land owner that does not take advantage of the lope pole and gets their one tag for his property. A solution to this problem is easier that just taking the right away from a non-resident land owner and making them pay extra to hunt in a WMU where there property is located.

43033,/comment/43033,"I feel that the spring bear hunt needs to be abolished.  The government must make an effort to acknowledge that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014, and align their views with its own pilot study showing that it does nothing to reduce human conflict with bears.  Proper behaviour by recreationists and hunters alike - and its enforcement - will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing such conflict.  Specifically, baiting should not take place; if it continues, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season. Additionally, more stringent limits must be put in place to protect other visitors and wildlife from any potential harm stemming from this practice.  All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.  Baiting should not be permitted within a 2 kilometer radius from the nearest inhabitant or residential area, and all refuse must be cleared after the hunt.  If the spring hunt is to continue, changes must be made to its term.  It should last only 30 days, from June 1st to June 30th in order to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.  Although bears do occasionally prey on moose calves, this is not habitual.  Baiting must stop after June 30th and not begin again until September 1st, or 2 weeks prior to the fall hunt.  The fall bear hunt would then begin September 15th and end October 30th throughout the province.  Bear hunters going out in the spring make up a very small percentage of the people enjoying the outdoors during the same period.  The Ontario government would need to hire more people for enforcing such initiatives, and this implies that the province needs more Conservation Officers in general.  The best way to truly reduce the possibility of human/bear conflict is to manage people by ensuring their capacity to manage their own waste.

Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
·        The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
·        Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
·        Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
·        Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
·        The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
·        A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
·        A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
·        The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.
The government must implement a more conducive process, to make it a WIN/win situation in Ontario.

We have to be aware how we influence into the nature and wildlife system. If we want to have control over wildlife in nature, we should look to protect it instead of leading wildife into extinction. Just one important example:
Authors Garrity and Christensen (2020) in their published article described one of the important reasons for extinction of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park and how they are being forced into less secure habitat where they are often shot and killed. The authors stated: “We have tens of millions of cattle in America but we only have about 700 grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Yet an October 2019 decision by the Bridger-Teton National Forest’s Pinedale District authorizes continued cattle grazing on 267 square miles of public lands that will result in the deaths of an estimated 72 grizzly bears in the Upper Green River and Gros Ventre River drainages on the southern border of Yellowstone National Park”. The authors provided with information that grizzly populations in Yellowstone may suffer inbreeding, which could lead to the extinction of the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s distinct grizzly population. Illegal lake trout introduction in Yellowstone National Park has significantly reduced populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, a traditional high-value grizzly food source. Add to that the drastic die-off of whitebark pines due to global warming, which has significantly reduced production of their seeds which are another high nutrition traditional food source for the bears.
Let's us think before we make another step!

I was told by a bear hunting lodge owner that the majority of hunters cannot tell the difference between male and female bears.  Even though it was a financial loss for him, he was opposed to the spring bear hunt because of the likely occurrence of cubs being left in the woods to starve to death.
The livelihood of a handful of hunting lodges does not outweigh the kind of suffering that this hunt would perpetrate on the cubs.  Our wildlife is already facing challenges from climate change and adverse effects of development.  We should be thinking of ways to protect our wildlife and wild places instead of destroying them further.
If this proposal goes through, is the Provincial Government or the bear hunting lodges ready to fund the two years of costs of caring for the orphaned cubs that are lucky enough to find their way to a rehabilitation centre like ""Bear with Us""?

43101,/comment/43101,"I was very concerned, once again, when I read about the announcement concerning permanently reinstating the Spring bear hunt. In 1999 the spring bear hunt was finally cancelled. The hunt was cancelled to protect bear cubs from being orphaned when their mothers were accidentally and /or illegally killed.
In 2013, the spring bear hunt was reintroduced as an experiment ostensibly to reduce human-bear conflict.  However, the government’s own science showed that human-bear conflict had nothing to do with the spring hunt. In reality, the number of nuisance bear interactions increased when wild food crops, like berries and nuts, were not readily available due to drought or other poor environmental conditions.
The decision to permanently implement a spring bear hunt by our Minister of Natural Resources must be impartial and based on sound, evidence based, scientific data which would be applied to every other species were it not considered as “profitable”. Appeasing hunters and other special interest groups should not be the primary goal of wildlife management policy.
  
Arguments against the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt:
Hunting bears in the spring does not reduce human-bear conflict.  The government should heed the results of their own science and appointed committees. Complaints do not reflect the number of nuisance bears in the population. The number of bears that were in conflict with humans and which were consequently trapped did not increase following the cancellation of the spring bear hunt in 1999.  The number of complaints about nuisance bears that occurred after the spring bear hunt was cancelled, was due to local controversy and an increased reporting effort.
It is difficult for hunters, even seasoned bear hunters, to tell the difference between male and female bears from a distance, and females leave their cubs in nearby trees while they forage. Inevitably, female bears are killed in the spring bear hunt.
Orphaning cubs threatens the black bear population, which has one of the lowest reproductive rates of all species. Female black bears do not generally start reproducing until they are 6 years old. 70% of orphaned cubs die before they reach one year of age. Black bear cubs stay with the females for protection and to learn how to forage for approximately two years. Killing the female also eliminates that generation of dependant cubs which cannot survive, or over winter on their own.
Arguments against bear baiting:
Baiting bears can increase the number of nuisance bears. Human attractants are a known cause of nuisance bear activity in populated areas. Bear baiting is begun well in advance of the legal hunt. Female bears teach their young how to forage, females that are not accidentally killed after using bait sites teach their young to take advantage of bait and other human food.
Females with cubs are more susceptible to being attracted by bait because they emerge from the den in Spring in poor body condition relative to other bears.
It can be difficult to identify and therefore avoid killing females around bait piles because mother bears stow their vulnerable cubs in trees while they forage.
Baiting bears goes against the notion of “fair chase” – there is nothing ethical or culturally significant about luring bears and shooting them from blinds as they consume unnatural food. 
 
General Recommendations (Preferred):
Immediate closure of the spring bear hunt and immediate ban on all bear baiting.
Proper consideration of evidence based science when making management decisions, instead of politically based motives that only provide the economic evidence in support of the decision.
To reduce human/bear conflicts by supporting programs which teach people to manage their waste
 
Alternative To Preferred Recommendations:
If the hunt is to continue, thereby ignoring current science and research which does not support reestablishing the spring bear hunt, in order to appease a political base as demonstrated by the explosion of “business opportunities” for multiple hunting organizations in Ontario, here are my recommendations. :
The Spring Bear hunt should last no more than 30 days, from June 1 to June 30.
Baiting must stop after June 30 and not to resume again until Sept 1st, two weeks prior to the Fall Hunt.
Baiting should be a minimum of 2km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after the hunt.
Fall Hunt should begin Sept 15 and end October 30 throughout the Province.
Hunting with dogs must be strictly Prohibited.
Female bears with cubs must be actively protected during the Spring AND Fall Hunt.
The Ontario government must hire additional Conservation Officers for enforcement of the above recommendations.
The decision to allow a Spring Hunt must be reviewed annually, considering evidence based science confirming the population is healthy and not driven purely by economic interests. Consultations must include First Nations, scientists and conservationists and not simply relying on the “science” provided by vested interests.
Having the Minister of Natural Resources, as stated by his own words, be more concerned about tourism, those hunting industries that support small business in northern and rural Ontario, forming committees such as the BGMAC to “improve big game management in Ontario”, read support for the above groups, and not look to maintaining the health and longevity of all species supporting the ecosystem in Ontario, including the “profitable” ones, is not what was intended for this Ministry. Economic development and business opportunities for Ontarians belong to other government ministries.
""We are listening to the concerns of northern Ontarians and the tourism industry that an ongoing pilot spring season creates economic uncertainty,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""A regular, monitored spring bear hunting season would enable tourism outfitters and camp owners to better plan their operations for the entire year, while also allowing hunters to better plan their activities and support local businesses.""
Premier, the Minister of Natural Resources has a remit that includes the protection of all of our natural resources. It seems like a reasonable expectation that this would consider the need for long-term sustainability in preference to lobby pressure by those who wish to profit in the short-term. In other words, I would expect your accountability to all Ontarians as Premier and the responsibility of the Minister of Natural Resources require that the Ministry take a long view, and base this decision regarding when to allow a bear hunt on sound proven evidence-based scientific principles. This would also ensure those interested parties with an economic interest in hunting bears have a hunt to “profit” from well into the future.

It is inhumane and the policy was based on erroneous information perpetuating myths about black bears.  Policies should be based on sound scientific facts and not by lobby groups who have ulterior motives such as hunters. The season suggested (May 1 to June 15) falls directly during the time that female bears are foraging for their young cubs who are often deliberately hidden from danger up to a kilometre away. Imagine the cruel and deadly fate of the cubs if the mother gets shot by a hunter who wrongly claims that the bear is not a mother simply to justify their actions. As well, while I am not bear expert, I have done some reading about the subject and have noted that more protection of these female bears is required during the hunting season in the fall. This can be accomplished by hiring more conservation officers.  I have also read that it is rare that bears prey on moose calves.  Moreover, any conflicts with humans (and this goes for any wild predatory animals) originate with food and waste. If residents are mindful not to throw food waste out in the open, this reduces the chances of urbanizing wild animals. As well, baiting of bears  should be forbidden - this is completely inhumane and causes lots of collateral damage.  Should it be impossible to abolish this hunt, I ask that the time frame be deferred to a later month (June) to protect the cubs.

Ontario has lots of tourism options and the industry should benefit from appreciating our wildlife, not killing them.
The government should be protecting bears and our biodiversity. Listen to your constituency!

I agree with your proposals and hope that the government will ignore the false allegations and unsubstantiated scientific claims  of radical animal rights groups and continue on course with good practice and sound animal science. Hunting over bait for Bears is good practice that will allow hunters time to determine sex so that Sows with or without cubs will be protected. Bear hunting in Ontario is our only means of population management.

43187,/comment/43187,"I think it is cruel and unnecessary to allow a spring bear hunt, when female bears are raising and nursing cubs.  Although the proposed law makes it illegal to shoot female bears with cubs, mistakes will happen and cubs will be orphaned and most will starve to death. Fines after the fact do nothing to address this type of cruelty.   In addition, MNRF likely doesn't have resources to appropriately police this.
Bear population numbers can be managed during a more humane hunting season instead of the spring when bears are weak from hibernation and raising young.  What other animals are hunted in the spring when they have young?
I understand that companies in the north running hunting businesses rely on the income from hunters, but perhaps they can offer photographic tour opportunities and other tourist options in the spring?  As humans, we have the ability to think about our actions and consequences and we need to be better stewards of nature.  We are also creative and able to diversify methods of generating income.
Please reconsider this legislation that permits heartless and cruel treatment of animals.

43189,/comment/43189,"In response to the proposal “to implement a regular spring black bear season, shorten the Bruce Peninsula black bear hunting season”, we wish to make the following comments for your consideration and immediate action.
Scientific studies by Parks Canada and Dr. Martyn Obbard (formerly with MNRF) indicate that the black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula is in decline, with only 100 to 316 bears remaining. The black bears on the Bruce Peninsula are in danger of extinction within the next fifty years. These studies also show that the Bruce Peninsula black bears are an isolated population, genetically different from other Ontario black bears and are the only black bears in North America that use crevices for denning. The black bear population is at considerable risk due to its “isolation and a high rate of human-caused mortality”.  [Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry]
This small and isolated population of black bears should be fully protected by a complete ban on bear hunting on the Bruce Peninsula.
Please take all necessary steps to ensure a complete ban of bear hunting on the Bruce Peninsula.

Re the fall hunt:  I understand that cubs stay with their mothers for a year - so are not young bears
being killed in the fall hunt??  And no matter the skill of the hunters, I am sure a spring hunt means
the - perhaps unintentional - killing of females with young cubs.  Another more incidental comment

Females are out in the spring, forging for food and their young are left helpless, awaiting their return. If a female is killed by accident, the bear population is in jeopardy. If a bear hunt must happen, then have it open in the fall, not the spring.
",comments-83.json
43206,/comment/43206,"I am extremely opposed to the spring bear hunt, and especially against making it permanent.  Please say 'no' to the spring bear hunt for the following reasons:
As an MNRF-certified wildlife rehabber, I am aware of the fact that black bears are NOT part of the reason the moose population in Ontario is declining, contrary to what the hunting/trapping industry would have people think.  Bears are mainly vegetarian, although they will occasionally eat meat, they do not hunt moose.  Wolves do, but even wolves are not excessive moose predators - the real reason moose in Ontario are declining is from humans over-hunting them and habitat loss.
Yet hunting organizations are not prepared to realistically address the problem by curtailing the moose hunt, they instead misinform the public into thinking it's because of bears and wolves.  They disseminate misinformation aimed at fear-mongering and then suggest 'harvesting' bears and wolves is the fix.  Mother nature does a very good job of balancing species populations; we experience problems when humans interfere too much.  And now we're about to interfere even further by decimating the bear population?!
May 1st is too early to hunt bears.  Mothers give birth to their cubs in early January.  They come out of hibernation to forage for food, leaving their young cubs in trees, often as far as a km or two away, because they're too young to follow. Current legislation requires the cubs to be present with the mother, if they're not, hunters can kill her.  Most hunters can't or won't discern if it's a lactating female and many will just shoot anyway in the 'thrill (or fear) of the moment', resulting in orphaned cubs that will die slowly of starvation or predation when their mother doesn't return.  Thus this hunt does not even take into account the realistic actual habits of a mother bear and her cubs' daily existence.
Some hunters use dogs.  Dogs cannot differentiate male/female/nursing female, they will chase any bear.  Again, hunters will not recognize a nursing mother and the cubs will not likely be present.  More orphans.
To make matters worse, current legislation has NO regulations specifying where hunters can bait - bear baiting can be set up close to homes and near towns.  THIS is what attracts bears, bringing them closer to human habitation that would not occur if baiting regs did not allow for such close proximity.  This results in human/bear conflict yet the hunting organizations resist change to these regulations because it serves their purpose by causing the very situation they then can use as a scare tactic to support the need for a spring and fall bear hunt.
Scientific study shows the spring bear hunt does NOT reduce bear/human conflict, it actually exacerbates it!  The spring bear hunt WILL NOT increase public safety.  Changing the baiting regulations to deny baiting near human habitation will, and ceasing the spring bear hunt will too.
Another element related to this is that the government and hunting organizations want to clear more land to create more roads into the wild spaces (more habitat loss).  Hunting organizations want this access for their industry and the bear hunt is an excuse to make this so.  As an Ontarian who loves our wilderness and the species we share them with, I do not want habitat and species destroyed just because one group, hunters/trappers, want it.  We share the land and one group should not get to have such a substantial impact on precious wildlife and habitat, eroding the already limited protections a great many Ontarians desperately want to remain in place (that should actually be increased before its too late, not removed).
The past 16 years' bear hunt needs to be curtailed and regulations need to be improved because the state of the world and our little piece of it here in Ontario is rapidly being destroyed due to climate change, pollution, human over-population, habitat destruction, and yes, over-hunting.  We need to protect what is left.  A spring (and fall) bear hunt is not conducive to this.
No to the spring bear hunt.  Instead, re-implement the Bear Wise Program in its former full-scale version, let's educate and protect instead of fear and destroy.

43228,/comment/43228,"The Spring Bear Hunt should be abolished. Females with cubs must be “truly” protected and The only way to do that is to not have a spring bear hunt. Since females frequently “tree” their cubs while they forage, it would be impossible for hunters to know whether they are shooting a female with cubs or not.
Orphaned bear cubs have no chance of survival without their mothers. It seems to be unnecessary and cruel. Our actions should be to do no harm to our Ontario wildlife.
In addition, the use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.
For fall hunts, baiting should be a minimum of 2 km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after hunt. Fall hunt should begin September 15 and end October 30throughout Province.
Best way to reduce human/bear conflicts is to manage people by making them manage their waste.
Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.

For the past 20+ years he has bought a bear license and used HIS land that HE pays taxes on to enjoy his passion for black bear hunting. Your new proposal would take that opportunity away from him. Part of the reason he bought the land was to hunt black bears. Where we live, he cannot hunt black bears every year. So he would be paying taxes on land he is unable to use due to his new proposal.

I can understand not letting nonresidents purchase a tag if they are using crown land without guide services. But for a nonresident who pays taxes, they should be able to use their land!

Schad thought this hunt was an atrocity leaving bear cubs orphaned and unable to care for themselves, or before they learnt behavior from their mothers how to find food.  These cubs made MORE interaction with humans as they tried to find food sources.
In this age when wildlife is in peril all over the world, this hunt is especially pernicious.  We need our bears ALIVE and healthy NOT shot for some peoples limited agendas.  These bears are NOT the property of the people in their area.  The bears were already there.  People moved in!
ALL people enjoy going to and vacationing in the natural environment in their areas. Lodges and camps with associated small business service opportunities, field guides etc. would benefit ALL Ontarians and not just the limited few in the hunting circle.
These days people are into living with and in their lands choosing wildlife to watch and enjoy.

Why do we seek to kill wildlife when they do nothing to us, and even if they come to our backyards to look through garbage, but they don't come with the intention of killing us. Hunting for any length of time is wrong because mama bears could be hunted at a time when they are needed to raise their young. Leaving young cubs at the mercy of other wild animals or even worse, humans, is a despicable form of cruelty. I do not support any time given to hunting, and call for a complete eradication of hunting for bears. The spring bear hunt should be canceled in favour of letting the bears LIVE.

3)You are proposing updates to improve fairness, ---- to who------, certainly not to the bears who are sentient beings, just like you!!!  Do you think it is a fair fight???
4)There is no need in the 21st century for ANYONE to be hunting. All of us, excluding native people, do not need fur, meat or trophies from an animal. Alternatives are available to all of us.
People who enjoy hunting are either narcissists (people who only care only about themselves) or people with low self esteem (feel the need to overpower or kill to make themselves  feel more important.)

43310,/comment/43310,"The spring bear hunt should be permanently cancelled. We're in the midst of a global climate emergency. It's irresponsible and misleading to leave climate change science out of the conversation about Black Bears. We need to err on the side of caution with wildlife policies. A recent study found that eastern Canada will see a 200% to 300% increase in 'fire weather'. Look at Australia. No one thought that their wildlife and wild spaces could be decimated in such a short time.  Regarding bear predation of moose calves, again, we have to look at the effects of climate change on moose. Warmer winters mean more ticks. From what I’ve read in the news, the ticks are more of an issue for moose than bears are.  Also, according to a 2017 study, for every 1°C that minimum winter temperatures rise, bears hibernate for six days fewer. This means that they wake earlier to the food scarcity they’re hibernating to avoid, and turn to human food waste as an option for survival. These are just a few of the ways climate change is affecting wildlife. There’s a lot we don’t understand. I’m sure many others have commented on the innate cruelty of hunters leaving orphaned cubs alone to die. Since sow bears leave their young alone while they forage, it is nearly impossible for hunters to tell males from females.  I live in Sudbury, and during years without a good wild blueberry crop, it’s obvious that we need to be serious about managing people to manage our food waste. That has been  proven as the only way to minimize human/bear conflicts. Also, during poor blueberry years, it’s obvious that the government needs to hire more Conservation Officers, as dealing with bears in the cities creates problems for the police, when it’s really an MNRF issue. During good berry years – like 2019 – there were very few human/bear conflicts. The Government must also consider the impact of the spring bear hunt on other people's safety, as other people are out enjoying the wilderness at that time. Bears are not “nuisances” nor are their bodies a “product” to buy and sell. They are a vital part of our ecosystem here in Ontario, and it’s high time we started to treat them with the respect they deserve.

43321,/comment/43321,"RE:  Ontario Spring Bear Hunt  ERO # 019-1112
To Whom This Concerns,
As a resident of Ontario I am forwarding my comments and opinions regarding an issue that I am strongly against.
The Spring Bear Hunt is about to start shortly and it has no place in the year 2020, in Ontario!  This hunt should not be extended, but rather abolished.
This is a cruel and heartless sport that government supports because pro-hunting organizations have spread incorrect information and blatant lies to benefit themselves and enable hunting of bears.  Hunters aim to make people afraid and hateful of bears in order to enable them to continue hunting and killing.
Hunters will have people believe that bears are dangerous with regards to people.  If there are human and bear conflicts, in most cases it's because of food products left carelessly that attracts the bears. Better management of people's food waste should be enforced.
Bear and moose conflict is another fallacy.  Bears are primarily vegetarian and are not responsible for the decline of moose.  Again, over-hunting by people is the major reason of this species decline.
Bear hunting in early spring ie, May is putting the baby cubs at risk because the female bear will hide her young in order to forage for food.  Sometimes, these females will travel quite far from their young.  How is a hunter to determine whether the bear he aims at is a regular bear or one with young cubs waiting for her return?  They can't.  That is why so many bears are killed and the young are left to die a slow and painful death of starvation.
Dogs are often used to chase bears.  How do dogs determine whether a bear is a female, with cubs?  They don't.  They are simply trained to chase bears...Any bears.
In this day and age of climate change and species decline, we as a country who are blessed with our beautiful vast lands and precious wildlife should be doing everything possible in order to save our animals.  Nature will provide balance of species. Humans do not need to cull any species.
I think that you realize that if most Ontarians were polled, they would be against the Bear Hunt.  Unfortunately, I am part of the Silent Majority.  Pro-Hunting groups are well organized and vocal while fighting for their unjust cause.  I implore that my government who represents the will of the people, do the right thing and STOP the Bear Hunt.

* If the spring bear hunt is to continue (and I do not agree with it at all), it should last only 30 days, from June 1 to June 30. This will help protect females with cubs which are often up in a tree and not with their mother while she forages.
* Baiting must not be done at all - why habituate bears to eating food provided by humans?  It will only tempt them to move into residential areas, led by the smell of garbage and human/bear interactions will occur with potentially disastrous consequences for both.
* The Ontario Government needs to hire more Conservation Officers to enforce the rules.         Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
*  The government needs to acknowledge that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014.  Their own evidence shows that attractants provided by humans (such as smelly garbage) and deliberate feeding cause the bears to become used to humans and this sometimes leads to conflicts.
* Hounds/dogs should not be used to chase, tree or harass bears.

I feel that by taking this privilege away from me someone broke the deal we made back in 2008 when I was told I could hunt. I made a large investment in your country, I always pay my taxes on time, I spend money all the while I'm in Canada and the word fairness was mentioned in the proposal so this does not sound fair to me.

43361,/comment/43361,"Reinstating the full spring black bear hunt in my opinion is evidently a must. Predation is a major impact with moose populations. I have noticed a direct inverse correlation between moose populations in Northwestern Ontario and that of bear populations over the last 20 years of hunting and living in the outdoors. Before, in my area, in WMU 13, bear populations were down, and moose populations, in my outdoor experience were thriving. We seen many. Slowly after the spring bear hunt was cancelled, year over year moose populations (sightings in our case) started to decrease and have ever since. Now black bears are seen everywhere and these high populations are most likely in my opinion, profoundly destructive to calf survival. Also, in congruence with this, is the fact that reinstating the spring bear hunt will bring a tremendous uplift to the outdoor economy and local businesses in the area and also bring many great hunting experiences to people who love to hunt and harvest black bears throughout spring and fall seasons.

43377,/comment/43377,"I am a federal environmental scientist. I am well aware of all of the aspects of implementing the spring bear hunt again. I am 100% against it. Bears are left without their mothers - cubs need their mothers until ~16 months of age- meaning killing a mother in the spring ultimately will also be a death sentence for her cubs. Hunters kill females as it is difficult to tell the sex of a bear from afar, and the mother and cubs are not always close together. Male bears only emerge ~2 weeks before females - so a spring hunt means both sexes are available to hunters. Nuisance bears are often not the ones taken in the spring hunt, and this does not solve that problem. Nuisance bears are created by the public- better education and enforcement will help to mitigate that issue. Please do not reinstate the spring bear hunt.

43389,/comment/43389,"The Spring Bear Hunt should be cancelled. There is no way to ensure a mother with cubs will not be shot as she would tree her cubs before foraging, and these cubs would be left to die, unable to fend for themselves. On January 15, 1999, The Minister of Natural Resources the Honourable John Snobelen announced an end to the spring bear hunt.  The Minister’s press release stated, “The government made the decision to move to end the spring bear hunt because it will not tolerate cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly shooting mother bears in the spring.” Bears are most vulnerable in the spring as they must recover from the effects of hibernation, why would we allow hunters to prey on them? While this may gain votes in a few ridings, it will surely lose votes in many others.
I have had the opportunity to study with the foremost expert on the North American black bear, Dr. Lynn Rogers, who also wrote the hunting regulations for Minnesota. Based on his expertise, the hunting season lasts for 6 weeks, in the fall only, and shooting bears in dens is prohibited. This allows for the population to reproduce, without inhumanely allowing cubs to die.
Rather than open the season on September 3rd, why not open it the Tuesday FOLLOWING Labour Day, so that hikers and campers will not be in danger as they enjoy the holiday weekend? In fact, in a province that uses the slogan ""A place to grow"" why are we not focussing on wildlife tourism as a way to boost the economy, rather than inviting non-resident sport hunters to our mutually owned public lands?

43395,/comment/43395,"To the government of Ontario and whomever it concerns: This comment is to urge an end to the practice of hunting bears in Ontario during the spring season, certainly not to expand it.
POLITICAL CONSIDERATION:
I cannot know if the Premier honestly thinks that by implementing bear hunting proposals outlined in ERO  Number 019-1112 it will decrease human-bear conflict situations (other than by producing a net decrease in the net population size of the American black bear in the regions affected) or if he believes that there is more support than opposition to the proposal in those regions that will translate into votes at the next election.  According to news reports that same Premier has been surprised at negative responses he has received at public events.  I believe that negativity stems from the fact that such a large percentage of the electorate are both weary and wary of reactionary pandering to a “base” that is not interested in or adept at analytical consideration of the results of policies based on gut instinct or simplistic reasoning, and not based in fact and experience.
There is a psychological phenomenon, well studied, that shows an ability to think that saying something makes it true.  The government is claiming that the hunt is expected to be “neutral to positive”, but there are no data in support of the contention.  If that claim is true, it negates any assertion that continuing the spring hunt with the changes proposed will address concerns by those fearful that there are “too many” bears, or who think that in some way the spring hunt will prevent human-bear conflicts (see below).
The reasons given for the proposal all have to do with assistance to those, Ontarian or not, who wish to kill bears, making it “fairer” by expanding the number of people allowed to do so in the spring, with no concern for the effect on bears themselves, particularly cubs that are to be orphaned or bear populations under threat, and no effort to address human-bear conflict concerns.
Short of eliminating the species, contrary to the government’s own conservation mandate, perfect assurance that no bear will ever harm any human can never be given.
Reducing absolute numbers of bears might, in and of itself, reduce the statistical probability of such an encounter – the rarer an animal is the less often it is encountered on average – but the material supportive of the proposal claims (albeit without evidence provided) that no such reduction is envisioned.  Such a reduction would not, at any rate, serve the interests of those outfitters and hunters who have lobbied for the expansion of the spring hunt, nor those of us who enjoy the landscape in the absence of a desire or need to kill bears.
The impression is given that the government assumes that anyone opposing the proposal is a Bambi-loving urbanite in a major city in southern Ontario who has rarely if ever seen a wild bear and does not appreciate their degree of threat; while everyone living in near bear habitat is afraid of bears, at risk, and will be grateful that their numbers are reduced and wills somehow be less likely to have a negative direct or indirect encounter with a bear if non-Ontarians are allowed to kill them in the spring.  It is this kind of simplistic and divisive thinking that, I assert, turns people off politics and frustrates those of us, a majority in Ontario, who prefer fact-based policy decisions to ad hominin arguments, or the implication that knowledge-based policy is “elitist”, thus discreditable.
FEMALE BEAR PROTECTION:
In reading the comments of those favoring the proposal, the assertion is often made that the females are to be protected, thus no such problem can exist.  But the government’s own research indicates otherwise, as does the experience of those involved in bear rescue and rehabilitation efforts.
Bear trapping cannot be sexually selective to any significant degree.  Bear shooting can obviously be significantly more sexually selective, but as I am sure the Premier and the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry must both know by now, not all bears are correctly identified as to gender by hunters.  I am sure many commentators have already mentioned the 2008 study, published in Ursus, and co-authored by MNRF own bear researchers, that even when using suspended baits that force the bear to stand, thus potentially allowing sex to be determined visually, hunters make mistakes.
Certainly if the government is sincere in not wanting female bears shot “accidentally” by hunters, suspended baits are a must, but in order to be most effective in allowing the hunter to determine the sex of a bear, the hunter must not fire until after the bear has stood up in circumstances that allow visual examination of the underside.  A side or back view does not work and the 2008 study shows that hunters, usually eager and excited (as I can attest from personal observation) are not always patient enough to wait until a firm identification, possible only under good viewing conditions, of the bear’s sex has been made.  The study indicated more research with a larger sample size is needed on this issue, and I would argue it should not only be done in the event if the spring bear hunt continues, but published, not suppressed.
SAFETY:
I express this last concern because I have been told my MNRF staff on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation that previously (nothing to do with the current government) a study on hunter marksmanship a government funded study that demonstrated a high potential for wounding was suppressed because the results countered the popular narrative that Ontario hunters are skilled marksmen.  And with regard to all research I strongly urge that all government policy, not only MNRF, be fact-based and experience-driven.
Because I did, in the 1960s, hold a hunter safety permit myself, following appropriate training, I am also have another concern.  Ontario hunters do need to exhibit a modicum of basic knowledge of gun safety.  Hunters from many western European jurisdiction get far more vigorous training both in gun safety and animal biology and comparative anatomy.  However, in the United States there is often very little such need for training in gun safety in order to own guns or obtain hunting permits, and as a result we see an increased number of hunter-caused “accidents” in the United States compared to Ontario, whereby innocent people are shot.
While I understand the economic motive of wanting to allow American hunters in our forests it increases the risks of those of us who want it to be safer to enter the forests in the spring for any of a suite of reasons.  Speaking personally, as a naturalist I love to visit what is viable black bear habitat in central Ontario in the spring and fall, but do not do so in the fall except in places where, or at times when, hunting with rifles or bows and crossbows is not allowed.  I have marginally less concern about shotguns but avoid marshes when and where waterfowl hunting is allowed not out of safety concerns (although I have been showered by spent pellets and had loaded guns pointed at me) but because they are largely devoid of wildlife and I find the killing of non-targeted species depressing to witness.
While any part of central Ontario (and a few parts of northern Ontario) may see significant use by tourists, safety is of special concern in such areas, and on the Bruce Peninsula it augments conservation concerns addressed below in giving reason to eliminate bear hunting and trapping from that region.  It is heavily used at all times of year by campers and hikers, naturalists, photographers and other tourists.
Please do not continue to ignore the interests and safety of the majority of us who wish to see, but not hurt, our native wildlife.
THE BRUCE PENINSULA AND CONSERVATION
It is odd that “research” is used selectively in the proposal being discussed to the degree that it is admitted that “research indicates that there has been a decline in bear numbers…” due to anthropogenic causes on the Bruce Peninsula, and that the population is “genetically isolated”.  The Bruce population is “insular” in the sense that it is ecologically the same as an island population, and a long, sad history of wildlife extermination teaches us that island populations are the most vulnerable to extinction.   I congratulate the government for any reduction in bear killing in that region, but for both conservation and human safety reasons there should be no spring or fall removal of bears from this region.  Apart from safety issues, unless or until we know that the population is rebounding any take makes a mockery of any claims of wise management, good stewardship or conservation.  For those wishing to kill bears there are opportunities nearby, and for those concerned about income, there are many tourist-serving potentials for income in this region at all times of year, most assuredly including the proposed spring bear hunt season.
We know that organisms can pass through a “genetic bottleneck” whereby a very small population contains quite limited genetic diversity which mitigates against selective adaptation that can be vital to species survival, especially in times of change, even if numbers of the species rebound.  In spite of this government’s cavalier view on climate change, such change is happening, trigging cascades of interlocking events too complex to be easily modeled, leaving no way to know just what black bears on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula will be experiencing in terms of future survival rates.  All that can be said for certain is the ability to adapt is a function of the very genetic diversity that hunting and trapping reduces.
HUMAN-BEAR WILDLIFE CONFLICT:
I am particularly concerned that the general public may be encouraged to believe, as many seem to, that in some way hunting bears in spring will reduce or eliminate risks to public safety posed by the presence of bears.   Short of extirpating the species, the potential for encounters dangerous to people always exist, but other than reducing numbers absolutely, the changes to current regulations will do nothing to help people who live in or visit bear habitat – most of Ontario – to more safely co-exist with native fauna, including bears.
Shooting bears, especially if, as the government seems to be claiming, does not alter the things people do that encourage the statistical likelihood of behavior that increases the likelihood of a risky bear encounter.  Indeed, provision of bait will almost certainly exacerbate that situation by habituating surviving bears to the idea of human-sourced food.
Shooting bears does not prevent people from putting organic garbage out in plastic bags, or overnight or long before pickup; does not prevent people from hiking with dogs off-leash or without knowledge of how to chase a bear with bear spray, shaking a plastic bag or other tried and true strategies; does not prevent use of bird feeders after bears have awakened from hibernation; does not encourage use of bear-proof garbage containers by restaurants and other sources of edible garbage; does not encourage campers to store food outside of tents and out of easy reach by bears; does not teach people bear behavior; does not alter the timing of emergence of berries and other food whose presence or absence influences bear behavior and in fact does nothing to really help people with that concern.
ETHICAL CONCERNS:
The spring bear hunt was ended in 1999, by the Conservative government under the leadership of then Premier Mike Harris for two reasons.  One, it was alleged by many, if not proven, that in a critical by-election a significant amount of financial support would go into an effort to defeat the Conservative candidate if the spring hunt, long an issue of concern because of the orphaning of bear cubs, was not stopped.  What is known with certitude is that then Minister of Natural Resources (now Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry), John Snobelen made the decision “…to move to end the spring bear hunt because [our government] will not tolerate cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly shooting mother bears in the spring.”
There can be no doubt Snobelan was sincere in his belief since he has repeated that concern after leaving politics.   Hunting is an inherently cruel sport since wounding is inevitable.  In a casual search while writing this response I can find no data on wounding rates from hunting bears, which at any rate is a function of a multitude of variable factors such as hunter skill, type of weapon used, and reporting truthfulness.  For other species of hunted wildlife overall, it would seem to average around thirty percent, but if bear hunting is restricted to being done only by use of hanging bait it should be very low, possibly even approaching zero.
But there is no doubt that spring hunting leaves an unknowable percentage of cubs orphaned.  The concern this generates is value-dependent.  There are people who care deeply about the suffering and deaths of those cubs that are still dependent on their mothers, and there are those who are not at all concerned.  Philosophers and ethicists cannot apply objectively determined value to such concern or lack thereof.  It may be that it is wrong to be concerned about the suffering of another individual, either of one’s own species, or another.  However, decisions based on such a value system would, in light of the anthropogenic pressure being placed on the natural world, given human dependence on biodiversity and ecological integrity, indicate that such attitude is counterproductive to human interest.
In Ontario I find no reason not to believe that the simple majority of us oppose such gratuitous cruelty to any species with a well-developed, cognitive brain and nervous system and subsequent ability to suffer.  Without getting into detail I urge abandonment of spring bear hunting on humanitarian grounds.
These humanitarian concerns overlap environmental concerns with regard use of dogs.  Inevitably when dogs are used to track and find, chase and corner (tree) game (as opposed to simply detecting and/or retrieving) some are lost, even though sophisticated electronic tracking is used.  The chased animal is greatly stressed and individual dogs may be injured. These dogs are hazardous to other wildlife species and those who escape will suffer themselves if not found and rescued.   According to what I have been told by people who work in them, dog shelters and pounds experience spikes in the retrieval of stray “sporting” breed dogs whenever there is dog-based chase hunting of bears allowed.  While Ontario hunters are less likely to employ dogs, it is a favoured hunting method of Americans and should not be allowed.
CONCLUSION:
It strikes me as bizarre that on one hand politicians and political parties decry citizen cynicism and apathy, and on the other, feed it by their actions.  Case in point would be the use of public comment on decisions already made, especially when there are majority governments unburdened by the risk of a vote of non-confidence by opposing parties.  If one does not take the time to provide thoughtful comment, it can be claimed that the public was indifferent to the policy.  If one does take the time, it can be said that there was “wide public consultation” or that “all stakeholders” were heard from.  Opposition is easily dismissed as “uninformed”.
Nevertheless, we live in an age when well over ninety percent of mammal biomass now consists entirely of humans and animals domesticated for human use.  We have to do better; we have to learn to co-exist with wildlife and appreciate what is left.  For these reasons I urge an end to the spring bear hunt once and for all.

Governmental  support for sport hunting might gain votes in some ridings, but will  surely lose voters’ support in other ridings of Ontario.
A  modern province can develop a better tourism plan than inviting  non-resident sport hunters who enjoy killing wildlife, animals who have  little hope of escape, onto our mutually owned public lands. Ontario’s  forests belong to all of us, not just to the businesses that profit from  violence against wild animals.

43406,/comment/43406,"Black bears have the lowest rate of reproduction of any land mammal in North America and reach sexual maturity late in life. Most females cannot produce cubs every second year, may do so every 3-4 years, but also can take up to 8 years.  In Ontario, depending on the region, 25-55% of cubs die in their 1st year and about 20-25% die in their 2nd year. Mortality rates in cubs are due to starvation, predation by other animals, falls from trees and road kill. Mortality rates in adult bears (over 2 years) are due to hunting, other human related conflicts, starvation, road kill and fights with larger bears. Very few bears die of disease.
For these reasons Ontario bears are vulnerable to over-harvest and must be managed carefully.
In 1999, the spring open season was cancelled by the previous Liberal govt. to address concerns about the potential orphaning of cubs during the spring, a time when they are very dependent. Cubs stay with their mother's until they are 17-18 months old. At that time the provincial estimated population of black bears was 75,000-100,000.
In April 1999, the status of black bears was assessed by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). At that time black bears in Ontario were listed provincially as ’Not at Risk’ on the Species at Risk in Ontario List (SARO). That was 21 years ago. According to world renowned wildlife specialists, since 1970 (50 years), 66% of the world's wildlife has disappeared. Ontario is not immune to this. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the spring bear hunt should be stopped, until the COSSARO can reassess the status of bears in Ontario.
Public opinion about black bears has changed in the past several decades, due to increasing awareness of the bear’s ecological role and an increased appreciation for the intrinsic value of the species. Black bears are recognized as an integral part of natural ecosystems. A landscape that can support the habitat requirements of bears can support a variety of other plant and animal species. Black bears are omnivores,  the bulk of their diet is plant material, but they also consume some animal protein through scavenging and predation on insects, mammals and fish.
There are many thousands of interactions between bears and humans in Ontario on an annual basis, without conflict. Black bears are one of the most intelligent mammals, try to avoid humans and will often even resort to nocturnalism to do so. Since 1881 (139 years) only 10 people in Ontario have died as a result of bear attacks.

It was the Harris government, a CONSERVATIVE government which had banned the spring bear hunt primarily because there is an inherent risk in this hunt of killing sows whose bear cubs could become orphaned and left to die of starvation, which would be VERY IRRESPONSIBLE AND CRUEL.

I am very strongly against this spring bear hunt. I am all for there being an outright ban on this matter once and for all.
First off, black bears are omnivores, which means their diets consists mostly of vegetation, and barely any meat at all. They are opportunistic, meaning if there is a carcass to feed off of they will. It is uncommon and rare, that a black bear will take down a moose calf.
Bears are not responsible for the decline in our Moose population; habitat destruction, development, and not putting a moratorium on hunting are responsible.
Secondly, the best way to reduce human/bear conflicts is STILL to manage people by making them manage their food waste. This also means doing a MUCH better job of enforcing this. Increase fines for those with issues with managing their garbage etc. Bears are NOT the problem; people are. Ontario needs more Conservation Officers!
Thirdly, females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages for food.
Please tell me what hunter, or any other person for that matter, can tell the difference between a female bear and a male bear? Do you understand just how much suffering and trauma that leaves bear cubs to endure?
It is quite enough that they have to go through this in the Fall, not the Spring too!
Lastly, is this Government considering the impact a spring bear hunt will have on other recreationalists’ safety, and our freedom to explore our beautiful province without fear of being shot? I for one do NOT want Ontario open to Trophy Hunters from all over.
This is a truly barbaric and appalling proposal that needs to stop dead in its tracks.

43581,/comment/43581,"I am very concerned that the Ont. gov. is proposing to make the temporary spring black bear hunt permanent. It is my understanding that there are only approximately 100,000 black bears in Ont. That is a not a large number of animals! Years ago, the spring black bear hunt was banned because hunters are unable to distinguish between male and nursing female bears. Females will often hide their cubs when they perceive danger. As a result, hunters have inadvertently shot and killed many mother black bears, rendering the very young orphaned cubs helpless without their moms. This is extremely cruel and is not necessary. And that is why the spring hunt was originally banned. Any kind of justification of a permanent spring hunt based on so- called ""economic"" reasons is not a valid justification for this cruel practice.  As a result, I am appealing to the provincial gov. to ban the spring bear hunt altogether.

""More males (72%) than females (20%) were killed outside the study area. The major effects of hunting were to reduce population size and lower the mean age of captured males. The prolonged period of maturation for black bears in Ontario, and the increased vulnerability of adult females, with increased hunting pressure emphasized the need for conservative provincial harvest quotas.""

""In every case, communities understandably took tentative steps in the begin- ning of their policy formulation process concerning nuisance bears. These tentative steps were evaluated and in most cases were judged unsatisfactory, which eventually lead to accepting the need for bear-proof garbage containers requiring added expense and change in human behavior. In most cases the policy formulation process was lengthy, from 10–25 years. In all cases, the policy initially in- cluded attempts to apply averse-conditioning to discourage nuisance behavior by the bears. Only in Mammoth Lakes has the practice been consistently sustained over the long-term.
In all cases, a combination of constituency forces increased public aware- ness of the problem, leading to the collective conclusion that there was a critical level of conflict, a human responsibility for the conflict, and a need for collective action to solve the problem. This awareness lead to policy formulation that was refined until a satisfactory resolution of the problem was achieved. This process
reflects a classic normative activation model in which it is acknowledged that people will not change behavior unless they recognize the consequences of their collective action on valued resources in a specific situation (Schwartz, 1977; Zinn, Manfredo, Vaske, & Wittman, 1998)""

43618,/comment/43618,"I most certainly favour the continuation of the spring bear season.  Aside from population management, the lack of hunting pressure during the 20 year spring closure, reinforced an extreme lack of fear in many bears I have had the pleasure if seeing near our cottage in NW Ontario.
A lack of fear in bears often translates to their own morality because of conflicts with humans.  I have seen this MANY times as a former Wildlife Biologist, Park Superintendent and Big Game Outfitter.  You may want examples beyond my first hand experiences?  Consider last fall's mauling of Winnipeg man
attacked a few miles NE of Clearwater Bay, Lake of the Woods.  I hunted bear there two years ago and the bears exhibited zero fear of being hunted.  Last summer, a neighbour cottager, was trying to find
someone to shoot a bear that had taken over her quest cabin and then entered the main cottage.  No help from MNR because of limited staffing and the difficulty of bringing a culvert trap to an island.  Ontario's backcountry is vast and often difficult to access.  MNR and OPP staff does not have the human resources to look into every bear complaint.  Hunting pressure can work wonders to reduce conflict.
Black bears are hardly endangered in Ontario.  For the anti's out there, some food for thought is this.
Grizzly Bear are considered an Endangered Species in the lower 48 States.  Normally ES are not hunted however in an effort to ""protect"" the species, Montana has a very limited hunt designed to create maximum pressure and fear in the bears to reduce human conflict.  The annual harvest of two bears off-sets the mortality that would otherwise occur if the animals had more human interaction.  I am a graduate of U of Montana and recall the research well.
I have a ""bone of contention"" with your plan to exclude non-resident Landowners from hunting to prop-up the tourist industry.  It would make too much sense to ask your outfitting community to run a business based on merit and value.  Instead they would prefer to have it mandated to use their services.  I was raised in rural Ontario and worked for MNR in every corner of the province but ended up becoming a very successful Alberta Outfitter.  I missed Ontario and purchased a family cottage on Lake of the Woods.  So I don't mind paying many multiples for the license that can only be used spring or fall not both.  I pay taxes to support the schools, roads, etc.  I expect that more tax money comes into the Kenora economy by the non-Ontario residents in that part of the province.  So now you want to pander to the guiding lobbyist and treat us the same as someone from Chicago?  Thanks a lot.  I wish I had known when I was helping put out the big fire of 1980.  The best way to manage resources is to have an excellent relationship with the local public.  This is a kick in the teeth by the tourist operators and is short sighted.
Last point has to do with baiting.  The jury is out on the effects of sugar on the bears.  I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to consider that it is likely not healthy for bears nor humans.  Bears are not stupid so we do not want to habituate them to eating human food and be surprised if they have conflicts with humans/food.  Bait should be limited to grain, meat scrapes form inspected domestic animals and skinned beaver.  Maybe fish could be included but there could be some enforcement issues as to type of fish and source.  Baiting has issues but it is fairly necessary for bow hunters and it will decrease the likelihood of a sow with cubs being taken.
That's my 2 cents.  Hope this isn't my last year hunting bear (I normally never shoot anymore cause I have set my sights to something unrealistic to obtain.....happens when you get old).

43681,/comment/43681,"There is no good reason to reinstate the spring bear hunt. Residents of northern Ontario who hunt for food have always done this in the fall. Most of those who participate in the spring hunt come from elsewhere, and they use the services of local outfitters, some of whom engage in the questionable practice of bear baiting -- attracting bears with stinky food to places where hunters lie in wait for them (what kind of sport is that?). Many of these ""hunters"" are unable to differentiate between male and female bears, so nursing females are illegally killed alongside the males, resulting in the inevitable death of their cubs.
   We read the old argument that a spring bear hunt is necessary to prevent a rise in dangerous bear-human contact. I propose a counter-argument: even with bear baiting, not all the bears attracted will be killed. The more bears are attracted to human foods like those set out to attract them at baiting stations, the more they are likely to become problem animals.
  A far more likely cause of any problem with human-bear contact is the acute and ongoing deforestation and loss of habitat of all forest-dwelling wildlife, which forces bears into places they shouldn't be. I implore the government to rethink its plans to expand areas available to logging companies, and as well to oversee much more closely all of their operations. So much habitat has already been completely lost, or compromised so badly that it cannot support normal biodiversity.
  Science does not support the return of the spring bear hunt. It seems as if the ministry can't supply any evidence to support it either. A vague notion of small economic benefit is not enough. I suspect the push is coming from a relatively small group of outfitters who depend on non-resident spring hunters. Sorry, but that's not enough. The long-term greater good must be the primary motivation for any government action, and for the ministries of environment and natural resources, economic arguments are only a part of it.

After four days of dragging kitchen compost and old donuts through the forest and hanging it from a tree, they easily shot a bear for ‘sport’.
Upon close examination of the dead bear, it became evident that they had shot a female yearling.

Generally speaking, my first issue is that it is hard to tell a female bear from a male bear. If a female with cubs is killed the cubs will die.
On the Peninsula, the bear population is small, genetically unique and faces extreme habitat issues. Having a spring bear hunt further threatens these animals. Since the Peninsula is still home to black bears, we need to protect and conserve these bears. They are part of our natural heritage and the only place in southern Ontario where they are still hanging on, a place where there’s still a little bit of “ wild” left.

Please be advised of my opinion that the Spring Bear Hunt should be eliminated.  The following are my reasons why and suggestions.
Sincerely,
Best scenario. Spring Bear Hunt should be abolished, however if hunt is too continue, changes must be made.
-It should last 30 days, June 1 to June 30. -Baiting must stop after June 30 not to begin again until September 1st, or 2 weeks prior to fall hunt.
-Baiting should be a minimum of 2 km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after hunt.
-Fall hunt should begin September 15 and end October 30 throughout Province.
-Females with cubs must be “truly” protected during the spring hunt and the fall hunt.
-The Ontario Government needs to hire more people for enforcement, this province needs more Conservation Officers.
-Bears (a few individuals) do occasionally prey on moose calves, this is “not"" common.
-Best way to reduce human/bear conflicts is to manage people by making them manage their food waste.
*Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
-The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
-Baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
-All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
-The Government must consider the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
-The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

Ontario must do its part to change the ways of its society to stop the unethical slaughter of wildlife, by unethical and ecologically unsound hunting practices and by industrial and development destruction of the environment.
We know:
~ that the ban on the spring bear hunt was a ecologically sound and ethical decision supported by the science of MNRF Biologists;
~ most spring bear hunters are non-residents who hunt baited bears;
~ many hunters at bait stations are unable to distinguish between male and female bears;
~ female bears are killed, including nursing mothers;
~ orphaned cubs, about five to six months old and typically weighing about five kilograms, starve to death or are killed by other predators;
~ despite the threat of large fines, regulations prohibiting the killing of females accompanied by cubs are unenforceable

43772,/comment/43772,"Dear Ontario Law Makers,
Concerning the return of the BEAR HUNT!
As a resident of Ontario, I am a Voice for those creatures you are planning on MURDERING Bears in the Spring Bear Hunt. Do you release that killing a female Bear, who now has Cubs, which she hides while she forges for food for her and her little ones. Killing one female bear really condemns killing an entire Family that includes her Cubs now without a Mother to feed them. The Female Bear with Cubs killed for sport and paid with Blood Money to do so. Also, this condemns the now orphaned Cubs to a slow painful death by Starvation and Predators. So killing one bear leads to the certain deaths of her Cubs. Without a mother, the Cubs have a horrible future of suffering and lastly death. Animal Rehab Centers will be subjected to a high amount of orphaned Cubs being brought to them to try and save them.
In all, if the hunter/s can not see nor hear the Cubs they will ""Take the Shot"" that destroys a beautiful animal but her Cubs thus an entire Family  gone. I wonder how many Cubs will be orphaned because of this needless hunt?
Thank you.

43779,/comment/43779,"And I thought that Canadians were both smart and humane.
Killing a top predator is not only wrong, it goes against all ecosystem logic.  In the U.S.. we have many National Parks and Forrests.  One of our most visited parks is Yellowstone National Park.  Until the late 19th through the early 20th Centuries, the Grey Wolf was Yellowstone's top predator.  During that period, President Theodore Roosevelt made what he considered a healthy ecosystem decision of eliminating the wolf from the Park in order to preserve the remaining species in the Park.  He called his effort Predator Control Campaigns.  For seventy years the wolf could no longer be found.  They were gone.  In turn the entire Park suffered and its perfect ecosystem nearly collapsed.  The absence of the wolf caused chaos in the Park as Elk, the preferred meal of the wolf, began grazing all over the Park.  Elk, typically are constantly moving from one feeding area to the next.  It's how they avoid becoming meals.  During the absence, the Elk slowed down as their numbers also grew.  They nearly decimated the rivers.  As the devastation ensued other creatures left the Park.  The beaver disappeared as did many other predatory birds, water and land birds.  With no beavers building their dams, fish were left with nowhere to spawn, thus they suffered.  At the same time the coyote and elk proliferated trampling and destroying much of the beauty of the Park.  During the 1970s scientists began to understand environmental issues.  They began to understand why ecosystems must be kept in tact.  They also began lobbying to reintroduce the wolf back to the Park.  Twenty years later, the group of scientists and conservationists began reintroducing groups of Canadian wolves to the Park.  Those who opposed the release rallied for the grazing animals saying they would be decimated.  The opposite happened.  Within a short period of time, everyone associated with the Park watched a miracle take place as the Park began to heal itself.  With the wolves (the top predator) on the loose and rise, the entire ecosystem was restored to its natural hierarchy.  All the absent animals began to reappear as they all contributed to the restoration of the beauty and nature of the Yellowstone National Park.  Too, Elk went back to their natural way of life as they once again began to move vs. linger.  Killing mother bears (also a top predator) will cause a Yellowstone-like disaster.  Humans MUST begin to learn from their mistakes.  Humans typically, however, don't learn so they continue to repeat their mistakes causing one predictable  disaster after another.  DO THE RIGHT THING AND BAN THE BEAR KILLING!

43783,/comment/43783,"Mimicking the thoughts and reasoning of Toronto Wildlife Centre, a charity wildlife hospital that have been working daily for decades to help sick, injured and orphaned wild animals, I think encouraging a permanent annual hunting season for bears puts both mother bears, and subsequently bear cubs, at risk.
Hunters often struggle to pinpoint the difference between a male and female black bear, and risk killing a mother bear during the spring season – orphaning her cubs who are too young to survive on their own.
This is one of the main reasons why I am speaking up against the suggestion to make an annual spring black bear hunting season permanent in Ontario. While there is a ban on killing bear cubs and their mothers, this won’t stop hunters who fail to make the distinction. Inadvertently shooting mother bears is what prompted the cancellation of a previous pilot spring hunting season, and reinstating it based on a proposed economic need just isn’t enough to warrant the negative impact on the species.
We have to work harder and make better informed, and more science-driven decisions when it comes to policies that impact wildlife and their habitat in general. While hunters and anglers can be great stewards of the environment, there is a history of these mistakes, and we can't afford to put our biodiversity at more risk. Thank you for your time.

43789,/comment/43789,"Hello, I am writing this comment in the sincere hopes that you will reconsider your proposal for implementing a regular spring hunting season of black bears in Ontario. By doing so, the likelihood of hunting and shooting a female black bear increases, leaving her cubs as orphans and consequently decreasing their chances of survival. Accountability for a hunter's actions will be made harder as they can fall back on the excuse of not being able to distinguish between a male and female black bear.
Reducing the spring hunting season of black bears in the Bruce Peninsula is not worth applaud if it means endangering other black bear populations. According to the proposal details, ""Research indicates that there has been a decline in bear numbers and that human-caused mortality should be reduced to support sustainability of this genetically isolated population."" Why run the risk of decreasing population numbers for other black bears in Ontario? Would it not make more sense (protection wise) to effectively eliminate the spring hunting season for Bruce Peninsula's black bears?
I understand the desires of hunters and tourists, but at what expense should their demands be met. Black bears are an iconic species of Canadian wildlife and important for maintaining biodiversity as top predators. Implementing this proposal will encourage future hunting regulations (not only for black bears, but other wildlife) that will do more harm than good in the long-term. This is not a sustainably sound proposal, but rather an economically driven decision without consideration for the fatal consequences, especially for female black bears. Once again, I sincerely ask you to reconsider this proposal. I look forward to hearing a positive response from the ministry in the near future.
Thank you.

43808,/comment/43808,"Black bear populations are being over-harvested in several to many WMUs in northeastern and south-central ON, exceeding sustainable harvest levels and exceeding other sustainability indicators.  The spring bear hunt pilots unfortunately exacerbated sustainability concerns and to date no adequate harvest management tools on the resident bear hunts have been provided to remedy the concerns.
There are large gaps in:
•	black bear harvest allocation policies;
•	regulatory and procedural tools to carefully manage sustainable black bear harvests, especially resident hunts (i.e., there are no WMU-specific 1st resident black bear tag quotas, which could be distributed on 1st-come-1st-served basis, using similar approach re: additional deer tag quotas);
•	transparency to stakeholders and public on the status of WMU black bear population estimates, annual trends in bear harvests by sector, and annual trends in sustainability indicators.
Mandatory registration / submission of premolar teeth from harvested black bears should be implemented such that sustainability indicators can be reliably determined at appropriate scales.  Most years, less than 10% of resident bear hunters submit premolar teeth from their harvested bear(s), yet annual resident bear harvests approach 80% or more of total bears harvested in many WMUs.
The current harvest tools used by MNRF is to impose BMA operators with black bear hunting validation certificate quotas, without any WMU-specific quotas on 1st resident black bear tags for resident hunters (i.e., resident bear harvests are wide open).  This inequitable approach has resulted in WMU and black bear ecological zone level bear harvests to be excessive, inappropriately managed, with bear populations being over-harvested.
The opportunity to engage stakeholders, Indigenous communities, municipalities and the public on appropriate black bear harvest allocation policies and procedures, and regulatory and procedural tools to carefully manage sustainable black bear harvests, would have best been done with the initiation of the spring bear hunt pilots.  However, that did not occur and the next logical time to do so is now as the pilot spring bear hunts come to an end.
The ER proposal (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-1112) to implement a regular spring black bear season, should be accompanied by analyses and lessons learned to inform and engage stakeholders, Indigenous communities, municipalities and the public on appropriate black bear harvest allocation policies and procedures, and regulatory and procedural tools to carefully manage sustainable black bear harvests.  In its current form, I cannot ethically and professionally support the proposed regular spring black bear season and am therefore opposed.  There should be no fear in implementing the right course of action, i.e., WMU-specific 1st resident black bear tag quotas where required – it is the right thing to do.
As indicated in the ER proposal, “Since the mid-2000s there has been ongoing collaborative research conducted on the black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula. Research indicates that there has been a decline in bear numbers and that human-caused mortality should be reduced to support sustainability of this genetically isolated population.”  While it is good to see a proposed action towards addressing the Bruce Peninsula black bear population concerns, a 7-day spring season without any quota on 1st resident bear tags is highly likely to be insufficient to prevent the decline of this genetically isolated bear population.  Even white-tailed deer, which have much, much higher reproductive potential compared to black bears, are afforded a 5-day gun season with 1st resident deer tag quotas on the Bruce Peninsula.   There should be no fear in implementing the right course of action, i.e., WMU-specific 1st resident black bear tag quotas – it is the right thing to do.  Without WMU-specific 1st resident black bear tag quotas, then the bear hunt seasons on the Bruce Peninsula should be eliminated entirely.

Not only have we killed 2/3 of our present day mammals and 50% of our birds, we still haven't learned our lesson that without animals (and plants) we cannot survive.  We need bio diversity to continue to live healthy lives.  We may believe that planting trees is the answer to our carbon problems, but the real problem is that trees do NOT make a forest.  Forests need biodiversity of all creatures, plants, insects, including bears, foxes, and wolves.
Killing bears, and may I say in a cowardly manner, is another step toward human extinction.

I support that mandatory hunter reporting deadlines for resident bear hunters would be simplified by requiring one report submission for the year.
If this proposal proceeds, it would come into effect on January 1, 2021. However, black bear outfitters must know by the start of the Spring 2020 season if these proposals are approved.

While I am not opposed to ethical and sustainable hunting, I share the view of many Ontarians who believe the proposal is headed in the wrong direction from a conservation standpoint. As the nature  organizations have said, females, including nursing mothers, have unfortunately been and will continue to be killed during the spring hunt as some hunters make mistakes.  As a result, cubs will be orphaned and that's a justifiable concern on the part of many Ontarians.  Although the government prohibits the killing of females accompanied by cubs, it is difficult to enforce the prohibition as a hunter simply has to state that no cubs accompanied the female when she was shot approaching the bait site.
I believe there are ample opportunities to hunt black bears in the fall and there isn't a justifiable reason to allow bears to be killed in the spring. Conservation should always be the foremost concern of the ministry.
I fully support the proposal to eliminate special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-residents hunting with immediate relatives, as well as measures to address the decline in black bear numbers on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.
Given the stresses on the population, I urge the government to completely close all bear hunting seasons on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.

Why would the ON government want to bring back this cruel hunt where bear cubs are being orphaned after their mothers are shot to death?  To appease the powerful hunting lobby!!! Where is our humanity?
It’s unacceptable that the government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears.
Here are the important points that the Ontario Government needs to consider.
• Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.

Bears need our protection and our compassion. Please do not allow this barbaric form of trophy hunting. We as a nation are better than that and we need to demonstrate that we have evolved and improved our animal and environmental protection laws to the highest standards possible, while setting a good example for other nations. We need to make progress in this area, not take ten steps backwards and revert to old, outdated ways which do not serve our society. We should take our role as stewards of this country and our planet with the utmost care and consideration especially when it comes to cruelly and needlessly taking the innocent lives of animals.

Proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations.  The spring black bear hunting season is a positive
idea.  It will spread out the hunting pressure and give the existing guides much more opportunity to service their clients.  If the black bear population is greater than the habitat will sustain, it gives the MNRF a tool to control the population.
Why didn't the guides ask for the Whitetail Deer to be put on the list that non-residents couldn't hunt without a guide service?
The proposal to force non-residents land owners to hire a guide service is a negative idea.  My first bear hunt in Canada was Northeast of Peterborough about six years ago with a guide.  The Camp was just off a good gravel road and okay.  Their was myself and a friend plus 4 other guys there when we were there.  The guide and his helpers kind of smothered all of the hunters.  The guide after morning hunts pretty much wanted us all to hangout at the Camp until afternoon/evening hunts.
We would have gone to explore the area, big Provincial Park near by, a couple Trading Posts and small town.  In this situation we would have spent much more money at the local businesses if we had owned land in that WMU.  The guide was the only person that made money!  We left after 3 days on a 6 day hunt package.  We harvested one bear about 130#.  We saw several small bear that we were encouraged to shoot in the 100# range, maybe yearlings.  The more bear you shoot with a guide, the better his ratio is, even if it a 90#er.
There is a big difference between being a hunter and a SPORTSMAN.  The guides all rate themselves on success of kills verses number hunters.  The forcing of Guide Service on non-residents is going to create more friction between guides.  Sometimes leaving somethings that works alone is better trying to change the ""wheel""!
The last 4 years I have purchased properties that we use for outdoors recreation, including black bear hunting.   Most of us bring our spouses, children and even grand kids.  This is our method of getting the younger family members interested in going fishing, hunting, hiking or any outdoor activity.  Most hunting guides are not setup to handle families and particularly younger children.  We rent cabins or camp at modern campgrounds.  We normally make 5 or 6 trips to Bruce Mines area yearly and hunt during the week days to lessen conflict with guides or residents that are also hunting black bear.
The tourism activity is one of the main sources of money for many of the smaller towns and ""mom and pop shops"", and part of that revenue comes from non-resident land owners!
I'm sure most of the WMUs are similar, but guide services and number of guides per area differ.  Where we hunt in the last 4 years we haven't seen a guide.  Where I come from fairness is a ""give and take thought process""!  Let's not give it all to the guides.
I complement the MNRF for their continued management and research of the Black Bear and the Wildlife Habitat that Ontario has for all its Wildlife!  I saw several research areas with barbed wire and sardines last spring!  Always nice to see and know what they are!  Good Job!

In the fall it is different. In early spring, bear cubs cannot accompany their mothers when they go to forage for food and are left hidden in brush or trees. There is no way hunters at baiting stations or those pursuing bears with dogs can tell whether the bear is male or a female. If they kill a sow, they cannot be held responsible under the law because they did not kill a “sow with cubs.”
If there is the slightest chance that even a few bear cubs could become orphaned then the hunt inhumane and cruel.
Hunting lobbies believe that bears are responsible for the decline in Ontario moose populations and that male bears kill their young. This is untrue, bears are primarily vegetarian and are not responsible for the decline in our moose population. Clear-cutting, aerial spraying, wetland destruction, development and not putting a moratorium on hunting are responsible.
We already have a fully legal bear hunt season in the fall. If anyone is concerned about controlling the bear population, that can be taken care of in the fall.

When the hunt was originally cancelled, it was not sue in part to science informing the decision, but purely of a political nature where the government of the day was making effort to appease vocal lobbyists with deep pockets!
Despite what nay sayers have been pushing in the media, Ontario has one of the longest histories of sustainable wildlife management in North America; this is inclusive of bears and bear hunting.  Bears like many of our natural resources are a renewable resource and we have proven that spring hunting is sustainable and doesn't negatively impact the overall health of the bear population in Ontario.  Furthermore, research has shown that bears do account for up to 50% of moose calf mortality, and as we know our moose population is currently under a great deal of stress as a result of many factors, bears being one of them.  Reinstatement of the spring bear hunt will assist with addressing one of many aspects impacting Ontario's moose population.  The three pillars of sustainability includes not just environmental aspects, but also social and economic aspects.  We know for a fact that the social and economic aspects associated to the spring bear hunt are critically important factors for many Ontario residents as well as tourists, especially those who live in northern and rural parts of the province, which accounts for 90% of the provinces land mass.  As a hunter and with proper education, it is in fact relatively easy to distinguish between male and female bears regardless of the season and whether or not cubs are present.  Younger, juvenile bears can be more difficult, but they are also not a component of the population which is reproducing, so the whole orphaned cubs argument is weak at best.
Anyway, you get the point of my feedback and the facts which support my family's position on being FULLY SUPPORTIVE on the permanent reinstatement of the spring bear hunt!
Next on the list of to do's I hope will be the elimination of the requirement for small game hunters to buy wolf/coyote game seals.  This was another ridiculous change that happened not based on science, but based on politics which shouldn't be a factor when making important fish and wildlife management decisions!  Wolves prefer moose over all other sources of food and have had massive impacts on the populations across northern Ontario.  Over the past 20 years I have seen and observed the impacts as a result of extensive amounts of time spent in the bush all across northern Ontario where I work as a Forester in addition to being an avid angler, hunter and trapper.

There are many bear in our area. I have pictures of several different bear at my baits. Big bear, small bear, bear with different markings and several sows with cubs. In 2017 there were numerous encounters with bear breaking into camps including my own in August. The bear broke my picture window and screens and tore the door open for entry.
The proposal states it would distribute opportunities in a fair manner. This would not be fair to myself, a landowner wanting to protect my property. These changes would greatly disrupt my opportunities to hunt and enjoy the outdoors. I can hunt where and when I want with my license in my B.M.U.
There is no competition with other bear hunters in my area. The locals encourage me to hunt to keep bear away from the camps. One person offered a $500 bounty for the bear that damaged his camp. I tagged a bear from a certain area and 2 locals say they haven't had a problem since.
Lots of people hunt deer in my area but no one hunts bear. I try to encourage them to hunt bear but they do not. I hunt both for the sport and love to eat the meat. I also render the fat to cook and bake with.
The proposal states it would distribute hunting opportunities in a consistent and fair manner. It would only distribute the hunting opportunities to the guides and take the hunting opportunities away from me. It would increase costs at the same time. The cost is high enough as it is. If you reduce opportunities it is not worth the cost!
If a non-resident landowner needs assistance to hunt black bear then that person can hire a licensed operator. I have a cabin in the woods and I can hunt without assistance. I would like it to stay this way.
As a landowner and taxpayer, I should have the right to hunt and protect my property. Please do not require us to hunt through a licensed operator. Also, there is not a current licensed operator in my area. I know the previous operator.
The proposal states it would simplify the licensing process. This is not true for me. I can purchase my license online and have it immediately.
I am a non-resident landowner with a home on it. I have no need for a licensed operator. We are not the ones that will contribute to the tourism industry businesses. If you want to improve the tourist industry businesses, reduce the cost of the licenses. I can bear hunt participate in Michigan every year for $15.00.
The law states in Part XII Hunting Services (2): A license to act as a guide may be issued to a resident or a Canadian citizen. O. Reg. 665/98,s. 94 (2)  The proposal states it is intended to improve fairness and remove conflict. You may call it conflict but in reality it is competition. The business challenge is actually price. With competition the consumer can get a fairer price. Without competition, you are creating a monopoly: the exclusive control of a service that makes possible the manipulation of prices. The price should reflect the service or experience that is provided. The license will again increase the cost of enjoying the outdoors. Also decreasing the amount of licenses purchased.

After re-introducing spring bear hunt pilot projects in 2014 and 2016, the government now wants to bring this cruel hunt back for good, all to appease the powerful hunting lobby.
The scene is sickening. Hungry black bears are baited with food, after they emerge from their dens after a long winter of hibernation. When they reach the bait, they are mercilessly gunned down.
Bears, like all wildlife, need our compassion and protection. It’s unacceptable that the government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears.

43884,/comment/43884,"I do not agree with killing black bears or culling any wild animals.  Black bears have low reproduction rates and in spring there is the very great risk of mothers leaving cubs in the den while foraging for food.  If they are killed, their cubs will starve to death.  When a bear appears in a hunter's gun sight, who cares if it's male or female?  The government is worried about low black bear birth numbers in the Saugen- Bruce-Peninsula yet they propose a week of hunting!  The world is losing an unprecedented number of wildlife due to human mismanagement and insufficient knowledge of the consequences although we all know that every living thing on earth is connected and is necessary for the environment as a whole.

The Ontario government wants to permanently bring back the spring bear hunt, a dangerous and irresponsible move being condemned by environmental and animal protection groups.
The province outlawed the spring bear hunt in 1999 because bear cubs were being orphaned after their mothers were shot to death. After re-introducing spring bear hunt pilot projects in 2014 and 2016, the government now wants to bring this cruel hunt back for good, all to appease the powerful hunting lobby.
The scene is sickening.   Hungry black bears are baited with food, after they emerge from their dens after a long winter of hibernation. When they reach the bait, they are mercilessly gunned down
Bears, like all wildlife, need our compassion and protection. It’s unacceptable that the government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears.

While the regulation includes a stipulation that the female bears with cubs should not be targeted, hunters could legitimately not see the cubs, or the cubs could’ve been hidden somewhere by the mother while she hunts for food. In the past, spring hunts have resulted in numerous instances of cubs being orphaned and left to slowly starve to death or be predated on by other animals. There is no way the government can control this or prevent this from happening. In addition, the practice of baiting hungry bears right after they have left the den in the spring, then shooting them when they find the food, does not demonstrate any particular skill or acumen by the hunters. It is simply cruel, and demonstrates the sport hunters’ need to feel superior over other stronger, more  powerful animals.

Baiting hungry bears after hibernation in order to get That Shot, is cruel and inhumane. Humans comfortably sit in a blind so the bear can't see or smell them. The bear smells the food, comes to eat it and the humans shoot it. These people call themselves sportsmen.  How sporting is that practice??????
I know someone who did have or maybe still has a bear hunt camp and it is disgusting to think how hunters can call kill when the bear has NO CHANCE against them.  If the bear us female, the cub has no chance. Cubs stay with and are taught by their sows for two years. If the sow is shot, the cub is orphaned and itself has little chance of survival without the milk from its mother or knowing the skills of what to eat, how to hunt, and generally survive.  I know the law said not to shoot female bears but how does one tell the difference from the front?
Overall, bears are not a problem for humans.  The humans cause the problem of their presence when they do not store food or garbage properly.  When visiting or camping, humans lure bears with food just to see them. Then the bear become habituated and may attack the human when there is no food.  Whose fault is that?  Humans want that photo with a wild bear and puts himself in danger.  Whose fault it that?  Again, the bear is killed when it is behaving as a wild animal must behave for survival.
I have little problem with people who truly hunt, kill cleanly and eat the meat.  I do have a problem with people who only want the skin or the head and leave the meat.  There is enough food for scavengers without the addition of a dead bear.  The lead bullet then works its way through the food chain killing all animals and birds that eat it.
Does this government want to protect our environment and animals for further humans to enjoy?? Or do they want to live in a silent, empty world with no bees to pollinate plants for our food so owe, ourselves starve?  I realize moving on to bees here is a whole other topic but the whole scenario applies.
The economic gain for suppliers or camp owners for hunters is negligible compared to the damage  caused by careless, ego driven ""hunters"".  There are many other sports for which they may supply clothing, transportation, gear and many, many other products.

Hunters should have to balance the playing field, the animals have no weapons, hunters should have no weapons - or stay home.
Real men don't need to harm animals, which follows that hunters can not tell male from female species because they themselves have no balls.... someone had to say it!
STOP THE HUNT!

43975,/comment/43975,"Why is the Ontario government considering reinstating the spring bear hunt? There are no good reasons for doing so. The hunt was outlawed because bear cubs were orphaned after their mothers were killed. Cubs stay with their mothers for at least a year and have little hope of survival without her. It is very difficult to know if a bear has cubs, since a protective mother will hide her cubs when searching for food. Cubs will die of starvation without her or be killed by predators. That has not changed.
Bears have low reproduction rates so a hunt would threaten their numbers.
Hunting bears will not increase safety for humans. An education program emphasizing the need to secure garbage and other food sources would be far more beneficial.
There is no sound economic justification for reinstating the spring bear hunt.

43991,/comment/43991,"Dear M,
Bears need your help!
The Ontario government wants to permanently bring back the spring bear hunt, a dangerous and irresponsible move being condemned by environmental and animal protection groups.
The province outlawed the spring bear hunt in 1999 because bear cubs were being orphaned after their mothers were shot to death. After re-introducing spring bear hunt pilot projects in 2014 and 2016, the government now wants to bring this cruel hunt back for good, all to appease the powerful hunting lobby.
The scene is sickening. Hungry black bears are baited with food, after they emerge from their dens after a long winter of hibernation. When they reach the bait, they are mercilessly gunned down.
Bears, like all wildlife, need our compassion and protection. It’s unacceptable that the government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears.
M, it’s now time to speak up. The public consultation period is open until Tuesday, February 18, 2020, and we urgently need you to add your voice!
Please eliminate the spring bear hunt.  See the following reasons.  Also, consult with Mike MacIntosh of Bear With Us Sanctuary who continues to rescue orphaned cubs because their mothers have been killed by inexperienced/uneducated hunters.  This is a trophy kill and has no necessity in our current times.
•	Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.

A Spring Bear Hunt is a silly, unscientific knee jerk reaction to the hunter/outfitter call for more ""economic"" opportunity for killing wild life.
Nuisance bears arise through loss of habitat, and are attracted because of human carelessness in waste disposal or failure to secure alternate food sources.
The Spring Bear Hunt is a cynical political ploy to pander to that part of the PC ""base"" that believes in its entitlement to kill.  Hunting bears is not hunting for sustanence. If there is any economic purpose, it is to sell Bear parts/skins to a largely illegal black market for spurious medicinal/vanity use.  A spring hunt will only legitimise this despicable enterprise, which is already perpetrated by illegal poaching.

44066,/comment/44066,"I am against reinstating the spring bear hunt.  The hunt would take place when the bear cubs are at their most vulnerable.  Although the proposal is to only hunt boars the reality is that females often hide their young in trees when foraging.  Differentiating between male and females is not easy and many females are likely to be killed in error, leaving their young to almost certain death.
The reality is that if humans were taught to properly bear proof their properties by storing garbage in bear proof systems,  avoiding feeding birds and other unintended food sources, humans and bears can cohabitate.
The excuse to institute the spring bear hunt to provide jobs and revenue for communities is ludicrous.  If population control is the objective then the fall hunt would provide that and the cubs who are orphaned at that time would have a slim chance of survival.
Communities such as Elliot Lake that instituted a bear wise program saw the human/bear conflict drop dramatically.  Education is the key.
To institute the spring hunt again is wrong and is only catering to the hunter lobby group with no good scientific evidence to support this move.  Please look at this from a scientific, humane perspective and say no to this pressure.

44067,/comment/44067,"Please re-think allowing a culling of the bear population, for any period of time.  Specifically, five years is not a solution to the problem.  Population encroachment, by allowing developers to expand into the habitat of many species has created the problem of bears scavenging close to municipalities, who have not properly addressed the issues of dealing with garbage in an efficient and environmentally safe way in rural areas.  Police forces should work with Ministry of Natural Resources officers, in a way that can safely remove bears from municipalities, without resorting to immediately shooting bears.
Similarly, I live on Lake Scugog, so I understand the need to be aware of coyote and wolf populations that use the lake to hunt, at night.  We walk our dogs in pairs, close to our fully lit property and watch the lake for activity, day and night.
I was raised in Sault Ste. Marie, so I also understand the hunting culture.  There is a marked difference between northern and southern Ontario.  Any hunting regulations should reflect these differences.  As well, development of hunting regulations should not include a view to creating a revenue stream for the Ministry.
I fear for the cubs of female bears, as the mother may leave to hunt for food.  These mothers would be presumed to be alone.  Shooting them could leave the cubs to fend for itself and could starve or be the victims of predators.

44072,/comment/44072,"On behalf of our Board of Directors and members, Nature and Outdoor Tourism Ontario (NOTO) is writing today to support the proposal listed above.
We have advocated and will continue to advocate that a properly regulated spring bear hunt will support sustainable management of our black bear populations and provide benefits to the Ontario economy through taxes and jobs.
A report that was circulated by your Ministry in 2018, titled; Black bear hunters in Ontario in 2017: Expenditures, characteristics, and hunting experiences, showed that the pilot spring bear hunt season in 2017 hunters spent $13.8 million and the fall hunt contributed $36.8 million. Together the spring and fall bear hunt season contributions are $50.6 million. This report confirms that the return of the spring bear hunt to Ontario is supported by resident and non-resident hunters and will have a positive impact to the Province.
For the tourism industry, returning a spring bear hunt to Ontario will provide bear outfitters the opportunity to be more flexible with their bear hunting offerings to non-resident and resident hunters.
We are encouraged that MNRF has presented changes that will reduce conflicts on the ground in Bear Management Areas. Conflicts involving non-resident property owners as well as resident hunters who hire the services of non-licenced bear outfitters has been a growing concern.
We are also encouraged that the bear hunting opportunities that were given to non-resident property owners and non-resident immediate relatives will be redistributed to tourism businesses. This shows our bear outfitting industry that our Ontario Government sees the value in tourism as an economic driver and that it supports businesses in the Province. It also acknowledges the experience and knowledge that our industry has to provide professional hunting services.
Requiring those that offer bear guiding services to residents to have a Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services, will not only help to reduce conflicts on the ground in our BMAs but will ensure that economic contributions are made for these services. It will certainly help to address the issues of fairness as it relates to business in our industry.
These changes are a step in the right direction to supporting a sustainable black bear hunt as well as the many bear outfitting businesses that have and will continue to contribute to significantly to the economy of Ontario.
We are pleased to support the components of this proposal and look forward to continuing our work with your ministry to develop enhanced harvest management approaches/systems that will further support the sustainability of our black bear populations as well as our bear outfitting industry.

Ther are too many irresponsible hunters that will not wait long enough before shooting a bear, to see if there are cubs, and maybe even then, would shoot anyway.
Even in the fall, cubs will be orphaned in their first year of life by lazy or greedy hunters, a lot of them Americans, who want a trophy at any cost.
Another problem is the sale of bear body parts to Asians for bullshit medicine, whether the bear is killed legally or not. Does the govt. condone these sales?.
People must learn to live with bears in certain areas of the country, and the govt. has to do more to re-locate bears instead of the lazy way out, just shooting them.

A Spring hunt is guaranteed to orphan cubs as hunters will admit the inability to identify a female from a male and the females often move about without their cubs.  So this hunt has the potential to have a double or triple the impact as you could possibly kill a female and up to three cubs who will die a slow and horrible death.
It is also being discussed to continue to have even a week long hunt on the Bruce Peninsula where there is a documented decline of black bears.  This is beyond comprehension!

Advocates for the hunt often argue it will reduce human-bear conflict, but time and again studies have shown that the spring bear hunt does not improve human safety. Rather, easy access to garbage, barbecues, and other easily removable attractants, as well as scarcity in natural food availability, are key factors in human-bear interactions.
From an environmental standpoint, black bears are known for their low reproduction rates, making the survival of adult females, who reach sexual maturity late in life and have few offspring, particularly important for the species.
There is no cultural or economic justification for allowing hunters to lure hungry black bears using bait and shoot these unsuspecting animals for sport.
The government’s strongest argument in favour of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt is that it will provide certainty to hunters and tourist outfitters. Given the disastrous consequences of the hunt for bears and cubs across the province, a desire for certainty is hardly a justification. Certainty would best be achieved by permanently cancelling this cruel and unnecessary killing game, instead of bowing to the powerful hunting lobby instead.

On behalf of humanity please do NOT allow anyone to hunt bears or any wild life animals. They have every right to be alive and free like humans. We can coexist on earth no need to hunt and torment these innocent animals. This is more than just hinting a bear, it is a demonstration for the young children/adults. Teaching them compassion for other existing life. Whereas hunting and killing only invites negative thoughts and behaviour.  It plays a psychological role in persons observing and or demonstrating such a cruel cold act.  Please be example of a spiritual being experiencing a human life and take all things into consideration before making a rash decision in the hunting and harming of other living creatures.

44128,/comment/44128,"The proposal discourages the purchase of land and hinders tourism and potential business growth since many non-residents specifically locate and even purchase land in WMUs where hunting is allowed without ""using the services of a licensed bear operator"".  A friend and I made several scouting trips and worked with a Canadian broker spending considerable funds & time deciding on our land purchase. Being able to hunt bear on it without such a requirement was a key factor which now would be taken from us. As naturalists and long-term experienced hunters, we know that a guided hunt is not at all the same type of experience.  Land is often purchased in more remote areas specifically for such outdoor purposes as hunting, fishing, camping and other activities. We built a cabin and pay additional taxes, develop the property, maintain insurance on it, and we buy supplies, firewood, dine out, and give great support to local economies.  We occassionally even purchase larger items such as boats, motors, kayaks, snow machines, ATVs and tools and equipment.  Also, consider what non-residents spend not only on repeated trips there, but on licences, fees, hunting & safety courses, passports, etc.  After meeting all these expenditures, and supporting Canada through continued trips over the years, we now have to hunt with a licensed bear operator?   Unintended consequences  could multiply in other ways also since even Ontario resident hunters would have to eliminate traditional family hunts unless using ""the services of a licensed bear operator""  (for non-resident immediate relatives). Really??? Even Canadian citizens are affected since many immediate relatives traditionally come ""home"" to hunt and visit. Non-residents already support the Canadian economy greatly through higher fees to hunt, fish, etc. and they travel and stay in Canada doing so. Don't be unfair to us under the idea ""to improve fairness"" for the bear operators. I strongly urge this change not be adopted for the good of Canada, Ontario and all Ontario residents & all non-residents. Thank you for the letter and please consider at a minimum ""grandfathering"" in those who already own property there.  Some licensed bear operators & other operators & hunters may need accountability in certain management areas, but solving that issue should not trump the concerns of both non-residents and even Ontario residents who would be affected by these specific changes. I do think the spring bear season should be adopted and plan to visit more because of it. I am certain other non-residents will also. Thank you for your careful consideration of these changes.  We non-residents love Canada and the opportunities for outdoor recreation it provides.

I am very concerned about the proposal to allow spring bear hunts again.  It is inevitable that bear cubs will to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. Even though it is currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, past experience clearly demonstrates that mother bears often leave their cubs in trees while searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be devoured by predators.
Then there are those that believe hunting bears might improve human safety.  We humans like to think we have superior intelligence when compared to wildlife, so lets use it and come up with better ways to deal with bear related problems for which we are responsible and have directly caused. A more common sense and humane approach would be to avoid human-bear encounters by removing access to garbage, smelly BBQs, and other possible attractive items.
We live near Bear With Us Sanctuary and are grateful for their tremendous efforts regarding not only the well being of bears, but the general public as well.  Their mission is to encourage an appreciation, understanding and respect for bears through education, action and by direct example.  A spring bear hunt goes against all that this organization stands for.
Now some will also say that the spring bear hunt is good for the economy - brings in hunters who spend lots of $$ here while pursuing their goal of killing a bear.  Yet there does not seem to be any strong evidence that a spring bear hunt has genuine economic benefits.  And ultimately, if we kill off all our bears or reduce the population to the point where it is endangered, what will it cost us to try to revitalize it.  After all, many areas of Ontario are known for their natural beauty and wildlife that can be observed and appreciated.  Do we want to be responsible for tampering with that?

The population on the Bruce of genetically isolated black bears is small and declining and yet you have proposed a limited hunt, which should be disallowed given this dire population decline.
Even one mother bear killed at a bait site is one too many when one considers the orphaning of bear cubs and the sufferance for dependent offspring.
Ecology dictates that bear populations are self regulating by way of what the ecosystem can sustain and does not justify killing.
The hunt is unethical due to the time of year and the fact that trophy hunting should be banned.
Trophy hunting is unethical and a blatant disregard for life, and our province would be better served by putting time and energy into helping folks take up their responsibility to not attract bears in bear country, and to advocate for humane co existence.
The unacceptable spring bear hunt proposal should be declined.  Our economy, environment, and tourism would be better served if folks could instead enjoy the presence of black bears and opportunities to view them in nature.
Bait piles are problematic and attract all other forms of wildlife to the dinner table.
Poaching has not been quantified and we know it is going on in Ontario.
Bears are sentient beings and should not be blood sport so called hunted at bait piles or at all.
This proposal is problematic because it is human centric and unscientifically justified and as such is inappropriate for a Ministry that must make good decisions on behalf of wildlife in the public trust.

44172,/comment/44172,"Wildlife Not Wild-Death
I am a spring, summer and fall resident of an inlet on Georgian Bay, one-half hour north of Parry Sound. Over the last 50 years I have often encountered bears in the wild. I am a former Vice-Chair of an Ontario environmental tribunal, and having chaired numerous hearings in which expert scientific evidence was determinative of the environmental issue to be decided, it is obvious to me that the science to support a spring bear hunt is conspicuous by its absence.
1. The ""nuisance"" claim
In my experience, it is human carelessness that is a nuisance and there is no such thing as a ""nuisance bear"" in the natural order of things. As this is one of the justifications for the spring hunt, it is simply ill-informed and wrong. Importantly, any decisions regarding a spring hunt should be science based. I am not aware of any scientific basis for the allegation that a spring bear hunt will somehow resolve the so-called nuisance bear issue or that it is even a problem for people residing in areas that bears consider habitat. In fact, the baiting of bears creates a situation where bears are led down the garden path by humans to being characterized as a nuisance. This is inexcusably contradictory.
2. The economic benefit claim
I support our northern economy. However, the alleged economic justification for the hunt (certainty of income for resort owners and spin-off businesses  from hunting and accommodation) is anecdotal and based on maintaining a perceived status quo that does not exist - there is far more public interest in conserving wildlife, and appreciating it by observation and study, than killing wildlife for sport. It is clear that the majority of Canadians are for preserving, and not killing, our native wildlife, including bears and wolves. Canadians would rather celebrate our wild creatures and not senselessly and needlessly harm, kill and harass them. There is no study that shows that killing bears is more economically productive than observing them in the wild.
3. Mother bears and their cubs
Lastly, the ""safety net"" suggestion - that hunters will be able to determine the sex of a target bear and avoid killing female bears - is simply ludicrous. As others have pointed out, a mother bear does not keep her cubs on a notional leash. It is precisely because a mother bear is separated from her cubs that she becomes distressed with a human presence and shifts into protection mode - a natural reaction that supporters of a spring bear hunt would call ""nuisance"" behaviour. This ""safety net"" is full of holes.
In sum, please do not re-instate a spring bear hunt that is an overreaction to a preventable and overstated ""nuisance"" bear threat, is based on outdated economics, is inhumane, cannot be enforced, and is not science based. Instead, why not try a modern approach by educating people to not create nuisance bear situations and by promoting eco-tourism opportunities that celebrate wildlife, not wild-death.

There is already a fall bear hunt, & there really is no reason to reintroduce the spring hunt, just when mothers are caring for their offspring.
There is no accurate way a hunter can tell a male bear from a female bear, especially from a distance, since mothers will often forage for food without their cubs in tow.
Shotting a female by ""accident"" only creates orphans, who will starve or be predated upon if they are not rescued.  How horrific to cause such undue harm when we as an intelligent and compassionate province should be exploring and promoting ways to preserve our environment, with all its native flora and fauna.
This is NOT hunting, it's a sport that unnecessarily culls a highly intelligent animal.
The bottom line is all about increased revenue from tag sales & satisfying the whims of the hunting community.

We know the scene is sickening. Hungry black bears are baited with food, after they emerge from their dens after a long winter of hibernation. When they reach the bait, they are mercilessly gunned down.
Bears, like all wildlife, need our compassion and protection. It’s unacceptable that my government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears.  Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent.

44280,/comment/44280,"As a lifelong Ontario citizen, I do not support the proposed spring bear hunt and believe it should continue to be outlawed. Hunting organizations and lobbyists are obviously biased and should not be trusted. They speak for a very small group of Ontarians, and, most importantly, they do not care about the welfare of black bears whatsoever but only their own selfish interests. The number of non-hunters in our province vastly outweighs the number of hunters, and you should weigh that carefully in your decision, as you were elected to carry out of the will of the majority of people.
Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants.
Bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species.
The government has disclosed a need to reduce black bear hunting in Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to population concerns, yet it is simultaneously proposing to allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week each spring. This is irresponsible.
Even the economic argument for allowing the hunt is weak. The government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, but has provided no evidence to support this claim.
In this day and age, when more Ontarians care about animal welfare and rights than ever before, it’s unacceptable that the government is supporting the cruel and needless trophy hunting of bears. For all the reasons outlined above and more, the Ontario government should once again outlaw the spring bear hunt.

44281,/comment/44281,"The spring bear hunt is unethical, allowing for lactating female bears to be killed as long as their cubs aren't with them. Cubs are often left alone while their mother goes out to get food, and she is attracted to bait sites as she is hungry since she has been hibernating all winter. Studies have shown time and again that the spring bear hunt does not reduce human-bear interactions. Humans need to be more responsible about leaving things out that attract bears, rather than unethically killing them for sport. We are not on this planet to unilaterally enforce our will on all the natural resources of the lands, we share this planet with animals, and we need to be more respectful of that fact.

How is it now justified to extend the spring hunt with the data that was used to cut new camp owner tags?  I now pay more to receive my 2 tags than the camps around me that receive anywhere from 12 to 15 tags. The purchase price of my camp was based on revenue that would be generated from the sales of these tags. By not cutting these tags until the second year of ownership my business has suffered huge losses in revenue and in the purchase price!  It is not reassuring now that the government has come out and says there is a healthy bear population!  What data are these cuts being based on?  Why is it only new camp owners are responsible in ensuring a healthy bear population?  How can the pricing of bear tags vary from camp to camp?  Is it fair that I pay more for my 2 bear tags than the camp rite next to me that receives 13 tags?  Will I ever get my tags back?  These are just a few questions from a very concerned new camp owner.

Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula black bears are an isolated population, genetically distinct from other Ontario black bears and possibly the only black bears in North America that use crevices for denning.
Any human-induced mortality (ie-spring or fall bear hunt) will only act to reduce the genetic diversity of this isolated population that is known to be in decline. All seasons should be closed completely on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.
In closing, I urge the ministry to abandon both the fall and spring bear hunt on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.

44307,/comment/44307,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide feed back regarding the proposed black bear hunting regulation.
I fully support
1) the continuation of the spring black bear hunt beyond 2020 for residents and non-residents in all WMU's where there is a fall black bear hunt: I do not have enough data at this time to comment on the Bruce Peninsula situation.
2) the regulation that the harvest of bear cubs and female bears accompanied by a cub(s) remain prohibited:I am thankful that most of my fall hunters respect that rule;
3) that bear licences & tags remain valid for both spring & fall seasons; this is very important for potential returning clients who were not successful in the spring hunt;
4) that the mandatory hunter report deadline for resident bear hunters be one report submission for the year; I believe it will be beneficial for the team who compiles the data;
5) the elimination of special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-resident immediate relatives of Ontario residents, even though the number of non-resident landowners is low;
6) the requirement for individual and businesses to have a Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services to provide guiding services to residents within a BMA; this is a much needed change; no one wants a confrontation in the woods; it will be a safeguard; otherwise, we will need enforcement and penalties, which is usually complicated;
Additional comments;
1) residents hunters that travel in excess of 40 km should have to indicate where they sought lodging and who baited for them. (After how many km is a person no longer considered a local harvester)
2) The announcement of the adoption of these proposals before the 2020 spring hunt would be welcomed; perhaps a draft.
3) The forest industry and MNRF have a serious impact on tourism. If there is little or no communication especially with respect to RSA's, tourist operators experience difficulties planning a hunt.  Some mining and exploration companies have also come up with unpleasant surprises.  These companies seem to have no accountability; they lack respect towards the local outfitters.  (So far, there has never been any consultation with the local outfitters.)
4) BMA Operators vs Resident Hunters
    There is no law to restrict a resident hunter from hunting on or next to an outfitter's BMA' s;the outfitter leases Crown land, but no law protects his rights, whether he's been leasing for 20 years or three years.  No one wants a confrontation in the woods
5) Hunting on Private Land
    a)It would not be accurate data to have an outfitter report the harvest on private land against his BMA quota. I suggest The Mandatory Hunter Report should also include the township in the WMU in which the harvest occurred.
b)Moreover, if the land does not meet the MNRF criteria of one (1) bear per fifty square km, (example), two or more bears are harvested on that property, over harvesting exists. Any private land, not included in BMA that does not meet the said criteria is therefore allowed the harvest of one (1) bear.
6) Let's compromise.
 Consider restricting the first two weeks of the fall hunt to BMA operators (some consideration and respect since there is a fee attached to their BMA's;  beginning the third week, residents start to hunt  (one fifth of the season would be allocated to the BMA operators.)
For the spring hunt,  one third of the season allocated to BMA operators,  two first weeks open to residents only, next two weeks to BMA operators only; remainder of season open to everyone.
7) Allocations.
  a)vacant BMA's,  My CONCERN regarding this is that NO true data is available.
  b) non allocated BMA, My CONCERN regarding non allocated BMA's is that NO data is or has been collected since the forestry is developing, new roads are allowing access to non-allocated BMA's, thus allowing harvesting activities; thus, creating a viable & sustainable bear population.
This would create new recreational opportunities--all good for my business & tourist industry.

44310,/comment/44310,"Hunting in the spring is particularly unfavourable because it is a time of vulnerability for bears and other animals that have endured winter and lost body mass. Bears are hungry when they come out of hibernation, there are newborns that must be nourished, and mothers are anxious to feed their young. As a result of these concerns, it remains illegal to hunt bear cubs and female bears with cubs.2 However, it is not easy to distinguish a bear’s gender at a distance and often, bear cubs are kept hidden in safety, so it is not always clear if a roaming female has cubs or not.4 Consequently, hunters may unknowingly shoot mother bears, leaving their cubs orphaned and doomed to suffer and die.
The practice of baiting is another contentious subject that has deterred many from the idea of a spring bear hunt. To make an easy shot for hunters, baiting stations are used to attract bears in the spring. But baiting also discourages bears from pursuing natural food sources and increases the likelihood that they will search for nourishment near areas of human establishment.
Most importantly, the return of the spring bear hunt is demonstrative of the persistence of a contradictory relationship between humans and other animals, and the paradoxical way in which we express interest and adoration toward certain non-humans and yet turn to aggression when they impact our preferred ways of life.
We wish to reduce human-bear conflict by means of violent force and yet, we feel obliged to spare mother bears and cubs due to their particularly fragile circumstance. Perhaps we must first address the moral conundrum with which we are faced – are we in fact concerned about bears and their interest in their own lives or are we only concerned as far as their presence serves humans?
Discussions of spring bear hunting in Ontario appear to have ensued without much consideration of solutions that would be in the best interest of both humans and bears. If we as a province made the decision to ban the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999 partly due to its inhumane nature, then it would make sense for us to attempt to resolve human-bear conflict through alternate non-lethal means.

I recently learned about this proposal. Frankly, I’m disappointed in myself because if I knew about it sooner I would have submitted a comment earlier.
It’s confusing as to why our provincial government banned this hunt in 1999 due to the increasing numbers of orphaned black bears, and now suggests a proposal that would cause the same issue? Just because there are certain limitations in place, it doesn’t mean these timid mammals are safe.
Please, indulge me here by imagining this scenario: It’s spring—cubs are born and far too young to scavenge in their own, let alone leave their den. Their mother must venture out on her own to feed herself in order to provide nourishment for her young.  A licensed hunter comes across her and sees no cubs. They murder her because of this ridiculous hunt and limitations.
What harm did the timid black bear threaten the hunter with?
What is the point of reinstating this hunt?
Tourism?
To appease hunting lobbyists?
We already impose so much unnecessary and violent suffering to sentient cows, pigs, birds etc. who share the will to live out their full lives, just like us. (Nevermind the wildlife harmed and killed by the effects of animal agriculture.) We take away so much life just for blood sport and profit.
Over the last couple of years, I’m increasingly disappointed and embarrassed to be a young Ontario resident. This province won’t have anything left to discover if we continue to capitalize on animal exploitation and slaughter instead of improving the welfare of domesticated, “livestock” or wildlife animals.
I hope this proposal for the permanent hunt extension is reconsidered and quickly rejected. It does not instil any values of the Canadian majority.

44349,/comment/44349,"I am totally against the Spring bear hunting season. Although it is illegal to kill cubs and sows with cubs, mother bears frequently leave their cubs in a tree for safety whilst foraging for food (I have personally observed this). Because hunters are unaware of this, the mothers get shot and the cubs are left orphaned, which essentially means they will starve to death slowly or be eaten by predators.
If there are population concerns on the Bruce peninsula, why is any hunting permitted? Black bear hunting should be closed in all seasons for this region.
Bear hunting does not improve human safety and bear populations regulate themselves if left without human interference. As bear hunting is essentially trophy hunting, it is also immoral and indefensible.

44353,/comment/44353,"I am very concerned about reinstating the spring black bear hunt.
This again puts bear cubs at risk if their mothers are killed at this critical time in their development.  Killing the mother threatens cubs left in trees for safety when the mother looks for food.  They will slowly starve to death or be eaten by predators. Bears have low reproduction rates.  The survival of adult females is vital for survival of the species.  Cubs that are born must be able to reach maturity.
Another reason people advocate the hunt is the ridiculous assertion that it improves human safety by reducing the number of bears.  Humans need to take responsibility for leaving out their garbage in ways that bears can access.  This is what causes bears to return to human areas, not bears' aggression.
How can the government simultaneously assert that the population of black bears in the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula needs to be protected and allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week in the spring each ear.  This makes no sense.
There is even no published evidence that the spring bear hunt will be economically valuable despite the government's assertion that it will be economically neutral or positive.  All I can conclude from this is that individuals wanting the hunt have some kind of powerful lobby that undercuts all rational reasons for continuing the ban on the spring bear hunt.  As an Ontarian with concerns about the well-being of all species, in this case black bears, I request that the ban on the spring bear hunt continue.

44354,/comment/44354,"This proposal is disturbing.  The spring bear hunt is no more a hunt than shooting goldfish in a pond.
What I find disturbing is that no other animal is hunted in the fashion bears are (they get baited for weeks, even months, then shot from a tree blind when they come to eat).  More importantly, hunters cannot differentiate between male and female bears unless cubs are present.  Thus, cubs are orphaned when females feeding without their cubs are shot.
Male black bears are one of the greatest sources of mortality of cubs.  As females only breed every two years, this is a form of population control.  OFAH incorrectly states that the spring bear hunt is needed to keep populations healthy.  But by killing black bears, a major source of mortality of cubs, this hunt could well do the opposite.
As part of the argument is a financial one (benefits to northern communities), far more money would come in if those outfitters would offer spring bear photography opportunities.  Studies have shown that ecotourism brings in far more financial benefits to communities than hunting does (a different type of clientele, with a more affluential background)
Additionally, no other ""game"" animal has two hunts per year (i.e., moose, white-tailed deer). Thus, the spring bear hunt goes against the very foundation of conservation.
I strongly urge the government to NOT reinstate the spring bear hunt.

-the bear population is already going to face new pressures with Beech Bark disease spreading throughout Ontario, and turning the Beech trees, a main source of fall protein (beech nuts), into pulp within three years of infecting a tree,
-despite arguments otherwise, it is too difficult in the field to discern a female from a male bear, leaving cubs vulnerable to losing their mothers to the hunt,
-bears are also going to become more vulnerable to changes in climate, especially those that hibernate under trees and rely on the snow to cover them over for the winter.  Those who can find cave or other good den sites may not be as vulnerable to our later winter season, and the freezes and thaws and wild fluctuations in temperature and precipitation that now characterize our winters.  However, those who den in more open situations will be stressed by these kinds of winters, which could affect numbers.

I worked in wildlife rehab for many years, and saw firsthand the effects of hunting on bear populations, particularly orphaned cubs whose mothers had been shot. The cubs were left to starve to death or be preyed upon by predators.
 In my experience, a hunt will not solve any problems of human/bear conflicts. The only way to mitigate these problems is to educate humans to not leave bear attractants...garbage etc out on their property. Hefty fines for doing so have been effective in many jurisdictions.
 I believe that in many areas, population dynamics are misunderstood, and a hunt could negatively effect the stability and health of these populations.
 One thing that particularly disturbs me is the cruelty of baiting spring bears just out of hibernation when they are hungry and vulnerable. This is simply unethical, and should NEVER  be allowed, in my opinion.
 I sincerely hope that you will reconsider allowing this hunt.

44408,/comment/44408,"To allow the Spring Bear hunt would be  irresponsible,  to many cubs would end up dying once again, it's well known that mother bears will often leave cubs behind in trees or hidden while they forage food,  when a hunter comes across the bear he doesn't know for sure if the bears have cubs or not they simply shoot them. Also bear numbers are falling because they are being forced into human confrontations,  loss of habit,  people dumping garbage,  leaving camping gear and food unattended etc. Bears must be protected,  they have a place in nature and we have become to quick to kill. Wolves have suffered as well.
Allowing this hunt only gives into the hunters who see them as a trophy, they are much more than that.  We cannot allow anymore cubs to starve and become orphans. .  Canada must take a stand and stop this hunt from happening,   there is no real reason to go forward with it. Protect them and if need be relocation is the best way to go.

44409,/comment/44409,"Hi,
I would like to express my support for a full band of hunting bears.  This day and age we should not be interfering with wildlife the way we do.  We do not need to take an animals life for pleasure or food.
I fear that allowing hunting of bears will lead to more poaching. It will be difficult to enforce in a provision with the lack of conservation officers.  I have heard about trophy hunters that shoot bears and feed the meat to their dogs or throw the dead bear into a dumpster.
Too many bear populations are impacted by human/bear conflicts, road and train collisions, habitat loss and lack of food to the extent that allowing hunting of bears is likely to be detrimental to the populations in the long run.
It seems we have not learned much since the obliteration of the buffalo, the big whales, the sea otter, mountain caribou, salmon, herring and eulachon. The moose are now being over hunted and this reduction is being blamed on wildlife when it is humans that have caused this.  We cannot just let this killing of wildlife continue.
Another reason to stop bear hunts are the bear cubs that are left behind or orphaned.  They starve to death so that a hunter can get pleasure in the killing of their mother. Bears and any wildlife families need to be protected anytime of year.
Baiting and the use of dogs needs to be stopped.  It is cruel for the bears, the dogs and other wildlife.
There is misinformation about bears that hunters purposely extend out to the community so that they can justify to the why they are killing bears and other wildlife.  (scare tactics)  This hunt for bears is not about the safety of the community because there is evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears.  People need to be educated properly.   Bear attacks are rare so this hunt will not increase human safety because there is really no danger from bears and will not solve nuisance bear issues.  Bears by the way are mostly vegetarian.
It is sad to think that a beautiful bear grazing on grasses minding it owns business is a target of a group of hunters lining up for a shot down the shore.  We need live bears to support ""bear-viewing"" in a right way instead of hunting them.  This type of enterprise where customers often return year after year to see how the bears are doing once they get to know them would make more sense.
There is no ethical defensible reason to allow the killing of one of the slowest-reproducing land mammal in Canada.
I greatly Oppose this spring bear hunt or any hunt and want it to be Stopped.
It is easy to chose kindness!
Thank you
Pam

I'm truly appalled, saddened and disgusted that our province is suggesting to make the annual spring black bear hunt a permanent right in Ontario. I'm hoping you can address this issue. It is cruel and many negative issues that go along with the hunt.
Hunters often struggle and make mistakes between male and female bears in risking killing a mother bear during spring season - orphaning her cubs who are too young to survive.
Although there is a ban on killing mother bears and cubs, hunters fail to make the distinction in too many cases.
With the world being an utter mess, we must be better than this. We must show respect, compassion and humanity and abolish such an unnecessary cruel ""sport"" and
""economic need"" isn't enough to warrant the negative impact on the species.

Living in Thunder Bay it is a joy to see the bears comes out in the Spring sometimes with their babes.
It is heartbreaking to think that bears after hibernation when they are most vulnerable would be subject to a spring bear hunt regardless of their sex.
Then to bait the bear when it may be ravenous after hibernation  to kill it is unethical. What kind of human being would allow this?
The fecundity of bears as you well know is low and the killing of bears only prohibits the killing of females with cubs. Have the bear sanctuaries had an increase of cubs in their care because of the Spring Bear Kill over the last Five years?
When people come visit some say they would like to see a bear, but it  is a rarity and a chance encounter when it does happen and most welcome, even if they do take a few apples off the trees.
If people were bear wise, bears are not a problem, the people are!

What we do know about the spring bear hunt is:
Most hunters are non-residents who hunt by baiting bears;
Many hunters at bait stations are unable to distinguish between male and female bears;
Female bears are killed, including nursing mothers;
Orphaned cubs – about five to six months old and typically weighing about five kilograms – starve to death or are killed by other predators;
Despite the threat of large fines, regulations prohibiting the killing of females accompanied by cubs are unenforceable.

No good reason to reinstate the spring bear hunt
There is no good reason to reinstate the spring bear hunt, but there are solid reasons not to. Northerner, Paul Filteau, explains:
“Bear tourism and the killing of animals by baiting isn’t hunting. It requires few hunting skills and little effort. A garbage can is put in the bush with various concoctions to attract bears close to where the tourist sits in a stand and can hopefully distinguish a sow from a boar … Further, the placing of bait in the bush conditions bears to human garbage and scent thereby reducing their natural fear of humans. The widespread spring bear baiting throughout Northern Ontario is the ideal boot camp for training nuisance bears.”
The government should end the pilot project and abandon the proposed changes

It is clearly stated that black bears have a population concern yet you are choosing to continue hunting them simply for your own joy or pleasure, which is never a good enough reason to take an sentient beings life. Moreover, just because you do not see a mother bear with her cubs in the present moment does not mean that hers cubs are not hidden in a safe location, therefore hunting black bears will always open the door to the reality that by killing a mother bear you are also sentencing cubs to a horrific death by slowly starving or getting eaten by predators in which they will be rendered defenceless all because you are ignorantly allowing people to continue a destructive ""hobby"". Hunting a black bear is not a necessary part of life, given that we have supermarkets that provide a wide variety of sufficient food to eat. As well, hunting bears will not improve ""safety"" for humans, stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants. Furthermore, bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species. In the midst of a climate crisis, where natural habitats are being destroyed daily, hunting animals for sport is no longer a feasible option. Find a new hobby.

Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent.  While it is currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often tree their cubs while they search for food.   The mothers will be attracted to the bait stations below the tree platforms and be considered ""not accompanied by cubs"" and therefore killed by hunters, most of whom cannot distinguish a male bear from a female bear.  ""I did not know it wasn't a male""  is not a valid excuse for killing a nursing female.  If a mother is killed, the cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.
Hunting bears does not improve human safety.  Human-bear conflict is alleviated by changes in human behaviour.  Humans must take responsibility for removing access to garbage, barbeques and other forms of outdoor cooking areas, as well as any other attractants.
Bears have low reproduction rates and survival of adult females and the cubs is vital for the species.
The argument for allowing the spring bear hunt is weak.   The government states that the economic impact would be neutral or positive but has provided little evidence to support the claim.  In addition, the question must be asked:  ""Is profit a valid reason for killing members of a species?""  In a compassionate, modern society, the answer is ""No.""
In general, public opinion is turning against sport hunting, hunting by non-resident hunters and trophy hunting.    The image of non-resident sport hunters paying large fees to kill, on mutually owned public lands, animals who have little hope of escape has become unacceptable to an informed electorate.
The government should be directing its attention to attracting eco-tourism rather than seeking to retain votes by catering to the wants of a small sector of the population who take pleasure in killing wildlife.

   - The hunt is being proposed to begin May 1, just after bears are emerging hungry from hibernation. They are immediately attracted to the, now even allowed closer to trails, bait piles where they will be slaughtered. A hunter cannot tell a female bear from a male until it is shot. In May the females often leave their cubs to forage for food, & as a result their cubs are left to  starve. Studies show over 75% will.   If the spring hunt were to go ahead, at least have the heart to delay it until June, when cubs are with mothers, & can be identified as mothers.
   - Bears are not a threat. Almost all attacks you hear about involved unleashed dogs Put the emphasis on educating the public about leaving garbage, etc. out that attracts bears.
    -- Bear #'s are decreasing, & they are facing enough factors contributing to this without a spring hunt being re-introduced. Poaching for illegal, expensive bear organs is on the increase. With beach trees dying, bears are losing these nuts which are essential for building up fat for winter hibernation. Bears have a built in system that will end their pregnancies if they go into hibernation underweight.

Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.

A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.

Bears serve an irreplaceable role in the environment and contribute to maintaining healthy prey populations. With the inherent decline in bear populations found with increased hunting prey populations will increase to nuisance levels. This will likely lead to more interactions with humans, and with larger prey animals like deer cause more auto accidents and more fatalities. The minimal revenue gain from additional hunting licenses will not offset the loss of life from overpopulation of prey animals and the environmental damage caused by the decline of an apes predator. This policies should not be enacted, and predator hunting should be extremely limited if not entirely eliminated.

44504,/comment/44504,"I'm baffled by the need to maintain the black bear population with a willingness by the government to allow the hunting of black bears, albeit for a week, in the spring. Killing female bears who will be looking for food after their hibernation to feed themselves and their cubs only increases the chances that along with the female killed, her cubs will be left alone to die. So, each female killed will have much larger ramifications than one bear killed.
I find it troublesome that bears, an important part of biodiversity, are referred to as being harvested. They are not fields of wheat, they are living, breathing, thinking, bonding beings. Every time humans tinker with animal and plant populations things go awry. Instead of looking at quarterly projections, take a step back and look at long term projections. Look at what you mean when you acknowledge that black bears are important to maintaining biodiversity only to allow killing them.
If the interactions between bears and humans is the overarching reason for allowing the hunt, perhaps a better way would be to look at why there are interactions in the first place and mitigating those circumstances rather than using the scorched earth approach of killing and destroying anything that humans find objectionable.
At some point surely someone somewhere has to say that money does not trump life on earth. According to the government's own proposal, the bear hunt is not going to bring in lots of money so why do it and risk having a long-term negative impact on the black bear population? Why can't we leave the bears alone?

So during a spring bear hunt, hunters will bait hungry black bears as they emerge from a winter without food, shooting them at bait sites. Females who have recently given birth are particularly attracted to bait, given that they emerge from their dens in worse body condition than other bears, having lost up to 40% of their body weight.  And leaving their orphaned cubs to starve to death or be predated upon.
This hunt was cancelled in 1999 for good reason.  And the follow-up in 2003, where the Ministry established the Nuisance Bear Review Committee to undertake an independent assessment of the spring hunt on so-called “nuisance bear activity”, found no evidence that the spring bear hunt reduced human-bear conflict.
In 2014 and 2016, Ontario implemented spring bear hunt pilot programs to assess the impact of the hunt on human-bear conflict.  Although the results of these two pilot projects would presumably be relevant to deciding whether or not to make the spring bear hunt permanent, the Government of Ontario does not mention these studies in its ERO posting, nor did it release the results.
Encouraging non-resident trophy hunters to bait and kill bears for sport as they emerge from hibernation is unethical. Indeed, Ontario technically prohibits the killing of cubs or females, but only when they are accompanied by cubs—but this is impossible to enforce.
Often, mother bears leave their cubs in nearby trees or elsewhere as they forage, meaning that there is a good chance that cubs will not be in sight as their mother approaches a bait site, only to be shot by waiting hunters. Females are, and will continue to be, killed during the spring bear hunt. When a lactating mother is killed, her orphaned cubs are also likely to die, either of starvation or by being killed by other predators.
There is no evidence that the spring bear hunt improves human safety. Advocates for the hunt often argue it will reduce human-bear conflict, but time and again studies have shown that the spring bear hunt does not improve human safety. Rather, easy access to garbage, barbecues, and other easily removable attractants, as well as scarcity in natural food availability, are key factors in human-bear interactions.
From an environmental standpoint, black bears are known for their low reproduction rates, making the survival of adult females, who reach sexual maturity late in life and have few offspring, particularly important for the species.
In its ERO posting, Ontario notes the need to reduce black bear hunting on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to serious conservation concerns, yet it is still proposing to allow hunting and trapping of these animals for one week each spring. Allowing any hunting of black bears on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula is irresponsible and contrary to the government’s duty to ensure the sustainability of the population now and into the future.
Even the economic case for the spring bear hunt is weak. In its ERO posting, the government states that the economic impact is expected to be neutral or positive, but it provides no evidence in support of this claim. The posting also fails to reference financial benefits associated with promoting eco-tourism and encouraging visitors to view and photograph, rather than shoot, these majestic animals. Many have questioned whether the proposal will have any significant financial benefit.
Stop the spring bear hunt!  There is no cultural or economic justification for allowing hunters to lure hungry black bears using bait and shoot these unsuspecting animals for sport.
The government’s argument in favour of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt:  That it will provide certainty to hunters and tourist outfitters.  Despicable!  Given the disastrous consequences of the hunt for bears and cubs across the province, a desire for certainty is hardly a justification. Certainty would best be achieved by permanently cancelling this cruel and unnecessary killing game, instead of bowing to the powerful hunting lobby instead.

I urge Ontario Progressive Conservative Party legislators to follow the example provided by former Premier Mike Harris and Minister John Snobelen, when they courageously resisted pressure from hunting lobbyists, a group that does not represent the majority of Ontarians.
Governmental support for sport hunting might gain votes in some ridings, but will surely lose voters’ support in other ridings of Ontario.

If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants.
Bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species.
The government has disclosed a need to reduce black bear hunting in Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to population concerns, yet it is simultaneously proposing to allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week each spring. This is irresponsible.
Even the economic argument for allowing the hunt is weak. The government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, but has provided no evidence to support this claim

44538,/comment/44538,"Dear Sirs,
I am writing to oppose the proposed permanent Spring bear hunt.
There are factors that need be taken into consideration. A hunter is not able to know that he shot a female bear before the kill. Mother bears may leave alone their cubs in trees and roam in order to forage. Therefore it is reasonably expected that many mothers will be killed unintentionally and many vulnerable orphans will be at the mercy of predators or perish due to exposure or starvation.
There is a lot of intentional misinformation that makes the public fear bears and want to have them killed. The truth is that bears are more afraid of people and only want to protect themselves and their territory. People need to know that bears are sentient beings, basically timid and rarely aggressive.
Hunters themselves need to be educated about bears especially about mothers and how they raise their cubs in order to avoid unnecessary killings.
As regards concerns that bears kill moose, this is not true. Such incidents are rare and have no effect on moose population.
If you proceed to spring bear hunt, then please consider this to take place later on, in June, so that mothers and cubs stand a better chance.
Taking this opportunity I would also point out that the fall hunting season is also disastrous for the cubs. Cubs that are orphaned during that period have a slim chance of survival in the coming winter. In most cases they are condemned to die of hunger and exposure.
I also oppose baiting- this should not take place at all; but if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season. In addition, stricter limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
I would also ask you to stop the use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears. This is barbaric and causes tremendous stress and torture to a basically harmless creature.
It should be very clear and publicly acknowledged that bear hunt has nothing to do with public safety. Hunting does not reduce human-bear conflict. When people are educated about bears, do not leave attractants and food accessible to the bears, then conflicts will be minimized.
Education, correct and updated information, enforcement of regulations about respect for wildlife will ensure that all people will be able to enjoy nature and co-exist peacefully with the bears.
Thank you for taking the time to review this comment.

44539,/comment/44539,"I have many concerns relating to the Ontario spring bear hunt. As a long time resident of Ontario, I vote that it be abolished. If that cannot happen, I request that consideration be given to making changes, as follows:
1. Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
2. The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
3. Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
4. Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
5. Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
6. The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict
7. A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
8. A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

It is time you start to invest in a feeding program that would pick up road kill, freeze it and than take it to remote areas and air drop during the summer. This would keep bears away from easy food.

Please, do not follow the misguided plan laid out by previous governments led by another party. And, please note that even though the previous government callously expanded the Spring Bear Hunt pilot project, they still lost power.
When governments do too much to satisfy lobbyists, like those that promote pro-hunting commercial interests, it’s no guarantee that they will win or keep power. Most Ontarians do not hunt, nor do they support sport hunting. Most Ontarians want our public lands to be free of violence.
I urge Ontario Progressive Conservative Party legislators to follow the example provided by former Premier Mike Harris and Minister John Snobelen, when they courageously resisted pressure from hunting lobbyists, a group that does not represent the majority of Ontarians.
Governmental support for sport hunting might gain votes in some ridings, but will surely lose voters’ support in other ridings of Ontario.
A modern province can develop a better tourism plan than inviting non-resident sport hunters who enjoy killing wildlife, animals who have little hope of escape, onto our mutually owned public lands. Ontario’s forests belong to all of us, not just to the businesses that profit from violence against wild animals.

44555,/comment/44555,"The proposal to reinstate a spring bear hunt on the Bruce (Saugeen) Peninsula is ill-conceived and runs counter to several of the Ministry's own guidelines.
The black bear population on the peninsula is a discrete, isolated and vulnerable estimated population of no more than 300 individuals. It faces pressure from increasing recreational development, changing land use strategies and habitat fragmentation. The species is an integral part of the natural heritage of this part of Ontario that is recognized both within the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve and the Bruce Peninsula National Park.
Without careful management to ensure the species' future, not as a hunting opportunity, but as a unique and valued living heritage, is at risk. The decline to vulnerability and ultimate extinction is inevitable!
The ministry recognizes the priority for conservation in the accompanying Black Bear Management Framework that outlines the case for management and reinstatement of a spring hunt across Ontario.
In the introduction, the opening statement states:
     ""Black bears are highly valued and unique members of Ontario’s wildlife heritage, symbols of         wilderness, an integral part of a functioning ecosystem, and an important component of Ontario’s biodiversity.""  * all quotations are taken directly from theMinistry proposal.
That statement is reinforced (Sec. 2.1)
     ""An enhanced black bear management program will contribute to the conservation of black bears and their habitat and, in doing so, assist Ontario in achieving biodiversity conservation goals to (1) protect the genetic, species and ecosystem diversity of Ontario. . ."".
The bears on the peninsula represent a unique genetic pool and are of importance, in terms of  understanding species as a whole, and its evolution within the province.  As with the species as a whole, they also exhibit  (Sec.4.4):
      "". . . relatively slow reproductive capacity relative to other harvested large mammals. . . "" .
These two factors combined indicate the importance of maintaining as diverse a breeding stock as possible, especially within such an isolated population.  A hunt would diminish, rather than enhance success a process.
Finally, the final section of the Ministry statement (Sec 6.10) advises:
      ""Black bear populations will be managed at the appropriate landscape scale within an ecosystem context.""
In that context,  the limited parameters of the Bruce Peninsula require stable, productive and secure habitats. This is paramount, as pressures escalate against the population; habitat loss, changing agriculture that has seen cask crops replace grazing and the long term existence of meadows, and forests that have seen the loss of American Beech with their critical production of nuts - a staple of bear diets are all negative forces facing the population.
The Bruce Peninsula black bear population is an integral, part of this unique region that lies within a two to three hours drive of 80% of Ontario's population.  It requires discrete and supportive management recognizing its unique challenges,  Its future, more than any other of its species in Ontario, is dependent on such management.
The ministry should consider protection and conservation for long term security of the population, a priority, not hunting!.  A spring hunt on the Bruce, might meet the requests of a handful of hunters, but at what cost to the population of this remarkable survivor?  Bear hunting on the Bruce should banned completely!

Yes or No?
A big NO!
Not sure why this is still considered okay.  Why mess with mother nature further.  If we stopped messing with the balance of things, over time, this would correct itself.  If there is not enough food for animals they will naturally die off and the strong survive, not saying that starvation is right but it is nature's way to keep things in balance.  A bumper year in rabbits = more foxes and coyotes for a few years, the rabbit populations go down, so the fox and coyote population.  As a Canadian mom, I raised my kids to respect all life.  Maybe it's time for others to do the same.

44558,/comment/44558,"Of the elements in the proposal, I agree with the updates to black bear regulations to improve fairness.
While I appreciate the economic considerations behind the spring bear hunt itself, I am against it and here is why:
1. It will result in orphaned bear cubs.  While it is illegal to kill mother bears with cubs, often mother bears with young cubs will have them stay in trees while she forages, which can be a kilometre or more away.  In that situation, a hunter would only see a lone bear and, not being able to tell it is a mother bear, legally would be able to kill it.  The result would be orphaned cubs dying slowly of starvation.  This defeats the whole purpose of prohibiting killing mother bears and, more significantly, is really cruel.
2. This possibility runs counter to the fourth Guiding Principle of the OMNR Black Bear Management Framework:
""Harvest management strategies must recognize that black bears have an inherently low reproductive capacity relative to other harvested large mammals and that, as with other long-lived species, population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females.""
Since the spring bear hunt threatens mother bears with young cubs, by allowing the spring bear hunt to continue in perpetuity the OMNR is violating one of its own Guiding Principles.

44562,/comment/44562,"I believe it is not wise to bring back the regular black bear hunt.  The main reason is that the cubs are too young in the spring to travel with their mother when she is foraging for food which means the hunters are  killing black bear mothers.  Hunters cannot determine at a distance if a black bear is a male or a female, they'll assume that it's a female if no cubs are present but the cubs do not follow the mother in the spring, they'll stay behind up in a tree.  This is devastating for the bear population with bear cubs being orphaned, doesn't the government and hunters want to make sure that the population stays healthy and that the cubs get a chance to grow into adulthood?  The regular spring bear hunt should not return, but if sadly it does, the very least that the government can do is push back the hunting date to june 1 and not make it last more than a month.

~ ""The conclusion of most biologists is that it is quite difficult to accurately determine nursing status of free-ranging black bears, even when a bear is in a tree or at bait. The appearance of nursing females in the kill each spring supports this notion.""
Hunters claim that Spring Bear Hunts don't leave dependent cubs orphaned, just because there is a regulation to protect them. But in the discussion paper written by five staffers with various Fish and Wildlife agencies in the United States they tell us that such regulations are not that reliable.
""Proponents of spring hunting usually point out that most states protect females with cubs by regulation. The regulation looks good on paper but is very difficult to implement in the field because of bear behavior.""
This paper, titled: ""Sociological and Ethical Considerations of Black Bear Hunting"" and was written by five staffers with Fish and Wildlife agencies in Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, California and Montana. We have this document as a paper file, and it does not appear to be available online. Nevertheless, the  statements quoted in this post have been reproduced verbatim.
The writers of the discussion paper are: Thomas D. I. Beck, David S. Moody, Donald B. Koch, John J. Beecham, Gary R. Olson, Timothy Burton.
In addition I believe this decision is based on monetary revenue gain for the province and is in favour of a small group of people that enjoy hunting.  It is not in the interest of those in the majoroty who don't participate, believe in or support these activities.  I believe ecotourism where all the animals live is more lucrative than killing.

44567,/comment/44567,"Thanks for allowing public comment in regards to the proposed changes for the hunting of black bear.  Here's what I'd like to say as a non-resident landowner:
The number one concern when making such a change should be the resource itself.  If the proposed changes are necessary for the proper management of bears, then do what you have to do.  If they're not (and aren't based on biological or scientific reasoning) then please reconsider.  Economics are certainly important but they shouldn't be the driving force to strip non-resident landowners of the privilege we've had for many many years.  Granting that privilege accomplishes a lot more than just shooting a bear and to take it away is only going to hurt.
We currently own two parcels of land near Iron Bridge -- a 500 acre piece and a small lot.  We've owned the land for almost 20 years and bought it to hunt and fish.  The bear privilege was a HUGE consideration  when making the purchase and four families became involved.  We can get  two over-the-counter bear tags every year and rotate the tags to anyone who's on the deeds and ready to hunt.  The tags are often like gold and kids eagerly wait to turn 16.  Wives have also grabbed a tag at times to learn about bears and their habits.  I know we could go to an outfitter to get some of the same experience but money would dictate otherwise and it's not just about sitting in a tree stand to kill a critter.  The current privilege allows a lot more and increases the overall value by ten-fold.  Adults and children have spent countless hours getting involved (even when they don't hold a tag) and the love for nature and appreciation of bears has grown.  It's quite a tradition at our camp and one I wouldn't want to lose.  People in today's world are moving further and further away from deep rooted traditions like hunting and fishing and it's getting tougher and tougher to retain the youth.  I guarantee that whats been happening at our camp for the past 20 years has only helped and it's something for the MNR to consider.  The tradition will definitely continue if we can purchase over-the-counter tags in the years to come and kids will pass it to future generations.  They'll also tell others about their experience and Ontario will be held in a positive light.  Bears are synonymous with Ontario and what we're currently allowed to do has brought others into the fold as well.  Non-hunting relatives and friends also spend time at our bear hunting camp and relish the chance bait, sit next to the man with the gun and learn about bears and their ways .  They'd probably never learn anything about bears at all if we didn't have the current privilege and to strip it away would hurt a lot of people.  Please don't crush tradition, distance youth and non-hunters from what's important and push others away from the natural world.
Another thing to consider is what we've personally done to help the bears and their habitat.  The guys at our camp spend time and money to improve the land and it benefits a lot of wildlife.  We tend food plots every year, prune apple trees, do things to improve berry production and tackle other projects that help bears in many ways.  I'm sure we'd still do those things if the over-the-counter privilege were lost but it certainly wouldn't happen if we were to sell -- something we've recently talked about if the privilege is taken.
A lot of the money we spend in Ontario is directly related to the bears and our privilege to hunt with over-the-counter tags.  We pump A LOT into the local economy (more than anyone who might go to an outfitter for a week) and it wouldn't be the same if the proposed change is passed.  Our money spent is spread across the board and everyone reaps the benefit.
Please think about the things I've said as you move forward and if you have to make a change please consider these options:
** A grandfather clause that would allow current non-resident landowners to retain the over-the-counter privilege without having to hook up with an outfitter and/or,
** A minimum parcel size that would allow the current privilege to continue
Thanks for Listening !!

Many violations go undetected unless the OMNR does a blitz, because there are not enough enforcement officers. In November of 2007 they had 2 blitzes. On one blitz, in Kenora, the OMNR laid 115 charges. In the other, in Bancroft, they laid another 67 charges. These hunters were most likely convicted in 2008.

44603,/comment/44603,"Je suis contre la proposition du gouvernement de réintroduire la chasse printanière à l'ours. Voici mes raisons:
Les ours ont un faible taux de reproduction, donc il est primordial que les femelles ne soient pas tuées.
Si la chasse à l'ours devient permanente, il y aura beaucoup d'oursons orphelins. Il est interdit de tuer des femelles ou des oursons, mais souvent les femelles laissent leurs oursons derrière pour aller chercher de la nourriture. Les chasseurs vont donc pouvoir tuer ces femelles et vont laisser des oursons orphelins qui vont ensuite mourir d'une mort souffrante.
Tuer les ours ne va pas renforcer la sécurité des humains. Renforcer la sécurité doit se faire en réduisant l'accès aux ours aux poubelles et autres sources de nourriture en ville et en périphérie.
Votre gouvernement se contredit. Vous dites vouloir préserver la population d'ours dans la péninsule de Saugeen-Bruce, mais vous proposer en même temps la chasse à l'ours sans restriction. Ceci est irresponsable.
L'argumentaire économique de votre gouvernement est faible et sans preuves. Il n'y a aucun bénéfice économique clair qui supporterait la réintroduction de la chasse aux ours.

44608,/comment/44608,"February 16, 2020
I am writing in strong opposition to the PROPOSED CHANGES TO BLACK BEAR HUNTING REGULATIONS – Environmental Registry of Ontario Number: 019-1112.
Since the termination of the “Spring Black Bear Season” in 1999, groups such as the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and some tourism operators have encouraged the public to report any and all “problematic” human/bear interactions to the MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND FORESTRY (MNRF) or police. Thus, people have related incidents that would previously have been unreported (e.g., bears moving through private, rural properties), which were then highlighted by the media. Consequently, negative incidents have been emphasized and exaggerated, giving the impression that there has been both an increase in black-bear populations and in troublesome interactions between bears and people since 1999. Establishment of the MNRF Nuisance Bear Review Committee further encouraged input on any negative human/bear interactions, which likely overstated the true numbers of these occurrences and resulted in inaccurate data.
Any conclusions that are drawn from this imprecise reporting data are, therefore, highly suspect because there is no way to determine whether or not there has been genuine growth in the number of troublesome human/bear contacts, or if this “supposed” growth is simply a result of an increase in the number of incidents that have been reported. It is also noteworthy that many so-called problematic encounters that people have with bears are the result of carelessness on the part of humans (e.g., improper garbage disposal – which may encourage bears to come in close proximity to cottages and homes). This is why the “Bear Wise” program has been such a useful educational tool.
During extremely dry summers in Ontario, the quantity and variety of food sources for bears has been reduced. Consequently, bears have had to travel further (and to non-traditional sites) in search of food, which increased the likelihood that people would see them. This is not necessarily indicative of an increase in bear populations, but simply a reflection of the number of bear sightings. For example, several people may have several different sightings of an individual bear – yet, this could be reported as sightings of multiple bears. One person could also have multiple sightings of an individual bear, and again this could be assumed to be multiple bears, thereby inaccurately inflating bear population numbers.
I can also comment on human/bear interactions from an anecdotal standpoint, because I live in a rural area near Parry Sound. Since 1999, my family has seen fewer bears – either on our property or during our wilderness excursions (e.g., hiking and canoe trips). I have also previously lived in (or near) the pilot-project target communities of Timmins, Thunder Bay, and North Bay, and have never experienced a negative encounter with a black bear. In addition, I know many people who currently live in all of the pilot-project communities. None of them (or their friends and acquaintances) have personally experienced an increase in the number of negative human/bear interactions over the last two decades. They have, however, confirmed that an embellished and inaccurate approach has been utilized in their districts to artificially increase the number of negative human/bear interactions which are reported.
Furthermore, there appears to be substantial difficulty in accurately determining baseline bear populations. I’ve read estimates from differing sources that vary significantly in this regard. This imprecision therefore results in “sustainable” harvesting figures which result from guesswork, at best. Add to this the fact that it is extremely difficult to accurately determine the mortality rate for bears within a particular year from natural causes or human activities (e.g., traffic fatalities, poaching). Decisions regarding the number of bears which can be harvested on an annual basis (while maintaining a biologically-healthy population) are, therefore, based upon insufficient data. The MNRF reports that bear populations are “healthy”, but provides no evidence to support this assertion.
The “Spring Black Bear Season” is also a significant problem from a biological standpoint. Although harvesting female bears with cubs is prohibited, it is not always possible to determine the gender of a bear from a distance (and female bears do not always keep their cubs where they can be seen by hunters). If mother bears are killed, their orphaned cubs will mostly likely die, as well. Hence the bear population is depleted in two ways. The difficulty in attempting to estimate this depletion arises from the fact that the number of orphaned cubs is really an unknown entity. Another unknown factor regarding mortality is the number of bears which are killed annually due to poaching. Thus, the number of black-bear fatalities cannot be determined with any degree of precision. Again, this makes it extremely problematic to accurately determine the mortality rate for bears, thereby resulting in harvesting figures which are determined from inaccurate and/or incomplete data.
Another serious issue regarding the “Spring Black Bear Season” is that it is simply unethical. How can one possibly assert that it is ""sporting"" to place bait to lure weak and hungry bears, who have recently emerged from hibernation, at sites where hunters are waiting to shoot them? Killing bears when they are at their most vulnerable (and when some have cubs) indicates a definite lack of concern with respect to ensuring that hunting activities are implemented in a sustainable, ethical, and humane manner.
Despite the fact that hunters and some people in the tourism industry desire certainty on the future of the spring season, their self-serving demands should not be the over-riding concern regarding the proposed reinstatement of the “Spring Black Bear Season”. They have access to ample bear-harvesting opportunities during other times of the year.
In conclusion, there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that killing black bears during the spring would not be problematic with respect to maintaining biologically-sustainable bear populations in Ontario, or that this practice will improve human safety and/or reduce nuisance-bear activity. Supporting materials listed on the ERO website are simply MNRF policy documents and regulations. They include no studies from the Ministry (or anyone else) to support this proposal. Thus, in keeping with ecological precautionary principles, the “Spring Black Bear Season” should never be reinstated. Furthermore, the current pilot program should be discontinued in all provincial Wildlife Management Units in which it was established in 2014 and 2016.

Female bears emerging from dens on their own will be attracted to bait and will be killed, leaving cubs behind to starve.
Please consider points made in Proceedings of the Fifth Western Black Bear Workshop, 1996  “Sociological and Ethical Considerations of Black Bear Hunting”  https://www.animalalliance.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/report_1996_Be…
“Rationale Against Spring Seasons
[…….]
1.	It is ethically wrong to hunt during a time when females are nursing young because of orphaning and subsequent death of cubs.
2.	It is wrong to harass bears during a critical period for them physiologically.
3.	Bears are too vulnerable in the spring because of their concentration in limited habitat and declining physical condition.
4.	Spring seasons contribute to harming other natural resources.  Road damage and stream siltation are two examples.
5.	Agencies lose credibility for supporting spring seasons.
I am persuaded by the ethical argument alone against a spring hunting season.  Although there are other factors to consider such as:
•	evidence shows that the spring bear hunt does not reduce human-bear conflict
•	a hunt that targets postpartum females threatens the sustainability of the population of this species
•	there might well be a stronger regional economic benefit from the presence of black bears, and other wildlife species, if eco-tourism, rather than hunting, were promoted
the unethical nature of the hunt, and the damage it does to Ontario’s reputation are sufficiently compelling for me.
The correct decision was made in 1999 to end the spring bear hunt in Ontario.  Please be the government that does the right thing again in 2020.

They then have orphans which usually die.  The sport hunters bait the traps. The bears are very hungry after the winter.  The sport hunters  then take up a 'blind'  ( usually high into the tree's canopy to conceal
 themselves).  When the bear appear,shoot them off without ANY sport at all.  It is just the joy of killing that they experience.  Next, the killer instinct will be heading into school yards to get the joy of 'killing'.  All forms of killing must be STOPPED.  There MUST be a balance in nature.

Ontario already makes $50.6 million a year on hunting.  An increase on hunting leads to more people and vehicles in many already stressed environments and habitats.  At a time when many animal populations are threatened and in decline here and around the world, adding more humans and machinery and guns to these habitats can only lead to more damage to habitats and stress to local populations of various wildlife.
It has been really nice to see the black bear population increasing over the years and it is nice to have several large species of healthy populations of wild mammals and birds in Ontario.  This alone draws large tourism.

44648,/comment/44648,"The spring bear hunt should not be re-introduced. Hunters are not skilled enough to humanely kill animals. In veterinary medicine, we have researched effective and humane methods of euthanizing various species of animals so that it is quick and painless (i.e., humane). There is no equivalent humane method for hunters and many animals are injured and die days later (i.e., inhumane death).
Hunters value their safety and thus they use bait and then sit in stands above the bait waiting for bears to visit. It is difficult to differentiate female and male bears from above or even on the ground. This invariably results in the death of nursing females and orphaned cubs that die, are killed, or need to be saved by rescue organizations.
Black bears are everywhere in British Columbia, and the residents of this province are able to go about their daily lives with few problems. The exception are bears that people feed - a man-made problem.  So the argument that hunting serves to control bear numbers for human safety is ridiculous.
I know one of the researchers who investigated the results of the spring bear hunt before it was banned. The conclusion was that the spring bear hunt was disastrous with many orphaned cubs that died or needed to be rescued. I would like to think that Canadian society is a bit more progressive, and that the spring bear hunt remains banned.

44653,/comment/44653,"On behalf of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance(NOSA), a 5000 plus member hunting, fishing, trapping and conservation advocacy group; I wish to extend our organization's full support for the measures recommended in this proposal.
Since the initial cancellation of the spring bear hunt in 1999, NOSA has been vocal in our support of spring bear hunting as a sound management tool for maintaining healthy numbers of black bears on the Ontario landscape. Ontario's bear population is healthy, it is growing and it deserves to be treated with value, as all other large game species in the province are. When bears are not hunted, they are no longer regarded with value, they are less protected and treated as vermin. This scenario contributes to wasteful shooting of bears during the three seasons that they are out of the den. Statistics have demonstrated unequivocally that orphaning rates are in fact measurable and real, when bears are not hunted but have to be shot by enforcement agencies or MNR technicians to protect human lives and property. This wasteful and unfortunate trend is reduced significantly when bears are hunted in the spring, under strict regulations and with mandatory reporting rules to track harvest much more effectively.
The Ontario spring bear hunt is widely recognized as a successful management tool, to keep bear numbers from becoming too high. NOSA has argued that the spring bear hunt acted to target larger male bears, thus controlling their numbers, concentrating them near bait locations and minimizing dangerous nuisance encounters in communities closest to geographic regions of the highest bear densities. Certainly this is perhaps the most significant reason that many northern and rural Ontario communities and municipalities repeatedly lobbied the Ontario Government, to return the spring bear hunt.
The socio-economic benefits of a well managed and highly regulated conservation tool such as the spring bear hunt, also cannot be ignored. NOSA estimates the spring bear hunt contributes over 35-40 million dollars to the Ontario economy, and it contributes significantly important revenue to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Special Purpose Account(SPA). For this reason, NOSA also supports the proposal and we encourage OMNRF to work with the provincial Big Game Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC) to continue to examine ways to offer more opportunity for the non-resident bear hunting tourism industry (TI) to sustainably maximize and expand bear hunting opportunity where feasible in Ontario to do so.
As for the pieces of the proposal related to reducing hunting season length in the WMU's of the Bruce Peninsula, NOSA is in support of such measures provided there is continued monitoring and an adaptive management approach taken, to allow for expanding bear hunting opportunities in the Bruce Peninsula region, if necessary in future to regulate bear population growth.
In reference to the proposal for provisions for those offering bear hunting/guiding services, to be licensed in some manner, NOSA supports this proposed regulation and management of would be tourism guides, where necessary to do so. It is acknowledged that in parts of the NER and SER there is significant overlap and conflict between some licensed service providers and non-licensed service providers and this is causing a negative impact to some well established and authorized bear hunt operators(BMA holders). Appropriate measures should be taken to regulate this to minimize or eliminate conflict.
NOSA would add to this proposal statement that we also support a complete review of the allocation of bear harvest to BMA holders across Ontario, so that this allocation is done according to a standard method of determining how many bear harvest certificates/Form 33's may be allocated to BMA operators from Region to region. Currently the allocation of Form 33's is a very inconsistently managed process, and there is extreme variation of how Form 33's are allocated from one BMA to the next. NOSA would encourage OMNRF to continue to work with BGMAC to find ways to administer Form 33's fairly, consistently and transparently across the province.
Lastly, NOSA wishes to thank Hon. Minister John Yakabuski for allowing this proposal to go forth to the public for comment and consideration. Clearly the Minister has listened to various stakeholder groups who have asked for this to take place, since 1999. We will continue to support the Minister on this proposal as it continues to move forward.

44654,/comment/44654,"I am strongly opposed to the Ontario government’s desire to bring back the spring bear hunt.
Here a few points that are common knowlege, but need to be repeated in the face of this new proposal:
*) There is a high risk of orphaning bear cubs who would be left to die an inhumane and cruel death - cubs do not follow their mothers on food gathering trips early in spring, and hunter/trappers cannot determine a bear's gender until it is too late.
*) Hunting lobbies in Ontario purport that bears are responsible for the decline in moose populations - this is blatant ""false news"" as bears are primarily vegetarian/pescatarian.
*) There is also no evidence that spring bear hunt reduces human-bear conflict, according to the 2003 Nuisance Bear Review Committee (see link).
*) As there is already a legal fall hunting season, there is no excuse for bringing back the spring hunt. It should be banned and remain banned.
*) In the ERO posting it was noted there is a need to reduce black bear hunting on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to serious conservation concerns. Allowing any hunting of black bears on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula is irresponsible and contrary to the government’s duty to ensure the sustainability of the population now and into the future.
*) Finally, if you have children or grandchildren who are fans of bears and bear cubs, as a politician can you honestly look into their eyes, knowing that many cute bear cubs will painfully starve to death, and that you did nothing to stop that?
Hopefully the government of Ontario sees that the proposal for spring bear hunting is in contradiction to its duty to protect our natural resources, and will not follow through with the changes.

44655,/comment/44655,"I strongly oppose the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt and believe any future hunts should be permanently cancelled.
It has been observed that “nuisance bear occurrences increased in the first two years of the spring bear hunt in most districts where it was allowed in 2014 and 2015.” (Nuisance bear incidents increased with spring bear hunt, Toronto Star, April 26, 2016.)
https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/04/26/nuisance-bear-inc…
Also, it has been established that the biggest threat to bear populations during the spring bear hunt is the killing of nursing females. Tom Beck is a former bear biologist from the Colorado Division of Wildlife. He has spoken about his research and the problems associated with  spring bear hunting.
“The biggest issue is the killing of nursing female black bears. There is no way to prevent this from happening in a spring bear season, either through hunter education or timing of season. …The conclusion of most biologists is that it is quite difficult to accurately determine nursing status on free-ranging black bears, even when a bear is not in a tree or at a bait. The appearance of nursing females in the kill each spring supports this notion. Proponents of spring hunting usually point out that most states protect females with cubs by regulation. The regulation looks good on paper but is very difficult to implement in the field because of bear behavior.” (Beck et al – “Sociological and Ethical Considerations of Black Bear Hunting” from the Proceedings of the Western Black Bear Workshop. Pages 119-131 published in 1995.)
The recreational killing of wildlife is antithetical to the values of contemporary society. The majority of Ontario residents do not hunt and it is poor public policy to allow defenseless wildlife to be used as moving targets. So-called blood sports are no sport at all and there is no benefit to the resumption for public safety. For these reasons, it makes no sense to allow the killing of bears in the spring. Doing so is only a politically motivated decision and not one based on science or the public interest and is thus indefensible.

I am commenting on this hunt while at the same time wondering what century we are in. It seems to me that the practice of hunting wild animals using baiting and dogs and not paying attention to the gender of the animal in the hunter's crosshairs is more than wrong. It speaks very poorly of the person holding the gun.
Female bears often have cubs at this time and while they are not supposed to be targeted, we know they are leaving the cubs to fend for themselves and often dying slowly from starvation. What part of any of this is humane?
I urge the banning of the hunt outright.

Reducing bear count has no impact on human safety. Stopping bears invading human living areas is achieved by removing the lure of open garbage bins, BBQs, outdoor pet food bowls, and other enticing food sources.
Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if spring trophy hunting continues - with weight on the term ""trophy"". Bears fresh out of hibernation are not usable as food, being malnourished at this time.
Trappers and hunters cannot determine if a bear is male or female until the bear has been killed. Because bears have low reproduction rates, the survival of females is vital for conservation.
Bears in the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula area are endangered. The irresponsible slaughtering during spring will end up with bear extinction in the region.

Any change in policy, along the government's efforts in time and money to improvement said policy, should always be rooted in yielding a net positive impact for Canadians. However, there is no evidence to support that this proposal will achieve a net positive impact or resolve key issues, given the following issues:
- The economic argument for allowing the hunt is unfounded. While the government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, no evidence has been provided to support this claim. If the government wants to institute new policies that result in the harm of wildlife and promotion of firearm usage, it has a responsibility to provide supporting evidence and a case that substantiates a net benefit
- Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Rather, stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants. If safety is the core issue, the solution / proposed policy should be a different, and already proven one
- Back in 1999, this practice was outlawed because bear cubs were being orphaned after their mothers were shot to death. Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent.

44677,/comment/44677,"I have lived in Northwestern Ontario since 1974 and am married to a man who was born in Northwestern Ontario. We have three sons and two grandchildren. None of us are bear hunters. We are all outdoor enthusiasts, spending time wildlife viewing, hiking, paddling,  fishing, snowshoeing, camping and cross-country skiing. We don't want to see hunters returning with loaded guns and other dangerous weapons to our forests in the spring. It is bad enough that our forestry roads and forests are crawling with hunters and their loaded guns in the fall. During hunting season, we have to avoid hiking and wildlife viewing where hunters are staked out or driving through.
I am a naturalist and an avid bird watcher. I belong to a group of naturalists and also a ladies' hiking group. Spring is the best time for birders. We love to explore different areas and record the bird species as we hike, mainly identifying birds by their song. I am now a senior and have covered many kilometres  through forests on and off trails. I am expert at exploring off trail with a GPS. I have never had a problem with a bear. I am more terrified of people with loaded guns. Spring should be a time for ecotourism in Northwestern Ontario, not the return of  American hunters in camouflage clothing bearing dangerous weapons.
Bear hunters place stinky bait to attract bears. Not only is this unfair to bears but bear baiting makes it dangerous for naturalists like myself. Twice I have found bear bait on different islands. One was on a canoe trip, the other on a fishing trip. Both islands were good destinations for hiking  and camping. Bear baiting should never be permitted on sites that are hiking, picnic or camping destinations.
I was overjoyed when the spring bear hunt was stopped. I am very upset that this government has given in to a small number of gun lovers who want more months of the year to kill our wildlife. Not only will the spring bear hunt result in orphan bear cubs but it will increase wildlife poaching on our Crown forests. Most likely many of the bear hunters are not ethical hunters and will use birds and other wildlife for target practice. Spring is the time of the year when moose and deer give birth. Returning the spring bear hunt will add to their stress. We have a dog who is terrified whenever he hears a gun fired. You have to ask yourself, what kind of human being, puts out bear bait and sits in a tree stand waiting to pull the trigger on some unsuspecting bear. If that person were respectful of wildlife, they would be trying to capture a close-up photo of a bear eating natural food in its habitat. Capturing a close-up of a bear , armed only with a camera would take real guts. I detest the kind of tourists that the spring bear hunt attracts.
Northwestern Ontario has more than enough tourism in the spring with all the fishing lodges. Not only will gun-loving tourists  be returning  if the spring bear hunt goes ahead, but spring hunting will provide an opportunity for local poachers  and other disrespectful gun activity to occur.  Twice a summer a visiting relative of a neighbour across the bay from our cabin shoots off a gun that sounds like an assault rifle, terrifying us, our dog and our neighbours. If the spring bear hunt returns that idiot will be hunting bears in the spring. The Americans who own hunting property near our cabin most likely will be returning for a spring bear hunt. We don't mind the American fishermen but a return of the spring bear hunt will have a negative impact on our outdoor life and a negative impact on wildlife populations.
If the spring bear hunt returns, many more conservation officers should be hired to enforce the laws and monitor the hunt. Returning the spring bear hunt is not a good wildlife policy. It is entirely political to appease the gun lobbyists of the right wing.

44683,/comment/44683,"I oppose these changes for a number of reasons and urge the government to not implement this plan.
First, the Spring Bear Hunt results in orphaned bear cubs. There is no denying this - hunters make mistakes and kill mothers with cubs even though regulations were designed to prevent this from happening. Mother bears are known to forage without their cubs in the spring and the ability to determine the sex of a bear is not easy and will result in females being killed and cubs being orphaned. This is inhumane but also adversely affects bear populations.
The proposal recognizes populations being in decline on the Bruce Peninsula but fails to limit or acknowledge the hunting impacts in other areas of the province. The fall hunting season has doubled in length in some places since the spring hunt was cancelled so to reinstate the spring hunt now means that the bears are under pressure for a much longer time each year (the fall season is from 2 1/2 to 3 months long depending on the location and now adding another 6 weeks in spring increases the total hunting season to 4-5 months) This will add stress that has not been seen since before management strategies were in place and I'm not at all convinced that it allows for sustainable bear populations.
It is known that black bears have one of the longest reproductive cycles of any land mammal in North America. Females only have cubs every 2 to 3 years and do not reach breeding age until they are 5 years old. Bear populations are known to be vulnerable and to fluctuate in seasons when food is scarce and due to hunting pressure. I have not seen anything in the regulation about monitoring of populations. Putting additional pressure on the bear populations at a time when we are experiencing climactic changes is not a responsible approach given the difficulty of knowing actual population data.
In the government documents on management it clearly states: ""life history traits of black bears make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of landscape level management actions and the ecological sustainability of populations. The adequacy of inventory, monitoring and assessment activities to support management decisions needs to be routinely reviewed to ensure that black bear populations are sustained and that there is an appropriate landscape and ecologically based approach...and,
""research has shown that no more than 40% of female bears should be represented in the annual harvest if the management objective is to maintain current population levels (Yodzis and Kolenosky 1986, Howe et al. 2007, McLaren et al. 2008)""
In data gathered regarding hunter harvesting, it was found that already 30-35% of bears killed were female so it seems very risky to me to open up the spring hunt and It's crucial that decisions of this sort are based on ecological principles and accurate data and not economically driven. The Enhanced Black Bear Management Strategy of Ontario clearly states this : ""Ongoing monitoring and research is critical for informed decision-making, sound policy development and implementing an adaptive management approach. Research should focus on addressing key knowledge gaps and risk assessment, as well as evaluating the effects of specific management actions on bear populations on the landscape and on their habitat. Population management decisions, and the assessment of their impacts, should occur on an ecologically based, landscape level.""
In summary, opening up the spring bear hunt is not following these ecological principles. It fails to acknowledge actual pressures on bears that are affecting their populations.
A quote from the management documents (EFFM 2009)
""1. The black bear’s inherently slow rate of recovery from low population levels increases the risks for local populations where harvest pressure and other mortality are high.
2. It is difficult to estimate black bear population size and trends.
3. Humans and bears can be in conflict, and there is a need to find ways to reduce human-bear conflicts while recognizing the importance of bears from a biodiversity perspective.
4. Black bear harvest is currently managed under a relatively open allocation system where tourist outfitter harvest can be limited.""
and later in the document,
""Black bear populations throughout Ontario may be affected by the predicted effects of climate change due to rising air temperatures and decreased precipitation. This could contribute to increasingly frequent droughts and less food for bears.""
In conclusion, I would like to see current and future management policies reflect these realities.
Black bear management needs to focus on reducing human-bear conflicts by investing in coexistence education. Policies such as bear baiting increase the incidence of ""problem bears"" and the number of bears killed because of problem behavior creates additional stress on bear populations. Please base management decisions on sound data and ecological policies.

44700,/comment/44700,"I am a life-long resident of Ontario and I believe the spring bear hunt should be abolished.
A bear hunt in the spring is too early in the year.  Mother bears roam at that time of of year in search of food for the cubs, while the cubs are hidden in the trees, sometimes up to a kilometre away.  As a result, hunters kill mother bears, leaving the cubs abandoned and left to starve to death.
It should also be noted that the bear hunt will not reduce nuisance bear issues.  Research shows that the spring bear hunt will not help reduce human-bear conflicts.  Misinformation has been spread about bears leading to an increased fear towards bears.  Bear attacks are extremely rare.  Educating the public with truthful, factual information about bears is greatly needed.  More Conservation Officers in this province are needed to help with education and enforcement.

44714,/comment/44714,"I am opposed to the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt.
 It is time for the government to change the way in which revenues are generated from hunting. I feel that sport hunting of large mammals in Ontario should be banned. Since the 1800's large predators have been extirpated through sport hunting, trapping, and urban development. No longer are there populations of Black bear, Eastern cougar, Lynx, Timber wolf, Fisher and Marten in central and southern Ontario, only remnant populations exist in norther portions of the province. The loss of these significant species has drastically altered the natural environment, negatively impacting native species of animals, birds and vegetation that  once comprised central and southern Ontario.
The Black bear is one of the last large predators left in parts of Ontario. They play an important role in the diversity and health of the ecosystem. Their population should be protected not reduced. Stronger efforts should be made to educate the public in co-existing with Black bears to reduce bear/human conflicts. Having worked as a Conservation Officer in the past, I have had the opportunity to observe bears in their natural habitat. They are entertaining and often gentle creatures living mostly on vegetation foraged from the forest and open areas. Without human interference they live in balance with nature.
Instead of licensing guides and hunters to kill these animals, the government should be considering the possible revenues generated by ecotourism. In BC. there is already a significant change in their approach to interacting with bears. Many ecotour companies hire guides to take customers into areas where bears are observed and photographed going about their daily activities. It is hugely popular. In many areas this practice is also beneficial for the indigenous economy and their cultural heritage, as bears played an important role in their history and beliefs.
With all of the added pressures of urbanization, habitat loss and road mortality, bear populations in Ontario will inevitably go the way of the lynx, and timber wolf. Hunting black bears is not a sustainable activity in the long term and results in often cruel outcomes. Young bears being left to survive on their own, often become nuisance bears, starve to death or are killed by other male bears in the absence of a mother to protect them.
The spring bear hunt is particularly devastating as  this is a critical time for mother's with cubs who have endured winter hibernation to recover their health and teach their young early skills needed to survive. Young bears stay with their mothers for up to 2 years before becoming fully independent. Although hunting of females and cubs is not legal, how many hunters mistakenly kill female bears, either pregnant or raising cubs.
My hope is that the Ontario government will abolish the spring bear hunting practice as well as bear hunting altogether and look at other more sustainable and environmentally responsible ways to generate revenue from our natural environment. Its time to end this barbaric practice and be better stewards of the land.

I have a background in biology and I really would like to say that I disagree with the spring bear hunt and  would not like it to be reinstated.
Years ago, when I was an undergrad, I saw something that I will never forget and affects me to this day. I had the misfortune to come across two young cubs left alone in a tree after their mother had been shot and killed by a hunter. Hunters cannot always tell if a bear is a female or a nursing sow. Their young have little opportunity for survival if they lose their mother. In no way, should a spring bear hunt be allowed. It will absolutely affect bear populations at a time we should be doing everything we can do to increase the odds of wildlife for survival.
Please do NOT make the spring bear hunt permanent, and please only allow limited hunting in the fall when necessary.

Cowardly hunters hide in trees until a bear comes looking for bait - there is no possible way to differentiate a male from a female.
Orphaned cubs will not survive in the wild, as the mother bear cares for them for at least a year.
We have lived for 30 years on a rural property which borders the local dump - families of bears cross our property in spring, summer, and fall.  We have never been threatened by them.

Second: why are we letting hunters get their way? they are cruel and barbaric.

Bear tourism and the killing of animals by baiting isn’t hunting. It requires few hunting skills and little effort.
Third: they is no guarantee that hunters won't hunt the females. this is the season the cubs are born, why risk killing them and their mothers, this is unnecessary and wrong. And then what about the poor orphaned cubs. Why do we treat animals this way!!
Fourth: the spring hunt did not and will not reduce human-bear conflicts. I don't even see how this makes any sense.

44724,/comment/44724,"Dear Premier, Minister and Public Input Coordinator,
The Spring Bear Hunt results in orphaned bear cubs. There is no denying this - wildlife rehabilitators can attest that some hunters make mistakes and kill mothers with cubs even though regulations were designed to prevent this from happening. Mother bears often leave their cubs in nearby trees while foraging, leaving the door wide open to this mistake consistently occurring. Furthermore, bears care for and protect their cubs into their second year of life, leaving even yearling cubs at risk due to orphaning.
In 1999, the Conservative government cancelled the spring bear hunt in recognition that we can't put a price on any number of cubs that starve or die of exposure after being orphaned due to government regulations. Protecting wildlife should be at the heart of any management plan or action.
Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project introduced by your government and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
I oppose your proposal to reinstate the hunt permanently. However, I do agree that non-residents and their relatives should not be given special opportunities to hunt and I agree that the hunt should be restricted where bear populations are suffering, including in the Bruce Peninsula area.
I also encourage you to consider a ban of bear baiting, as this practice introduces bears to food that is unnatural to their foraging and encourages them to seek out ""human"" food, thereby undermining goals of reducing human-wildlife conflict. Short of this, baiting should be more strictly regulated and baits should be registered to ensure compliance with modern regulations.
It should also be taken into consideration that as bears wake up earlier in the Spring due to climate change, as already seen in B.C., they will have a difficult time finding food and will likely be only beginning to recover from malnourishment when a Spring bear hunt begins.
Bear hunters in the Spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario, so the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations of enjoying the outdoors in Ontario should be taken into consideration.
Black bear management needs to focus on reducing human-bear conflicts by investing in coexistence education. Ontarians and tourists can safely share the landscape with black bears and other carnivores; we only need to make sure we have the resources to teach them how. For example, education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
A Conservative government saw the unnecessary cruelty of orphaned cubs dying of starvation and exposure due to the Spring bear hunt, and therefore brought it to an end in 1999. I hope your government will choose to do the same.

44732,/comment/44732,"I am strongly opposed to the Ontario government’s proposal to bring back the spring bear hunt. There are a number of science-based reasons why the hunt should not be reinstated, but I will focus on just two issues that concern me – (1) the claim that this will protect moose populations, and (2) the ability of the average hunter to distinguish gender when hunting. I question both.
1. Moose and Bears
Among the justifications the government cites for the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt, the most flimsy is the implication that bears are in part responsible for the decline in Ontario moose populations. The reality is human hunters are probably more abundant than black bears. In fact, Ontario has more moose hunters than moose, with over 90,000 provincially licensed moose hunters. This figure, by the way, comes from the Ontario government’s own website.
Moose are declining for many other reasons, and they must be acknowledged as combined factors rather than focus on one possible cause, such as predation by bears. These factors include: loss of habitat, winter ticks, diseases and other parasites, other predators and, of course, hunting by humans.
In fact, if I were to quote the Ontario government site’s own comments on moose populations and bear removal programs, one finds slim evidence to reinstate this program, and I quote: “Several studies have looked at the effect of black bear removal on moose populations. The results of these studies can be difficult to interpret because of the complex ecological relationships in landscapes that have multiple predator and prey species. It can also be difficult to rule out other factors that may be affecting moose, such as habitat changes.”
Issues around habitat, habitat loss and a changing climate should not be underestimated or ignored. This current government, however, prefers development over habitat protection and denies that we live in a world where ecosystems are being affected by changes to climate in ways we have yet to fully understand. This government’s obvious bias in these matters may be informing and tainting their overall understanding of the complexity of the matter.
2. Can you really assure us that only male bears will be hunted and killed?
The spring bear hunt proposal is flawed in its claim that females and cubs will not be harmed. The reality is otherwise. One simply cannot guarantee that every hunter will be able to distinguish between male and female bears. Female bears do get killed, including nursing mothers. Orphaned cubs end up starving to death, or they are killed by other predators. Starvation is cruel. It happens in the wild, of course, but when it is caused by humans it is unacceptable cruelty, so we have to question the ethics of this proposal as well.
As for the fines, are the regulations prohibiting the killing of females accompanied by cubs really enforceable? Finally, killing females, whether by accident or design, will eventually adversely affect the sustainability of the black bear population. Culling never works, and it usually upsets nature’s own delicate balance by creating human-imposed imbalances.
In the end, the citizens of Ontario – the vast majority of whom are not hunters – are owed a full and transparent, non-biased, non-influenced, science-based explanation that can adequately defend the government’s proposal to reinstate the spring bear hunt.
Failing that, the spring bear hunt should not be allowed to move forward, and making it a permanent occurrence in Ontario is definitely wrongheaded in the long-term — scientifically unfounded, ethically questionable and willfully short-sighted.

44734,/comment/44734,"Before re-instating the spring bear hunt in Ontario, how about considering the sustainability of this proposal. This is 2020 and the killing of animals for an individual's fun is no longer seen as sporting, rather it is more akin to being pretty selfish. Bears, like all living things, are finite in numbers. Their death by tourism is neither a sport, nor is it what tourism is all about these days. It seems ironic to tout the wonder of our country and province as still having these magnificent creatures still in the wild, and then allowing the killing of them by baiting and worse. Like all living creature, they have a right to exist alongside humans, in their own right.
Please stop deflecting the real issue by suggesting that bears are a danger to all humans. It is precisely because of the type of interactions bear have with hunters, and baiting that they get accustomed to being around humans in the first place. Most wild bears don't want to be near man, they avoid interactions if at all possible. So don't stick hunters into the bears' habitats, and then tell us how dangerous they are when more conflict with man ensues.

44736,/comment/44736,"Hello,
I want to comment on the changes that are being proposed for non-resident Black Bear hunting.
I am a Retired Michigan Conservation Officer, so am very familiar with how important it is to have proper wildlife management, law changes and the regulating of Outfitters or as you call them ""licensed bear operators"". I appreciate this opportunity to submit comments.
Our family bought property in Canada almost 20 years ago. We have a small three bedroom cottage on 500 acres of land. We purchased this so that we could take our 4 children to Canada for vacations and to take them hunting. Through their younger years they have simply sat with us while we have hunted. We have enjoyed this immensley and because of this have instilled in our children a great respect for the outdoors, wildlife, and the importance of proper management and legal harvest of different wildlife species. Although we have participated in hunting many species on our property it has been the Black Bear hunts that have been the most enjoyable and memorable! As our children have reached the legal hunting age in Canada, three of them have had the opportunity to experience a successful bear hunt with us now sitting with them. Truly a rewarding experience!!
With the changes that you propose this will come to an abrupt end, as we would not be able to hunt our land anymore but would be forced to pay big money to go through a licensed operator. Because of  my background/career with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and having worked closely with Wildlife Division I don't feel that your proposal truly puts Black Bear Management ""first"".
Hopefully statistics have been gathered. I would think that as far as non-resident bear hunters go, that the majority of  non-residents already go with an outfitter. Forcing ""all"" non-residents who want to hunt Black Bear to go with an outfitter can take this opportunity away from ""families"" like ours (who have 1 person per year be able to purchase a license to hunt anyway). What your proposed change would do is.... increase/pad the pockets of the licensed outfitter. This too at a time when many states nationwide struggle with and continue to watch their revenue drop in license sales because of a growing loss of interest in hunting, partially due to so many single parent homes where children grow up never being exposed to the great outdoors as far as wildlife education, management, and hunting opportunities.
If Black Bear Management is the  #1 priority, I hope that you would consider a minimum  requirement of the size of acreage that a non-resident owns, to qualify to purchase a license for bear hunting, before jumping to the extreme measure of cutting this out altogether. I would guess that you have many non-residents who only own a lot or very small parcel of land, probably not even suitable for any type of hunting activity, so that they can qualify as a property owner to be able to legally purchase a non-resident bear hunting license.
Thank you again for the opportunity to submit comments on this proposal. I obviously hope that you will reconsider some of the changes that you are proposing. I appreciate your time and the importance of the job you have been entrusted with to manage our wildlife species for future generations!

44737,/comment/44737,"I am opposed to a Spring bear hunt for the following reasons -
Hunting in the spring will cause cubs to be orphaned.  Just because it is illegal to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs,  the mother may be away from her young while looking for food. If a mother is killed, the cubs are unprotected and unable to care for themselves.  This is inexcusable.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Conflict between humans and bears is caused mostly by humans not properly taking precautions with their food and garbage.  Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by making people aware to remove access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants.

44740,/comment/44740,"Your rulings in this matter are very important, not only for bear survival but for the integrity of the ecosystem of which they are a part, particularly now with the effects of climate change. Ecologists sometimes refer to bears as “ecosystem architects” or “ecosystem engineers.”
Human-bear conflicts are known to increase in years of low natural food availability.” One of the guiding principles laid out in your document entitled “Black bear management framework” is that “Black bear movements and annual reproductive capacity are strongly influenced by annual forage abundance and distribution."" I would like to argue that by hunting the black bear in some areas where their numbers have dwindled, that forage abundance will decline, and consequently human-bear conflicts rise rather than achieving your goal. Ensuring food abundance and distribution is key to minimizing bear movement into human occupied areas.
Returning to the concept that bears are ecosystem architects or engineers, bears are one of the most crucial ingredients in a healthy ecosystem. They disperse the seeds which grow into the plants they eat, such as berries, nuts, acorns and succulent vegetation. These plants are their staples, along with insects. Meat and other less succulent greens are eaten only when preferred vegetation is scarce. More importantly, as the paper points out “In years when major food crops fail, black bears wander more widely and can remain away from their spring ranges for 3 to 4 months.” This wandering could push encroachment into areas where people are apt to live and hence complaints increase, giving the illusion that there are more bears. Thus, it is important that there are enough bears to successfully maintain their ecosystem engineering capacity and thereby their food abundance.
If too many bears are lost, then more people will complain as they see more bears in their vicinity, but this inductive reasoning would be false, as there are fewer bears but they are roaming farther and closer to human habitation in search of food.
Another concern is that extrapolation of numbers based on habitat potential for each bear population may not be accurate. As this paper states, “It is difficult to estimate black bear population size and trends.” According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), six of the eight bear species globally are listed as vulnerable to extinction. A telling sign of the challenges faced by the black bear. The paper on “Black bear management framework” on your website also states that “The black bear’s inherently slow rate of recovery from low population levels increases the risks for local populations where harvest pressure and other mortality are high.”
Adding to the pressures on bear populations is the interplay of threats from habitat loss from  deforestation or mining; of climate change; vehicle and train collisions are a few of the  adverse impacts of human behaviour adding to the constraints on black bear populations.
The spring bear hunt was only supposed to last for seven years, when reintroduced. For the above reasons, as well as those of others submitted to your registry, a ban on the hunting of black bears should be re-enacted under the province’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.

44751,/comment/44751,"I am opposed to reinstating the spring bear hunt for the following reasons:
Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators. There is little to no enforcement of the current hunting regulations. Hunters know that and the potential for abuse of a basically unchecked spring hunt is enormous and for no valid reason.
Bears don't reproduce very quickly even under favourable circumstances. To recklessly expose mother bears and their cubs to hunting will damage the very ""sport"" you are trying to encourage. It's morally wrong.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by educating people who likely will come into contact with bears. My spouse and I and a great many other people have lived and continue to live amicably alongside bears. We've not once felt threatened and have enjoyed, even cherished our encounters.
The government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, but has provided no evidence to support this claim. Where is the backing for such a statement? If you can't prove what you propose then you should go back and do your homework. This is a very serious matter and decisions should not be made based on mere wishful thinking.

Therefore I feel it is wrong to permanently bring back the spring Black Bear Hunt.  However, for Indigenous that require Bear to provide for them as they always have, I think they should have that right.  But for those that hunt for sport and those that cannot or would not take the time to recognize a male vs female, when on the hunt, this should not be allowed.  This would mean that there would be many who would not qualify to hunt.  You can not tell me that some one intent on shooting and killing a Black Bear, in the heat of the moment, when the Bear is spotted and in their sights, is going to say, hold on a minute here...  this bear looks smaller, oh I can't shoot her, she might have Cubs somewhere.  Come on, you really believe that will happen.  No way!  Ontario Government should be concerned with protecting all Species, as they are at increased risks every day, not just from Hunters, but from Habitat loss, as mentioned before, scarcity of food, and most importantly Climate Change.

44758,/comment/44758,"I urge the Ontario PC government to cancel the Spring Bear Hunt altogether.
Female bears give birth to cubs in early spring and keep them hidden in trees while the mother forages for food. Since it's very difficult to determine the sex of a bear in the wild, many mother bears are shot and killed, leaving the orphaned cubs to die a slow death by starvation or a violent death by predators. This is very cruel and inhumane.
It's untrue that moose populations are compromised by bears. In fact, wildlife experts who actually study animals in their natural habitats, will tell you that when left alone, animal populations, both predator and prey, regulate themselves. Predators are not going to kill all of their prey, otherwise predators die out. It makes sense. It's only when humans try to manage wildlife populations that problems arise.
Most Ontarians do not hunt nor do they support killing wild animals. I don't feel that Ontario should be open for the unsavoury business of killing our wild animals, and I will not support a governing party that allows hunting. A modern province can develop a better tourism plan than inviting non-resident sport hunters who enjoy killing wildlife, animals who have little hope of escape, onto our mutually owned public lands. Ontario’s forests belong to all of us, not just to the businesses that profit from violence against wild animals.

44765,/comment/44765,"I was pleased to learn in 1999 that the Ontario Progressive Conservative Government was banning the spring bear hunt.  In January 1999, The Minister of Natural Resources John Snobelen  announced an end to the spring bear hunt as the government did not want bear cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly shooting mother bears in the spring.  In 2014, the spring bear hunt was brought back again under the Liberal Government as a pilot project. I find it very objectionable that now our current Progress Conservative Government wants to bring back the spring bear hunt on a permanent basis.
The reasons, for banning the spring bear hunt in 1999, were because mother bears, after leaving their dens, often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food.  If a mother bear is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators. Bears have low reproduction rates so therefore the survival of adult female bears is vital for the species.
I find it unacceptable that hungry black bears, after they emerge from their dens from a long winter of hibernation, are baited with food. When they reach the bait, they are gunned down. These bears are being handed to hunters to satisfy their thirst for hunting big game in order for them to acquire trophies. With not always being able to identify whether or not the bears are male or female, it is highly probable that a hunter will kill a female bear who recently gave birth to nursing cubs who weigh 5 kg or less leaving them alone feeling terrified, and they will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.  This potential outcome is unconscionable!
As outlined in the Ontario Government’s proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations, the government states that they have black bear population concerns in the Bruce Peninsula. As stated in the proposal details “Research indicates that there has been a decline in bear numbers and that human-caused mortality should be reduced to support sustainability of this genetically isolated population.” Due to this population decline why is the government even considering having a spring bear hunt for one week from May 1 to May 7?  There should be no hunting or trapping in this area either in the spring or fall.
Resident hunters in Ontario represent only a small portion of Ontario’s population. The Ontario Government has stated in their proposals “The anticipated economic consequences of the proposals are expected to be neutral to positive. Continuing the spring season as a regular annual season beyond 2020 will provide certainty of continued hunting and trapping opportunities and related economic benefits. The proposed changes to remove special opportunities for non-resident landowners and immediate relatives will redistribute those opportunities to licensed operators resulting in additional economic opportunities for businesses.” Even if the economic impact is positive, it is morally wrong. The Progressive Conservative Government under Premier Mike Harris and Minister of  Natural Resources John Snobelen considered what was morally right when they banned  the spring bear hunt in 1999. Our current Progressive Conservative Government should do the same. After all, the public lands in Ontario belong to all of us, not just to the organizations and businesses that profit by the killing of our wild animals.

44766,/comment/44766,"Please take the time to truly reflect on the animals lives that will suffer if these new black bear hunting regulations go through. I personally work very close with animals and see the effect on newborn/young wildlife that have lost their mothers due to human greed. Ontario doesn't have a lot of wildlife rehabilitation or rescues programs to help with these orphaned babies which very often leads to the rescues euthanizing the animal or turning them away resulting in them starving to death due to the lack of their mother's milk, protection and safety or die due to predators.
During the spring bear hunt, hunters bait hungry black bears as they emerge from a winter without food, shooting them at bait sites. Females who have recently given birth are particularly attracted to bait, given that they emerge from their dens in worse body condition than other bears, having lost up to 40% of their body weight and have babies waiting for them to bring home food. This hunt is incredibly inhumane as all these animals are trying to do is raise and take care of their families. We are tricking them and killing them because simply people enjoying killing other beings.
Encouraging non-resident trophy hunters to bait and kill bears for sport as they emerge from hibernation is unethical. Indeed, Ontario technically prohibits the killing of cubs or females, but only when they are accompanied by cubs—but this is impossible to enforce.
There is no evidence that the spring bear hunt improves human safety. Advocates for the hunt often argue it will reduce human-bear conflict, but time and again studies have shown that the spring bear hunt does not improve human safety. Rather, easy access to garbage, barbecues, and other easily removable attractants, as well as scarcity in natural food availability, are key factors in human-bear interactions.
There is no cultural or economic justification for allowing hunters to lure hungry black bears using bait and shoot these unsuspecting animals for sport.
The government’s strongest argument in favour of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt is that it will provide certainty to hunters and tourist outfitters. Given the disastrous consequences of the hunt for bears and cubs across the province, a desire for certainty is hardly a justification. Certainty would best be achieved by permanently cancelling this cruel and unnecessary killing game, instead of bowing to the powerful hunting lobby instead.
Please reconsider reinstating this hunt because these animals lives matter. Just not how much fun people have killing them.

I'm not sure who the government is thinking they are benefiting, but it isn't the safety of its residents.
It has been shown, time and again, that there are minimal safety concerns between bears and the human population. Indeed, most interactions between bears and humans could have been prevented with proper bear awareness on the part of humans.
Bringing back the spring bear hunt will produce orphan cubs and will create unnecessary cruelty through cub starvation.
Penalties against killing females cannot be adequately enforced, while common baiting practices will target both male and females.
Unless you are actively requiring training for 'hunters' to distinguish between male and female bears, you are sentencing all bears to death.
Allowing baiting to occur is, again, bad practice and not true hunting.
If the advice of bear experts and environment staff go unheard, this will be an election issue.
In the age of proper conservation and environmental awareness, the spring bear hunt is misguided and entirely unnecessary.
I hope the government will follow the lead of the experts and take the idea of the spring bear hunt off of the table.

44783,/comment/44783,"I'm appalled by your decision to allow a Spring Bear Hunt in Ontario. This is both a political and a moral issue.
The Conservatives, under Mike Harris, cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt 15 years ago because of the extreme cruelty in leaving hundreds of tiny orphaned bear cubs to die a slow death of starvation. As well, its a completely deplorable act to hunt an animal waking up out of hibernation. Bears, along with all wild animals are already left at the mercy of reckless and selfish human behaviour..habitat loss, human interference and the hunting for sport/fun that already is happening in our country. How can your government possibly justify reinstating this throwback to another era?
I find it hard to believe and/or sad that you are unaware or simply don't care of the following facts:
*    Attracting bears with food bait when they are coming out of hibernation and obviously very hungry to be easily picked off by a hunter sitting in a nearby tree blind is hardly hunting, rather it is target practice.
*    Your government states that ""it will remain illegal to kill a female bear with cubs"".  This assurance is disingenuous given that it's rare to be able to see a bear's genitals or lactating teats from a tree blind at a distance.  Furthermore, mother bears approaching a food source where there may be other bears send their cubs into hiding before approaching the bait.
*    It was why, in 1999, the Spring Bear Hunt was cancelled when MNR staff revealed that over 270 bear cubs were orphaned each year and left to starve to death as a direct result of the hunt. A former MNR staff member indicates that this number is low and that it was more likely closer to 1,000 cubs that died.
*    Your government indicates that there has been an increase in the black bear population and that Ontario is home to a healthy and sustainable bear population.  In fact, the black bear population has not increased.  To the contrary, the 2007 Annual Report of the Auditor General of Ontario conveys that 'despite the cancellation of the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999, government bear hunting data show that bear populations are likely not being maintained at sustainable levels and that every year, hunters kill more female bears than allowed by law'.
*    In attempting to justify the Spring Bear Hunt, you have stated that ""public safety is paramount and Ontarians should feel safe in their communities"".  If, in fact, your real concern is public safety, you would acknowledge the studies that have conclusively shown that the greater number of bears killed, the greater number of human-bear conflicts and complaints. A report by Dr. Edward A. Tavss of Rutgers University http://www.bearsmart.com/docs/Tavss-v4.pdf on a dozen communities across North America included data from Ontario which shows that there has been a bear hunt every year in this province, with generally increasing numbers of bears killed annually, and a corresponding increase in the number of complaints.
*    On the other hand, the report shows where jurisdictions have implemented conflict prevention and education strategies, there has been a significant decrease in bear conflicts and complaints.  The Elliot Lake Ontario community is one such example. The year before public education and bear resistant containers were introduced, there were 500 nuisance bears and three shootings. Using the Bear Wise model program, in 2004 this was reduced to 87 nuisance bears and no shootings.
*    Given these results, we are shocked that your government has abandoned the Bear Wise Program and instead plans to use an inhumane, ineffectual and highly controversial lethal approach to bear management in Ontario.  Our consternation is shared by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario in his 2012-13 Report where he criticizes the gutting of the Bear Wise program, a program which successfully reduced human/bear conflicts.
Policy must derive from logic and compassion, not political opportunism. We urge you to cancel the ill-conceived plan for a Spring Bear Hunt and immediately re-instate all elements of the highly-effective Bear Wise program.
I look forward to your response to these concerns and your assurance that, unlike previous Environmental Bill of Rights consultations conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, this one will be transparent and fair.  It will be closely scrutinized.
Sincerely,
Kim

44786,/comment/44786,"The 2020 Spring Bear Hunt in Ontario – an issue of concern.
The Ontario Annual Spring Bear hunt should be shut down permanently to eliminate the unnecessary killing of wild bears and the resulting cruel death by starvation of their orphaned bear cubs. The so called “hunt” uses baiting of bears with food dumps and the “hunters” merely use the wild bears for target practice. There is no hunting skill involved, no “shared family experiences” only a painful and pointless death for every single bear killed and cub that is orphaned and starves to death. How ruthless can anyone be to find pleasure in gunning down a bear out from its hibernation looking for food! A morally reprehensible act inconsistent with our civility!
The logic used by the bear killing industry that this is required to manage bear populations to reduce human bear interactions is greatly overstated. These rare interactions only occur in the marginal areas of development where the bear habitats are removed, and bears are attracted into the food waste in domestic bins and landfill areas. The hunters never want to kill these bears on the domestic fringe; only those out in their romantic fantasy of the wild. A responsible modern approach would be to control the urban spread and development with effective food waste management   Education of people about their responsibility in management of and garden crops would be conducive to less attraction of bears to human habitats.
Hunting damages tourism and every dead bear makes Ontario appear more cruel in the eyes of the world. Most people want to experience the joy of seeing these magnificent creatures in the wild and to have the opportunity to share a brief interaction and take home only photos, not body parts. Too often we see a celebrity posting a picture of themselves against a dead animal on social media or on TV and each post is followed by thousands of comments by people disgusted with this display. The attitudes of the Conservation Officers noticed in other provinces has been found to be disturbing without any compassion for orphaned cubs and acted more like Law enforcement officers rather than for wild life protection.
We are living on a fragile planet with limited resources. Hunting belonged the days before agriculture when the need for food was a matter of survival of the hunter and the hunted. Today’s well fed hunters with their high-powered rifle and hiding near food piles is a travesty of the term hunting. This is an assault on humanity!
Wild life are vulnerable to the stress and struggles caused by our climate changes which is impacting on their food sources plus loss of habitats all likely to affect their reproduction abilities which is out of their natural abilities! What happens then to the population of these bears?
Civilisation has moved a long way on from trading cruelty for entertainment. The Ontario Annual Spring Bear hunt and all related bear hunting should be shut down permanently. Better we share our world with all our companions than kill the bears and their cubs which do nothing for the general population who looses out on enjoying these magnificent mammals. Using dogs/hounds to harass bears is an act of abhorrence as pitting animals against animals is an act of depraved human behaviour and must be condemned in our societies.
Tourism will be affected as from my own experience have been totally disappointed from not seeing any wild life or bears when visiting this province! The Economic contribution from tourism viewing far outweighs that from Hunter’s licence fees.
A pressing and disturbing concern is the growing markets for “bear parts” to meet the demands of the Asian Markets also contributing to the shocking “bear bile” operations in which Canadian Black bears have fallen victims to as per various articles in the media. The recent disturbing cases in Saskatchewan and Richmond in British Columbia should be of concern to Ontario as it indicates the likely dangers associated with legal hunting of black bears.
We have seen the disastrous consequences in many countries where legal hunting has become uncontrollable to manage as it quickly opened the doors to poaching. This immoral outcome would be a tragedy for Canadian Wildlife if hunting of black bears became permanent and legal in Ontario, as it would likely have a nationwide effect.
Thank you for this opportunity and hoping for an end to killing the black bears forever. We are all inhabitants of this planet with our own purpose. We enjoy wild life today and want the future generations to be able to do the the same .

44801,/comment/44801,"I am opposed to the spring bear hunt because it does not address or resolve the issue of nuisance bears or public safety.  Nor would an enhanced hunt as the Minister has suggested in a recent announcement.  Evidence abounds from a variety of sources. Since the hunt was based on these 2 premises as per the ERO, the only thing the hunt will do is satisfy outfitters and trophy hunters at the expense of creating orphan cubs left to die a miserable death. This is not an activity that benefits tourists or the community at large, economically, ethically or environmentally. Focussing on ecotourism is the current direction of progressive governments. My person views are not relevant, only the facts are. Here are some of the source documents I used to support my opposition the spring bear hunt: (If you cannot access them, I would be please to email the docs as attachments)    Check out the MNR peer reviewed research paper:  “Do public complaints reflect trends in human bear conflict ‘ especially the last paragraph on page 140; Nuisance Review Committee Report and Recommendations - URL http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr/ebr/nbrc/  states hunting has no effect on nuisance bears or safety or economics;  google Dr. Hererro’s data on bear attacks: Black Bear Fatal Attacks 1900-2003; and, ""Correlation of reduction in nuisance black bear complaints with implementation of (a) a non-violent program and (b) a hunt Final Report Presented at 9/21/05 New Jersey Public Hearing on the Comprehensive Black Bear Management Polic Edward A. Tavss, PhD Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey”.  There is more information but let’s start with this.
It is based on the premise that individuals have no knowledge of these studies that show: i) the incidences with bears actually DECREASED when the hunt was cancelled and the BEAR WISE program was introduced; ii) that non lethal interventions to promote safety and perceived safety are more effective; iii) that increased hunting, harvests, culls, and other lethal means do not have a positive impact on reducing nuisance bears, or human-bear conflict as confirmed by the MNR’s own biologist Dr. Martyn Obbard.
Empirical data shows neither a spring hunt nor any hunt, has a positive effect in promoting increased safety or diminishing nuisance bear activity. It has been proven though, that the most effective means of reducing human-bear encounters/conflict is EDUCATION.
FACTS
1.The Ministry of Natural Resources’ own site has a document titled: Black bears rarely attack people. (The black bear is also the slowest reproducing mammal in Canada, not fully mature until 6 years of age and reproducing only every 2 years.)
2.There have only been 7 bear attacks resulting in 4 deaths in the past 100 years. Since the early 1900s there have been fewer than 70 deaths in ALL of North America from black bears. Bears are generally timid animals and injuries and attacks are rare.
3. As a result of the 2003 “Nuisance Bear Review Committee”, Bear Wise was born, designed to prevent and address human/bear conflicts. It was an immensely successful EDUCATIONAL program. Recommendations put forward in 2009 by the current Minister to further improve the Bear Wise Program was shelved. In 2012 the Premier scaled back this already proven program. And, 10 years later, rather than incorporate the recommended enhancements, Bear Wise was dismantled to ‘save money’. The only challenge to its effectiveness came from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, a powerful lobby group.
4.) Furthermore the above Report prepared by MNR staff stated : “Recommendation for a partial re-instatement of the Spring Black Bear Hunt for socio-economic reasons (from Section 9.0)
... the Committee did not find any connection between the cancellation of the spring bear hunt and recent increases in nuisance activity...
5.)More statistics support the Ministry’s own conclusions confirming there was no increase in nuisance bear sitings or in humane wildlife conflict when the spring hunt ended. In Elliott Lake, the year prior to Bear Wise and the implementation of bear resistant containers there were 500 nuisance bears and three shootings. In 2004, there were 87 nuisance bears and NO shootings.
6.) Confirming the findings of the Ministry’s own report was the, ‘The Tavss report Sept 2005 which was presented at the New Jersey Public Hearing on the Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy: Correlation of reduction in nuisance black bear complaints with implementation of (a) non-violent program and (b) hunt Final Report’. This study included sites in Ontario such as Elliot Lake. It too, came to the same conclusion regarding education. It stressed the value of Bear Wise as an exceptional tool to effectively resolve and prevent human bear conflict.
7.)Although hunters are only supposed to shoot male bears, according to MNR statistics prior to the cancellation of the spring hunt, from the number of females killed approx. 270 cubs were orphaned each year, dying a slow and painful death from hunger. The Ministry did and does not  provide any information on how the hunt will be monitored to stop the killing of mother bears with cubs.
8). EDUCATION such as the Bear Wise Program is the real answer to keep both people and bears safe. Bears do not hunt people and bear hunts do not resolve the issue of nuisance bears. It has been proven that the leading causes of bear problems are the presence of residential garbage, food smells, and fruit trees. Being proactive, adopting responsible habits, and learning about bears is the solution.
The spring bear hunt will not control nuisance bears and increase the safety of residents. Reintroduction of educational programs will do more to prevent nuisance bears, and ensure people are protecting themselves by understanding bear behaviour so they can act responsibly.
Increasing tourism through ecotourism and environmentally sustainable activities, will benefit the community as whole, financially and otherwise.  It will create more spin off businesses than a spring bear hunt.

44803,/comment/44803,"Subject:   ERO #019-1112 Proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations
The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is Ontario’s largest, non-profit, fish and wildlife conservation-based organization, representing 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 725 member clubs. We have reviewed the proposed changes to the black bear hunting regulations and offer the following comments for consideration.
The OFAH supports the full return of spring bear hunting in Ontario
We applaud the Government of Ontario for proposing to regularize the spring bear hunt. We acknowledge that the spring bear hunt remains a contentious issue, but commend the government for following the scientific evidence showing that the spring hunt is sustainable, rather than letting emotional rhetoric and targeted disinformation campaigns dictate wildlife management in the province. This reaffirms one of the core principles of the North American Model of wildlife management - that science is the proper tool to guide wildlife policy. Allowing emotion to dictate wildlife management decisions in the province is a slippery slope. Those who advocate for the cancellation of the spring hunt based on personal opposition to hunting fail to realize that, by deviating from the principle of science guiding policy, they are opening a door that would allow other emotional arguments to influence wildlife management in the province. There are those who view black bears as vermin that should be exterminated, which is an equally emotional response. Neither of these extreme views should dictate wildlife policy if our goal is to have sustainable bear populations in the province.
In 1999, Dr. Martyn Obbard, Ontario’s leading black bear scientist, described the orphaning of cubs by hunters as an “extremely rare event,” due to a combination of black bear behaviour and hunting regulations. Female bears do not produce their first litter until they are at least five years old and, due to the fact that offspring stay with the female until they are 16-18 months of age, give birth to cubs no more often than every other year. This means that only a small proportion of female bears has cubs in any given year. In the spring, those female bears with cubs are relatively sedentary, meaning they move less than other bears and tend to avoid areas where they are likely to encounter other bears. This reduces their susceptibility to harvest (Kolenosky and Strathearn, 1987).
Additionally, cubs and females with cubs are protected by Ontario’s hunting regulations. It is illegal to kill a cub or a female with cubs in the spring season and doing so carries severe penalties of up to $25,000 in fines and/or up to a year in jail. Ontario’s hunters are some of the most highly trained in the world and a key component of this training is knowing your target and ensuring you are harvesting a legal animal. This philosophy has been evident in the results of Ontario’s pilot spring bear hunt. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF) Enforcement Branch, which dedicated significant resources to enforcement activities during the spring hunt, has confirmed that no charges have been laid for the shooting of a cub or a female with cubs since the pilot was initiated. A comprehensive study of Manitoba’s spring black bear season (Hristienko et al., 2004), which is similar to Ontario’s, found that the number of cubs orphaned by hunters was less than 2% of the estimated number that die each year from natural causes. In reality, many factors other than hunting can lead to the orphaning of cubs including: abandonment by the sow due to limited milk supply, human disturbance at the den site, the death of the mother in vehicular- and nuisance-related incidents, and cannibalism of the sow by other bears. Despite this, animal rights activists attribute all instances of orphaned cubs to hunters and continue to promote a false narrative around the spring bear hunt in an attempt to deceive the public.
The pilot project has demonstrated that the province’s black bear population can support both spring and fall seasons sustainably. The MNRF has determined that approximately 10% of the province’s black bear population can be harvested annually and has estimated that the provincial black bear population is between 85,000 and 105,000 bears. Even if we assume that the population is at the lower end of this range, the combined spring and fall harvest has been below the 10% threshold for all years of the pilot project for which we currently have harvest data. Ontario is well prepared to sustainably manage black bear harvest going forward and, through investment in the provincial barbwire hair strap study and new mandatory reporting requirement, has the tools to identify and address any conservation concerns if or when they arise.
For these reasons and the benefits that it provides, the OFAH fully supports the full return of the spring bear hunt. This has been a major advocacy priority of the OFAH since the spring hunt’s abrupt cancellation in 1999. We fought the cancellation in court for three years and have kept it at the forefront of our advocacy efforts ever since, lobbying successive provincial governments. We fought for the limited pilot spring season that was introduced in 2014 and then advocated to have it expanded in 2016. With the pilot set to sunset on June 15, 2020, we fought to secure the certainty for our members and the hunting community at large.
The return of the spring bear hunt provides hunters, northern and rural businesses, the general public and the bears themselves with benefits that have been lost for the past twenty-one years. Hunters benefit from a unique season that provides healthy meat, valuable hides and time spent with friends and family. Ontario’s economy benefits from the estimated $50.6 million that bear hunting contributes annually, $13.8 million of which is from the spring hunt and which will likely increase as tourist outfitters invest in a season they know will exist in the future. The general public, who will interact with bears in a wide variety of circumstances from nature viewing to human-bear conflict, benefit from a comprehensive suite of black bear management tools where education is complemented with regulated hunting to ensure ecologically, culturally and socially sustainable bear populations. Finally, the bears themselves benefit from increased funding for their management and increased social tolerance. All revenue from hunting licences directly fund wildlife management in the province and bear licences on their own contribute over $2 million annually. The relationship between the public and bears has fluctuated significantly over the past hundred years. Prior to 1961, black bears were considered vermin in Ontario and shot under a bounty system. It was the OFAH’s lobbying effort that led to them being recognized, managed and valued as a big game species. Since the cancellation of the spring bear hunt, the pendulum has started to swing back in the other direction, as members of the public perceive conflict in the absence of benefits. This is a worrisome trend and the OFAH sees the return of the full spring bear hunt as a major step in addressing it.
Black bear hunter reporting requirements
The OFAH supports the changes to the reporting framework, where black bear hunters will be only required to submit a single annual report, regardless of when they bought their licence, as the current system has caused some confusion among hunters. We recommend that the MNRF clearly communicate to hunters what information will be required on the report in order to ensure that information is not lost or forgotten, especially for hunters who hunt both the spring and fall seasons.
Black bear hunting on Bruce Peninsula
To address a declining black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula, the MNRF has proposed to reduce the spring season to one-week (May 1st to May 7th) and close the fall season in wildlife management units (WMU) 82A, 83 and 84. The OFAH’s first priority is the conservation of the resource and, therefore, we do not support any actions that would put the future sustainability of Bruce Peninsula’s black bear population in jeopardy. In order to inform our position on the proposed changes, we have requested from the MNRF additional information that unfortunately was not received in time to inform this response. We strongly feel that answers to the following questions are critical in ensuring sustainable management of the Bruce’s bear population:
1.	What aspects of the current black bear harvest on Bruce Peninsula are unsustainable? Is the overall harvest too high, is the sex ratio of the harvest skewed too heavily towards adult females, or is it a combination of factors?
2.	What supporting evidence (i.e., harvest records, telemetry data, etc.) do you have that indicates that the one-week spring season will effectively address these concerns? While the OFAH does not want to see sustainable hunting opportunities unnecessarily restricted or lost, we also do not want to see a season that allows overharvest by not being as restrictive as needed.
3.	If these objectives are achieved, what specific effect do you expect it to have on the Bruce’s black bear population and why? A management plan should have an expected outcome against which its success is measured.
4.	Is this expected effect sufficient to ensure the long-term sustainability of the population given its isolated nature or are other measures needed? Research conducted by Pelletier et al. (2017) highlights the long-term genetic diversity challenges faced by this population. It is the OFAH’s hope that the MNRF would take any additional measures needed to ensure this population’s sustainability and not limit their actions to regulating hunter harvest.
Without answers to these questions, the OFAH cannot develop an informed position on the proposed changes to black bears seasons on Bruce Peninsula other than to say that we support wildlife management decisions that result in sustainable hunting opportunities while ensuring the long-term conservation of the local black bear population.
Special non-resident hunting opportunities and resident guiding requirements
The OFAH does not have any specific comments related to the elimination of special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners or the requirement for individuals or businesses to have a “Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services” when providing guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area. We do question the need to restrict the special hunting opportunities for non-resident immediate relatives. The current regulations allow non-resident immediate family members to hunt black bear without the services of a tourist outfitter. Recognizing that the number of hunters who take advantage of this opportunity is very low (approximately 10 or less per year), the OFAH would prefer to see this opportunity remain in place. This would allow family members to continue to hunt together, maintaining traditions and the bonds fostered by participating in an important heritage activity. We live in a time where many people move within Canada and beyond for employment opportunities and we should be doing what we can to strengthen, rather than weaken, these bonds. Hunting through an outfitter is not the same as hunting with family and may not provide the type of hunting opportunities they are seeking.
Future black bear management needs
The OFAH will continue to work with the MNRF to ensure that future management needs for black bear are addressed. We continue to advocate for expanded fall black bear hunting opportunities in WMUs that currently do not have them. Expanding black bear hunting brings the same benefits associated with the return of the spring hunt as described above, especially the increased tolerance. We frequently hear from members of the public in areas without black bear seasons about their frustration with unmanaged bear populations. Given that regulated hunting is recognized as an important tool in the bear management tool box and that hunting increases the social tolerance around black bears, we strongly recommend that the expansion of hunting opportunities be seriously explored. Two wildlife management units where we hear particular concerns are 78A and 78B, immediately to the south of Lake Simcoe.
As always, the OFAH stands ready as a partner in sustainable bear management in the Province of Ontario. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input into this important proposal.

Making minor regulation updates to improve fairness
Eliminate special black bear hunting opportunities
	Although the number of non-resident landowners and non-residents hunting with relatives is     low, following the moose hunting example and have them get there forms through a licenced outfitter is appropriate. I support this change
	The Form 33's should be redistributed to licenced outfitters.
Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services’ to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area (BMA)
Requiring anybody that guides commercially on Crown Land to have a Licence to provide Black Bear Hunting services and a BMA is a long overdue change.  I support this change.
In the past many outfitters throughout the Northeast area have had residents guiding residents on Crown Land within their BMA's.  This has caused user conflicts, enforcement issues and in some cases overharvests.  Some outfitters were forced to give up or abandon their areas due to severe competition from unlicenced outfitters operating in their licenced areas.  This change will allow existing BMA operators to properly manage their licenced areas and it will also provide additional business opportunities guiding resident hunters.  Properly managed and controlled BMA's provide the best management information to MNRF to adequately assess populations and harvest.

There are no scientific facts to date that show overpopulation of the bears.
Why would our government purposely support any program that would lead to the death of a mother bear and the certain death of motherless cubs that will surely die a slow death due to starvation.
This one time slaughter is now to become a permanent one.
No wildlife should be allowed to be killed in spring when all have young to rear.

Dear Public Input Coordinator,
Re: ERO# 019-1112 - Proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations
We, the forty undersigned organizations, are writing to express our strong opposition to the reintroduction of the spring bear hunt across Ontario. There is no sound rationale to reintroduce the hunt, but there are solid reasons not to, as outlined below.
Human-bear conflicts
The ERO posting references two spring bear hunt pilots, an earlier one conducted from 2014-2015 and a current one from 2016-2020, both to assess the impact of the hunt on human-bear conflict. Despite the obvious relevance of the pilots to this proposal, the ministry did not mention or release findings from those studies. We understand that findings from the first pilot were never released and that the 2016 pilot (which saw the spring bear hunt expand from eight to 88 Wildlife Management Units) hasn’t yet concluded. Consequently, the results which should accompany any decision about continuing the hunt are not publicly available. We further understand that the pilots have so far confirmed what Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) biologists already knew and presented in a peer-reviewed journal  in 2014 - i.e., that the spring hunt would have no positive impact on human safety. For transparency and to inform public comment on this proposal, the ministry should have released relevant findings from the pilots.
The public has a right to know that the human safety argument, often made by proponents of the spring bear hunt, has no merit. After Ontario’s spring bear hunt was cancelled in 1999 MNRF established an independent Nuisance Bear Review Committee to review the issue. In its 2003 report, the committee concluded that “there was no evidence that spring harvest reduced nuisance bear activity.” Other studies likewise point to the lack of evidence demonstrating that hunting is an effective means of reducing human-bear conflict.
Economic benefit and certainty
The ERO posting states that the economic consequences of the spring bear hunt are “expected to be neutral to positive,” but provides no information to back that claim. It is highly unlikely that there would be any significant financial benefit. Rather, those who used to hire outfitters in the fall to hunt black bears would be hiring them in the spring instead. A spring season would simply move money spent in Ontario from fall to spring.
The ministry’s chief argument for the spring hunt seems to be that moving from a temporary pilot to permanently reinstating the hunt will address uncertainty. But of course, permanently cancelling the hunt would provide the same level of certainty. This argument has no merit.
Opposition to the spring bear hunt
The ERO posting states that the social consequences of the proposal are expected to be both positive and negative but fails to acknowledge a key negative social impact: that thousands of Ontarians are opposed to the spring hunt. The ministry has chosen to ignore public sentiment on this issue.
Our organizations are not opposed to hunting if it is conducted in a sustainable and ethical manner. But this is not the case with the spring bear hunt. Most participants are non-residents who hunt by baiting bears, and many of these hunters, even at bait stations, are unable to distinguish between male and female bears. An Ontario study of bait hunting conducted by MNRF biologists indicated that important descriptors for assessing sex (enlarged nipples, penis, neck size and shape, body shape and proportions) “were infrequently or never used by hunters.”
Females have been and will continue to be killed during the spring bear hunt, including nursing mothers. As a result, orphaned cubs – about five to six months old and typically weighing about five kilograms – starve to death or are killed by other predators. This is an ethical issue – clearly recognized as such not only by the public, but by the government itself which prohibits the killing of females accompanied by cubs. The problem with the government’s approach, however, is twofold. First, it does nothing to protect nursing mothers unaccompanied by young cubs who are often sent up trees while their mother forages for food. Second, despite the threat of large fines, this prohibition is unenforceable: a hunter simply has to state that no cubs accompanied the female when she was shot approaching the bait site, and no charges would be laid or would be successful in court.
Spring bear hunt on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula
The ERO posting states that there has been a decline in black bear numbers on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula and that “human-caused mortality should be reduced to support sustainability of this genetically isolated population.” Accordingly, the ministry is proposing to close the fall black bear hunt in this area and to limit the spring hunting and trapping season to one week.
We fully support the overall intention to reduce human-caused mortality, and the proposal to close the fall season. There are ample opportunities to hunt black bears in nearby areas and across the province in the fall (see map below). However, for the same reasons, there should be no spring hunt. Any human-induced mortality will only act to reduce the genetic diversity of this isolated population  that is known to be in decline. All seasons should be closed completely on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.
We, the undersigned, acknowledge and respect the Aboriginal and Treaty rights that are recognized and confirmed in Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. We expect that MNRF would be consulting with Saugeen Ojibway Nation and all affected First Nations on this issue and will make every effort to address consent and accommodate their rights and interests, including not only their right to harvest bears but also to maintain and restore their cultural and spiritual relationships with them.
In closing, we urge the ministry to abandon its proposal to reintroduce the spring bear hunt. There is no need for the hunt. The human safety argument has been soundly refuted, and the economic and ‘certainty’ arguments are unfounded.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed policy.

MY RESPONSE TO EBO POSTING # 019-1112
>>With regard to the Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season.
 I think it’s a long overdue decision that will help the local tourist economy, bear outfitters as well as the general public that have been plagued by nuisance bears the past two and a half decades. I’m all for it. Thank you.
>>With regard to the Proposal to address Bruce Peninsula black bear population concerns.
  I’ve been down that way a few times and also have friends (including former BMA holders) there that have moved south from the Sudbury area. My friends are not pleased at all with the hunt being shortened to one week only in the spring and no hunt in the fall. Another thing they told me was there was next to no public information put forth on this subject in their area.
 My recommendation for this part of the EBO 019-1112 would be put it on hold and have some local open houses and then consider it in another EBO along with other changes regarding bears.
 >>With regard to the Proposal to Updates to black bear regulations to improve fairness .
1.	  With regard to Non-Resident property owners not being allowed to hunt without the services of an Outfitter.
 I’ve been an outfitter for Black Bears since 1972 and have also as an individual hunted in jurisdictions other than Ontario for big game. Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, and the Yukon in Canada and South of the border in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Texas, West Virginia, South Dakota, Colorado and Florida. In none of these provinces, territories or states was I required to use an Outfitters services.
 My personal pocket book/wallet determined the use of an outfitter rather than foolish laws. Why on earth would you restrict Non-Resident Ontario Property owners? The property taxes they pay is the same rates as Ontario property owners. They also have higher transfer taxes then residents.
 Ontario taxes are high with mill rates in Northern Ontario of 0.17 and up as high as 2.18 in some jurisdictions. Its only the property owner that can get a form 33 from the MNRF to hunt in that specific WMU not all his friends or relatives. In 49 years as a Black Bear outfitter I never had a problem with the scant few of these folks in my area. Four (4) separate parties in over 40 years in my BMA’s. In fact, some of them that were able to get one (1) form 33 came to me to outfit other family members and relations so it’s a win win situation.
 As near as I can come up with an amount of non-residents that make use of this is under 100 in the entire province of Ontario.
 I’ve heard rumours that if these form 33’s are suspended then they will be reallocated to Bonafede licensed bear operators in each area. I do not believe such. What is the plan to give less than 100 forms 33’s to over 2000 Licensed BMA holders? That’s less than 0.05 form each! Not near enough of a significant plus to offset the negative impact of Property Owners rites and privileges.
 My personal thought is that the MNRF just don’t want to bother with it any more.
Give the non-resident property owners a fair shake for their tax dollars and don’t delete this insignificant item. Thanks
2.	 With regard to individuals or businesses having to have a “License to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services” to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area.
I think it’s a long overdue change that will increase the fairness for all concerned. It will resolve conflict between Licensed BMA holders and unlicensed folks that probably don’t even pay any income taxes on their business ventures. This is a win win situation for everyone. Thank you.
>>There is another Major Concern I have as a Licensed BMA holder and that is the re-allocation of Vacant and Dormant BMA’s.
 The MNRF has not made any available in the Sudbury/Espanola District for over 15 years. I have tried numerous times to get additional area where the BMA’s have become inactive to increase my hunting area as well as help alleviate the Local Nuisance Bear problem to no avail. All I received was a myriad of fairly lame excuses. Then it was said there is a moratorium until the pilot spring hunt is ended. Now is the time to do something about it. Perhaps the old application system should be revised some what and I would be glad to provide input into that phase of it.
  These dormant properties are hindering established BMA holders from expanding as well as losing the tax payers of this Province income that could be well used by the MNRF with its limited funds. This needs to be addressed forthwith.
 >>One other Major Concern I have is the method of issuing of Form 33’s. over the life and History of the BMA creation there was no limit on the amount of form 33 allocation until the Province wide spring bear pilot project. There was one exception and that was in the Chapleau District and it worked well. Where rather than restricting the form 33’s they restricted the number of bears harvested. A very sensible solution I thought. I did follow up in 2016 with telephone chats with the folks in Chapleau MNRF on this matter and they said their system worked well from both an enforcement and a sustainable harvest view.
 If you remember when the Spring hunt was canceled in January of 1999 the Outfitters (BMA holders) were given a token compensation based on the number of form 33’s they had used in 1998. This seems to have carried over to 2016 when the form 33’s given to BMA holders were an average of what they had used the previous 3 years with no regard to earlier years at all. This was a band aid that did not and does not work well.
 This whole process needs to be rethought and some serious effort be given to make the rite decisions. One important factor that has never been used is the experience of long time bear outfitters that goes way back to before the introduction of BMA’s and that is the knowledge that these folks can share.
 In my case in particular this is my 49th year as a Black Bear Outfitter in Ontario. Do you really think if I had overharvested that I would still be in business? There are many other outfitters with experience that predates the 1999 Spring hunt cancellation that would be willing to share.
 You are seriously hindering the tourism industry by limiting the form 33’s rather than limiting the harvest ratio. I figure if you have say 20 form 33’s then you can harvest 20 bears. If your normal success rate it about 30% then why would you not be allowed 60 form 33’s of if you did the calculation it would be 66.66 forms or 67. Chapleau sure had the rite idea and it worked well so the wheel does not entirely have to be reinvented.
 Thank you very much.

44826,/comment/44826,"Permanently bringing back the spring bear hunt, is a dangerous, irresponsible move being condemned by environmental and animal protection groups.
The province outlawed the spring bear hunt in 1999 because bear cubs were being orphaned after their mothers were shot to death. After re-introducing spring bear hunt pilot projects, the government now wants to bring this cruel hunt back for good, all to appease the powerful hunting lobby.
Hungry black bears are baited with food, when they emerge from their dens after a long winter of hibernation. When they reach the bait, they are mercilessly gunned down.
Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mothers often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators. Cubs are dependent on their mothers and remain with them until they are 17-18 months old, can be mistaken as small adult bears and killed by hunters.
As it is, black bears have the lowest rate of reproduction of any land mammal in Canada. The survival of adult females is vital for the species.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage and other attractants. We can co-exist.
The government has disclosed a need to reduce black bear hunting in Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to population concerns, yet it is irresponsibly proposing to allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week each spring.
The economic argument for allowing the hunt shouldn't even be considered. Sustaining our wildlife resources is far more important, at a time when wildlife numbers are plummeting world wide.

44829,/comment/44829,"Dear Premier Wynne
 c.c. Ontario MPP's
Our family is appalled by your decision to allow a Spring Bear Hunt in Ontario. For us this is both a political and a moral issue.
The Conservatives, under Mike Harris, cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt 15 years ago because of the extreme cruelty in leaving hundreds of tiny orphaned bear cubs to die a slow death of starvation. How can your government possibly justify reinstating this throwback to another era?
We find it hard to believe that you are unaware of the following facts:
* Attracting bears with food bait when they are coming out of hibernation and obviously very hungry to be easily picked off by a hunter sitting in a nearby tree blind is hardly hunting, rather it is target practice.
* Your government states that ""it will remain illegal to kill a female bear with cubs"". This assurance is disingenuous given that it's rare to be able to see a bear's genitals or lactating teats from a tree blind at a distance. Furthermore, mother bears approaching a food source where there may be other bears send their cubs into hiding before approaching the bait.
* It was why, in 1999, the Spring Bear Hunt was cancelled when MNR staff revealed that over 270 bear cubs were orphaned each year and left to starve to death as a direct result of the hunt. A former MNR staff member indicates that this number is low and that it was more likely closer to 1,000 cubs that died.
* Your government indicates that there has been an increase in the black bear population and that Ontario is home to a healthy and sustainable bear population. In fact, the black bear population has not increased. To the contrary, the 2007 Annual Report of the Auditor General of Ontario conveys that 'despite the cancellation of the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999, government bear hunting data show that bear populations are likely not being maintained at sustainable levels and that every year, hunters kill more female bears than allowed by law'.
* In attempting to justify the Spring Bear Hunt, you have stated that ""public safety is paramount and Ontarians should feel safe in their communities"". If, in fact, your real concern is public safety, you would acknowledge the studies that have conclusively shown that the greater number of bears killed, the greater number of human-bear conflicts and complaints. A report by Dr. Edward A. Tavss of Rutgers University http://www.bearsmart.com/docs/Tavss-v4.pdf on a dozen communities across North America included data from Ontario which shows that there has been a bear hunt every year in this province, with generally increasing numbers of bears killed annually, and a corresponding increase in the number of complaints.
* On the other hand, the report shows where jurisdictions have implemented conflict prevention and education strategies, there has been a significant decrease in bear conflicts and complaints. The Elliot Lake Ontario community is one such example. The year before public education and bear resistant containers were introduced, there were 500 nuisance bears and three shootings. Using the Bear Wise model program, in 2004 this was reduced to 87 nuisance bears and no shootings.
* Given these results, we are shocked that your government has abandoned the Bear Wise Program and instead plans to use an inhumane, ineffectual and highly controversial lethal approach to bear management in Ontario. Our consternation is shared by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario in his 2012-13 Report where he criticizes the gutting of the Bear Wise program, a program which successfully reduced human/bear conflicts.
Policy must derive from logic and compassion, not political opportunism. We urge you to cancel the ill-conceived plan for a Spring Bear Hunt and immediately re-instate all elements of the highly-effective Bear Wise program.
I look forward to your response to these concerns and your assurance that, unlike previous Environmental Bill of Rights consultations conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, this one will be transparent and fair. It will be closely scrutinized.
Sincerely
Derrick

44833,/comment/44833,"I was notified of your intention to make changes to the regulation about bear hunting in Ontario. It looks like you want to ensure more people than the land holders or their relations can hunt bears in Ontario, and want to expand this, plus you want to hunt hungry bears just coming out of hibernation, which includes momma bears with new cubs.
Personally, I do not agree with your new regulations. Supposedly your reasoning is that bears in that region are becoming more common? Have you the results of any statistical studies verifying that? We would like to see those reports.
So your solution is to kill the moms and their cubs. The moms by baiting them in their hungry period, and their cubs by starvation as their mom will be dead.
If this is what Canadian Fish and Wildlife has come to, I am not for it.
Avoiding confrontations with bears takes other alternative action from human settlements than killing. It means using bear safe garbage containers. Secure barns, graineries to avoid bear entry. No pets held outside on chains, or insecure pens.
More can be done by us first before we should resort to hunting at all. Especially the inhumane method which seems to be favored by Canadian Fish and Wildlife department.
The hunters in Canada have a powerful group, that can apply a lot of pressure to the government to make their voices heard, but the rest of us also must have a say, and we have our reasons for our opinions also, which I think are better ones than that a bear skin is desired for my cabin.

Re: Environmental Registry #019-1112:
Proposed Changes to Black Bear Hunting Regulations
We are writing to register our strong opposition to the Spring Bear Hunt.
It is unethical to hunt any species in the spring, not only are the bears depleted from their hibernation period and desperate to find food, but they also have young to care for. Hunting of any other large game species is not permitted in the spring when there are dependent young.
Utilizing baiting stations should also be prohibited, it is akin to shooting fish in a barrel. In the spring the animals are ravenous from months without food and in the fall they are focused on finding enough food to reach a body weight that will sustain them through hibernation.
As for it being illegal to shoot a female bear with cubs, cubs are seldom with the mother at the food site and it is well established that it is very difficult for hunters to determine the nursing status of a bear from a tree blind. This means that cubs will be orphaned in the spring. Unable to care for themselves, they will suffer and die.
With respect to the assertion that the Spring Bear Hunt helps reduce human/bear conflicts, this was shown not to be the case by Martyn Obbard, the Ministry’s own bear biologist, now retired.  Evidence shows that it does not minimize human conflicts with bears.
Education and prevention are the only sensible and cost-effective tools that exist when it comes to dealing with human-wildlife interactions. For this reason, Ontario’s Bear Wise Program must be reinstated. An evaluation of the program that was conducted with the participation of northern municipalities, organizations and citizens found that “There is overwhelming support for the program in general, particularly in the areas of response and community funding.”
The former Minister of Natural Resources, John Snobelen, who cancelled the spring bear hunt in 1999, has publicly denounced its reintroduction.  In an Op-ed in the Toronto Sun he states “In Ontario we don’t hunt large game in the spring. We believe in fair chase and hunting for consumption. The best of our hunting traditions don’t include blasting away from a tree stand at hungry bears lured to bait”.
In closing we would like to recommend Recommendations:
The withdrawal of the Environmental Registry #019-1112; the reinstatement of the ban on the spring bear hunt; end the spring hunt and trapping in the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula; the tightening of the fall bear hunt to include no hunting of mothers with cubs (family groups); and the reintroduction of the Bear Wise Program.

3. Instituting a province-wide spring black bear season cannot be justified as a way to reduce human-bear conflict.
4. Economic gain from a spring season is not substantial. A spring season mostly moves revenue to outfitters from the fall to the spring with no net gain.
5. Suspended baits should be made mandatory in order to skew the harvest towards males and protect adult females, especially should a spring season be implemented permanently.
6. The hunting season on the Bruce Peninsula should be closed completely to halt further declines in the number of bears in the population and to halt further declines in genetic diversity which would be a threat to the long-term viability of the population.

There are a great deal of issues surrounding the existing spring bear hunt that have not been addressed appropriately. While The Fur-Bearers strongly oppose the spring bear hunt and believe it should be cancelled, there are issues that must be considered if it is to continue. The list below was created in conjunction with information from Bear With Us Sanctuary and Rehabilitation Centre for Bears in Ontario and Coyote Watch Canada.
1. Females with cubs must be protected; currently that is difficult as cubs are frequently treed or kept away by their mother while she forages.
2. The current season of May 1 to June 15 should be changed to June 1 to June 30 to protect females with cubs as well as the cubs themselves.
3. Evidence as to the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot project and the extended pilot project (not the original strategy written before the hunts) need to be released to the public.
4. Baiting should not take place; if it will, baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife. All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
5. Information showing an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available.
6. The government must make an acknowledgement that a spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in the face of their own evidence showing it does not impact human conflict with bears; education and enforcement of human behaviour, attractants and feeding will have the greatest impact on mitigating and preventing conflict.
7. A report should be created and released on the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
8. A report should be created and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
9. The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.

Angling and hunting generate significant tourism revenues for Ontario especially from visitors to Ontario from the USA.

""We have advocated and will continue to advocate that a properly regulated spring bear hunt will support sustainable management of our black bear populations and provide benefits to the Ontario economy through taxes and jobs.
A report that was circulated by your Ministry in 2018, titled; Black bear hunters in Ontario in 2017: Expenditures, characteristics, and hunting experiences, showed that the pilot spring bear hunt season in 2017 hunters spent $13.8 million and the fall hunt contributed $36.8 million. Together the spring and fall bear hunt season contributions are $50.6 million. This report confirms that the return of the spring bear hunt to Ontario is supported by resident and non-resident hunters and will have a positive impact to the Province.
For the tourism industry, returning a spring bear hunt to Ontario will provide bear outfitters the opportunity to be more flexible with their bear hunting offerings to non-resident and resident hunters.
We are encouraged that MNRF has presented changes that will reduce conflicts on the ground in Bear Management Areas. Conflicts involving non-resident property owners as well as resident hunters who hire the services of non-licenced bear outfitters has been a growing concern.
We are also encouraged that the bear hunting opportunities that were given to non-resident property owners and non-resident immediate relatives will be redistributed to tourism businesses. This shows our bear outfitting industry that our Ontario Government sees the value in tourism as an economic driver and that it supports businesses in the Province. It also acknowledges the experience and knowledge that our industry has to provide professional hunting services.
Requiring those that offer bear guiding services to residents to have a Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services, will not only help to reduce conflicts on the ground in our BMAs but will ensure that economic contributions are made for these services. It will certainly help to address the issues of fairness as it relates to business in our industry.
These changes are a step in the right direction to supporting a sustainable black bear hunt as well as the many bear outfitting businesses that have and will continue to contribute to significantly to the economy of Ontario.
We are pleased to support the components of this proposal and look forward to continuing our work with your ministry to develop enhanced harvest management approaches/systems that will further support the sustainability of our black bear populations as well as our bear outfitting industry.""

Certainty would best be achieved by permanently cancelling this cruel and unnecessary killing game, instead of bowing to the powerful hunting lobby instead.

I have heard of it from some of my native friends but otherwise not.  So this is an unnecessary and cruel ""hobby"" that should be banned completely.  The regulations speak of the hunting of cubs and females with cubs as being banned but at some point a female will make short trips away from her cubs.  How are hunters able to determine if she has a cub at that time?  We all know that they can't and therefore there are many orphaned cubs left behind who, if they are very lucky, get rescued and rehabbed at the tax payers expense or with public donations ( again at the tax payers expense because who is it making those donations?).  Also, how does whoever created these regulations think that baby bears get made?  I'll explain it, it takes a mommy bear and a daddy bear.  So where is the sense in allowing any bears, male or female, being hunted for their skins, fur or someones big hunter ego?

Hunters especially US Hunters shoot first and ask questions later.  Young bears are shot, sows are shot leaving orphan bears.  Again NOT ETHICAL!
There is more tourism value to viewing live animals that murdering hungry animals who have been trained to feed from baits.

To Whom it May Concern:
Re: “Proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations” (ERO No. 019-1112)
Please accept these comments on behalf of Animal Justice Canada in response to the above-noted posting on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (“ERO”).
Animal Justice is deeply concerned about this proposal to permanently reinstate the spring black bear hunt.  As set out below, the proposal will cause serious harm to black bears across the province, including females and young cubs in particular.  The government has provided very little justification for the proposal. The ERO posting speculates that it may have positive economic consequences, but sets out no scientific or ethical justification for allowing hunters, including an increasing number of non-resident hunters, to bait hungry bears as they emerge from hibernation, shooting them over bait piles and potentially orphaning their cubs.
The proposed amendments to Ontario Regulation 665/98 (Hunting) and Ontario Regulation 670/98 (Open Seasons-Wildlife) under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act will not improve human safety.  They are a huge moral step backward, given that the spring bear hunt was cancelled in 1999 to prevent orphaning cubs, saving the lives of thousands of bears.  Neither of the two pilot projects implemented since then have demonstrated any basis to believe reinstating the hunt is in the public interest. Bringing back the spring bear hunt would be contrary to the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (“Ministry”), which is to protect Ontario’s rich biodiversity, not to make it easier to kill vulnerable bears in an effort to appease hunters.
I.	About Animal Justice
Animal Justice is Canada’s only not for profit organization focused on using the law to protect animals.  Animal Justice has tens of thousands of supporters and donors from communities across Canada.
Animal Justice works to prevent cruelty to animals by going to court to enforce existing laws, encouraging all levels of government to strengthen legal protections for animals, and educating the public on animal practices.  A key focus of Animal Justice’s work is addressing threats to wild animals, including habitat loss and hunting.
When the previous government proposed to introduce spring bear hunt pilot projects in 2014 and 2016, Animal Justice  and hundreds of other non-governmental organizations and private citizens wrote to the government demanding that the proposals be withdrawn.
II.	Certainty for tourist outfitters does not justify an unethical hunt
During the spring bear hunt, hunters bait hungry black bears as they emerge from a winter without food, shooting them at bait sites. Females who have recently given birth are particularly attracted to bait, given that they emerge from their dens in worse body condition than other bears,  having lost up to 40% of their body weight.
A. The spring bear hunt does not reduce human-bear conflict
In the past, the main argument advanced in favour of the spring bear hunt was the need to reduce human-bear conflict.  In 2003, the Ministry established the Nuisance Bear Review Committee to undertake an independent assessment of the spring hunt on “nuisance bear activity”.  The Committee found no evidence that the spring bear hunt reduced human-bear conflict.   This is consistent with other scientific studies that have demonstrated that the spring bear hunt does not improve human safety.
The main causes of human-bear interactions are easy access to garbage, barbecues, and other easily removable attractants, as well as scarcity in the availability of natural food, such as berries and nuts.  Indeed, baiting bears can increase the number of “nuisance” bear incidents.
Despite the Ministry’s own findings that the spring bear hunt did not reduce human-bear conflict, in 2014 and 2016 it implemented spring bear hunt pilot programs to assess the impact of the hunt on human-bear conflict.  Although the results of these two pilot projects would presumably be relevant to deciding whether or not to make the spring bear hunt permanent, the Ministry does not mention these studies in its ERO posting, nor did it release the results.
Presumably the government has now abandoned the unscientific argument that the spring bear hunt will improve human safety.
B.	Females, including nursing mothers, are killed during the spring bear hunt
Ontario prohibits the killing of black bear cubs.  To prevent cubs being orphaned when their nursing mothers are killed in the spring, Ontario also prohibits the killing of females accompanied by cubs.  However, this prohibition is ineffective. Mother bears often leave their cubs in nearby trees or elsewhere as they forage, meaning that there is a good chance that cubs will not be in sight as their mother approaches a bait site, only to be shot by waiting hunters.  Without the presence of cubs, it is difficult for hunters to distinguish between mothers and other bears.
Females are, and will continue to be, killed during the spring bear hunt.   Approximately 70 percent of orphaned cubs die before they reach one year of age.  These cubs either starve to death or are killed by other predators.
C.	Risks to black bear populations
Black bears are known for their low reproduction rates, making the survival of adult females, who reach sexual maturity late in life and have few offspring, particularly important for the species.  The species’s low reproductive rates also means that orphaning cubs is a particularly serious threat to the black bear population. As noted above, female black bears are and will continue to be killed during the spring bear hunt.  The consequences of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt could be significant for black bear populations.
In its 2003 report, the Nuisance Bear Review Committee recommended that any future spring bear hunt in Ontario be a male-only hunt in order to protect the critical adult female component of the black bear population.  In its ERO posting, the Ministry has provided no scientific or ethical justification for the potentially significant adverse effects of its proposal on the black bear population, including in the form of orphaned cubs.
In its ERO posting, Ontario notes the need to reduce black bear hunting on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to serious conservation concerns, yet it is still proposing to allow hunting and trapping of these animals for one week each spring.  We urge the government to act in accordance with its public trust duty, as well the precautionary principle of international and domestic environmental law, and ban the hunting of black bears on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.
D.	Eco-tourism opportunities
The Ministry’s ERO posting states that the economic impact of this proposal is expected to be neutral or positive, but it provides no evidence in support of this claim.  The posting also fails to reference financial benefits associated with promoting eco-tourism and encouraging visitors to view and photograph, rather than shoot, these majestic animals.
III. 	Ban the spring bear hunt
The spring bear hunt was banned in Ontario in 1999 in order to prevent the orphaning of cubs when their mothers are shot accidentally or illegally.  The hunt takes place at a time of vulnerability for bears emerging from months-long hibernation, during which they have lost a great deal of their body mass.  New mothers emerge from hibernation hungry, having lost even more body mass than other bears, and with young cubs to feed.
There is no cultural or economic justification for allowing hunters to lure hungry black bears using bait and shoot these unsuspecting animals for sport.  Re-instating the spring bear hunt will not lessen human-bear conflict. Rather than bringing back this unethical hunt, Animal Justice recommends that the Ministry invest in coexistence education programs, and work with northern communities to explore opportunities for ecotourism that shares the landscape with, and even benefits from, black bears in the wild rather than shooting them when they are at their most vulnerable.
The government’s strongest argument in favour of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt is that it will provide certainty to hunters and tourist outfitters. Given the disastrous consequences of the hunt for bears and cubs across the province, hunters’ desire for certainty is not a scientifically or ethically sound justification.
The Government of Ontario should permanently cancel this cruel and unnecessary hunt and ban bear baiting across the province.  The Ministry’s wildlife management policy should be driven by its duty to protect wildlife, not a desire to appease hunters.

MY RESPONSE TO EBO POSTING # 019-1112
>>With regard to the Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season.
I think it’s a long overdue decision that will help the local tourist economy, bear outfitters as well as the general public that have been plagued by nuisance bears the past two and a half decades. I’m all for it. Thank you.
>>With regard to the Proposal to address Bruce Peninsula black bear population concerns.
 What I have heard was there was next to no public information put forth on this subject in their area.
My recommendation for this part of the EBO 019-1112 would be put it on hold and have some local open houses and then consider it in another EBO along with other changes regarding bears.
>>With regard to the Proposal to Updates to black bear regulations to improve fairness.
1. With regard to Non-Resident property owners not being allowed to hunt without the services of an Outfitter.
 Why on earth would you restrict Non-Resident Ontario Property owners? The property taxes they pay is the same rates as Ontario property owners. They also have higher transfer taxes then residents.
Ontario taxes are high with mill rates in Northern Ontario of 0.17 and up as high as 2.18 in some jurisdictions. Its only the property owner that can get a form 33 from the MNRF to hunt in that specific WMU not all his friends or relatives.
As near as I can come up with an amount of non-residents that make use of this is under 100 in the entire province of Ontario. That’s not a very significant amount to harm the bear population.
What is the plan to give less than 100 forms 33’s to over 2000 Licensed BMA holders? That’s less than 0.05 form each! Not near enough of a significant plus to offset the negative impact of Property Owners rites and privileges.
Give the non-resident property owners a fair shake for their tax dollars and don’t delete this insignificant item. Thanks
2. With regard to individuals or businesses having to have a “License to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services” to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area.
I think it’s a long overdue change that will increase the fairness for all concerned. It will resolve conflict between Licensed BMA holders and unlicensed folks that probably don’t even pay any income taxes on their business ventures. This is a win win situation for everyone. Thank you.
>>There is another Major Concern I have as a Licensed BMA holder and that is the re-allocation of Vacant and Dormant BMA’s.
The MNRF has not made any available in the Sudbury/Espanola District for over 15 years. My friends and partners have tried numerous times to get additional area where the BMA’s have become inactive to increase my hunting area as well as help alleviate the Local Nuisance Bear problem to no avail. Then it was said there is a moratorium until the pilot spring hunt is ended. Now is the time to do something about it. Perhaps the old application system should be revised some what and I would be glad to provide input into that phase of it.
 These dormant properties are hindering established BMA holders from expanding as well as losing the tax payers of this Province income that could be well used by the MNRF with its limited funds. This needs to be addressed forthwith.
>>One other Major Concern I have is the method of issuing of Form 33’s. over the life and History of the BMA creation there was no limit on the amount of form 33 allocation until the Province wide spring bear pilot project. There was one exception and that was in the Chapleau District and it worked well. Where rather than restricting the form 33’s they restricted the number of bears harvested. A very sensible solution. Follow ups in 2016 with telephone chats with the folks in Chapleau MNRF on this matter and they said their system worked well from both an enforcement and a sustainable harvest view.
If you remember when the Spring hunt was canceled in January of 1999 the Outfitters (BMA holders) were given a token compensation based on the number of form 33’s they had used in 1998. This seems to have carried over to 2016 when the form 33’s given to BMA holders were an average of what they had used the previous 3 years with no regard to earlier years at all. This was a band aid that did not and does not work well.
This whole process needs to be rethought and some serious effort be given to make the rite decisions. One important factor that has never been used is the experience of long time bear outfitters that goes way back to before the introduction of BMA’s and that is the knowledge that these folks can share.
There are many outfitters with experience that predates the 1999 Spring hunt cancellation that would be willing to share.
You are seriously hindering the tourism industry by limiting the form 33’s rather than limiting the harvest ratio. I figure if you have say 20 form 33’s then you can harvest 20 bears. If your normal success rate it about 30% then why would you not be allowed 60 form 33’s of if you did the calculation it would be 66.66 forms or 67. Chapleau sure had the rite idea and it worked well so the wheel does not entirely have to be reinvented.
Thank you very much.

Both the fall and spring hunts need to end. Your bears are more valuable alive than dead.

Stop the bear hunt entirely, do not consider expanding it.
I doubt that the majority of voices that want the hunt to end will be heard.

Sow bears are smarter than the people claiming that the hunt causes orphan cubs as sows will not take the cubs to a bear bait where the male bears are for fear of the males killing them. The biggest predator on bear cubs and sows are male bears. I have guided bear hunters for 15 years and hunted bear for over 30 years and saw a sow with a cub at a bear bait once. There is more bears orphaned by vehicles than hunting. If the hunt is stopped the poaching will go up and at that point people are shooting bears everywhere.

-Baiting must end when the season concludes and not begin again until shortly before the fall season and more stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.
-All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
-The Government must consider the impact of a spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, as bear hunters in the spring make up a very small percentage of people enjoying the outdoors in Ontario.
-The use of hounds/dogs to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately halted.
– Hanging baits. To further reduce the chance of a hunter shooting a mother bear, regulations should be changed to make this practice mandatory.
-The Ontario Government needs to hire more people for enforcement, this province needs more Conservation Officers.

It leaves young bear cubs alone and unable to fend for themselves and there is no black bear overpopulation problem.  Outfitters and lodges can surely find more humane ways of making money than by maiming and killing defenceless wildlife. Perhaps they can host host wildlife photographers instead of hunters.

44956,/comment/44956,"I do not support making the spring bear hunt permanent.  It should never been started in 2014.
I have a cottage on Grace Lake, just south of Algonquin Park.  I’ve owned my cottage for 25 years & have noticed a decline in the number of bears I have seen.  They have never been a problem when I hike in the bush. I have never been bothered by a bear or any wildlife.  I use to enjoy seeing the occasional bear around my cottage.  If it got too close to the bird feeder, I’d sing a song. The bear wouldn’t be able to identify the sound, so would scoot off.  I’ve never had any damage to my property from a bear.
For the past 8 or more years, I have not sited a bear around the cottage or in the bush.  There haven’t been any tracks in the snow at the north shore of Grace Lake either.  So sad.  I know there is a hunt lodge on Yankton Lake just north & west of Grace Lake.  This could be the reason the population of bears has decreased.
Camille Labchuk, executive director of Animal Justice said; “hunters struggle to distinguish between male & female bears, even at close range; this is a death warrant for innocent baby bear cubs who will be orphaned & die when their mothers are gunned down by hunters after emerging from hibernation in the spring.  It’s deeply disappointing that the current government has so little regard for the majestic creatures with whom we share this province.”
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner of Guelph states, “Hunting of any species cannot be driven purely by economic interests and should only be considered if the population is healthy.  Consultations must include First Nations, scientists and conservationists.”
We should also have enough sense to acknowledge that human long term survival is dependent on a vibrant biosphere rich in life and diversity; if that disappears, then so do humans as well as many plants, birds, animals & insects.  Decreasing the population of bears will have a negative affect on the biosphere.
I am hoping that the government of Ontario will stop the spring black bear hunt.

There is no cultural or economic justification for allowing hunters to lure hungry black bears using bait and shoot these unsuspecting animals for sport.
The government’s strongest argument in favour of permanently reinstating the spring bear hunt is that it will provide certainty to hunters and tourist outfitters. Given the disastrous consequences of the hunt for bears and cubs across the province, a desire for certainty is hardly a justification. Certainty would best be achieved by permanently cancelling this cruel and unnecessary killing game, instead of bowing to the powerful hunting lobby instead.

Proposed Changes to black bear hunting Regulations.
Ford doubles down on bad Liberal decision
The organizations listed below are writing to express strong opposition to the proposed changes to black bear hunting regulations, namely the implementation of a permanent spring bear hunt.
History:
In 1999, Premier Mike Harris and the Progressive Conservative government ended the spring bear hunt.  At that time, the Minister extended the fall hunt into mid-August, compensated outfitters and established what was considered one of the most progressive Bear Wise programme designed to resolve human/bear conflicts without taking lethal action.
Fifteen years later, in 2014, Premier Wynne and the Liberal government implemented a 2-year black bear spring season pilot from May 1st to June 15th in eight Wildlife Management Units in northern Ontario.  The political excuse used for the introduction of the pilot project was to address human/bear conflicts.  The Liberal government refused to acknowledge the scientific literature which demonstrated that conflicts occurred in greater numbers when food was scarce and declined significantly in food plenty years.
In 2016, Premier Wynne and the Liberal government extended the black bear spring season pilot for an additional 5-years and expanded it to include all Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) where there was an open season for black bear in the fall. The rationale for this move was to appeal to northern voters.
It is shocking to find out that the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario would overturn an ethical and humane decision made by fellow Conservatives and so blindly follow such bad decisions about bear management as those made by Premier Wynne.
Argument against the spring bear hunt:
The arguments against spring bear hunting are well known and based in science and fact.
1.	Cubs are orphaned in the spring.  No matter how careful hunters might be, mistakes are made and mother bears with dependent cubs are shot and killed.
When orphaned during the spring hunt, the cubs are too small to care for themselves so they die from starvation, dehydration or predation. Ministry staff do not collect data about the number of lactating bears killed during the spring hunt.  However, in the late 1990s, during the previous fight to end the spring hunt, the Ministry staff did examine hunt data and determined that approximately 274 bear cubs would be orphaned as a consequence of the spring hunt.
Determining sex of the bear is additionally compromised with the use of dogs.  A paper by Thomas Beck et al titled, “Sociological and Ethical Considerations of Black Bear Hunting” addresses the issue of nursing female bears and the use of dogs during the spring hunt.  The six authors of this study were all representing Fish and Game Departments from six US states.
The article reads as follows, “The biggest issue is the killing of nursing female black bears.  There is no way to prevent this from happening in the spring bear season, either through hunter education or timing of season.  Nursing female black bears often forge at great distances from their cubs.  When pursued by hounds, the female bear usually leaves the cubs in a tree and continues eluding the hounds.  When she trees, she is seldom with her cubs.  Many nursing females do not bring cubs to bait sites initially but will as they grow older and she becomes less wary at the site.  There remains great contention between hunters and bear biologists/managers as to the ability of hunters to accurately assess nursing status of bears.  The conclusion of most biologists is that it is quite difficult to accurately determine nursing status on free-roaming black bears, even when a bear is in a tree or at a bait.  The appearance of nursing females in the kill each spring supports this notion.  During the last year of spring hunting in Colorado, the number of nursing female black bears checked was within three of the number predicted based on breeding rates of females and total female kill.  In other words there was no selection even with regulations prohibiting the taking of nursing females.”
2.	No other big game species is hunted in the spring when there are dependent young or for so many months of the year. In Ontario, bears are hunted for 6 weeks in the spring and 14 weeks in the fall (varies depending on the WMU).   Five of the nine months that they are not hibernating, Ontario black bears are hunted: in the spring when they are ravenous from months of not eating while in hibernation; and in the fall when they are continuously searching for food to put on enough body weight to get through hibernation.
This is addressed in the Guiding Principles section of the Framework for Enhanced Black Bear Management in Ontario-EFFM-June 2009 which states that “Harvest management strategies must recognize that black bears have an inherently low reproductive capacity relative to other harvested large mammals and that, as with other long-lived species, population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females.” (page 3)
3.	Bear hunting and specifically spring bear hunting does not reduce human/bear conflicts as demonstrated by Martyn Obbard, the Ministry’s own bear biologist, now retired.  Despite evidence to the contrary, the hunting community has long advocated the spring hunt as a way to reduce human/bear conflicts.  Mr. Obbard’s research found that conflicts were not reduced because of hunting but occurred when food was scarce.  Mr. Obbard et al published a 2014 paper on the subject titled “Relationships among food availability, harvest, and human-bear conflict at the landscape scale in Ontario Canada.”
In addition, after the spring hunt was cancelled in 1999, the Ministry formed an independent Nuisance Bear Review Committee to review the issue and found that “there was no evidence that spring harvest reduced nuisance bear activity.”
Finally, the government’s own framework, cited in the Environmental Registry posting, (Framework for Enhanced Black Bear Management in Ontario-EFFM-June 2009) also acknowledges that “Human-bear conflicts are known to increase in years of low natural food availability.”(page 3)
4.	According to the Environmental Registry posting, the Ministry conducted two spring bear hunt pilot studies about the impact of the hunt on human/bear conflicts.  It failed to release the results of those studies in the ER posting despite the obvious relevance of the findings.  This government is acting in the same manner as the Liberal government, hiding data and ignoring the science in order to justify its position to permanently reinstate the spring bear hunt.
5.	The effects of a rapidly changing climate on species is unknown. For example, the decline in moose populations in Ontario and various other parts of their historical range has been attributed to climate change.  The Ministry acknowledges that it is difficult to estimate black bear population size and trends.  It also acknowledges that “the black bear’s inherently slow rate of recovery from low population levels increases the risks for local populations where harvest pressure and other mortality are high.” (IBID pg. 4)
Combine the difficulty determining population levels and problems with slow rates of recovery from low populations with unknown effects of climate change and concerns with the spring bear hunt are increased substantially.  The Ministry states, “Black bear populations throughout Ontario may be affected by the predicted effects of climate change due to rising air temperatures and decreased precipitation. This could contribute to increasingly frequent droughts and less food for bears leading to increasing human-bear conflict and, potentially, reproductive failure in bears.” (IBID pg. 4)
Bear hunting and trapping on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula:
The Environmental Registry posting acknowledges the decline in black bear numbers on the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula.  The registry states that “human caused mortality should be reduced to support sustainability of this genetically isolated population”.
In an interview with the Owen Sound Sun Times (February 12, 2020) retired Ministry research scientist Martyn Obbard states “that the entire hunt on the Bruce Peninsula should be cancelled due to the declining number of bears…”  He continued by stating that “…any further loss of black bears would further limit the genetic diversity of the Peninsula black bear population.”   (https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/province-proposing-to…)
For this reason, the government should extend the closure of the fall hunt to also include the spring hunting and trapping season.
Recommendations:
For all the above reasons, we recommend:
1.	the withdrawal of the Environmental Registry #019-1112;
2.	the reinstatement of the ban on the spring bear hunt;
3.	end the spring hunt and trapping in the Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula;
4.	the tightening of the fall bear hunt to include no hunting of mothers with cubs (family groups); and
5.	the reintroduction of the Bear Wise programme.

Categorizing Ontario non-resident landowners with any ravaging non-resident is improper and inappropriate. The purpose of a guide is to provide their client knowledge in wildlife behavior and their movement patterns, and also provide advice on hunting and fire regulations. None of that advice is necessary and proper for any landowner regardless of their residency status. If a landowner does not feel comfortable hunting on their own land then they may, at their own volition, hire a guide. The decision to utilize a guide should be left up to the landowner.

MY RESPONSE TO EBO POSTING # 019-1112
>>With regard to the Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season.
 I think it’s a long overdue decision that will help the local tourist economy, bear outfitters as well as the general public that have been plagued by nuisance bears the past two and a half decades. I’m all for it. Thank you.
>>With regard to the Proposal to address Bruce Peninsula black bear population concerns.
  I’ve been down that way a few times and also have friends (including former BMA holders) there that have moved south from the Sudbury area. My friends are not pleased at all with the hunt being shortened to one week only in the spring and no hunt in the fall. Another thing they told me was there was next to no public information put forth on this subject in their area.
 My recommendation for this part of the EBO 019-1112 would be put it on hold and have some local open houses and then consider it in another EBO along with other changes regarding bears.
 >>With regard to the Proposal to Updates to black bear regulations to improve fairness .
1.        With regard to Non-Resident property owners not being allowed to hunt without the services of an Outfitter.
 I’ve been an outfitter for Black Bears since 1972 and have also as an individual hunted in jurisdictions other than Ontario for big game. Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, and the Yukon in Canada and South of the border in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Texas, West Virginia, South Dakota, Colorado and Florida. In none of these provinces, territories or states was I required to use an Outfitters services.
 My personal pocket book/wallet determined the use of an outfitter rather than foolish laws. Why on earth would you restrict Non-Resident Ontario Property owners? The property taxes they pay is the same rates as Ontario property owners. They also have higher transfer taxes then residents.
 Ontario taxes are high with mill rates in Northern Ontario of 0.17 and up as high as 2.18 in some jurisdictions. Its only the property owner that can get a form 33 from the MNRF to hunt in that specific WMU not all his friends or relatives. In 49 years as a Black Bear outfitter I never had a problem with the scant few of these folks in my area. Four (4) separate parties in over 40 years in my BMA’s. In fact, some of them that were able to get one (1) form 33 came to me to outfit other family members and relations so it’s a win win situation.
 As near as I can come up with an amount of non-residents that make use of this is under 100 in the entire province of Ontario.
 I’ve heard rumours that if these form 33’s are suspended then they will be reallocated to Bonafede licensed bear operators in each area. I do not believe such. What is the plan to give less than 100 forms 33’s to over 2000 Licensed BMA holders? That’s less than 0.05 form each! Not near enough of a significant plus to offset the negative impact of Property Owners rites and privileges.
 My personal thought is that the MNRF just don’t want to bother with it any more.
Give the non-resident property owners a fair shake for their tax dollars and don’t delete this insignificant item. Thanks
2.       With regard to individuals or businesses having to have a “License to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services” to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area.
I think it’s a long overdue change that will increase the fairness for all concerned. It will resolve conflict between Licensed BMA holders and unlicensed folks that probably don’t even pay any income taxes on their business ventures. This is a win win situation for everyone. Thank you.
>>There is another Major Concern I have as a Licensed BMA holder and that is the re-allocation of Vacant and Dormant BMA’s.
 The MNRF has not made any available in the Sudbury/Espanola District for over 15 years. I have tried numerous times to get additional area where the BMA’s have become inactive to increase my hunting area as well as help alleviate the Local Nuisance Bear problem to no avail. All I received was a myriad of fairly lame excuses. Then it was said there is a moratorium until the pilot spring hunt is ended. Now is the time to do something about it. Perhaps the old application system should be revised some what and I would be glad to provide input into that phase of it.
  These dormant properties are hindering established BMA holders from expanding as well as losing the tax payers of this Province income that could be well used by the MNRF with its limited funds. This needs to be addressed forthwith.
 >>One other Major Concern I have is the method of issuing of Form 33’s. over the life and History of the BMA creation there was no limit on the amount of form 33 allocation until the Province wide spring bear pilot project. There was one exception and that was in the Chapleau District and it worked well. Where rather than restricting the form 33’s they restricted the number of bears harvested. A very sensible solution I thought. I did follow up in 2016 with telephone chats with the folks in Chapleau MNRF on this matter and they said their system worked well from both an enforcement and a sustainable harvest view.
 If you remember when the Spring hunt was canceled in January of 1999 the Outfitters (BMA holders) were given a token compensation based on the number of form 33’s they had used in 1998. This seems to have carried over to 2016 when the form 33’s given to BMA holders were an average of what they had used the previous 3 years with no regard to earlier years at all. This was a band aid that did not and does not work well.
 This whole process needs to be rethought and some serious effort be given to make the rite decisions. One important factor that has never been used is the experience of long time bear outfitters that goes way back to before the introduction of BMA’s and that is the knowledge that these folks can share.
 In my case in particular this is my 49th year as a Black Bear Outfitter in Ontario. Do you really think if I had overharvested that I would still be in business? There are many other outfitters with experience that predates the 1999 Spring hunt cancellation that would be willing to share.
 You are seriously hindering the tourism industry by limiting the form 33’s rather than limiting the harvest ratio. I figure if you have say 20 form 33’s then you can harvest 20 bears. If your normal success rate it about 30% then why would you not be allowed 60 form 33’s of if you did the calculation it would be 66.66 forms or 67. Chapleau sure had the rite idea and it worked well so the wheel does not entirely have to be reinvented.
 Thank you very much.

44985,/comment/44985,"Since mother bears will sometimes be away from their cubs for a short time, there is a strong chance that a number of mothers may be shot and killed leaving cubs without mothers.  Unfortunately, there did not seem to be anything in the proposal as to what would be done to support cubs  in the cases where their mothers have been accidentally shot.  If a mother dies, there is a strong likelihood the cubs will not survive which is counterintuitive to what the hunting community would want.  According to a paper by Ken Morrison a former wildlife specialist with the OMNR, acknowledges orphaning when he states, “70% of cubs orphaned during spring seasons died before one year of age” (Status of Black Bears Harvested in Wildlife Management Units 39, 41 and 42, Ken Morrison, Wildlife Specialist, OMNR, October 1996, pg 7).
In addition, to the cruelty and harm that a spring bear hunt does to the population, the report below goes on to highlight the significant damage that is done to the environment during the spring.

44994,/comment/44994,"I sincerely urge you to end the spring bear hunt.
There is nothing virtuous about taking joy in killing an animal minding their own business. In fact, it is a barbaric practice!
Please note: Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbecues, and other attractants.
Bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species.
The government has disclosed a need to reduce black bear hunting in Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to population concerns, yet it is simultaneously proposing to allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week each spring. This is irresponsible.
Even the economic argument for allowing the hunt is weak. The government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, but has provided no evidence to support this claim. Plus, killing others is plain violence!

Living in the country i have seen two black bears years apart that suffered from gunshot injuries. One had her elbow shot; she couldn’t walk or forage properly and was found dead nearby a few days later. Imagine dying like that.
Given technological advances, conclusive research collected about bears and their behaviour, a spring bear hunt has become completely unacceptable. Honestly, i’m not sure why any spring hunting of anyone is acceptable since there is such a high possibility of orphans.

I would imagine from my limited perspective that humans have and always will be a part of the food chain and hunters provide that part of the natural system. On top of that, they provide data and money for ecological study through the MNR.

45000,/comment/45000,"My comment is to address the spring bear hunt regulations
I do not support the spring bear hunt being extended -
I support the position taken by Premier Mike Harris when he ended the hunt and for all the reasons he cited at that time.
The complete and current data associated with the hunt should be in a readily available website - to ensure transparency and further build confidence in OMNRF management practices
If the hunt was to be extended - the use of bait and the use of dogs should not be allowed (prohibited) at any time of the year.
It is not unreasonable to assume the use of bait can be expected to habituate post hibernation bears to waste human food products and results in the establishing the conditions for creating nuisance bears -
Personal experience - indicates the use of bait in the spring results in dead female (lactating) bears.  Orphaned cubs are difficult to locate. Poor light conditions (Dawna nd dusk) make it difficult to distinguish between male and female bears except in the situation of exceptional large male bears - an uncommon event.
The use of bait is also not sportsmanlike and is viewed unfavaourably by sportsmen in the hunting of other species in Ontario -
The use of bait and tree stands reflects badly on hunting  - when viewed by both non-hunters and many hunters.  There is a social licence applicable to all hunting that can be put in jeopardy by the continuation of this unsportsman-like practice - baited spring bear hunts are tough to defend.

45010,/comment/45010,"I oppose the MNR proposal to implement an annual spring bear hunt for a number of reasons.
Firstly, no government agency should presume to have self- appointed authority to justify and promote the death of a bear (or any other living creature) especially for the purpose of dubious economic benefit to a region or select business interests. Or to satisfy some individuals who feel empowered by the ""sport""  of killing some unsuspecting big game animal with a high powered rifle under the guise of a hunting tradition which has deviated from the origin of feeding oneself and family.  I'm sure that any of the temporary economic benefits derived by the guides and tags are all driven by profit, not hunger.
  For anyone to assume that there can be a totally predictable and controllable outcome from increased reduction in species numbers by human intervention is folly and ignorance of the resultant outcomes with just about every species that man has ever hunted.-- Finite numbers, shrinking habitat, increased unnecessary hunting equals threatened species. Proven throughout history, whether it's whales, rhinos, tigers, elephants or cod fisheries we usually see the irrevocable results too late. Perhaps the dwindling black bear population on the Bruce will serve as another example.
  As an Ontarian, I have a voice in opposing this proposal for the annual  hunt and like many others see this as a further step towards jeopardizing the bears' natural rights to live free from unwarranted  endangerment in  Ontario.

45018,/comment/45018,"I'm a senior and have been an Ontario resident my entire life. I've also spent many decades enjoying Ontario's forests, and canoeing, hiking and camping in wilderness areas. The people I've camped with have always been vigilant about storing food properly to avoid any negative encounters with bears.  Several times I've seen adult black bears as well as cubs in the forests. Those moments were memorable and left me with a feeling of awe. The few times I've seen a bear in the wild, they have always wandered off in a different direction and seemed anxious to avoid contact with people.  On a hike a few years ago, I saw a mother bear with two cubs. She quickly guided her cubs over a hill far away from us, and I never felt in danger. On the contrary, I felt so fortunate to experience a brief glimpse of Ontario's amazing wildlife.
I cannot emphasize enough how angry and extremely distressed I am about the Ontario government's plan to reinstate the Spring Bear Hunt. To hold a bear hunt in the early spring when mother bears and their newborn cubs are just emerging from their dens, seems particularly cruel. Hunters are unable to identify if a bear is a nursing mother, until after she has been killed. That leaves vulnerable young cubs, unable to fend for themselves, to die a slow lingering death. There is no way to say this gently -- anyone who thinks that this is acceptable, is not a human with a conscience, but a monster!  That this is sanctioned by a government is unbelievable, and proof that politicians ONLY care about money.

This proposal and the idea of an annual hunt is absolutely disgusting. I was very happy to return to Ontario after living in the United States (NYC / NJ area) for 14 years. I am dismayed by the number of gun incidents and crimes that are now rampant in the GTA and Ontario, caused by illegal gun ownership and the ''loosening"" of gun restrictions and attitudes. The appalling attitude of Americans towards guns, hunting, and everything related to guns is one of the reasons I left there. It is very sad to see Canada moving downhill in that direction. The majority of Canadians abhore hunting and everything that goes along with it, as they are more interested in helping the environment rather than feeling it is their right to plunder everything in sight.
An issue that I became aware of when living in the USA, is the Annual Bear Hunt in the state of New Jersey. Although I am not interested in hunting or part of that culture, I became very aware of the issue due to the large number of protests, demonstrations and lawsuits launched every year in the attempt to remove the hunt. It had also become a platform for politicians as they promised to do something about removing the hunt should they be elected. Ontario will be on the receiving end of similar protests, demonstrations and the like should this move forward. I envision they would be somewhat like the protests currently taking place that are shutting down train travel. You are welcoming and encouraging these types of protests annually should you move forward.

45029,/comment/45029,"Hello,
I wish to express my concern with the spring bear hunt being extended. The main reason is that there is no way for hunters to be absolutely sure that a bear does not have cubs. The cubs are only 2 to 3 kg before June 1st. The mother leaves them to go forage for food as they can’t follow their mothers yet. If a mother bear happens to pass by an area that has been baited on her own, how will the hunters know she has cubs waiting for her? This is very cruel has it now leaves cubs to fend for themselves and very likely to starve to death. Some end up with a wildlife rehabilitator who quickly becomes overwhelmed with the time needed to care for them on top of all the other wildlife and also the cost which is not supported by the government.
Bears are mostly vegetarians and the decline of the moose population cannot be blame on them but rather on over hunting by people and the construction of new roads.
As for the danger posed by bears, why are hunters allowed to set up bating areas so close to towns? This would certainly increase the amount of bears coming near humans. The summer of 2015 may have been a bad summer when it comes to bear conflict but the summers of 1991 and 1992 were also bad when the spring bear hunt was legal. Extending the spring bear hunt will not result in an increase in public safety but the Bear Wise program should be brought back to full scale.

Hunting bears especially in May puts mothers and their cubs at risk. Although mothers and cubs are restricted from hunting, cubs are often not within eye site of the mother. Also males and females are difficult to tell apart  another aspect which puts the females at risk.
Businesses have licences  to provide bear hunting services. Allowing hunters to hunt without working through a licensed bear operator could create trophy hunting. Hunters with this aim in mind target the strongest and largest bears. These bears are  needed for healthy reproduction.
Bear Hunting at this time in history is cruel and speaks volumes about humans lack of concern for a species which already facing numerous problems especially on the peninsula.. A study done by Dr. Marty Obbard  shows that  black bears on the Saugeen Peninsula are in danger of extinction within the next 50 years.  Also the study estimates there are only  100 to 316 bears left.
Not only this they are   a genetically isolated  population thus being distinct from other bears
in Ontario. Also it is believed that  the Peninsula bears are unique in denning in crevices.
Pouching and the killing of bears in populated areas where garbage is an issue accounts of  number losses which are not taken into account. Education is the key to keeping humans and bears in close proximity and with one another and not endangering either species..

One thing that does not make any sense is why black bear hunting is even being considered in the first place when accurately numbers of this population have yet to be obtained.
What has yet to occur is a rational explanation in your literature as to why exactly black bear hunting is even necessary. This isn’t about securing food. No one hunts a bear for food or controlling the population. No. This is mostly about Trophy Hunting. Stalking and then committing lethal violence upon an innocent animal isn’t sport. It’s sick, unnecessary, cruel & vile. No living being should have to grow up with a bullseye on their back.
And what about the cubs? Have you stopped to think about what would happen to these babies if they become orphans? How they would survive if their mother is killed?
Regardless of the numbers, this black bear hunting needs to end. It’s 2020 not the 1900’s. It’s time to evolve & find better ways; *nonviolent* ways to address issues that impact the black bear & it’s population such as climate change & conflicts with humans.

The wildlife of Ontario belongs to population and a harvest is appropriate whenever it is found to be humane and sustainable based on science.  Hunting is a heritage activity that along with trapping, fishing and timber harvest was the basis for the settlement of this country.  Many residents enjoy the activity of pursuing wild game for the table.  This is a fundamental human instinct going back to hunter/gatherer days.
Additionally, having spent many years in the outdoors, my personal observation is a hunted population of animals have a natural instinct to avoid contact with people.  This was clear to me having spent time in the interior of Algonquin park and also in Temagami Crown lands on numerous canoe trips.  This to me implies that hunting may minimize nuisance bear occurrences and the subsequent euthanization of problem bears and the wasting of the carcass.

The 1999 ban was so clearly the correct option.
The proposed spring bear hunt is disgusting and unethical on many levels:
-There is no monitoring to enforce the prohibition on killing female bears with young. Females often stash their cubs in the dens and go foraging for food. It's important that hunters are able to identify a female, especially a nursing female.
-Female bears with cubs get killed because hunters can't tell the difference between males and females. Reference: Obbard, Martyn E. et al. (2008), “Suspended baits: Can they help hunters distinguish male from female American black bears?” Ursus 19(1): 33 – 42.
-Orphaned cubs starve or are predated. This is sickening. How can politicians countenance this? Why are ministry biologists not going public with the facts?
-I am not opposed to the hunter who tracks a wild animal and kills it with a clean shot. But this is not a hunt. This is some overweight bozo sitting in a tree and luring the animal in with junk-food bait. It is despicable.
-Such an important change in the life of our forest species should be backed up by data. There have been two pilot projects, one in 2014-15, the other in 2016-20 (still apparently ongoing). But no information has been released!!!  It is a stain on the record of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and an insult to the public that a decision has been made without proper supporting evidence.
-One claim made to support this measure is that it would reduce human-bear conflcts. To the contrary, the evidence is that a ban on the spring bear hunt would have no impact on human safety.
-Another claim is that the spring bear hunt would result in economic benefits for the outfitters who cater to this trade. No evidence is produced. The general view is there will be no overall economic benefit and the proposed spring bear hunt will merely detract from the present legal fall bear hunt.  I reject this prioritization of dubious increased outfitter profits over starving or predated bear cubs. Let the bears live their lives and stop this cruelty.
-Baiting. This is unsportsmanlike, unethical, and serves to lure bears into human proximity and familiarize them with human contact. Result? Nuisance bears. STOP BAITING. Instead our despicable government has facilitated more nuisance bear behaviour by reducing the minimum distance requirement for placement of bait from rights of way. Who does this benefit? Overweight bozos who find walking 200 metres a challenge and are - according to the government's plan - to be allowed to sit on bait a mere 30 metres away from rights of way, endangering the public.
-Hunting on the Saugeen-Bruce peninsula. Please! Close this hunt down.
My brother the bear, my sister the fox, I am with you in spirit. I am so sad this is happening in the beautiful land we share.

It is proven that nursing mothers can not be reliably distinguished from other bears, and therefore we are jeopardizing cubs by going forward with the spring bear hunt.  Private profits should not trump ethics and morals.

If the province is going to brazenly move forward on bad information then they should be proactive in ensuring hunters are educated in being able to tell the difference in a Male and female bear. There is the fall hunt and I believe that at this time, that is sufficient.

Only humans can show such lack of compassion for no reason except greed or barbarism.  Is this what the Ontario government thinks Ontario’s citizens are?
This letter opposes the proposals presented in ERO 019-1112 to expand and make permanent the spring bear hunting season.   It closes with an appendix.  If you do choose to ignore all the legitimate concerns expressed below, and their consequences to both people and wildlife, you can at the very least consider the suggested changes listed in this appendix.
FINANCIAL GAIN OVER HUMAN COMPASSION; POLITICAL GAIN AND LOSS
We believe that these changes have been proposed to align the MNRF with the wishes of those who hunt bears, causing the bear population untold, and horrendous pain, loss, and horrible, unconscionable deaths of young male and female bears and their almost infant offspring.  The sole purpose of this action by your Government is to increase revenues, while the costs to our wildlife will be beyond the scope of conscience and ethics. This Government, and the MNRF will be held accountable.
Mr. Ford, your own Party cancelled the spring bear hunt because, in the words of John Snobelen, “…to move to end the spring bear hunt because (our government) will not tolerate cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly shooting mother bears in the spring.”  (January 15, 1999)
This Government would be replaced today if an election were held.  You should know that your lack of compassion toward our wildlife only deepens our resolve.  Action such as is proposed here enrages voters in ridings you will need if you want to form the government again.
And you must be aware that hunters have an insatiable appetite for more and more.  They are never satisfied.  Kathleen Wynne reinstated this hunt in hopes it would influence rural ridings.  This did not save her career or her government, and I will be reminding all those around me of actions such as this when the next election rolls around, unless you make a better choice and cancel this plan.
The rationale that more revenue will flow into Ontario as rich Americans, Europeans, and Asian hunters will be allowed to kill our bears both in the spring and fall.  What chance do our baby bears have in the face of your cruelty and greed?
CRUEL AND INHUMANE ORPHANING
The spring bear hunt is a cruel, unmeasurable and unscientific abuse of animals.   It orphans cubs by the hundreds, and leaves them alone to die from starvation, thirst, climate, or predation.  Further, the deaths may be tortured over weeks and months, over the first year or more.   Starvation is a horrible, cruel death, and the terror the little cubs must experience, being left alone in the world without the mother which nature shows they need for the first year and a half of their lives must be absolutely unbearable. Although illegal, we know from past experiences that some mother bears will be shot, especially since you are also encouraging hunter tourists from regions lacking bears, and thus unfamiliar with their habits (such as mother bears hiding their infants in the trees before foraging to keep them safe from male bears).  This exposes all bears to the dangers of kill-motivated, uninformed persons, left unsupervised in the wild with their deadly weapons.
Further, the MNR (EBR RB9E600l) cancelled the spring bear hunt in l999 because of the need for lactating mothers to remain with their young.  This Ministry has gone backwards in its ethics.
Further, it states that “…the size of the bear population does not guarantee that female bears with young cubs are not mistakenly shot during a spring bear hunt.”  It is beyond ridiculous to suggest that a hunter in a tree blind can determine, with any degree of certainty, a nursing female.  And in the fall, how would a hunter know if there was a juvenile nearby, still in need of his/her mother?  Not seeing the cubs does not mean that there are no cubs with that mother. And enforcement is not possible unless every hunter is accompanied by MNRF staffer who maintains a balanced view of conservation over the need to shoot first, look later.  Add to this the encouragement of foreign hunters who lack awareness of babies hidden in trees, or juveniles who are not far off and still in need of their mothers, and you have a personal disaster, for each bear, in the making.
The practice of killing female adult bears is damaging enough in regards to the fall bear hunt, a hunt which was extended when the spring bear hunt was cancelled and has never been, but should have been, shortened again when the spring hunt resumed.  The fact that bear cubs naturally remain with their mothers until they are a year and a half old shows that young bears do not have the knowledge or skills, even if they have enough fatty tissue to survive the winter, t survive on their own until they are a year and a half old.  They need to learn what to eat, where and how to get food across the seasons, on land and in water.   They need to learn where the species they can eat may hide, and who their enemies are.  They need protection from other predatory species and male adults.  And some are still being fed in the fall because the female adults being shot are often still lactating.  So it is clear that juvenile bears need their mothers in the fall. Yet, during both spring and fall, females are dying, and no doubt, orphans are dying, too, and these are unnecessary as well as cruel deaths for the very young.
In the world of spring bear hunt, there is no protection for any bears.  To an infant bear, or to a juvenile, the only “population” s/he is interested in is her/his mother.   Your own research, published in l996, showed that 70% of cubs orphaned during spring seasons died in the three wildlife areas studied before their first birthday, and that the cubs had been left to die of thirst, exposure, starvation, and /or predation.  It is likely that juveniles often suffer the same fate.
So just how long there will be a healthy and sustainable bear population when mothers are being killed and infants and juveniles are left to die is being disregarded by this Ministry.  It is a travesty of irresponsibility and a betrayal to our citizenry.
ONTARIANS APPRECIATE AND WISH TO PROTECT OUR WILDLIFE
In reality, the vast majority of Ontarians have developed a deep appreciation for, and desire to protect, our wildlife, and do not see sentient beings of any species as objects to be brutalized.  We also want our public lands to be free of human violence.  These ethics are unequivocally clear whenever human-wildlife conflicts occur in human-populated areas, and can be further documented by wildlife rehabilitators whenever injured or orphaned wildlife are discovered.
This Ministry appears to hide behind its premise that it is illegal to “harvest” (kill) bear cubs and female bears with cubs.  Unfortunately, it has no teeth since, whether it is legal or not, it happened to a full third of the hunters’ watch, and since hunters are trusted to self-report, the number is very probably much, much higher.  History shows that either the hunters cannot differentiate between males and females, or they don’t care.  As for the fine involved in killing a female with cubs, it is lacking in intelligence to believe that any hunter would self-report and subject him/herself to the $25,000 fine and jail time.  So, with the serious lack of enforcement, who is going to charge the lawbreaker?  Without a massive hiring of MNRF conservation officers to accompany these hunters, enforcement is not possible.
MINISTRY STUDY PROJECTS AND FINDINGS
You have created this ERO before publishing the results of the two past “studies”, which, I understand, have only been submitted by 39% of the hunters, so the results would not hold any legitimate conclusions anyway.
Furthermore, assessments done by the MNRF`s scientists years ago to examine the issue of human-wildlife conflicts have shown that the spring bear hunt results in a dramatic increase in human-wildlife conflicts, largely due to starvation.
To add insult to injury, this proposal only requires one report by hunters for the year, which means that there will no longer even be an effort to determine the spring seasonal record.
We do know that the Bear-Wise program, weakened and then cancelled, had a very positive effect on both the communities where it was implemented, and the people and bear populations surrounding them.  This success clearly points to a reinstatement and deep funding of this program to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL STRESSES
This proposal ignores the impacts of other current stresses on bears.  Hot, dry summers caused by climate change (lack of food such as berries, etc.), additional proposals to encourage logging and release from strict monitoring and ecological impact proposals which will result in habitat loss, and your government’s current direction at removing any constraints on big business to destroy natural habitats, exponentially increase massive stresses to the bears already being increasingly attacked by humanity.
DISTINGUISHING MOTHER BEARS AND JUVENILE MALES IS IMPOSSIBLE
Understanding bear behaviour confirms that mother bears will not approach baited areas with their young because they are leary of other bears being in the vicinity.  Instead, out of sight and high in trees, they leave their little ones alone to search out the site and the food on their own.  Therefore, there is no way of being assured that the bear before the bait is not a mother.
Second, male and female bears in the spring are both small and thin.  It is very challenging to discern any difference from a hunter`s stand.  Therefore, the submitting of teeth to discern how many females were killed was very important, and should have been required.  It was not.  This fact demonstrates that your Ministry is not interested in seeing the true cost to our bears, and to future generations, of this hunt.
BAITING
Food baits at their core are an ethical issue which reeks of barbarian tactics.  Hunters bait bears at their most vulnerable, while they are starving and desperate, including mothers feeding babies at a time when there is very little food available naturally.  Setting up feeding stations, then sitting in tree tents and killing whatever bear approaches, means that many, many mothers and juveniles will die, and their babies will be left to die as well.  Looking from above, how would they know if the bear was lactating or not?  How would they know if she had a juvenile nearby, or babies?
The use of baiting is more likely to create human-wildlife conflicts than any other single thing hunters could do, and to do this when, especially feeding mothers, are starving after the long, brutal winters we now experience is a travesty.  Further, this form of `hunting` is anything but sport.  There is no sport in sitting in a raised tent, or behind a large baited tree and shooting a starving bear who approaches.  It is anything but sport, and can be likened to the shooting of a person standing beside a symbolic monument.  Neither are deserved.  Neither are conscionable.
The lack of discrimination among hunters was clear in the first two years’ study findings, which were, in part, published.   Fully a third of the bears killed in those years were females.  Who knows how many orphans there were, and this just represents the number we know about!
LACK OF MONITORING
When the second “study” period was approved, the MNRF could not possibly have known how many bears, or what type, had been  killed since it hadn’t even received 50% of the reports from licenced hunters!   Setting maximum numbers without having the statistics of what has already been done was ridiculous, and demonstrated that this Province does not want or value scientific decision-making.
This continues in the current ERO, since there has been no provision for additional Ministry enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers has not been planned in this ERO plan.
BEAR-WISE PROGRAM
Communities should know that the cost benefits of this additional licensing are inaccurate, since the costs of dealing with wildlife conflicts in communities has been downloaded to them,  without provision of any humane management strategies or materials.  This decries any intent of public safety being put forward by the Ministry.
The Bear-Wise Program, which should be being funded and extended, was proven to work in the communities where it was properly funded and implemented.  Black bears are naturally shy and suspicious of humanity, and this program used the best practices available to prevent human-wildlife conflicts.
We request that this proposal be cancelled immediately, that an independent panel of scientists follow through on the two past spring bear hunt programs’ effectiveness, and that the Bear-Wise Program be reinstated, and properly funded to protect any citizens of Ontario who may be considered at-risk.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES “NEUTRAL”
This suggestion ignores the impact on both the living animals affected by the spring bear hunt, and costs to our future bear populations, since your statistics, monitoring and ongoing research are being thwarted by the changes to your licensing plan.  The costs of terror, suffering, injury, orphaning, starvation, and predation are not neutral.  We have a moral and ethical responsibility to be caring stewards of our wilderness cohabitants, a responsibility your proposal does not even consider, but most Ontarians do.
ECOTOURISM REPLACING CONSUMPTION ACTIVITIES
Premier Ford, if you wish to have your Party re-elected, and to meet the real needs and wishes of the vast majority of Ontarians, then we appeal to you to show some leadership by stopping the obvious war on wildlife put forward by this out-of-date Ministry, replace this Minister or give him ethical marching orders, and invite ecological tourism to replace he destruction of ou  r wildlife as a matter of course in Ontario.
21st Century Ontarians, and in fact 21st Century world citizens, value and recognize the need for predatory species in our environment, and appreciate all animals for their beauty, uniqueness, sentience, and intelligence.  Those who live with wilderness dwellers could find new and wonderful insights by sharing the beauty of their ecologies with tourists who carry cameras instead of guns.
Most of all, what a tremendously powerful image of Ontarians would come from developing ecological tourism and employment, rather than consumptive tourism and employment which continues to compromise our wilderness and results in terror, suffering and death for so many innocent animals.
This more powerful, ethical image of Ontario will only come if you change the current, scientifically-unsupportable, cruel and ecologically dangerous policies and direction your government is taking on behalf a very small minority.
Listen, please, to the voices of the vast majority of us who, in fact, elected you and your Government, trusting you to be both scientifically and ethically moral.
You could begin this transformation with a clear sign of this more appropriate and democratic direction, as well as in the name of humane ethics, by cancelling the spring bear hunt, and setting your sights on international ecotourism.
Mr. Ford  and MNRF, it is self-evident that a modern province can develop a better tourism plan than inviting non-resident sport hunters, regional and international, to who enjoy killing wildlife, animals who have little hope of escape, onto our mutually owned public lands.  Ontario’s forests, and its wildlife, belongs to all of us, not just to the businesses that profit from violence against wild animals.
Please return our public lands to our wildlife, as they should be, and begin to build Ontario’s reputation as an ethical, humane province, the same as the majority of its people are.
APPENDIX
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF PROPOSAL IF YOU INSIST ON APPROVING IT…
1.	Spring bear hunt should last no more than 30 days, June 1-30 so that females with cubs, and the cubs themselves, will be protected.
2.	  Baiting must stop after June 30th and not begin again until September 1st.  Baiting should be at least 2 km from the nearest residence or residential area and garbage must be cleared after the hunt.
3.	Fall hunt should begin September 15th and end October 30th across the Province.
4.	Females with cubs must be strongly protected during both hunts.  To do so, the Ontario government must hire more people for enforcement, more Conservation Officers.
5.	Reduce human/bear conflicts by managing people, not bears.  Require them to manage their own waste.
6.	Evidence of the accomplishments and milestones of the pilot projects of MNRF and the extended pilot project needs to be released to the public before any decision on this proposal is made.
7.	Baiting should be stopped, as it is unethical.  If it will continue, baiting must end when the season ends and not be allowed to begin again until shortly before the fall season.
8.	More stringent limits must be put in place to protect recreationalists, drivers, property owners, pets, and others from bait piles that attract wildlife.  All bait sites should be registered to ensure compliance.
9.	Information verifying an increase in enforcement capability through funding, infrastructure and boots-on-the-ground hires of conservation officers should be made available to the public.
10.	The MNRF must acknowledge that the spring bear hunt is not about community safety as originally stated in 2014 in light of the evidence that this hunt only increases human/wildlife conflicts and causes untold misery to our youngest bears.  Enforcement of human behavior (e.g., removal of waste, etc.) and education about bear behavior, attractants and feeding will be especially important to protect both our bears and our citizens.
11.	The MNRF appears to be moving backward instead of forward in light of climate change and the ethics of Ontarians.  A report should be prepared and released on the impact of the spring bear hunt on other recreationalists’ safety, freedom to explore and expectations, since bear hunters in the spring make up a very small proportion of people enjoying our wilderness.
12.	A plan should be prepared and released on efforts of the Ontario government to increase availability and awareness (advertising) of non-consumptive ecotourism opportunities in the province alongside the limited spring bear hunt.
13.	The use of dogs or other “tools” to chase, tree and/or otherwise harass bears should be immediately stopped.

45102,/comment/45102,"I do not agree with the Spring bear hunt and believe it should be discontinued. Very few hunters can determine whether a bear is male or female. The regulations forbid killing a female with cubs but many times a mother will forage alone while leaving her cubs in a safe place. It is too much of a risk that a mother will be killed leaving her offspring to starve. The possibilty of this cruelty should definitely mean no spring hunt.

45104,/comment/45104,"I sincerely urge you to end the spring bear hunt.
There is nothing virtuous about taking joy in needlessly killing and innocent animal minding its own business. What a barbaric practice!
Please note: Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators.
Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety. Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbeques, and other attractants.
Bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species.
The government has disclosed a need to reduce black bear hunting in Saugeen-Bruce Peninsula due to population concerns, yet it is simultaneously proposing to allow the hunting and trapping of these bears in that region for one week each spring. This is irresponsible.
Even the economic argument for allowing the hunt is weak. The government has said the economic impact would be neutral or positive, but has provided no evidence to support this claim.

45117,/comment/45117,"I object to the continuation of the spring black bear season beyond 2020 for residents and non-residents in all Wildlife Management Units where there is a fall black bear season. The annual spring season from May 1st to June 15th should end on June 15th, 2020.  The reasons for my objection are as follows:
•	The OMNRF has not released to the Ontario public the OMNRF’s analysis of the 7-year black bear spring season pilot (which started as 2 years in 2014 and was extended another 5-years in 2016).  As a result, the public cannot use the OMNRF’s analysis of the black bear spring season pilot, which directly relates to this proposal, to assess the scientific validity of the current proposal.
•	The OMNRF has not released to the Ontario public the data from the Bear Wise program to show that a regular spring bear season should be implemented.  As a result, the public cannot assess the success of the stated purpose of the pilot project and therefore cannot fully respond to the current proposal.  When OMNR introduced the spring bear hunt pilot in 2014, Minister David Orazietti stressed that the purpose of the 2 year pilot was to “reduce human-bear conflicts and improve public safety.” The MNRF Black Bear Management Framework published February 28, 2019, updated December 10, 2019) indicates that “further considerations for bear management comes from recommendations of the Nuisance Bear Review Committee Report (August 2003) and the Auditor General of Ontario’s 2007 Annual Report (see 2.0 Scope) and that the OMNR also moved forward on recommendations from the Nuisance Bear Review Committee Report by initiating the Bear Wise program to address public safety concerns about human-bear conflicts.”  In addition, under section 7.0 “Key Management strategies and associated tactics”, objective #1 states that “ongoing monitoring and research is critical for informed decision-making, sound policy development and implementing an adaptive management approach.  Research should focus on addressing key knowledge gaps and risk assessment, as well as evaluation of the effects of specific management actions on bear populations on the landscape and on their habitat.”  Why has OMNRF not reported back to the public on the evaluation of the specific management actions of the Bear Wise program in reducing human-bear conflicts and improving public safety?
•	The population growth rate of black bears has been significantly impacted by the spring bear hunt pilot.  The MNRF Black Bear Management Framework indicates under section 4.0 “Guiding Principles”, in principle #4 that “harvest management strategies must recognize that black bears have an inherently low reproductive capacity relative to other harvested large mammals and that, as with other long-lived species, population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, particularly survival of adult females.”   Under section 5.0 “Challenges”, challenge #2 acknowledges that it is difficult to estimate black bear population size and trends.  Given these statements, it is directly relevant that the black bear harvest data from the Ontario Data Catalogue shows that as a result of the black bear spring season pilot (which started as 2 years in 2014 and was extended another 5-years in 2016), the black bear harvest in Ontario increased by 21% between 2014 and 2018 (32,197 bears) compared with the previous 5 years (2009 to 2013) at 26,709 bears.
•	The spring bear hunt pilot project was not justified, nor does the current proposal provide adequate justification for the implementation of a regular spring black bear season.  The Ontario government should not be ignoring the Environmental Commission of Ontario’s (ECO) November 2015 annual report which harshly criticized OMNRF’s 2-year spring bear hunt project.  Included in this report is the Environmental Commissioner’s view that the Ontario government ignored its own research that calls into question the utility and justification of the pilot project and had ignored the existing advice of the committee created to review the nuisance bear issue.
•	A 2010 study by MNR scientists indicated that there was “no evidence that the spring bear hunt {in 1999} caused the perceived increases in the bear population or human-bear conflicts.”  The 2003 report from the independent Ontario Nuisance Bear Committee found that increased nuisance bear activity was not related to the cancellation of the spring bear hunt, but rather the scarcity of natural foods.
If the proposal proceeds, it should be amended to take into account the following factors:
•	The fall black bear hunting season should be reduced if Ontario implements a regular spring black bear season.  The proposal does not  take into account he 1999 expansion of the Ontario black bear hunt (currently 2 ½ to 3 months).
•	The proposal should to prohibit hunting with dogs during the spring bear hunt.  The Nuisance Bear Review Committee recommended that any spring bear hunt should prohibit the use of dogs.
•	The prohibition should include significant penalties for harvesting bear cubs and female bears accompanied by cubs.  The prohibition of the harvest of bear cubs and female bears accompanied by a cub is not adequate to ensure that numerous bear cubs will not be orphaned by the spring bear hunt.  OMNR estimated that at lease 274 bear cubs were orphaned in the 1999 spring bear hunt.  Ontario has chosen not to publish current estimates of orphaned bear cubs and so I cannot quote more current data.  Current data should be released to the public.
I agree with the proposal to reduce the bear hunting and trapping season to one-week from May 1 to May 7 in WMUs 82A, 83 and 84 (and to close the fall season) to support the long-term sustainability of the local black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula, but I do not think it goes far enough.  The MNRF Black Bear Management Framework published February 28, 2019, updated December 10, 2019) indicates under under 5.0 Challenges that “the black bear’s inherently slow rate of recovery from low population levels increases the risks for local populations where harvest pressure and other mortality are high.”  For this reason, I think that the one-week season from May 1 to May 7 should also not be implemented.

45128,/comment/45128,"I think the idea of making the spring bear hunt permanent, is absolutely abhorrent.  Bear cubs who are still highly dependent on their mothers at that point, stand to be orphaned if their mothers are killed when they leave their cubs behind to go foraging.  Females being mistaken for males is not as rare as some would like to say it is.  Hunters can't know with certainty the gender of the bear they've killed until they've killed it, and once it's done, it's done; there's no, ""Oops, I take it back,"" at that point.  These are sentient beings with strong bonds between mother and young, and for a long time.  It's not about how many bears there are in the province, it's about the fact that this is absolutely inhumane.  There is no enforcement or accountability regarding killing females who have young, unless the hunter involved decides to turn themselves in and, even then, it does nothing to change the fact that there are now orphans left without a parent to teach them how to live.  I am filled with disgust that anyone thinks that the spring hunt should exist at all, let alone be made permanent!

There certainly aren't too many bears and, in some parts of the province like the Bruce Peninsula, there are declining numbers. In the case of bears on the Bruce Peninsula their genetically isolated population is already at risk.
Spring bear hunts also result in mothers with dependent cubs being killed leaving the orphaned cubs to die. Cancelling the Spring Bear Hunt in 1999 was the correct and ethical thing to do then and it is the right thing to do now.

45131,/comment/45131,"Hi
The spring bear hunt should really not be reinstated.  In a time of climate fluctuation and environmental degradation, our goal should be to preserve not to eliminate essential components of the delicate ecosystems we have already rocked out of balance.  In addition, bear baiting is not real hunting.  Putting a garbage can out in a forest conditions bears to continue to seek out human food sources and raid garbage cans.  This puts bears in danger of being killed via interactions with humans.
In addition, during the spring bear hunts, it is almost impossible to distinguish between male and female bears.  Nursing bears are at great risk of being killed and while there is a penalty, it is practically impossible to enforce.  Cubs will starve and die without a mother.  If the top predators of an ecosystem are wiped out by our irresponsible hunting practices, we have sabotaged ourselves and our children.
Please choose to protect our future,
Thank you,

45133,/comment/45133,"I concerned and strongly opposed to the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt in Ontario. The reasons why we should not allow the hunt are:
1.	Bear cubs will continue to be orphaned if the hunt becomes permanent. While it’s currently against the law to kill cubs and mother bears accompanied by cubs, mother bears often leave their cubs in trees when searching for food. If a mother is killed, her cubs will likely die slowly of starvation or be eaten by predators. It is so unethical and ignorant to ignore the relationship between mother bears and cubs!
2.	Stopping human-bear conflict is achieved by removing access to garbage, barbecues, and other attractants. Hunting bears doesn’t improve human safety.
3.	Bears have low reproduction rates, meaning the survival of adult females is vital for the species. Hunters cannot tell the difference between a male and a female when they are in the bush.

Obviously this is in the stakeholders’ interest (hunters, outfitters, tourism industry, camp owners) as they focus on maximizing their hunting opportunities and revenue year-round.
As usual, the arguments are wrapped in assuring, feel-good vocabulary like small businesses and jobs, sustainable resources, harvest, outdoor recreation, wildlife management, sport, etc.
Did anyone also ask the bears about their point of view? They probably would use different words.
I am not a misinformed animal rights activist. For several other reasons - other than hunting - I am a supporter of the Ontario PC Party.
I am a mature pre-school educator. Instead of continuing to tell the children cuddly stories about mama bears and their cubs, I seriously consider telling them the chilling truth next time. (I assume the original Winnie-the-Pooh, an orphaned Ontario bear cub, also resulted from a spring bear hunt.)
The regulation to protect females with cubs looks good on paper but is difficult to implement in the field.

MY RESPONSE TO EBO POSTING # 019-1112
>>With regard to the Proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season.
I think it’s a long overdue decision that will help the local tourist economy, bear outfitters as well as the general public that have been plagued by nuisance bears the past two and a half decades. I’m all for it. Thank you.
>>With regard to the Proposal to address Bruce Peninsula black bear population concerns.
  What I have heard was there was next to no public information put forth on this subject in their area.
 My recommendation for this part of the EBO 019-1112 would be put it on hold and have some local open houses and then consider it in another EBO along with other changes regarding bears.
 >>With regard to the Proposal to Updates to black bear regulations to improve fairness.
1.	  With regard to Non-Resident property owners not being allowed to hunt without the services of an Outfitter.
  Why on earth would you restrict Non-Resident Ontario Property owners? The property taxes they pay is the same rates as Ontario property owners. They also have higher transfer taxes then residents.
 Ontario taxes are high with mill rates in Northern Ontario of 0.17 and up as high as 2.18 in some jurisdictions. Its only the property owner that can get a form 33 from the MNRF to hunt in that specific WMU not all his friends or relatives.
 As near as I can come up with an amount of non-residents that make use of this is under 100 in the entire province of Ontario. That’s not a very significant amount to harm the bear population.
 What is the plan to give less than 100 forms 33’s to over 2000 Licensed BMA holders? That’s less than 0.05 form each! Not near enough of a significant plus to offset the negative impact of Property Owners rites and privileges.
 Give the non-resident property owners a fair shake for their tax dollars and don’t delete this insignificant item. Thanks
2.	With regard to individuals or businesses having to have a “License to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services” to provide guiding services to residents within a Bear Management Area.
I think it’s a long overdue change that will increase the fairness for all concerned. It will resolve conflict between Licensed BMA holders and unlicensed folks that probably don’t even pay any income taxes on their business ventures. This is a win win situation for everyone. Thank you.
>>There is another Major Concern I have as a Licensed BMA holder and that is the re-allocation of Vacant and Dormant BMA’s.
 The MNRF has not made any available in the Sudbury/Espanola District for over 15 years. My friends and partners have tried numerous times to get additional area where the BMA’s have become inactive to increase my hunting area as well as help alleviate the Local Nuisance Bear problem to no avail. Then it was said there is a moratorium until the pilot spring hunt is ended. Now is the time to do something about it. Perhaps the old application system should be revised some what and I would be glad to provide input into that phase of it.
  These dormant properties are hindering established BMA holders from expanding as well as losing the tax payers of this Province income that could be well used by the MNRF with its limited funds. This needs to be addressed forthwith.
 >>One other Major Concern I have is the method of issuing of Form 33’s. over the life and History of the BMA creation there was no limit on the amount of form 33 allocation until the Province wide spring bear pilot project. There was one exception and that was in the Chapleau District and it worked well. Where rather than restricting the form 33’s they restricted the number of bears harvested. A very sensible solution. Follow ups in 2016 with telephone chats with the folks in Chapleau MNRF on this matter and they said their system worked well from both an enforcement and a sustainable harvest view.
If you remember when the Spring hunt was canceled in January of 1999 the Outfitters (BMA holders) were given a token compensation based on the number of form 33’s they had used in 1998. This seems to have carried over to 2016 when the form 33’s given to BMA holders were an average of what they had used the previous 3 years with no regard to earlier years at all. This was a band aid that did not and does not work well.
 This whole process needs to be rethought and some serious effort be given to make the rite decisions. One important factor that has never been used is the experience of long time bear outfitters that goes way back to before the introduction of BMA’s and that is the knowledge that these folks can share.
 There are many outfitters with experience that predates the 1999 Spring hunt cancellation that would be willing to share.
 You are seriously hindering the tourism industry by limiting the form 33’s rather than limiting the harvest ratio. I figure if you have say 20 form 33’s then you can harvest 20 bears. If your normal success rate it about 30% then why would you not be allowed 60 form 33’s of if you did the calculation it would be 66.66 forms or 67. Chapleau sure had the rite idea and it worked well so the wheel does not entirely have to be reinvented.
 Thank you very much.

45168,/comment/45168,"Greetings,
I hold a degree in natural resource management, was a former environmental consultant in the private sector, and I’m currently a tourist camp owner/operator and non-resident landowner in Northwest Ontario (WMU 5). I recognize the need for sustainable management based on scientific data to determine harvest rates while considering population density and habitat carrying capacity within a territory. I understand the need to decrease or increase harvest rates at any given time if the data suggests and I appreciate initiatives such as the barbed wire surveys as an attempt to reach an objective approach to determine best management practices for a sustainable and healthy black bear population. Sustainable management of the black bear population is eminent. Regulation of fish and game harvest rates are crucial. However, in many instances when attempting to regulate fish and game harvest across vast, varying landscapes such as Ontario, too often rules are passed with too broad of a brush stroke across the entire Province, which negatively impacts hunters and tourist camp operators in areas over-run with black bears. Unless the rule will open the door to more BMA transfers and an increase of allotted tags to our tourist camp, the proposed rule to eliminate the non-resident landowner tag opportunity will have a negative effect to our tourist camp operation.
My wife and I (with 3 toddlers) spent our savings to purchase our camp and moved from Texas to continue the operation as a fishing and hunting lodge along the Sioux Highway between Dryden and Sioux Lookout. We purchased the camp based on historical and projected revenue generated from lodging, boat rentals, black bear hunting, and moose hunting. We did not enter the business for financial gain, but rather to make a modest living while sharing our passion for the outdoors, our hunting/fishing heritage, and advocating good stewardship of the natural resources on the landscape. The historical and anticipated revenue generated from bear hunts is vital and a substantial component to the sustainability of the business. After purchasing the camp and submitting the application to transfer the BMA from the prior owners, we were notified by MNR that a determination had been made to halt all BMA transfers in select units (WMU 5 being on the list). This information was not published or communicated to camp owners prior to the decision being made. In some instances, this information was intentionally withheld from camp owners that were marketing their camps for sale with an associated BMA. In an acquisition such as ours, that information can be the difference between a successful business and bankrupt business. Beyond my own personal interests, these bear hunts provide an economic benefit to Ontario and local communities of Fort Francis, Dryden, and Sioux Lookout as our guests spend money in those towns to fulfill their hunting trips. These bear hunts also assist in the reduction of predation on struggling cervid populations.
Our camp has held a BMA across multiple owners for over 30 years. This relatively small BMA has historically produced an annual harvest of 10-20 bears without showing any sign of depletion throughout those years. When the previous owner began to reduce his operations due to poor health and upcoming retirement, the MNR reduced his allotted tags to 4, based on his previous 3-year average of bears harvested (12-0-0). This reduction in tags was not due to a declining bear population, but simply due to his inability to provide hunting services at that time. It is also evident that our accelerating bear population is having a direct impact on the struggling moose population, which we would like to see bounce back. Now, as a new owner of the camp trying to scratch out a living, we are struggling to get approval for the BMA transfer to receive the minimal amount of tags to manage a robust bear population that we have in the area. Since August 2019, the MNR Dryden Office has failed to respond to my inquiries and provide any data to suggest the local bear population is in decline, or any piece of legislation or statute that would justify and legitimize the halt of BMA transfers in WMU 5. Trying to find an alternative solution to receive the bear tags granted to the prior owner who still holds the BMA, we have provided the MNR with legal documentation, signed and notarized by the current BMA holder and myself, that grants me authority to act on behalf of the prior owner to pay the associated BMA fee and fulfill the validation certificates. The MNR Dryden office has held my check payment for the BMA fee for over 2 months and has yet to issue a reply to my inquiries dating back to August 2019.
I presume many tourist camp operators would favor the elimination of non-resident landowner tag opportunities, presuming that would direct more business into the hands of camp owners. However, as a tourist camp owner and non-resident landowner, I am opposed to the proposed rule-change to eliminate the tag opportunity for non-resident landowners. Currently, a non-resident landowner tag is the only means I have to manage a robust bear population around my camp. We have historically had a thriving bear population over the past 30 years, even with a consistent harvest of 10-20 bears annually within the 50 square km BMA around the camp. Since the harvest rate has been zero over the past several years, we are experiencing an unusually high rate of human-bear conflict around the camp and noticeably less moose and deer sightings in the BMA. I recognize the need to regulate harvest rates to maintain a sustainable population, while still maximizing the benefit of the resource. If the local bear population were indeed in decline, I would be on the front line sounding the horn. However, in our particular BMA, and surrounding BMAs, there are no signs or suggestions of a depleted bear population. Neighbors, nearby outfitters, and conservation officers have all suggested a robust bear population in the area, and they see no need to reduce the harvest of bears in our area. It is very common to see bears along the highway, shorelines, and in our camp.
Based on personal sightings of a variety of bears around our camp, several instances of personal property destruction, and receiving frequent feedback from guests and neighbors regarding human-bear conflict, there is no doubt that we have a bear population in our area that needs managed with additional harvest. I oppose the proposed rule to eliminate the non-resident landowner tag and forcing the non-resident landowners into the hands of the tourist camp operators. I am in favor of maintaining the current non-resident landowner tag opportunity as well as allowing BMA transfers on a case by case basis in areas where it is evident that a thriving bear population can outpace historically high harvest rates due to the high carrying capacity of the landscape. Continuing to allow the management of black bears through both programs such as the non-resident landowner tag, and tag allotments to tourist camp outfitters provides a valuable ecological and economic benefit throughout all of Ontario.

1. It results in orphaned cubs. Female bears get shot as hunters do not identify them properly and kill them in error. I don't feel bear cubs should be collateral damage. Despite the threat of large fines, regulations prohibiting harvesting of females accompanied by cubs are unenforceable, as they were up to 1999 when the original spring season was cancelled.
2. Female bears could be identified if the bait was hung at a height. But it isn't. When the bait is hung at a height the hunter can identify it as a female and not shoot. Please see attached paper. Also, how are fines going to be enforced? Is the hunter who has just killed a female going to self-report? It will not work as a deterrent.
3. There is already a fall bear hunt. We do not need to have two times of the year to hunt bears. It is overkill. Research has shown that hunters do not tend to hunt twice a year. They hunt in the spring or the fall. Therefore, having a hunt at two times of the year is not necessary.

And, please note that even though the previous government callously expanded the Spring Bear Hunt pilot project, they still lost power.
Most Ontarians do not hunt, nor do they support sport hunting. Most Ontarians want our public lands to be free of violence.
I urge Ontario Progressive Conservative Party legislators to follow the example provided by former Premier Mike Harris and Minister John Snobelen, when they courageously resisted pressure from hunting lobbyists, a group that does not represent the majority of Ontarians.
A modern province can develop a better tourism plan than inviting non-resident sport hunters who enjoy killing wildlife, animals who have little hope of escape, onto our mutually owned public lands. Ontario’s forests belong to all of us, not just to the businesses that profit from violence against wild animals.

45204,/comment/45204,"The spring bear hunt will put black bear cubs in danger of being orphaned.  There is no way for a hunter to know if the bear he is hunting is male or female.  The mother bears do not take their Cubs along when foraging for food.  It is far too early in the season for a bear hunt.
To introduce such a bear hunt is short sighted and turning a blind eye to the global wildlife crisis.  So many species are at risk of extinction or quickly becoming extinct.  We are at a time on the planet's history where this type of hunting can no longer be justified - not for any reason.  Sighting a healthy bear population as an excuse to hunt is not a valid reason to kill bears in the spring.  Truly devestating for the bears, Ontario and the planet.

45205,/comment/45205,"No bear hunt. Hunters are stupid and can’t even tell the difference between a human and a bear let alone a male and female bear. Ontario doesn’t have to stoop so low to let hunters murder our wildlife. We are better than that. Ontario is not open for murder/ cruelty business. What kind of government reverses laws that protect our natural beauty??!! Omg! So stupid. Don’t allow bear hunting.

45207,/comment/45207,"I am very much opposed to any kind of Spring black bear hunt.  I've read the proposal and the news articles outlining the 'pros' of having such a hunt and they are just not compelling.  It is predominantly the anglers and game hunters associations pushing misinformation about the 'necessity' of such a hunt, and severely downplaying both the severity of the negative consequences as well as their likelihood.  In addition, the money brought in by hunting cannot seriously be taken as a consideration when it flies in the face of these negative consequences.
The reality is that there is no need for a Spring black bear hunt.  Listening to unbiased wildlife biologists, rather than biased pro-hunting lobby groups, makes that abundantly clear.  Bottom line - it is unconscionable and indefensible to prey on any species during breeding season.  The risks are too high - and are undeniably cruel.  I understand that there are written regulations to guard against hunters shooting nursing females and cubs, but that's a weak 'protection' at best.  Hunters will profess that they can determine if a female bear is nursing her young, but the reality is that it is extraordinarily difficult to accurately determine nursing status of free-ranging black bears. The overwhelming conclusion drawn by wildlife officials in the field is that the regulation looks good on paper but is spectacularly difficult to implement in the field.
Ultimately, this hunt invariably leaves dependent cubs orphaned - it's inevitable.  Given the difficulty of making solid determinations of which bears are definitively nursing mothers by hunters, it makes no sense to have a Spring black bear hunt in Ontario.  I come from a long line of hunters and this is abhorrent to all of us.  No ethical hunter is pushing for this.  The comments and propaganda I see in social media and in the news pushing for these regulations are from those who want the hunt simply because they enjoy it or stand to make money from it.  Decisions about the wildlife in this province (and the structure of hunting laws) should be informed by scientists and unbiased wildlife biologists, not only by those that stand to gain from changes to the laws.

45208,/comment/45208,"I am an Ontario resident strongly opposed to the reintroduction of the spring bear hunt.  Studies have demonstrated that, despite the skill and best intentions of most hunters, it is practically very difficult to distinguish nursing black bear females from males or non-nursing females.  Reintroduction of the spring bear hunt will inevitably result in the inadvertent killing of mother bears and the orphaning of their young to starve to death.  This is cruel on an individual level and harmful to the bear population on a larger level. Many wildlife species in Ontario, including bears, are already facing increasing pressures from climate change and habitat loss.  Reversing the cancellation of the spring bear hunt feels like a big step backward.

45211,/comment/45211,"I am totally against the spring bear hunt.  There is no scientific evidence to support it.  Hunters themselves admit they cannot distinguish between male and female bears when hunting.  This causes orphaned cubs and subsequent imbalance in the natural environment that works quite well on its own without human abuse.  Bear meat is not the chosen food of hunters.  There is no valid reason to allow this hunt.

45212,/comment/45212,"To hunt down a mother bear and leave the orphaned cubs to starve to death is the utmost in cruelty.
Studies have shown that hunters cannot definitely tell whether the bear is a nursing mother or not, which makes sense in the heat of the moment, so that reasoning is useless.
Its bad enough that our wild animals are dying due to loss of more and more habitat each day.
Please do NOT re-instate the bear hunt in Ontario.
As if things weren't bad enough, you will also be seen as a bunch of barbarians.
Why not do something good for the environment for a change and get the people on your side?
Such as planting more trees, or putting in legislation to protect our migrating birds from window collisions? Or having pesticide free zones for birds, bees and butterflies? This is what people want to see more of - not more destruction.

45214,/comment/45214,"Thank you for reading my comments.
At this time, the size of the genetically isolated, and potentially genetically unique, black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula (“The Bruce”) is not reliably known. This is an important quantity of which to be aware at it must represent the basis for population management decisions. For this reason alone, black bear hunting on the Bruce should be suspended until population numbers are reliably known. One should look even more deeply, however.
On the unhunted Chapleau Crown Game Preserve, the black bear population is on the order of 40/100 km**2; this is a reasonable estimate for a “natural” population density. Therefore, on the Bruce, for a minimum safety margin, this means population densities should not be allowed to fall below 20/100 km**2.
Moreover, for a small population, it is desirable to have no fewer than 50 individuals, with four times that, 200, being preferred. A population of 50 individuals of a species which does not begin to reproduce until about age five may not contain many breeding individuals, so an ideal population would contain much closer to 200 individuals.
Considering that the population of bears on the Bruce is unknown but certainly small, and considering that a spring hunt allows for the possibility, if even only by accident, of killing a sow while orphaning her cubs, all hunting of bears on the Bruce should be suspended, but perhaps especially spring hunting.
Should the resumption of a hunt be considered, this cannot be allowed to occur before the population of bears is clearly established, and that it well-exceeds 200 individuals. Further, in order to capture and maintain any unique genetic traits of these animals, a priority must be to establish population connectivity to populations further south and east of the Bruce.
In general, at this time, black bear hunting on the Bruce should be suspended so that recovery of the population, accompanied by quantifiable sustainability, can occur. There exists no reason to risk imperiling this unique population.

I personally do not approve of any change in the guide requirement for landowners. How do you think the property owners feel that live close to the provincial border? What about those whose property is adjacent to the border? I’d they step over the line they’ll instantly need a guide to continue to hunt?

45224,/comment/45224,"I find this proposal to be deeply disturbing. Rather than taking an opportunity to become a leader in wildlife conservation, you are choosing to revert back to archaic and barbaric practices. Ontario's forests belong to all of us, including the animals who inhabit them, and are not for the sole use of violent people who enjoy killing beings who have little chance of escape. Let the forests belong to the majority of Canadians who do not kill, who abhor killing, and who want some places of peace left for us to enjoy. We have no right to exploit these animals in this manner, and especially given the provincial government's recent improvement in animal welfare legislation it is ironic that you are saying some animals are worth saving but these wild ones are up to be hunted? I understand it is a fine balance to making all parties as happy as possible, but this is not an acceptable compromise, not for the people who want to leave nature as untouched as possible and especially not for the animals who will be mercilessly killed. On a further note, given the difficulty of experts in determining the nursing status of black bears it is simply unfathomable to me that you are trusting hunters who by and large have little to no regard for animal life to do so. You have an opportunity here to do the just and moral thing. Please deeply consider here the effects this will have on all of these animals, and if that is not enough then please consider that history will not look kindly upon you for not protecting those with no voice.

45227,/comment/45227,"As a citizen of Ontario, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to reinstate the spring bear hunt in Ontario. There is no compelling justification or need for such a hunt, and it is likely to lead to the inadvertent killing of nursing females and, thereafter, to the deaths of orphaned cubs who cannot survive on their own.
Despite hunters' good intentions to follow regulations that prohibit killing females with cubs, it is well documented that it is extremely difficult, even for biologists, to identify nursing female black bears. How, then, can hunters and their guides be expected or relied upon to follow the regulations? I am not a hunter, but my father was, and I know that the last thing he ever would have wanted to do is to kill a mother bear with cubs. Most hunters would be appalled at the prospect of being the perpetrator of such a tragedy, and yet a spring bear hunt makes this tragedy almost inevitable. Please do not reinstate the spring bear hunt. It is in no one's interest except for hunting guides and outfitters who have already shown that they do not need a spring bear hunt to remain in business.

45230,/comment/45230,"I would like to comment on the proposed changes to the black bear hunting regulations.
Specifically, I am against the proposal to implement a regular spring black bear season. I do not think this proposal will reduce human-bear conflicts.
I am disappointed that the Ontario Government hasn't released any studies citing this change will reduce human-bear conflicts, despite the fact that in 2014 a pilot study was started to assess this very question.  Surely the results of this study would be relevant to these proposed changes.
Many participants of bear hunting are non-residents who hunt by baiting bears, and are often unable to distinguish between males and females. Nursing mothers have been and will continue to be killed, leaving orphaned cubs behind.  Without parental support these orphaned cubs then have the potential to engage with humans.  Additionally baiting bears conditions bears to human garbage and scent thereby reducing their natural fear of humans.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read my concerns.

Bears are integral to the health and well being of a landscape and far more tourist visit Ontario and Canada hoping to see bears in their natural habitat then those who hunt and kill bears.  Supporting the Spring Bear hunt will only provide short term funding compare the to many tourist who visit in the hopes of a sighting of the rich wildlife that Canada supports.
Canada is a progressive country and we have an opportunity to lead the way in highlighting how much we value our wildlife and nature to a world that has lost so much of its wildlife.

45239,/comment/45239,"The reinstatement of a black bear hunt in Ontario is a cruel and unnecessary proposal.
Hunting black bears in Ontario, is environmentally wrong, dangerous, and cruel.
Spring is when black bears awaken from hibernation. Often times mother bears have newborn cubs during this time.  The hunting if black bears will inevitably cause mothers to be killed, orphaning the cubs.  It is not easy to identify whether a bear is a male of female, so hunters will end up indiscriminately killing any bears.
When you kill a sow, her cubs are left alone, while still nursing. They will either be killed themselves, or starve to death. When a sow is approached, she will be aggressive, and will stop at nothing to protect her cubs. This also places physical danger and risk to humans in near proximity- including hunters.   Hunters will be endangering themselves.
Many municipal areas in Ontario are working towards preventing bear encounters with humans by putting up fencing and other preventative measures. The killing of black bears is unnecessary as the issue of black bear encounters in areas of human development is already being resolved in much more humane ways. .
Please make the only responsible decision in this matter by refusing to reinstate the hunting of black bears in Ontario.
Respectfully
J Kaisse
