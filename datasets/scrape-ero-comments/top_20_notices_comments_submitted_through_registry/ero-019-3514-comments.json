        "comment":"On page 10 you note \"Ontario supports implementation of sustainable forest\nmanagement practices on private woodlots through initiatives like the Managed\nForest Tax Incentive Program.\"\nThis isn't entirely accurate, and is definitely incomplete. The MFTIP program provides for Good Forestry Practices as defined by the Forestry Act, but does not necessarily provide for any direct forest management unless the author of the plan is an RPF. There is a big difference between those plans produced by an author who is an RPF and one who is not. Namely, RPF-authored plans may be prescriptive, whereas plans produced by a non-RPF author may only be descriptive of the forest resources encountered. Hence, these are Good Forestry Practices, but are not necessarily forest management as within the context of timber products such as biomass.\nFurther, this reference is incomplete as it does not speak to the role of RPFs in Ontario in ensuring the public good through sustainable forestry. Ontario does indeed support the implementation of sustainable forest management practices through the Ontario Professional Foresters Act, which sets out exactly this charge to the registered professionals governed by this legislation. This most definitely is something that should be referenced within a Biomass Action Plan for which Registered Professional Foresters will play a critical role in implementing and ensuring sustainability and serving the public good.\nI encourage you to rethink the wording of this section as well as the omission noted here.\n",

My peeve is the waste left behind that are not desirable or profitable species to harvest for whomever is cutting these bush limits. Every year after the first snowfall 1000's of cords of wood are burned in slash piles, I am 100% certain this material could be utilized better and made into something that creates jobs and profit for an investor. Several  years back a couple local entrepreneurs wanted to start a pellet processing facility but where denied access to this waste material because there was no monetary gain for the private company that was controlling these public lands to allow it. Their preference is the burn it, and get it out of sight, out of mind, out of the market stream. My point is that it is disgraceful, that any company can't be overridden by our government on lands that are in its care for all peoples of this province and told that what they leave behind can be re-directed to another enterprise.\n",

The idea for a bioheat strategy and to look at biomass to reduce diesel dependence in the North is are also great - I would suggest a strong focus on the build-out of district heating infrastructure within both of these initiatives. While the infrastructure investment is significant, it enables larger scale use of biomass and allows for integration of other heat sources, or an easy switch to a different fuel as things change in the future (see video linked).  There is a lot of federal money being invested in infrastructure, and an infrastructure assessment happening, the more that can be done to get attention on district energy infrastructure, the better! District energy is also necessary for large scale deployment of bioenergy at the community level - biomass CHP is much more efficient when heat is used in a district energy system.\nAlso, how might the strategy help new companies, or communities, to access more biomass and capital funding?\n",

Meanwhile, our region is anticipating increased electrical demand, as electric cars and expanded mining infrastructure, coupled with electrification of the North under the Watay project and others, all come on line.  This against a backdrop of record setting forest products prices, with trees being harvested as rapidly as ever but with the bark, tops and culls formerly destined for these facilities being left piled in the cutovers.  Draft Plan Action 2.1: is to \u201cEnsure that existing facilities that consume biomass for electricity generation are provided ongoing access to the provincial market at fair compensation for the value they provide to Ontario\u2019s electricity system. This includes recognizing and, where possible, removing barriers that prevent biomass facilities from optimizing their assets.\u201d  I would respectfully submit that dismantling and smelting any existing generation plants would represent a significant barrier to their optimization.

        "comment":"Several years ago the MNRF authorized the use of Bio Fuel for the St. Mary's Paper Mill in Sault Ste. Marie Ontario (Algoma District)  and as such a Logger was selected to harvest the Bio Fuel which he did to great effect.   Huge swaths of forest were cut and piled along side of logging roads and then mulched prior to bringing the mixture to the St. Mary's Paper Mill for burning.    It was a great process because dead trees and left over slash from previous logging operations were taken as well and used in this process, which in my opinion nicely cleaned up the forest.   As well, left over mulch could be allowed to remain in place to be absorbed by the environment.\nThe problem that happened early on was that the Paper Mill went bankrupt and as a result large amounts of trees or Bio Fuel were left behind stacked in huge long piles about 10ft in height that went on for kilometer upon kilometer.   It was an environmental shame and an eye sore that still exists and is still visible to this day.   After the plants closure the Logger had no choice but to walk away from any clean up and as such these piles and piles of dead trees are still there and un-used, presenting not only an environment issue but an extreme fire hazard.  I would have liked to have seen these large amounts of dead trees be mulched so that this huge mass of perfectly good Bio Fuel could have been better absorbed into the environment instead of just sitting there rotting for the past several years or better still be mulched and sent to other regional wood processing plants to be used in their heating or kiln drying processes.   Even though, in this instance, the Provincial government has changed, the Bio Fuel environmental issue that I speak of still exists today simply because I believe  that the MNRF's policy and plan has not changed nor has it been updated to take into account and address this kind of issue.  From what I know this problem exists throughout the District of Algoma, from the forest North East of Sault Ste. Marie as in the Searchmont area, to as far North as to the Wawa area, where it seems to be much more prevalent.\nIn any new forth coming plan I think that there should be a contingency that would allow excess un-used trees or mulched Bio Fuel be used elsewhere.    At the very least any un-used trees in the process should be mulched into a Bio Mass, put back into the environment, and allowed to be absorbed.    These days I don't think anyone wants to see huge swaths of forest completely clear cut and the trees then piled high for as far as the eye can see and then be allowed to sit un-used to rot for years upon years.  All of this just does not make good business or environmental sense to me and so I would like to see some safe guards put in place and written into any new Forest Management Plan for Bio Fuel that would prevent this type of situation from occurring again sometime in the future.\n**Pictures available upon request\n",

        "comment":"Ontario has lost 10 of the 15 pulp mills operating in the province in 2000. Only 5 remain and several are at risk of closure. This has resulted in a reduction in timber harvest of 50% compared to 2004 levels. The reason for the reduction is that without a market for low-grade wood fibre and pulpwood, sustainable forestry is not possible. The ONLY proven, high efficiency alternative market for this wood fibre is heat. All other products are not commercial (e.g., liquid biofuels), low efficiency (electricity only), or the market is too small to have a meaningful impact on the forestry industry or forest management (e.g., most bioproducts).\nIf Ontario is to see large-scale adoption of bioheat, it MUST enable municipalities to develop district energy systems. This is not limited to rural, northern communities, but must service the core of Ontario's population - the GTA. Stockholm and Copenhagen have 400 and 500 MW combined heat and power plants heating their cities, respectively. Why not Toronto, Mississauga, or Hamilton? In the case of most municipalities, they do not have the staff or funds to complete the required district energy feasibility studies. Capital for infrastructure construction - namely the Green Stream of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program - is available. But to apply for this fund, feasibility studies must be completed.\nI recommend the Province of Ontario establish a fund to support municipalities to complete the required district energy system feasibility studies. The Province can then hold a dedicated district energy system competitive call under the Green Stream of ICIP. This would enable use of local fuels to create local energy and sustainable, economically competitive communities.\n",

Look at an aerial photograph of cultivated land, where forests would slowly take up carbon dioxide and bury it into new biomass and consequently form more soil. This carbon sink is lost with cultivated land. This carbon sink is lost with reducing forests for any reason, whether it be grey development or agricultural land. Why would we allow for loss of forest to generate biomass? The release of carbon captured in this biomass and the instantaneous loss of capacity to capture more carbon by destroying existing sinks would be devastating. Increasing forest biomass harvest amounts at all is a bad plan for reducing green house gas emissions, because it will reduce the ability of forest to capture carbon in the first place. Jobs in forestry can be directed to other sustainable industries such as geothermal heating and cooling in local communities or small scale manufacturing of specialized equipment for this industry.\n",

It's so hard to believe that this is even being considered while we face a climate crisis. It's not hard to see the faults of the forest biomass industry:\n1. Like coal and oil, biomass is a carbon-burning form of energy production that emits carbon dioxide and contributes to the climate crisis. In fact, biomass power plants are California\u2019s dirtiest electricity\nsource\u2014releasing more carbon at the smokestack than coal. Adding to these harms, cutting trees for\nbiomass energy reduces the forest\u2019s ability to sequester and store carbon. All in all, biomass power is a\ndouble whammy for the climate: it emits more carbon at the smokestack and leaves less carbon stored\nin the forest.\n2. Biomass power plants rely heavily on regulatory incentives and subsidies paid for by taxpayers and ratepayers. In a time when we're bouncing back from a pandemic that has hit low-income families the hardest, are you seriously going to use taxpayer's dollars to create subsidies for these biomass power plants?\n3. Forest Biomass Energy ineffective for protecting communities and forests during wildfires. Have you been paying attention to the rest of the world battling wildfires every dry season? Australia, California, and even in Parry Sound a few summers ago? Why make matters worse?\n4. Biomass power plants are also a significant source of air pollutants, harming the vulnerable communities where biomass facilities are located and worsening environmental injustice. When thousands of people are hitting the streets protesting racism, why are you planning to make matters worse? Where are these plants going? I'll bet you're planning to place these in racialized communities because you wouldn't dare to put one in the Muskoka Lakes or anywhere near Toronto's top earners.\nOn close inspection, it\u2019s clear that biomass energy is not the solution \u2013 and would in fact impede\nOntario\u2019s ability to build a truly clean energy economy, all while endangering Ontarians along the\nway.\n",

It absolutely can and will, as long as this industry exists.\nFrom the link I have attached: \"The rapidly growing wood pellet export industry claims it offers a renewable energy fuel source for aging coal plants overseas, yet a new investigation warns the little-known biofuel poses an overlooked threat to forests, endangered species habitat and the climate.\"\nThere are plenty of economic opportunities in clean energy generation.

        "comment":"It is perplexing that we are considering burning wood as a climate solution. The climate crisis is a function of high levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which include carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide is what is released when biomass is burned; when we allow biomass (such as wood) to break down naturally in the environment, that carbon content is stored in the soil for reincorporation into the life cycles of the ecosystem; we should preserve existing woodlands and forests, and focus resources on rewilding additional areas so as to further enhance these natural carbon storage cycles instead of deliberately establishing any sort of policy that would encourage burning biomass and thereby releasing even more carbon into the atmosphere. We are facing an existential threat to our collective survival; this is not the place to be looking for profitable economic opportunities. While the government and industry claim that only waste wood is used to manufacture wood pellets, more whole trees from primary, boreal forests are being logged to meet the demands of the growing biomass pellet industry. The sciene indicates that radical shifts in our earth's climate systems are already underway; we can, however, still mitigate the worst impacts of this unfolding tragedy by abadonning delusional initiatives such as this one.\n",

In this time of a climate crisis, cutting down forests to create \u201cclean\u201d electricity is entirely counter productive, as it will increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and remove a carbon sink.\nObjective 3 - reducing regulatory burden for all sectors which use forest biomass - is particularly disturbing, as it is proposed to reduce government oversight in an industry that is contributing to mass deforestation. We need to be protecting our forests, and governments need to be the ones regulating companies in this regard.\nThe idea that forest pellets are a renewable form of energy is entirely false. It can take generations for forests to regain their carbon capture potential, time that we just do not have. Carbon capture is going to be a huge expense in the future. It will be SO much cheaper to leave our carbon capturing forests alone, as opposed to building carbon capturing infrastructure later.\nPlease, think of generations of the future. Listen to the science that the wood pellet industry is not the energy source that we need.

You might as well be burning coal. Deforestation is a significant cause of climate warming. We need to PROTECT and EXPAND our forests, not burn them.\nYour government's claim that biomass as a solution to climate change is just another measure to deflect Ontarians' concerns about climate change, and to support and promote the forestry industry at our climate's expense. For a start, nowhere in the proposal are there any plans to prohibit the use of whole trees to produce wood pellets. In effect, your government would give the green light to forestry companies to continue and expand use of whole trees for their pellets.\nFurther evidence of your real motives is the proposal to deregulate those who use it: \u201cstreamline permitting and reduce regulatory burden for all sectors which use forest biomass.\u201d  In other words, indirect subsidies to companies that use wood pellets, again with no regulations on their use. A double win for the forestry industry and a win for the companies that use its products, with no benefit to anyone or anything else as whole trees are destroyed. My bet is that the biomass industry isn't viable using only waste wood. Let's see the evidence on that please.\nCould your government please get serious about climate change by reducing emissions through regulation, and promoting renewables and other alternatives to fossil fuels. Or produce a proposal on wood pellets that protects our existing whole trees. No greenwashing please.\nAlso, how dare you require commenters to post links to support their comments. Ontarians are entitled to comment on government's proposed policies, whether or not they have expertise in that field. It's called democracy. Instead, you deliberately bias the results of this process. I have read quite a few articles over the last decade on the problems with biofuels, including biomass, without recording them.  And now I've had to try and find them all again. HOW DARE YOU.\n",

Increasing deforestation is NOT a climate solution.  Protecting our boreal forests should be a national (even international) priority.\nAt the smokestack, burning wood pellets is much dirtier than coal.  I don't see how an industry that dumps more carbon into the atmosphere than what it's replacing could possibly be conceived as a solution for providing alternative employment for fossil fuel workers.  This is unsustainable and illogical as far as I'm concerned.  Please stop any notion of expanding the biomass industry at all.  Deforestation is not the answer to any industry, including biomass and toilet paper! Cutting down forests seems to be a worldwide 'epidemic'. It takes many, many decades to replace these lost trees, tree planting rates are abysmal and boreal forests are irreplaceable.  The U.S. is an example of the pellet industry gone awry and magnifies Canada's own need to correct the erroneous claims and damage this industry has done to our planet and our lives.\nFederally, I feel for every tree that is cut or lost, at least 2 should be planted in it place, for every industry, everywhere! This doesn't mean that I agree with deforestation or with the biomass industry. The biomass industry should be scaled back.  Dead trees are home to many species of animals, birds, insects and microorganisms. Leaving them in place is a good idea generally.\nThank you.\n",

An expansion of wood-burning would be a mistake for many reasons.\nFirstly, burning wood is dirtier than coal. Since wood is not as energy dense as coal, more wood needs to be burned per energy unit generated resulting in a 40% increase in emissions.\nSecondly, trees take a long time to grow back and capture the same amount of carbon that a decades old tree can. Add to this that much of our old-growth forests have already been logged, and the current logging cycle is so much shorter than it used to be, means that our forests are already less effective carbon sinks than they used to be. The best solution for the climate is to leave the trees in the ground!\nLastly, many more permanent jobs and spin-off industries would be created with more high-tech clean energy technologies like solar, pumped storage, wind, and landfill methane capture.\n",

It was known, but only really dire in the last 60+ years; even that is so sickening to know that and companies continued dishonestly to kill us and the planet.\nLobbyist against protecting the environment and our health are a very nasty part of the problem.

Car companies are pushing more EVs, and committing to help and not ignore.  Food companies are working to move away from single-use plastics and more with the help of governments that are banning those plastics with a due date.\nBut for some messed up reason, oil and gas companies get money thrown at them to continue through subsidies.  Money to expand, to be destructive on land that is not theirs, ignoring the rightful owners.  Indigenous peoples all over the world are treated so badly, so disrespectfully; bullied, attacked and they are peaceful when they protest.  The word reconciliation is thrown around by governments, but it would seem the meaning is lost.\nListen, those of us that want to protect our planet understand that it\u2019s not an overnight thing.  But if oil and gas companies are part of the solution then unfortunately they are going to lose out.  Electric vehicles will solely and surely take over and oil and gas will be left behind and disappear.

Why?\n(1)\tOntario's electricity needs are predominantly meet through nuclear and water power as well as solar and wind with some natural gas-powered plants primarily used for peak power. In the latter case there is now being developed carbon sequestration technologies that eliminate CO2 emissions.\nGreen energy slogans for political purposes only should be eliminated in this policy proposal for that reason. It is bad enough that greenies sometimes propose projects that can and have done enormous ecological damage in the past. This proposal, in its own way contributes to that. For example, the science is in with respect to the enormous ecological damage done by damming large river systems worldwide for green power; and many rivers are now being freed and\/or being considered for reversal.\n              The whole premise of using wood to replace coal is ridiculous. Even in the US private sector\npower generating companies have and are still converting coal burning power plants to natural gas.\n(2)\tEffectively then this project is totally about converting the totality of the Boreal Forest into a tree farm for economic and northern development reasons. In principle I have no quarrel with this but it must be done in an ecologically sustainable manner. In this context this means that Ontario\u2019s Boreal Forest cannot become one giant mono culture tree farm\nThe wood supply will come from Ontario's Boreal Forest area meaning that even more of this area will be subject to industrial style forest practices including herbicide spraying to eliminate any competing biomass; effectively creating a mono-culture (a tree farm rather than a forest). Real forests can be logged sustainably; Algonquin Park is a good example. This should be considered as a management strategy for the whole Boreal Forest but in a way that large tracts and related corridors are left untouched.\nThe bigger environmental threat is not from climate change but from degraded ecosystems in terms of ecological integrity and diversity. In this sense the biggest ecological threat worldwide is industrial scale farming, fishing and forestry which will ultimately lead to large scale extinctions and broad scale ecological collapse.\nThis proposal is solely about maintaining employment opportunities in the north; and I am for that but only in the context of environmentally sustainable ways.\n",

Destroying forests to produce electricity is counter productive.  It not only destroys natural habitat for wildlife but reduces the planets ability to naturally absorb carbon while expelling all that was retained in the trees being burned.  This make work project is unsustainable and not in the best interests of workers, Ontarians as a whole, or the health of our planet.\nPlease prevent further destruction of our forests for the unsustainable use of forestry products.  With the move towards renovating existing buildings and constructing new high efficiency buildings the demand for lumber will increase which will put greater pressure on our forests.

These are some opportunities I see  for improvement.\nBenefit to Silviculture\nThe draft version is missing a major benefit of  biomass use.\nThe Biomass Action Plan must address the benefit to silviculture from being able to remove undesirable species .  The benefit to silviculture is one of the most significant implication of biomass harvest, yet is completely neglected in this draft Strategy.  This is a major aspect of the subject that warrants inclusion in detail, and in the Introduction.\nOn page 8, under 'Improving our environmental stewardship\",  the text about silviculture should be more specific than merely \"promotes healthy and resilient forests\", such as  \"improves silviculture and regeneration of a more natural\/desirable species mix.\"\nBiomass includes 3 types of unused fibre:\n#1 - fibre from trees already cut, i.e. slash\n#2 - fibre from trees left standing in harvested areas\n#3 - fibre from trees in unmerchantable stands\nUse of #1 fibre frees up space for trees to regenerate, and is far cheaper and more effective than piling or burning it.  Slash is an issue on most Forests in Ontario, as they are a waste of land and  of fibre. The Independent Forest Audit on the Hearst Forest 2019 required action to reduce slash piles.\nUse of #2  fibre generates significant savings to silviculture, and a more desirable  stand regenerating.  Instead of a new stand starting with  mature trees of unmarketable species,  the forest manager can decide which species of residuals are desirable, leave the residual trees  required for habitat, and start with a cutover that's more natural, more like what a fire would leave.\nUse of #3 fibre  is only way unmerchantable stands will be restored to a desirable condition.  It's important to keep in mind that without fire, stands which are low stocked or of unmerchantable species cannot be 'managed' .  If a different condition is desired (e.g. for habitat), there is no opportunity to work towards that condition.  But a biomass market can provide the opportunity.\nWhere I am (Hearst District) we are now harvesting areas which were harvested  ~80 years ago.  They are full of balsam fir, larch, and\/or balsam poplar,  unmerchantable species which remained or  grew in after the spruce was harvested.  We also have sites in which the trees that originated with historical fires are now falling and being replaced with young balsam fir and brush.  After we harvest  the merchantable timber,  the remainder  takes up space that otherwise could be regenerating to spruce, pine or aspen.  Mechanical site prep  is expensive and only pushes these unmerchantable trees  into windrows , which is still lost space.  Some sites  are so dense with balsam fir post-harvest  that they are virtually untreatable.  MNRF Fire has examined the prescribed burn potential for some such sites, and found that tramping would be needed to create the structure to carry a fire; however, as  MNRF hasn't  carried out a prescribed burn of such a site in Northern Ontario the past decade,  the risk of no burn happening is too high to invest in.  A biomass market would accomplish what site prep cannot.\nInnovation - p11\n- MNRF should  innovate its business system to separate Larch and Balsam Fir from Spruce\/Jack Pine\/ Scots Pine\/Balsam Fir\/Larch in the Stumpage Matrix, so that  Larch and Balsam Fir can be charged a lesser Renewal Rate (because they regenerate naturally and require no renewal expense).  Currently, the renewal rate for these species is an obstacle to their utilization.  In this part of Northern Ontario, larch is ingressing  into openings such as harvested sites, and balsam fir is growing under upland spruce.\nObjective 1:  Identify Pathways to Markets for Forest Biomass\n- Action 1.7 focuses on ensuring biomass use doesn't damage ecological sustainability.  There needs to be an companion Action to study the benefit to ecological sustainability from the improvement of regeneration.  As with any action, both the downside and upside of biomass use needs to be understood.  The existing perspective ignores half the story.\nObjective 3:  Improve the Business and Regulatory Environments for the Use of Forest Biomass\n -  Biomass needs to be incentivized as are wind and solar, since it is equally renewable.  Biomass use is arguably more environmentally friendly than wind and solar, since the infrastructure for biomass use has lower environmental impact, including on climate change.\n- There needs to be  an economic mechanism to transfer  the savings in regeneration costs to the cost of producing biomass.  Currently, the major obstacle to biomass usage is economic.  The savings to silviculture is immense.  MNRF needs to address  economic transfer mechanisms; e.g. can biomass collection \/harvest be reimbursable from the Renewal Trust Fund.\n- MNRF needs to continue to support  existing facilities that use biomass as a feedstock.  The environmental  benefit of existing facilities needs to be considered when proposals that affect their survival  are made.  Seemingly innocuous changes in a system can have far-reaching  deleterious impacts.  For example, the Atlantic Power co-gen plant in Calstock near Hearst is affected by the changes in electricity transmission routes near Kapuskasing.\n- The Biomass Action Plan should be supported by other Government of Ontario ministries, such as Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Infrastructure. For example, the Government of Ontario announced a program to extend natural gas pipelines to un-served communities, e.g.  on the north shore of Superior.\n\u2022\t\"Ontario is providing $100 million for the new Natural Gas Grant Program, part of the province\u2019s Moving Ontario Forward plan.\"\n\u2022\t\"Natural gas is the dominant heating source in Ontario and continues to be consistently less expensive than alternative sources such as electricity, heating oil and propane.\"\nFirewood and wood  pellets  are omitted from 'alternative sources'  even though some communities are  surrounded by  more biomass than they could ever use!  Was biomass omitted because it's less expensive than natural gas? Or  was it just never thought of, even though  more and more people are heating with pellet furnaces?\nBest End Use\nThe Biomass Action Plan needs to acknowledge, and contribute to,  the best end use being made of trees harvested on Crown land.   MNRF needs to ensure that the use of fibre for biomass promotes best-end use (and assure the public of that),  while allowing incidental inclusion of merchantable stems  that are part of otherwise unmerchantable stands.  Market economics generally ensures best end use, but the public needs  assurance that  trees that are marketable for solid wood products will not entirely be turned into pellets, only the unmarketable parts.   Biomass use should focus  on the parts of trees, or trees, or stands that are otherwise unused.\nMaking it Happen\nSFLs in Northern Ontario have been working with the forest industry to try to move biomass from harvested sites to biomass-using facilities, but currently the economics preclude the utilization of all but a small amount.  The forest industry is doing what it can to move biomass within the current economic  and regulatory environment.  If the government does what it can to improve the economic and regulatory environment,   win-wins  can happen at the site scale right across Northern Ontario, translating into significant benefits for the economy and environment at the provincial scale.\nThe test of this policy's success  will be whether, via economic and regulatory means, and by thoroughly addressing the issues involved,  the policy results in greater biomass utilization.  I hope for a strong Biomass Action Plan, because  those who care for the forest need it to succeed.\nSincerely,\nLauren Quist, RPF\nHearst Forest Management Inc\nHearst, ON\nl_quist@hearstforest.com\n",

Currently, the major obstacle to biomass usage is economic.  The savings to silviculture is immense.  MNRF needs to address  economic transfer mechanisms; e.g. can biomass collection \/harvest be reimbursable from the Renewal Trust Fund.\n- MNRF needs to continue to support  existing facilities that use biomass as a feedstock.  The environmental  benefit of existing facilities needs to be considered when proposals that affect their survival  are made.  Seemingly innocuous changes in a system can have far-reaching  deleterious impacts.  For example, the Atlantic Power co-gen plant in Calstock near Hearst is affected by the changes in electricity transmission routes near Kapuskasing.\n- The Biomass Action Plan should be supported by other Government of Ontario ministries, such as Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Infrastructure. For example, the Government of Ontario announced a program to extend natural gas pipelines to un-served communities, e.g.  on the north shore of Superior.\n\u2022\t\"Ontario is providing $100 million for the new Natural Gas Grant Program, part of the province\u2019s Moving Ontario Forward plan.\"\n\u2022\t\"Natural gas is the dominant heating source in Ontario and continues to be consistently less expensive than alternative sources such as electricity, heating oil and propane.\"\nFirewood and wood  pellets  are omitted from 'alternative sources'  even though some communities are  surrounded by  more biomass than they could ever use!  Was biomass omitted because it's less expensive than natural gas? Or  was it just never thought of, even though  more and more people are heating with pellet furnaces?\nBest End Use\nThe Biomass Action Plan needs to acknowledge, and contribute to,  the best end use being made of trees harvested on Crown land.   MNRF needs to ensure that the use of fibre for biomass promotes best-end use (and assure the public of that),  while allowing incidental inclusion of merchantable stems  that are part of otherwise unmerchantable stands.  Market economics generally ensures best end use, but the public needs  assurance that  trees that are marketable for solid wood products will not entirely be turned into pellets, only the unmarketable parts.   Biomass use should focus  on the parts of trees, or trees, or stands that are otherwise unused.\nMaking it Happen\nSFLs in Northern Ontario have been working with the forest industry to try to move biomass from harvested sites to biomass-using facilities, but currently the economics preclude the utilization of all but a small amount.  The forest industry is doing what it can to move biomass within the current economic  and regulatory environment.  If the government does what it can to improve the economic and regulatory environment,   win-wins  can happen at the site scale right across Northern Ontario, translating into significant benefits for the economy and environment at the provincial scale.\nThe test of this policy's success  will be whether, via economic and regulatory means, and by thoroughly addressing the issues involved,  the policy results in greater biomass utilization.  I hope for a strong Biomass Action Plan, because  those who care for the forest need it to succeed.\n",

It is a value-driven business employing over 1200 people and the key value for the company is \u201cBuilding a Sustainable Future \u2013 Together\u201d (www.walkerind.com). That means all Walker holdings and investments are scrutinized for Social, Environmental and Economic Sustainability benefits to employees, clients and communities.\nThe Walker Environmental Group is a major operating division of Walker Industries Holdings Inc. The Walker Environmental Group has two business units that would be considered stakeholders in Ontario\u2019s Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan.\n\u2022\tWalker subsidiaries Gro-Bark (Ontario) Ltd. and All Treat Farms Inc. produce soil and mulch products for the Ontario market at more than 15 sites across southern, eastern and northeast ON. They employ over 350 Ontarians in a business that uses forestry biomass and municipal compost as the primary raw materials.\n\u2022\tThe Technical Services unit of Walker Environmental is the major Canadian producer of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) from landfills across the country, and thus a current player in the bio-economy.\nWalker is a proud member of the Ontario Forestry Industry Association (OFIA) and supports the sustainable forestry industry of province. One of the principal strategic 20 year goals of Walker Industries as a company is to be a \u201cNorth American Scale Leader in Recovering Resources\u201d. As such, Walker\u2019s is pleased to have the opportunity provide comments on the Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan (\u201cFBAP\u201d).\n1.\tTHE FBAP IS OFFERING ONLY \u2018POTENTIAL\u2019 LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO A PRESENT AND \u2018ACTUAL\u2019 ISSUE \u2013 ie. THE ONGOING NON-RENEWAL OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (PPAs) FROM BIOMASS\n-\tBiomass PPAs in the Kirkland Lake \u2013 Cochrane \u2013 Hearst region have been cancelled or are pending cancellation and the fruition of new bioenergy and bio-product businesses is still years away, if they happen at all.  In the meantime, wood processing operations in that region have lost their major regional outlets for wood processing residues and low value forestry fiber. This policy direction has failed these communities in social, economic and environmental terms.\n-\tBiomass PPAs in Northwestern Ontario are under threat of non-renewal which poses a clear and present danger to the forestry sector in that part of the province. Presently, there are no alternative markets to utilize the surplus forestry biomass that would result from the disappearance of biomass energy facilities in this region.\n-\tWhy is there no transition period, for a reasonable duration, to allow for the ongoing flow of biomass materials via existing PPAs, until such a time that new bio-economy or other markets?\n2.\tTHE FBAP IS ARTIFICIALLY NARROW IN SCOPE AND IGNORES KEY EXISTING MARKETS FOR ONTARIO\u2019S FOREST BIOMASS \u2013 ESPECIALLY THE LANDSCAPING INDUSTRY\n-\tThe use of bark, wood chips and log ends have been used in the production of soil and mulch products since the 1980s. Currently, soil and mulch producers in Ontario utilize at least 25% of the annual volume of bark produced in the province, and the prices paid for bark by these producers in comparison to power generators means that soil and mulch producers account for approximately 50% of the total dollar purchases of bark generated annually in Ontario.\n-\tWalker\u2019s Resource Recovery division is believed to be the single largest bark purchaser in the province.\n-\tOntarians spend over $4 billion on landscaping service and supplies annually (Statisca 2020).\n-\tThe use of forestry biomass in landscaping materials is a highly beneficial use of carbon in that it decomposes slowly over time, adding much needs organic matter and carbon to soil. Secondly, it potentiates the growth of an \u2018urban canopy\u2019 which is in itself a carbon sink and climate change modifier. Thirdly, processed bark and wood fiber are substitutes for the non-renewable \u2018peat\u2019 materials in soil products and that trend promises to grow the market for processed bark as the carbon impacts of peat harvesting come to public attention.\n-\tThe Statscan report cited in the Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan failed to consider and thus ignored the landscaping sector as a user of forestry biomass (written communications with Statscan).\n-\tThere are other significant users of Ontario forestry biomass that also appear to have been ignored in the preparation of the Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan (eg. particle board, animal bedding).\n-\tA major British producer of bark and wood fiber based soils reports that government intervention in the UK, designed to promote forestry biomass in community heat and power projects, has disrupted their access to bark and wood fiber for horticultural purposes. (www.floraldaily.com\/article\/9301804\/a-perspective-on-peat-free-growing-\u2026)\n-\tHow is the Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan going to ensure that thousands of Landscaping Industry sector jobs, as well as other forestry biomass using sectors, are not adversely effected by interventionist policies to promote a promising but economically unproven \u2018bioeconomy\u2019 sector?\n3.\tTHE FBAP  DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONSIDER THE USE OF \u2018RECYCLED\u2019 WOOD PRODUCT AS A COMPETITIVE FEEDSTOCK FOR BIOENERGY PROJECTS\n-\tNew bioenergy start-ups in Ontario are looking to access recycled wood waste from construction, demolition, landfills and secondary wood processors for feedstock, rather than green forestry biomass. They are attracted by the lower moisture content of recycled wood which is <20% compared to forestry biomass which is >40%.\n-\tStudies of recycled wood generation in Southern Ontario estimate that 800,000 to 1,000,000 MT are generated annually.\n-\tRecycled wood costs start at negative value and are less expensive to transport due to significantly lower moisture content in the material\n-\tTransporting green forestry biomass from Northern Ontario to bioenergy start-ups in Southern Ontario appears to be cost prohibitive given the presence of available alternative recycled wood\nJune 18, 2021\n",

It takes 50-100 years for forests to regrow after being harvested, and to meet the foreseeable needs of this practice, we would not be able to function on mill by-product alone. Harvesting of trees and forests ultimately results in a release of CO2 into the atmosphere, and additionally, loss of valuable carbon sinks. To produce an equivalent amount of energy, these wood pellets would actually produce 1.5x more CO2 emissions than coal would.

        "comment":"(Signed submission attached)\nThe County of Renfrew wishes to voice its support for Ontario\u2019s Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan, as posted Environmental Registry of Ontario Number 019-3514. There are approximately 6,900 people in Renfrew County directly or indirectly employed by the forest sector, a significant number for this area with a total population of just over 100,000 and about 43,000 households. We hope that the Action Plan will result in new biomass projects and economic development, and enhance the existing forest sector in Renfrew County.\nWe offer the following comments for consideration as you develop the final Action Plan.\n-\tForest biomass, in the form of residuals from mills, has long played an important role in Renfrew County\u2019s forest sector. We are fortunate to have existing destinations for bark, chips and sawdust in local successful mulch, MDF and bio-oil manufacturers. However, biomass and residuals can also become a significant cost and environmental issue for operations without a strong market for these by-products.\n-\tForest biomass also includes low-end materials with limited markets in Central Ontario. There is a pulpwood problem in Eastern Ontario, and we hope that the final Action Plan includes solutions to address the issue of utilizing pulpwood roundwood. Destinations for pulpwood are limited, somewhat unpredictable and involve significant trucking costs from Renfrew County. It is important for existing sawmills in Renfrew County, as well as the future forest, to ensure there is a destination for pulpwood roundwood. Areas that are bypassed due to high pulpwood components are hurting sawlog availability, as well as silvicultural goals.\n-\tWe are pleased to see private and other forested lands mentioned (pg.10) as a potential source for forest biomass. However, it should be noted that the Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program does not technically support implementation of forest management but rather encourages landowners to get to know their woodlot. Increased programming by MNRF, similar to Stewardship programs and foresters outside the Area of the Undertaking, would assist in helping landowners embrace forest management on their properties through education and outreach.\n-\tAn action for incentivising new development areas or community service upgrades to consider co-gen community\/district heating would be a welcome addition to Objective 3. This could lead to pilot projects and determination of feasibility in retrofitting small settlement and rural Ontario communities, especially those with mills prominent in the community (e.g. Eganville, Barry\u2019s Bay, Petawawa, Killaloe) to be powered by biomass. District heating satisfies about 60% of the heat demand in Swedish buildings, with about half of the supply to these systems coming from biomass . Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from how this came into place in Sweden.\nOntario\u2019s Draft Forest Biomass Action Plan sets an exciting stage for the future of the forest sector in Ontario. The addition of measurable targets would help measure progress and ensure the objective and actions of the strategy are fully realized. We appreciate MNRF\u2019s efforts in working toward a stronger forest sector and look forward to seeing the Action Plan be finalized implemented.\n",

        "comment":"CHAR technologies Ltd. is pleased to submit the following recommendations to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry: Ontario Forest Biomass Action Plan.\nRecommendations\n1.\tRegulatory Burden Restrictions: Thermochemical conversion, pyrolysis, should not face the same regulatory hurdles as the Wood-Fire Combustor Program. Pyrolysis, by nature, is not a combustion process. There is no oxygen present to initiate a combustion event. Companies implementing thermal processing are required to meet burdensome criteria to demonstrate and ensure proper combustion even though by design combustion doesn\u2019t take place.\n2.\tRegulatory Burden Restrictions: Thermochemical conversion should not have to comply with the Renewable Energy Approval Process (REA). The use of forestry biomass to create renewable gases, such as green hydrogen and renewable natural gas (RNG), may trigger the REA process. REA is designed for large land impact technologies, such as wind power, yet the small footprint of pyrolysis systems might have to go through this process - which is a 5-year undertaking. This poses large challenges to further innovation and advance forestry biomass use with such burdens.\n3.\tStreamline Permitting: Reduce the length of the regulatory process for Non-Combustion Thermal Process. Consider adding forestry biomass processing, non-combustion thermal processes, to the Environmental Activity and Sector Registry (EASR). This would significantly reduce the time requirement to meet the current regulations.\n4.\tForest Bioenergy and Bioproducts: Include \u201cblack-pellets\u201d in the Ontario Bioheat Initiative. Black-pellets, also known as advanced wood pellets, are biocarbons while white pellets are pelletized wood.  Unlike white pellets, black-pellets can be made from woody-biomass, using pyrolysis technology, to create two simultaneous value streams, renewable natural gas (RNG) and biocarbons (\u201cblack-pellets\u201d_ to be used as a substitute for traditional coal.\n5.\tPathways to Markets for Forest Biomass: Develop Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine Carbon Intensity (CI). The development of a proper LCA would allow Ontario companies access to lucrative foreign marketplaces via pipelines from Ontario. This would significantly aid Ontario companies ensure projects are financially viable.\n6.\tPathways to Markets for Forest Biomass: Increased support for the Centre for Research and Innovations in the Bio-economy (CRIBE). CRIBE continues to be a value add to the Bio-economy. Any additional resources that can be provided to CRIBE increase their ability to facilitate innovation.\n7.\tSuggested Graphic Additions:\nPage 4 - Forest Biomass Advantage Chemicals:\n\u2022\tInclude \u201cactivated charcoal\u201d to the Chemicals Examples of Current Uses list.\n\u2022\tInclude \u201cbiocoal and bio-coke\u201d to the Examples of Emerging Uses\nPage 6 - Deployable Technology Pathways for Low Grade Biomass Figure 1:\n\u2022\tPyrolysis Syngas should also point to \u201cPrecommercial Development Stage: Renewable Gas\u201d\nOn behalf of CHAR Technologies, I would like to thank the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry for the opportunity to contribute to the Ontario Forest Biomass Action Plan.

        "comment":"Comments on Draft Biomass Action Plan\n2021-06-17\nThe Mass Timber Institute appreciates that the Ontario Government wishes to encourage the use of biomass in Ontario.  Shifting towards greater representation of renewables in the energy mix, much like shifting towards a greater representation of mass timber in the building materials mix, has the potential to help re-balance the sustainability equation and provide reliable economic opportunities for future generations. However, it is important that wood that could be used for mass timber or other value-added applications are not diverted into the bioheat and biofuel products stream as part of this action plan.\nIt is likely that the barrier to fiber access in Ontario is economical rather than regulatory. Provincially,only one half of the available harvest volume across the managed Crown forest area has been cut in any given year since 2009. The number of mills in the province, and therefore the number of markets for this fiber, has also declined since then. Mass timber and biomass together represent an opportunity to unlock this additional fiber. Innovation in mass timber mill technology and supporting the establishment of small mass timber mills will not only make biomass more economically viable, but it will also provide a major value-added opportunity for the province to participate in the emerging mass timber markets in Canada,the United States, and Internationally.\nThe technology does indeed exist. Lathe and sawmill technology in China, Europe, and elsewhere in Canada clearly demonstrate that some \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 wood (e.g. small diameter, hardwoods) by typical Canadian standards can be used to produce the veneer and sawn lumber building blocks necessary to produce mass timber. This wood can and should be used for mass timber. Using the mill residuals (which have been paid for via stumpage already) as a source of bioheat and bioenergy is much more likely to be economically viable and promote increased efficiency of use.\nAt the Mass Timber Institute, we believe it is important that when a tree is cut, it should be used in the most valuable way possible. For wood that can be used to manufacture mass timber, including small diameter wood and hardwoods without existing markets, we believe that mass timber is the most valuable application. Importantly, we do not support taking any existing wood away from license holders, but rather using combined mass timber and biomass facilities as a value-added strategy for the forest sector and to unlock access to additional fiber.\nHowever, much work remains to be done in this field. A complimentary \u2018mass timber action plan\u2019 may be worth considering in the future.\nAnne Koven PhD, R.P.F. (Hon.)\nDirector, Mass Timber Institute\nUniversity of Toronto\n",

We have been in operation since 2014 focusing on supplying woodchip boilers to rural farmers and businesses across Canada.\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on this plan and would love to be involved as an industry participant wherever possible.\nMy thoughts on how government can assist with the adoption of Biomass as a Green heating solution:\n1.\nModern Biomass Heating is a solution for all of Ontario.\nBiomass is currently being promoted for rural and remote communities with a big focus on remote.\nOur market for biomass is for greenhouses, sawmills, farms, woodworking shops, any businesses, large residences and institutions with access to waste wood.  They do not need to be rural or remote.\nTypically woodchip heat has not been promoted to potential users such as farms and businesses in southern Ontario due to the difficulty in getting quality, uniform fuel however some systems, like Heizomat\u2019s can handle non uniform fuel and we are having great success with these customers showing that woodchip heat and biomass heat can have a big impact by helping this large group move away from fossil fuel heat.\n2.\tPromotion of Biomass to the business and institutional community\nRaising the awareness of the benefits of biomass can be elevated through advertising to the business and institutional community on its benefits:\n\u2022\tCheaper fuel costs\n\u2022\tClean, sustainable energy with LOW emissions\n\u2022\tHelps build local jobs and sustainable communities\n\u2022\tUtilizes waste wood materials that would otherwise go to landfills or be burnt off\n\u2022\tLong lasting (30+) years equipment which means a great investment and less waste\n3.\tEncouraging municipalities all over Ontario to utilize Biomass Heat as one of their local solutions.\n\u2022\tWood as a heating fuel still has an image of burning trees and creating smoke.  Modern technology such as woodchip boilers is very different from this.\n\u2022\tLandfills, landscapers, woodworking businesses, businesses using pallets, construction.  All these businesses produce waste wood.  Redirecting and with minimal processing, this wood can be utilized to produce local, clean heat.  How can we encourage wood recycling facilities that process waste wood into economical heating fuel.\n4.\tBuilding a database of Biomass Heating suppliers.\n\u2022\tCurrently the same players keep coming up in training and speaking engagements.  There is a growing industry and growing number of businesses involved.  Let\u2019s raise the awareness for everyone.\n\u2022\tInclude Fuel suppliers \u2013 woodchip, pellet, alternative biomass, those who do it as a business and those who have waste wood they want to get rid of; Fuel delivery suppliers, Heating equipment suppliers \u2013 furnaces, boilers, stoves etc.; Installer and repair experts including hydronics experts who understand biomass;\n5.\tTax Incentive for investment in Biomass capital investments.\n\u2022\tThese are big investments.  How can we help initial customers get over the leap of investing in something \u2018new\u2019 and less well known.\n\u2022\tIf there are any current incentives out there, they are hard to find.\n                                                               i.

At one time all the pellets where I live were made from sawdust from the small lumber mills in the province I live in. Trees were not cut down for pellets, but for lumber for building.  But issues with the dust and ash from the pellet stove gave me problems with allergies and my lungs.  So, after working and saving money for a couple of years I was able to replace the wood pellet stove with a heat pump for both heat and cooling.  The filters in the equipment helped with my allergies, along with a small hepa filter for my home.  Heat pumps, though expensive up front, are much more efficient when it comes to using electricity.   I saved a lot of money on my oil bills too.  Please consider not reducing biomass to make wood pellets.  There must be mills with sawdust that could be used rather than cutting trees in the very, very, important Boreal Forest.  The Boreal is home to many many bird species and other wildlife and is a huge carbon sink which should really not be reduced any further than it already is.  It is one of the most important areas for reducing green house gases, so should be preserved at all costs.\nThank you for considering my comments, and I also ask that you consider other alternatives.\n",

I am just hearing about it the day before the comments are closed and I am connected in the environmental justice realm. So the average Ontarian has absolutely no clue about this, and they deserve to know. What are Ontario\u2019s initiatives for that?\nAs a Stage 3 cancer survivor at 35 years old, who recently watched her mother die from the long-term effects of environmental poisoning, I am deeply invested in educating people about the long-term effects of possible environmental toxicity.\nI am eagerly awaiting the Environmental Assessment plan for this draft since currently your document states \"The draft Forest Biomass Action Plan is not environmentally significant and is considered a voluntary posting.\"\nThe draft also states that it aims to  \"support holistic, culturally relevant pathways for Indigenous community involvement in forest biomass value chains to support reconciliation between Indigenous communities and the Crown.\"\nI am eager to hear about the holistic ways since my understanding of the document is that the forest, ecosystem and human communities are at risk of unregulated pollution, deforestation and green-washing for an industry to profit. That is not holistic, is it?\nOne of my main concerns is the effects on air quality in the surrounding areas, which would likely be First Nations and Indigenous communities in Ontario.\n\"Some communities living near wood pellet mills have also protested about the fumes that waft over their homes.\" (See first link below)\nSecondly, I would insist that Total and Prior Consent be given by all First Nation, M\u00e9tis and Indigenous nations upon whose land the manufacturing plants would be situated and whose forests are at risk.\nMy next concerns is that the pellet and biomass industry are not sufficiently regulated\n\u201cOne of the most troubling trends in the wood pellet industry is that facilities that should face the most rigorous air permitting standards are actually the least controlled.\u201d  (see 2nd link below)\nThe action plan lists these points as to how biomass will improve environmental stewardship\n\u201cHelps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Creates sustainable, renewable and low-carbon consumer products.\u201d\nBoth of these points are highly debatable and there is a significant amount of research suggesting that biomass is not low-carbon because of the destruction of forests and the burning of wood that releases carbon into the atmosphere and removes trees which reduce carbon. That is mentioned in all of the links I have provided. And when the document refers to the by-product being used, then why in so many other areas where this industry is established, are forests being cut and burned? And how can we be sure that will not happen in Ontario? And furthermore, the \"by-product', dead trees on the forest floor, play a vital role in ecosystems and in the carbon cycle, and that should not be disrupted.\nNext, my concern is that biomass actually creates more pollution and that it has long-term effects on our forests.\n\u201cThe pellets create more pollution at the smokestack than coal, and trees can\u2019t regrow in time to recapture all the emissions biomass energy is spewing.\u201d (See 3rd link below)\nThere are also many accounts of accidents and fires at the biomass plants in other areas of the world; \u201cpellet mills and storage facilities have experienced a rash of fires and explosions, injuring workers and releasing large amounts of uncontrolled air pollution. Because wood pellets are stored in massive and concentrated piles, these fires can burn for days or weeks.\u201d (see 2nd link below) How will that be addressed? How will the other families be consoled? Did I mention that my 38 year old cousin was killed on an industrial site in BC, leaving his wife, two children and mother devastated? A loss that no amount of money can mitigate.\nFinally, the very first sentence in the summary says that one of the aims is  \u201cto create opportunity and prosperity for thousands of Ontario families.\u201d If that is actually true, then would it not be absolutely necessary to inform Ontario families of the possible opportunities and see if they are interested, as well as inform them of the possible long term risks i.e. air pollution, unregulated industry, deforestation, violation of Indigenous rights as part of the action plan?\nCan we hear from men and women and children who have been affected by industry in Ontario? Sure the money is great, but what's the point if you are sick from the job? (Asked the cancer survivor.)\nHow will the Government of Ontario inform families and seek their feedback in this project which would clearly affect the future of our entire province. A comment form that only reaches a fraction of the population is simple not enough.\nThank you for reading this comment, I appreciate that this form is available, as in many other countries it is likely not even an option.\n",

It is a criminal act by Ontario to allow the decimation of the forest for burning pellets and generating electricity. It is an act of suicide. 95% of the Boreal forests of Canada is not wood. It is an intricate web of life that hosts thousands of species. The trees sequester carbon from the atmosphere and release oxygen vital for human existence and all of life on earth. Around the world humans are cutting down the forest like there is no tomorrow and if we keep doing it there will be no more tomorrow. Cutting down the forests to simply turn them into biomas is total stupidity. We might as well start cutting out parts of our lungs to make sandwiches it makes about as much sense. But short term thinking politicians focused on having an economy think oh lets expand our plunder. But I understand that without the forest of this planet humans existence will come to an end. The only single reason human life can exist on this planet is because intact forests do what they do, they clean the air of carbon and the release oxygen and create an environment fit for human life. This is not the time for Ontario to expand its bio mas activities but a time for it to rethink its methods of generating electricity. It is time for Ontario to invest heavily in alternative means of power generation. Wind and water turbines. Water turbines placed in the municipal water system where the water moves 24\/7 would allow every Ontarian to help this effort every time they bathe or do the dishes or wash the car and this electricity is free for the collecting. All it takes is generating the will to use alternatives. Wind turbines placed beside the busiest hiways as used in Turkey so every passing vehicle spins the turbine free power is generated. There are numerous options that just require the political will to place a greater value on the intact forest treasures of the Boreal forest. There are many options. Lets invest in using our common sense instead of taking the easy path that plunders our childrens future and cutting down the forest.\n",

        "comment":"I am deeply concerned with the wood pellet industry rising from harvesting round wood to produce electricity. Wood pellets are marketed as a clean energy alternative. The government and industry claim that only waste wood is used to manufacture wood pellets, but the truth is more whole trees from primary, boreal forests are being logged to meet the demands of this growing industry. Peak Renewables is trying to do the same thing in Fort Nelson, BC. In BC, people are already opening their eyes to this problem.\nIn February 2020, 500 scientists raised their voices to the European Union and the world to stop burning trees and a climate solution. There are numerous scientific articles from reputable sources that argue that burning wood is less efficient than burning coal- it produces more CO2 than coal, specially round wood (as it has more moisture content than wood waste). - see article link attached.\nMany jurisdictions around the world argue that burning wood for Bioenergy is carbon neutral. This argument assumes Forestry residues will decompose if not burned for energy. Studies have argued this assumption fails to include biogenic carbon emissions in the equation and is not a true representation of the carbon emissions of wood pellets. See link study attached\nThe wood pellet industry is increasing deforestation of our forests, while we should be focused on preserving them. The Ontario government argues that the wood pellet industry will provide alternative employment for fossil fuel workers, but these would be jobs in an industry that dumps more carbon into the atmosphere than what it's replacing. We need truly green jobs! Invest in solar, wind, carbon sequestration!! Our planet can\u2019t afford more CO2 in the atmosphere.\n",

        "comment":"Most intelligent people realise that forests provide one of the few ways of helping maintain air quality.  Therefore it is totally counter-productive to chop them down to burn them, thereby releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Also many animals are becoming endangered because their habitat has been encroached upon by human activity, as there are fewer and fewer laws intended to protect them.  All together the attitude of the government is that they want to make as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, for the small percentage of the population that have their fingers in the public pot.  To continue to chop down trees in order to burn them as pellets is not in any way a good solution.  Trees are counted as renewable, which they are but only in the very long term.  Forward looking governments are using solar, and wind, and water as true clean renewable producers of the energy needed.\n",

They claim that the province is a leader in the emerging green economy because of the \u2018clean electricity\u2019 produced from wood pellets, but we know that burning wood pellets is dirtier than coal at the smokestack. The Ontario government is using that as a key point to justify expanding the industry. They are intentionally deceiving the public to generate higher demand and open up new market pathways.\nThe Ontario government is also largely selling the forest biomass industry as a circular economy because they claim that it only uses \u201cmill by-products\u201d aka, waste wood, to manufacture wood pellets. However, many Canadian provinces including Ontario are logging whole trees from primary forests to meet the growing demand for wood pellets. One of the key objectives (objective 3) of this action plan includes, \u201cstreamline permitting and reduce regulatory burden for all sectors which use forest biomass,\u201d which is concerning because that essentially means there would be fewer environmental checkpoints. Ontario has already gutted the Endangered Species Act, which is a key regulatory body.\nThe argument to expand the forest-biomass industry, particularly the wood pellet sector, to provide low-carbon jobs in replacement of fossil fuel jobs isn\u2019t valid. Amidst an ever growing climate crisis, we simply can\u2019t afford to keep chopping down forests to make a fuel that emits immense amounts of carbon dioxide. Moreover, it can take centuries for forests to regain the majority of their carbon storage after being logged. Once again, wood pellets are a false climate solution.\n",

The abuses and deceptions of the forestry industry in BC (please see link to articles below) are mirrored by the industry in all the other provinces as well.  The regulatory agencies of all provinces, and certainly Ontario, should be focused on exposing the lies and ending these destructive practices, not in encouraging further environmental abuse.

        "comment":"I am writing to strongly urge you not to expand the harvesting and use of biomass, especially timber, for  the production of pellet fuels for heat and electricity production.   In the past decades, economists, forestry experts, ecologists, and other scientists have come to understand that using forests for biofuel creates a \"carbon deficit\" leading to greater greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for several decades.  This is simply unacceptable, given that catastrophic climate change will occur if GHG emissions are not cut in half this decade and eliminated entirely in the subsequent decade.\nTo quote a letter sent to the heads of state of the U.S., European Union, Japan, and South Korea, signed by five hundred economists and scientists:\n--------\n\"We urge you not to undermine both climate goals and the world\u2019s biodiversity by shifting from burning fossil fuels to burning trees to generate energy.\n\"For decades, producers of paper and timber products have generated electricity and heat as by- products from their process wastes. This use does not lead to the additional harvest of wood. In recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a \u201ccarbon debt,\u201d which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change. As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas.\n\"The reasons are fundamental. Forests store carbon - approximately half the weight of dry wood is carbon. When wood is harvested and burned, much and often more than half of the live wood in trees harvested is typically lost in harvesting and processing before it can supply energy, adding carbon to the atmosphere without replacing fossil fuels. Burning wood is also carbon-inefficient, so the wood burned for energy emits more carbon up smokestacks than using fossil fuels. Overall, for each kilowatt hour of heat or electricity produced, using wood initially is likely to add two to three times as much carbon to the air as using fossil fuels.\n\"Increases in global warming for the next few decades are dangerous. This warming means more immediate damages through more forest fires, sea level rise and periods of extreme heat in the next decades. It also means more permanent damages due to more rapid melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost, and more packing of heat and acidity into the world\u2019s oceans. These harms will not be undone even if we remove the carbon decades from now.\n\"Government subsidies for burning wood create a double climate problem because this false solution is replacing real carbon reductions. Companies are shifting fossil energy use to wood, which increases warming, as a substitute for shifting to solar and wind, which would truly decrease warming.\n\"... \u201cSustainability standards\u201d for forest or vegetable oil management cannot alter these results. Sustainable management is what allows wood harvest to eventually pay back carbon debts but cannot alter these decades or even centuries of increased warming. Similarly, any increased demand for vegetable oil adds to the global pressure to clear more forests already created by rising food demands.\nMaking countries responsible for emissions from land use changes, although desirable, cannot alone fix laws that treat burning wood as carbon neutral because these national responsibilities do not alter the incentives created by those laws for power plants and factories to burn wood. In the same way, the fact that countries are responsible for emissions from diesel fuel use would not fix a law encouraging trucks to burn more diesel on the flawed theory that diesel is carbon neutral. Both treaties that shape national climate responsibilities and each country\u2019s energy laws that implement them must accurately recognize the climate effects of the activities they encourage.\n\"Your decisions going forward are of great consequences for the world\u2019s forests because if the world supplied just an additional 2% of its energy from wood, it would need to double its commercial wood harvests. There is good evidence that increased bioenergy in Europe has already led to greatly increased forest harvests there. These approaches also create a model that encourages tropical countries to cut more of their forests \u2013 as several countries have pledged to do \u2013 undermining the goals of globally accepted forest agreements.\n\"To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system. Japan needs to stop subsidizing power plants to burn wood. And the United States needs to avoid treating biomass as carbon neutral or low carbon as the new administration crafts climate rules and creates incentives to reduce global warming.\n\"Trees are more valuable alive than dead both for climate and for biodiversity. To meet future net zero emission goals, your governments should work to preserve and restore forests and not to burn them.\"\n--------\nI include links to the original letter and its five hundred signatories, to the report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that stresses the catastrophic consequences of exceeding our remaining carbon dioxide budget, and to the recent IPCC-IPBES joint report on the critical need to protect and expand natural ecosystems and biodiversity.\nGiven the weight of the consequences and the immense body of study on which these reports rest, it is clear that expanding timber extraction for fuel would be a violation of the Province's duty to protect its citizens' Charter rights of life, liberty, and security of the person.\n",

In general, I think that it should be a 10-year action plan to coincide with Sustainable Growth: Ontario\u2019s Forest Sector Strategy (FSS).  I also think that it could be restructured to illustrate how it provides actions to meet FSS objectives and action areas.  FBAP should also prescribe targets for certain actions - so that it provides direct support to Ontario\u2019s Forest Sector Strategy.\nThe FBAP is well written and provides valuable information about the potential for biomass, however, I feel that there are several shortcomings in the proposed actions.  In my opinion, there are some missed opportunities that should be addressed, and measureable targets should be established.  FBAP does provide a good description of Ontario\u2019s forest biomass advantages and its challenges.   FBAP also has valuable insights from the Working Group members about the importance of bioenergy to existing forest product supply chains.\nThe first sentence in the document indicates that the FBAP is a part of \u201cSustainable Growth: Ontario\u2019s Forest Sector Strategy\u201d (FSS).   FBAP is being put in place to secure jobs and encourage sustainability in the forest sector, while supporting economic development through the use of forest biomass.   It goes on to say that Actions identified in the FBAP will help to realize the goals and vision set out in the FSS.  This is admirable; however, neither the FSS nor any of its goals and actions are referenced again in the FBAP.  I believe there should be direct links to uniquely describe how the FSS vision, goals, and objectives are being met by actions identified in FBAP.  FBAP is a key component of the FSS, and as such its actions should be directly linked to FSS objectives.  Putting an action plan in place that leads to using more forest biomass can help address many actions within all four FSS pillars.  Here is my cursory view on how FBAP can help to meet specific FSS action areas, including (but not limited to):\nPillar 1:  Stewardship and Sustainability\n1.\tEarning Recognition for Our Sustainable Forest Management Practices\nUsing biomass can contribute significantly to the sustainable management of Ontario\u2019s forests.  Using biomass leads to higher stocking, higher regeneration success, less competition, increased growth and better yields.\n2.\tConducting Applied Research and Best Science\nUsing biomass is consistent with best science and information practices.   It will significantly contribute to mitigating the impacts of a changing climate. This should perhaps be spelled out better in FBAP\n3.\tEstablishing and Strengthening Partnerships with Indigenous Peoples\nObjective 4 in FBAP, and its associated actions, highlights some of the ways that Ontario will continue working with Indigenous communities.  Key performance indicators could be added so that progress can be tracked.\n4.\tDetermining Effects of a Changing Climate & Responding to a Changing Climate to Mitigate its Effect\nSurprisingly, the FBAP is pretty silent on the how using biomass can potentially help Ontario mitigate climate change.    The FSS promotes the use of renewable forest biomass as a means of mitigating climate change.  Key performance indicators could be inserted in the FBAP that indicate the amount of biomass used by industry and as an energy source to provide heat and potentially both heat and power for northern, rural and Indigenous communities.   Using biomass helps to build resiliency in forests, and reduce the potential impacts from wildland fires.\nPillar 2:  Putting More Wood to Work\n5.\tRemoving Policy Barriers to Accessing Wood\nObjective 3 in FBAP purports to address Policy barriers to accessing wood \u2013 but there is no indication of $ or time savings, or the potential volume of biomass that could be used as result.\n6.\tA Path to Increase Forest Growth\nI find it highly unusual that the word \u2018silviculture\u2019 does not appear anywhere in the FBAP, given that the silvicultural benefits of using biomass are immense.  The FSS action of increasing forest growth is likely not possible without using more biomass.  Increasing forest growth is predicated on increasing plantable spots and available land base so that full stocking can be achieved.  Biomass must be removed to achieve this FSS action \u2013 by removing currently \u2018unmerchantable\u2019 and \u2018unmarketable\u2019 biomass from the site.  Surely this must be addressed in the FBAP.\n7.\tProviding Wood Supply Certainty, Ensuring Use and Attracting New Investment\nObjective 5 of FBAP provides high level actions \u2013 but there are no key performance indicators or other tangibles.  The FSS action indicates that a range of actions to support existing forest operations that encourage the use of wood and facilitate its availability will be developed, including strategies to support these actions.  I feel that more detail is required in this section regarding effective and efficient mechanisms to see wood utilized and made available in a way that supports existing mills and forest operators, but that also attracts new business and new investment for underutilized wood supply.\n8.\tHarvesting Our Sustainable, Available Wood Supply\nThis FSS action is simply not possible without the increased use of biomass.  Biomass is part of the sustainable available wood supply, and as such targets for the increased use of biomass should be established in the FBAP.\nPillar 3: Improving Cost Competitiveness\n9.\tLowering Taxes\nEstablishing a new, or adding a biomass consuming process to an existing facility can help companies to lower taxes \u2013 as they accelerate write-offs of capital investments\n10.\tMaximizing the Use of Mill By-products\nWhile FBAP provides a definition for mill by-products \u2013 there are no associated actions to maximize their use.  There is a specific FSS action which recognizes the use of mill by-products (e.g. bark, sawdust and shavings) to provide sources of biomass heat, steam and energy for manufacturing in place of fossil fuels.   I believe that FBAP should address this action specifically.\n11.\tReviewing Certain Components of Stumpage\nThis FSS action encourages a review of components of stumpage so that more wood can be used.  I think that a \u2018negative stumpage\u2019 could be investigated and implemented in intensive management areas to encourage greater timber utilization and the harvest of species and lower quality logs that currently have no markets.  Currently companies get paid for piling slash and burning it.  Doesn\u2019t it make more sense to pay to have the slash removed (negative stumpage), and make energy or other products and re-distribute the ash over the entire cut area\u2026\n12.\tReducing Regulatory Burden\/Streamlining\nSee pillar 2 above \u2013 there should be targets regarding streamlining in the FBAP\n13.\tEnhancing the Alignment of the Trusts\nThis FSS action could support items in \u2018reviewing certain components of stumpage\u2019 above.   FBAP should have an explicit action related to the use of biomass as it enhances forest management, increases available wood supplies and contribute to cost competitiveness.\n14.\tRealizing Benefits from Forest Inventory Investments\nThere is no mention of this FSS action in the FBAP.  While many aspects of the new LiDAR based inventory are yet to be worked out, targets should be set that pertain to opportunities to undertake better analysis of biomass supply.\nPillar 4: Fostering Innovation, Markets and Talent\n15.\tMaking Strategic Investments\nFBAP could set targets for investments in biomass activities.  The Forest Sector Investment and Innovation and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC), provide for projects\n16.\tPromoting Innovation\nIt is great that an action in FBAP indicates that CRIBE will be involved in an economic fibre supply model.   Certainly other biomass related \u2018innovation\u2019 actions could highlighted that include working with industry leaders, CRIBE, FPInnovations, OFRI (or whatever it is called now), Indigenous communities, and universities and colleges to support the commercialization of innovative forest products and processes.\n17.\tIncreasing Wood Use\nAgain, I believe that a target is necessary if objectives are to be measured.  FBAP provides plenty of detail on the Ontario Bioheat Initiative \u2013 but it does not have anything that is measurable.\n18.\tReaching New Markets\nThe FSS and the FBAP will not be successful without achieving this objective.  New markets are imperative to growth and advancement of the forest sector.  Definitive strategies should be implemented and targets should be set in this regard.\n19.\tMaking Ontario Wood the Natural Choice\nI believe that this FSS action should be identified in FBAP.  Ontario is growing the domestic market, and Ontario produced biomass (pellets, chips, fuelwood) can play a role.\n20.\tCollaborating on Carbon Analysis\nFBAP can contribute to this FSS Action as well.  Using biomass for heating, electricity, and cooling systems will provide a means by which the private sector, municipalities and provincial entities can account for the carbon footprint of their building assets.\n21.\tAdopting New Technologies\nWith respect to new technologies, FBAP actions include publishing a report and facilitating discussions\u2026 How much economic activity will these actions lead to\u2026  FBAP should set targets with the forest industry, CRIBE, FPInnovations, Indigenous Communities and others to explore mechanisms for the adoption of innovative tools that optimize industrial processes, harvesting, and renewal.\n",

Why would we have spent so much political capital and money to end the burning of coal just to replace it with biomass wood pellets that are dirtier than coal at the smokestack?\nIt also makes no sense as the federal government commits to and Ontario collaborates in planting trees when forest biomass projects destroy mature trees that are far more powerful carbon sinks than newly planted trees.\nI sincerely believe that this approach is a danger to our planetary survival but it is designed to support the extractive forest industry at a time when we need to make the shift off all fuels that add additional greenhouse gas emissions to our atmosphere.  The forestry industry and the Government of Ontario need to get onside with climate change solutions and biomass is not one of them no matter how hard you spin it.  This is not a just transition for fossil fuel workers either as wood pellets and biomass fuels will not improve our GHG emissions in Ontario, so where is the transition we just swapping one climate destructive job with another.\n",

Honestly?\nOne of the main products of Ontario\u2019s forest biomass industry is wood pellets. As if biomass is an industry to help in climate change, it is not.  Wood pellets are marketed as a clean energy alternative, but we know that wood pellets are dirtier than coal at the smokestack and is by no means an excuse to cut down huge swaths of boreal forest during a climate crisis, a crisis helped by leaving boreal forests alone.\nIncreasing deforestation as a climate solution is not viable.  It is the opposite of viable and accelerates climate change.    While the government and industry claim that only waste wood is used to manufacture wood pellets, more whole trees from primary, boreal forests are being logged to meet the demands of this growing industry.\nThe growing industry of what?  Forest destruction for private profit.  Deforestation for profit may be called a \"growing industry\" as it has been in decline and hopefully reversed as of late but apparently being reworked, rebranded and restarted regardless of the very real damage it does.  Cutting down boreal forests is the opposite of climate solutions and quite possibly against the Paris Climate accord.\nThe Ontario government claims that expanding the wood pellet industry will provide alternative employment for fossil fuel workers, but these would be jobs in an industry that dumps more carbon into the atmosphere than what it's replacing. It's a completely false narrative that has nothing to do with fossil fuel workers needs and more to do with a big industry that is known for destroying forests.\nWe were not born yesterday and Canada seems to do more harm than good when it comes to every facet of climate change.  Shame on Ontario for telling anyone wood pellets are carbon solution to anything and that their job creation depends on cutting down large swaths of boreal forests.\nThese practices have to end.\nThank you.\n",

It is no longer making the majority of its pellets from dead trees and wood waste, they are cutting down trees and therefore this practice is no longer a green source of renewable energy.\nConsideration for this expansion has to be pressure from the dying fossil fuel industry influencing government with bullshit biased studies the try and justify this insanity.\nBurning wood is as bad as burning coal if not worse at the smokestack, and it releases greenhouse gases into our atmosphere making global warming worse.\nPractices like this should not be expanded, they need to be phased out and replaced with real clean renewable energy solutions.  This is nothing more than greenwashing and most Canadian voters are not that stupid.\nI got rid of my diesel furnace and replaced it with an efficient electric boiler because I knew I had to do my part, but industry refuses to do theirs.\nIt is so frustrating that a large portion of the electricity I use for my electric boiler is coming from Nova Scotia Power burning coal and then charging us some of the highest power rates in Canada to which they try and justify as needed for their transition to more green energy solutions which we all know is mostly a load of crap.  A large amount of their profits from these high rates go towards insane salaries and bonuses for their upper management and CEO's as well as profits for their shareholders.\nRunaway capitalism like this destroying the earth.\nI digress.\nWe all know the burning of all fossil fuels needs to be phased out to help prevent more extreme climate events that we around the world are already experiencing.\nSo all Canadian governments need to stop expanding pipelines, stop expanding oil sands, stop expanding fracking operations to extract natural gas, stop cutting down trees which are a carbon sink, to be used for biomass, and use our current fossil fuel industries for our needs here in Canada while we invest in and expand more clean renewable energy that will not contribute to but help reduce greenhouse gases.\n",

It's a double-whammy against any kind of climate change mitigation and resilience, in that it (1) releases carbon into the atmosphere and (2) destroys the very forests that provide the CO2 storage, shade and cooling evapotranspiration that can help us survive a warming planet.  Forests are solar-powered air conditioners.\nEven burning genuine \"waste\" wood is unwise and unsustainable.  The best use of wood waste is putting it back on the land itself, to replenish soil fertility, provide habitat for important soil organisms (eg fungi) and reduce drought with moisture-retaining organic matter.  These are the elements necessary to grow a healthy and sustainable forest in the first place.\nIn Denmark, garbage is burned to create energy -- and it's burned in state-of-the-art facilities that trap virtually all pollutants and resources, for safe disposal or recycling.

If the Government\u2019s goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they should commit to displacing fossil fuels by exact measures.\nThe United States is ahead of Canada on offering corporations tax incentives for switching heating loads to modern biomass systems, (not the older outdoor cordwood boiler technology).

Ontario has the biomass and the technology available but there is little incentive to switch off fossil fuels to biomass specifically.

        "comment":"Hello, I am Francis Leclerc, a salesperson for Heizomat Canada and also an owner of an automated wood chip boiler and wood chipper. Heizomat Canada sells German made automated biomass boilers, wood chippers and loading systems.  I spent 20 years working in the natural gas\/oil industry, I quickly realized how bad it is on the environment and families as people have to go work in very remote locations to make a living.  By switching to biomass heating we can use local renewable resources and sustain families in each communities that do the transition.\nI am very passionate about automated biomass heating because it makes so much sense for Canada and it has been time tested in Europe.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel... and the benefit for the environment and people are obvious.\nOne of the challenge of the Canadian biomass industry is the production and supply of good quality wood chips.  Just like firewood, wood chips need to be dried before being burned.  It takes time and the right equipment to implement a wood chips supply chain but we are lucky we can just look over to Europe to see how it gets done.\nThe location of the fuel is our challenge.  Wood chips should not be transported more than 80-100km to make them affordable.  But most of the energy is needed in large cities and the wood lots surrounding the large cities are privately owned and not managed properly to supply biomass fuel because there are no incentives\/regulations for the landowners.  That is the main difference between Europe and Canada, I believe.  Lots of wood is going to waste due to lack of harvesting\/management of private wood lots, in Europe owners are obligated to managed their wood lots.  It is profitable but it takes time...\nOne great source of biomass fuel for the large cities is their landfills\/transfer station.  All the waste lumber can be chipped and burned right away as this waste is from dried lumber.  Heizomat's biomass boilers are designed to burn fuel that contains contaminants like nails, gravel, etc.\nIn rural farm areas, the farmers are utilizing their wood lots to produce firewood, cord wood and logs for lumber.  They are slowly turning to automated biomass boiler and they usually produce their own fuel using a PTO driven chipper off their tractor.  They can also produce and supply good quality wood chips in their area because they already own most of the equipment needed to handle\/transport wood chips.\nIn the Prairies where there are no trees to chip, or in urban areas where wood chips is not suitable due to the lack of space, wood pellets becomes the right fuel to use to displace fossil fuel.  Due to the lower cost of transportation and ease to handle the pellets are definitely part of the biomass fuel supply chain as well.  The pellets producers do not want to truck the wood chips needed to produce pellets very far either, this creates shortages of wood chips in some areas.  Most of the pellets are exported to the Asian and European markets so it leaves some Canadians with a bad taste for the biomass industry...\nIn Canada, and Ontario, we have plenty of wood to do the switch to biomass heating and CHP, but the challenge is the location of the wood.  To keep the cost of the fuel down we need to make sure we use the biomass close to where it is being utilized, highly populated areas.  This means incentives and regulations for private wood lot owners to mange their land and supply wood to businesses that will produce and supply good quality wood chips with the right moisture content.\nThere are plenty of people interested in supporting the biomass industry either by supplying  or producing good quality wood chips but they need some help.  Just like natural gas is subsidized to make it affordable, the government will need to help people and businesses as well.  The government of Quebec, through its Transition Energetique program, is definitely promoting and helping people and businesses transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy and I think other provinces and Territories should have a similar program.\nThe other big challenge is the technology made and available in Canada is so far behind that only large industrial project can afford to buy a good automated system.  There are no good systems below 1MW made in North America.  The technology comes from Europe and the challenge comes from the certification of the equipment.  In North America we certify boilers using the ASME system, or a CRN number for equipment certified for Canada only, Europe uses EN 303-5.  This is holding back many systems and complicating the installation.  Only PEI has recognized EN 303-5 as equivalent to ASME.  North American manufacturers are not going to be able to catch up to European manufacturers so we have 2 solutions:  change regulations to accept EN 303-5 or force the European to build the boilers here to have them ASME certified.\nAs a salesperson and a boiler owner of a non ASME certified system, I would like to see the regulations barrier removed ASAP to lower the cost of the equipment.  The few ASME certified European boiler dealers are hording the projects and driving the cots way higher than they need to be.  They have managed to influence the engineers designing the heating system by telling them that ASME boilers are better.  There are plenty of high quality European boiler manufacturer but only 2 are able to bid on governments projects that always require ASME certification.\nThanks for listening to users and salespersons involved in the industry, we appreciate it!\nCheers.\n",

It is a step in the wrong direction unless you are harvesting the CO2 that you are creating and replanting trees taken at higher rates. Also leave the hardwood trees alone. There should be dedicated forests for producing softwood trees to use for making pellets. There is so much going wrong with this method of producing electricity. Why not put available resources & funding into other already established green energy methods? Solar, wind, and water turbines to name a few. Why are we cutting down trees and taking away animals homes in order to make wood pellets to burn for energy?? Also, considering the rising price of wood products right now this really does not seem like an economical move. Leave the trees alone and invest in more solar and how we can improve photo-voltaics. Anything but burning our resources and fracking our lands. Think of the future generations and what we are leaving behind for them. Think of your own children, if you have any. This is a bad idea and should not be considered for any future projects. Thank you for listening to my rant. I've provided many links to provide some further insight into my stance on this issue.

Also cutting down the boreal forest for this is extremely destructive, eliminating an ecosystem, that helps to absorb our much over produced carbon dioxide.\nThe forests in Canada have been shown recently to be net losers of carbon dioxide rather than sinks for carbon dioxide due to the heave cutting down of trees.  Also the way that we cut trees with heavy machinery disturbs the land, and it is in the land under the trees that most of the carbon is stored, and the large mycorrhizal network (fungus), that works between trees supporting them with water, carbon, warning, is also destroyed, so it is difficult to replant trees in the disturbed soil.  They will have to slowly build up the mycorrhizal network to support themselves.\nFinally replanting trees should be done to mimic the forest that was there before, a mixture of trees, not only a monoculture which is prone to disease and blowdowns and fire.\n",

        "comment":"Wood pellets are NOT 'clean electricity' - in fact, burning wood pellets is dirtier than coal at the smokestack. The Ontario government cannot intentionally deceive the public to justify expanding a climate-destroying industry.\nWhole trees from primary, boreal forests are being logged to manufacture wood pellets, not just 'waste wood' as the government claims. There is no world in which increased deforestation is a climate solution.\nOne of the key objectives (objective 3) of this action plan includes, \u201cstreamline permitting and reduce regulatory burden for all sectors which use forest biomass.\u201d This would be absolutely devastating, leaving few environmental checkpoints in a province that has already gutted the Endangered Species Act, a key regulatory body.\nThe Ontario government cannot bill these jobs as 'clean' alternatives for fossil fuel workers when this industry is even more carbon-polluting than what it's replacing. It will take centuries to recover the forests as a crucial carbon sink - time we simply do not have.\nWood pellets are a completely false climate solution. The government must recognize this and adapt accordingly. The public will not believe attempted greenwashing of 'solutions' that create more even more damage and lead to environmental catastrophe.\n",

Canada and Ontario are part of a global movement to decarbonize fossil fuel dependent industries, and this is an opportunity for research, development and innovative use of forest biofuel. The circular economy in the forest sector is important and commendable, however development of stand alone, independent facilities needs more support particularly if in the green energy sector.   Pleased to see an emphasis on regulatory burden reduction.\n",

This latteris revealed by the little regard by human decision-making based on understanding of the interconnection of all elements that mean creation in all its forms, (including human) can continue if in a right - relation balance for life).\nSimply but profoundly put, we as human beings are able to breathe (take in oxygen) because of the action of the trees absorbing and \"metabolizing\") carbon dioxide. We breathe because they breathe.\nFor the future of our human presence on the earth and our future generations, I urge for a pausing and further considerations through expert investigations re. possibility of an increase of further tree harvesting for increasing pellet production. May we act on a vision to participate in wise decisions now for the sake  of future life as an earth community continuing on. Otherwise, we are ultimately on a suicidal path here.\n",

The Ontario government is largely selling the forest biomass industry as a circular economy because they claim that it only uses \u201cmill by-products\u201d aka, waste wood, to manufacture wood pellets. However, many Canadian provinces including Ontario are logging whole trees from primary forests to meet the growing demand for wood pellets. This isn't just \"waste\" wood that's being used. One of the key objectives (objective 3) of this action plan includes, \u201cstreamline permitting and reduce regulatory burden for all sectors which use forest biomass,\u201d which is particularly concerning in light of the above.\n",

It like the foolish project of burning food crops (biofuel) grown on land that is needed to feed the world.\nAll these blunders are done in the name of profit - they are to appease those who try to make us believe that climate can be addressed with minimal effect on GDP. As Einstein said: problems cannot be solved using the same methods over and over again. The neo-liberal belief that the market is the only way to solve problems has be proved false many times and has, in fact, led to the climate catastrophe we are now experiencing.\n",

To even conceive that cutting down more trees to continue the suicidal pollution that anyone anywhere can see for themselves is threatening the planet is almost unimaginable. We must PLANT MORE TREES and become more frugal and careful with our effluent outputs, not cut more down and burn them - wildfires are already again out of control across the planet!!!

Overall we found that the draft action plan was in need of more specific actions that will be directed at specific policy areas of biomass.  These are as follows:\nOverview comments:\n1) Provide local incentives to use biomass.\n      a Companies in central Ontario need specific Biofibre \u201cactions\u201d to deal with a different forest type\n         and smaller company size.\n      b Fund merchandising areas to provide more effective product sorting and direction between\n          operators and between different SFLs is appropriate.\n2) Fix pricing \/ scaling to reflect the actual market conditions.\n     a Currently biofibre is not a viable market because of distorted prices for low end fibre.\n     b Cross province pricing is not realistic given local supply variability.\n     c Ensure that all loads going to biomass facilities are charged at a low rate.\n     d Biomass fibre should be charged at zero currently, given a negligible market.\n3) Incentives should be directed to the forest sector specifically.\n     a Provincial government grants directed to supporting the establishment of new businesses or\n        business growth, (such as but not only NOHFC), should have a forest sector funding stream (vs\n        those requests being considered amongst the mix of all other business sector requests) .\n4) Current tenure constraints are systemic problems that need to be addressed before any actions will\n     be successful.\n     a Loosen commitment and facility license constraint to allow new entrants (as per Tenure\n        Modernization Act  2010).\n",
