        "comment":"To whom it is concerned,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act. As written, the changes will render the heritage register as basically a 2 year waiting period for designation, which is a significant problem for many (if not all) municipalities which are 10 or more years behind in their designations. This sets an impossible pace to catch up, given the already strained municipal resources and will lead to the loss of culturally significant homes and buildings.\nForcing municipalities to try to keep up with the designations will just take more municipal resources away from reviewing and approving development and building permits. Heritage is low hanging fruit for developers to point at as a reason for delays, mostly without merit. If a developer buys and speculates on a heritage listed property for 15 years until it becomes economically profitable to develop and then tries to get it demolished, who\u2019s fault is that? It isn\u2019t a reasonable complaint to claim delay due to heritage at that point.\nThe current function of the Act forces a city council to act on moving to designation within 60 days already following demolition request, which is a perfectly fine system. No intelligent developer would buy a heritage listed property and believe they would be able to demolish it immediately (unless they are in the pocket of the city council).\nTo reiterate, the proposed changes will just overload municipal offices trying to catch up on designations, or more likely lead them to give up. You might as well just scrap the Act at that point.\nHeritage designations are not the reason why we are a generation behind in constructing housing, let\u2019s not rob future generations of cultural heritage.\nCameron MacCarthy-Tilley, MEng., P.Eng.\nGuelph, Ontario\n",

        "comment":"There is no \u2018housing crisis\u2019; this is an emotional and panic-inspiring phrase repeated by the current Ontario government. But there IS a housing affordability crisis. The knee-jerk proposal to unprotect the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine lands for housing is not a convincing solution. Is it just a coincidence that unlocking this land for development is worth billions?\nI paraphrase an article about housing supply and demand in a Jan. 3, 2017 Globe and Mail article (running headline: \u2018Stop blaming the Greenbelt for Toronto's housing prices. (Link provided).\nI also cite StatsCan data about multiple property ownership in Ontario (link provided)\n1. Recent analysis by RBC reports four factors accounting for almost 90 per cent of price increases in Toronto since 1999: low borrowing rates; higher incomes; higher percentage of incomes used to pay mortgages; and parent loans all contributing to strong buying power.\n2. Globe article:  \u201cCanadians buying properties that are not their primary homes now represent a quarter of demand in Toronto real estate\u201d.  StatsCan data; \u201c Multiple-property owners own 31% of residential properties in Ontario\u2026 Owners seeking additional properties contribute to increased competition in already tight real estate markets, making it more difficult for prospective homeowners to purchase a home.\u201d  These market factors have driven average home prices up 180% in the last decade when wages increased only 38%. Point: it is not just low supply that is increasing the demand for (affordable) housing.\n The proposed \u2018solution\u2019 is to build tens of thousands of houses (on the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt) to create supply. Contrary to this belief, what will happen is our \u2018non-real estate assets\u2019 of headwaters, groundwaters, food-growing land, and flood-plains will be irreparably lost. Heat-generating hard-top area will expand. Congestion in the GTA will increase. And who will control whether these new homes are bought as investments by multi-property owners? The proposal to open 7400 acres of Greenbelt land is based on a false choice between housing and the environment.\nSolutions? Some are currently underway:\n1. Metrolinx is improving rail connectivity between larger South Ontario cities. This will reduce strain on the overburdened GTA highways as these cities become viable commuter cities (to and from). Facilitate this rail work.\n2. Prioritize and assist municipalities in the  building of affordable low-to mid-rise family rental units, and townhouses to modestly increase density and create viable neighbourhoods with affordable housing.\n3. Ontario is not \u2018short of land\u2019, an argument posed to justify removing protections from wetlands, headwaters and forested areas in the Greenbelt. There is land in vast excess of 7400 acres available for building within existing municipalities. Zoning issues (eg single family home zoning) and other delays here make the Greenbelt and Oakridges Moraine seem very attractive to for-profit developers: empty land with no strings attached.\nI ask that the proposal to change the Ontario Heritage Act as proposed by Bill 23 be denied. An alternative and better plan to achieve sufficient  affordable housing is possible.\n.\n",

Overall, I do not believe this will create housing affordability, or significantly impact supply. Here's why: Reducing fees on development does not make housing cheaper, it increases the amount of money a developer is able to pay for land. As land prices go up, so will the price for consumers.\nOur development charge system is based on the principle that growth should pay for itself. If you are discounting development charges that are based on the actual cost of providing infrastructure to support new growth, then either municipalities will not be able to build that infrastructure, and there will be no new housing, or existing property owners will have to pay for it through property tax.\nI agree with the intent of streamlining approvals, but I don't think removing Upper Tier municipalities and Conservation Authorities from the development review process is the way to do it. Upper Tier municipalities have a fundamental growth management role, as well as infrastructure planning. CAs do more than just review flooding and erosion hazards, they have expertise in ecology and climate change and safeguard our natural heritage system. Especially as we are experiencing more frequent extreme weather and other impacts of climate change, now is not the time to eliminate or severely limit CAs.\nI could say much more, but I will finish with this. Housing construction is not going to happen any more quickly by consolidating all review powers either with municipalities or the Province, especially if municipalities have reduced revenue and increased responsibilities. The consulting world is barely keeping up with the pace of development today, and we have an acute shortage of skilled trades to actually do the work.\nPlease extend the commenting period so the planning and development industry as well as the public can have more time to review. This legislation will be incredibly damaging to our quality of life in Ontario.\nThank you\n",

While it is imperative that housing continue to be built in Ontario, it is equally critical to accept that the dual crises of climate change and loss of biodiversity mean that we must plan sustainably.\nWetland are key to this, storing water during increasingly frequent torrential downpours, releasing water during also frequent droughts (as I write the main river system in Hamilton, Spencer Creek is running dry due to lack of rain). Wetlands provide critical habitat for a variety of species throughout heir life cycles - and of course, we have already lost over 75% of wetlands in southern ON - we cannot afford to lose more. In this vein, Ontario's Conservation Authorities are renowned around the world with their watershed planning approach, invented in the months after Hurrican Hazel.\nFor climate change reasons,, municipalities need greener building code standards (as Toronto has demonstrated) - houses built today will be with us for 50+ years at a time when our communities are required to be net zero for greenhouse gas emissions. Site Plan control is necessary to ensure new intensification-style  evelopment fits into the character of existing neighbourhoods, respecting cultural heritage.\nLastly, public consultation processes including the ability of neighbourhood groups and environmental groups to participate in planning appeals is a key part of our democracy in Ontario. Any efforts to narrow the public's involvement in the planning process should be resisted.\nI urge you NOT to advance these changes, but instead look for planning process changes that would speed up the process of housing.

        "comment":"I think that Bill 23 is very problematic in many ways. In general, it seems to simplify the solution for needed housing by encouraging and supporting market economy development as the driving force for growth, and it reduces the power that other stakeholders have in negotiating the goals and means of these projects. Developers work largely for capitalist gain. This can put developers at odds with other values and goals in a municipal or rural area. Some of those other values include sustainability through nature conservation and the preservation of agricultural lands, so important to the continued sustainability of basic urban and rural livelihoods. The fact that developers work for economic profit over other goals is why municipalities have laws to recognize the rights of other values to thrive in cities. We do, absolutely, need housing, but this idea (in Bill 23) to meet our needs through the economic drive of developers can fail miserably. For example, most of the housing needed today is affordable housing. But developers make very little project on that, so developers favor luxury, high-end housing. This is not going to solve our housing crisis, as many of the luxury housing market serves as \"investments,\" which sometimes are not even lived in. In this role as investment, luxury housing\/condos also often serves as a second house (or more). What this Bill really fails to put upfront is the need for any new housing to be affordable housing (which could in fact be partially solved [I believe] with a more creative approach to retrofitting and renovating existing buildings [sometimes not even housing--sometimes commercial, or otherwise] into affordable housing.\nSome developers find lucrative not only luxury housing--such as condos--but also tract housing. But this kind of housing is only profitable on inexpensive land--which means developers look for this land outside of the high real estate prices of urban centres and instead buy land on the periphery. But this is where a good amount of our rich agricultural land is located--which, through development, is being shrunk and pushed farther from cities. This is just not sustainable. We expect to increase the housing while diminishing the agricultural land that feeds people? This is precisely what is happening and it is a short-term solution which could lead to serious food shortages, as farmers (who actually have very little political power, unfortunately) have pointed out for decades. Some of the land on the periphery of cities has been conserved for wildlife habitats, and here again it seems that this Bill puts the power in the hands of developers over conservation authorities. This land seems to be viewed as an indulgence that we can live without, something that this Bill could allow. But we can't live without it. Birds, insects, other wildlife, wetlands, streams, and forests are not just an indulgence for weekend hikers and bird-watchers. Our entire ecosystem has been damaged and disrupted by loss of food and habitat for wildlife. Insects, for example, pollinate our plants which allows them to fruit. Wetlands provide buffers to flooding and purify our water. Plants, animals, and soils sustain us, but they will not be able to do this much longer if we destroy them. This Bill certainly seems to put nature in a precarious place, where a balance of perspectives is abandoned for (again) power in the hands of developers.\nOverall, I think Bill 23 is very flawed in the imbalance of power it will produce.\nRegarding Schedule 2 of Bill 23, I would support its removal and replaced instead with the following:\nAllow Municipalities to continue voluntary agreements with Conservation Authorities.\n    Continue to allow municipalities to use existing expertise within Conservation Authorities while saving time and money for applicants.\n    Development subject to Planning Act authorizations should not be exempt from Conservation Authority permits, and CA regulations should not be delegated to municipalities where there is no organic capabilities.\n    Watersheds, and not municipal boundaries, should continue to be the scale used to assess natural hazards.\n    The multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group should continue working with the Province to provide solutions for shared goals and objectives.\n    Conservation Authority development fees should not be frozen since they are based on cost recovery.\nThank you.\n",

These required staff and time increases have not been provided, and as a result, these properties will be at risk as they will lose listed status and lose any record of ever being considered worthy of heritage designation.\nHeritage Conservation District plans will be endangered. Existing HCDs would be subject to a process that would allow Heritage Conservation District Plans to be amended or repealed, again throwing away countless years of municipal work, and leaving them exposed to policy-free development.

        "comment":"Comments on proposed revision of the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) \u2013 the Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022. ERO Registry Number 019-6196\nThe proposal states that,\n\u201cThe goal of the proposed changes is to renew and update heritage policies, some of which haven\u2019t been reviewed in over a decade, to reduce red tape and remove barriers that are slowing down housing construction and other priority projects while continuing to conserve and commemorate key heritage properties that matter most to local communities.\u201d\nThis \u201cgoal\u201d as stated is based on the false assumption that heritage preservation and new housing construction are somehow antithetical. They are not. There are many examples of new housing and increased density in heritage buildings and neighbourhoods in Ontario. Additions can be put on existing buildings. Single family dwelling have been converted into duplexes, triplexes and condos.  Former factories have been turned into lofts, former churches and schools into multi-unit apartments and condos. Heritage districts have accommodated new apartment buildings, all while preserving heritage character and links to the past.  There are many examples of renewed heritage neighbourhoods with increased densities. Look at the Distillery District or St. Lawrence Market area in Toronto. These are thriving communities and popular tourist destinations. These projects were not happy accidents but the result of time consuming and careful application of heritage preservation planning.\nThe governments proposed \u201cgoal\u201d to increase housing starts while \u201ccontinuing to conserve and commemorate key heritage properties that matter most to local communities\u201d ignores the statement on the official Ontario.ca website under the heading, \u201cLearn about how we support heritage conservation.\u201d It says \u201cThe Government of Ontario recognizes that the province\u2019s heritage tells us who we are, where we have come from and what we have accomplished. This knowledge is a source of strength and confidence.\u201d The concept put forward in this proposal to update the Ontario Heritage Act is that we only \u201ccontinue to commemorate key heritage properties that matter most to local communities.\u201d This is a severe new restriction of the purposes of the Heritage Act which protects all heritage identified, evaluated and designated by local municipalities.\nOur sad state of affairs regarding the lack of available housing has many sources, not the least of which was the cancellation of Federal funding for social housing during the mid-1990s by the Liberal government and the subsequent downloading of social housing funding to local municipalities by the Ontario government. Heritage planning is not a barrier to increasing housing, lack of funding is.\nThe proposed changes to the section of the OHA dealing with municipal heritage registers is ignoring the primary purpose of these registers which is to facilitate the planning process to renovate or develop properties with suspected heritage value in an efficient manner while still protecting what is of potential public value in them.   Registers are meant to provide an early warning system to owners and prospective owners that a property has possible heritage value that may have to be taken into consideration when planning for alteration or demolition. A register is not supposed to be a list of properties of known value and worthy of designation but just a list of properties that should be considered for designation if necessary.\nThe government is now proposing to weaken the purpose of registers while making them so onerous for municipalities to maintain that they would basically no longer be worth retaining.\nThe proposals are the following;\no\tNon-designated properties currently included on a municipal register would have to be removed if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force. Non-designated properties included on the register after the proposed amendment comes into force would have to be removed if council does not issue a NOID within two years of the property being included.\no\tIf removed from the register under any of the above three circumstances, the property cannot be relisted for a period of five years.\nThe expectation here that cash strapped municipalities will suddenly move to research report and designate 100s of properties in a few years is ludicrous and financially impossible. What it will do is wipe out all the work (and expense) that went in to making the listings in the first place. Some municipalities have hundreds, if not thousands of listings, this effectively removes the usefulness of the early warning value and would effectively end the process of maintaining heritage registers.\nThe further proposal not to allow municipalities to designate in the face of a proposal to demolish or alter unless the property is already on a register is the final nail in the coffin of the Ontario Heritage Act. It would soon make it impossible for municipalities to protect their heritage character. The proposals destroy the ability of municipalities to avoid \u201c\u201ddesignation decisions being made late in the land use planning process\u201d  and they penalize them again by making it impossible to designate unless the property is already listed, The term \u201cCatch 22\u201d comes to mind\u2026\nIs all this really necessary to assist the addition of new housing? Or rather is it intended  to lower costs and increase profits for a small number of individuals who are building any developments, housing related or not, at the expense of the wishes of local communities?\nThe government also proposes, \u201cAn increase in the threshold for designation of individual properties and new limitations on designation for properties subject to proposed development.\u201d\n\u201cMCM is proposing to provide further rigour in the designation process by increasing the threshold by requiring that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation.\u2019\u2019\nWhile I suspect that most designated property will easily meet two criteria there are examples of important heritage properties that only meet one criterion. What about a little chapel moved to a new location that was built by black settlers who followed the freedom trail to Ontario? What about the childhood home of Wayne Gretsky that is in a modest subdivision of Brantford? Are these not of sufficient importance to deserve recognition and protection? The OHA enables municipalities to identify and protect their heritage properties and to defend them in an appeal process, why restrict their decision making further?\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022, is a bulldozer destroying key parts of the Ontario Heritage Act and Ontario\u2019s cultural heritage protection system.\nTo enable clear sailing for development, this bill takes aim at how we define cultural heritage itself.  The proposed change would effectively narrow the places our cities and towns can recognize and protect.\nBill 23 must be withdrawn.\nIronically, it is the new \u201cminister of heritage,\u201d the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism, Michael Ford, who is abetting this travesty.\nThe seemingly simple proposal to redefine our cultural heritage \u2014 based on TWO legislated criteria rather than one \u2014 means that many of the places of value to Ontario\u2019s diverse communities risk exclusion from the official \u201cheritage\u201d of the province.\nIn Bill 23 the government seems to be signalling that much of our (public\u2019s) is decidedly second-rate and not worth considering - Because it (somehow) gets in the way of housing starts.\nFor rural communities whose economic drivers are rooted in both natural and cultural heritage, the impact of changes to the OHA and its regulations represents a threat to their sustainability.\nRegulation 9\/06\nThe Ontario Heritage Act, going back to 1975, provides a suite of tools for municipalities, and the province itself, to use to identify and protect our cultural heritage resources. The main protection tool is heritage designation\nBecause the Act is primarily concerned with land or real property, there are a great many different kinds of places that could be subject to designation which includes but is not limited to : buildings, bridges, battlegrounds, cemeteries and other burial sites, gardens, parks, ruins, archaeological sites, landscapes, streetscapes, trees and other natural features (at least those with a cultural component), memorials, and engineering works.\nBut lists like this don\u2019t tell us which buildings, bridges, etc. are heritage buildings, bridges, etc. and eligible for designation. And there is no definition in the Act to help.\n2005 saw comprehensive amendments made to the OHA where a property was eligible for designation if it met specific criteria \u201cfor determining cultural heritage value or interest\u201d \u2014 and these were set out in Regulation 9\/06 adopted the next year. The regulation provides a now almost universally used definition of heritage in Ontario.\nThe criteria themselves \u2014 nine in all, with three in each of three categories: physical\/design, historic\/associative, and contextual \u2014 didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.\nWhat had been developed and fine-tuned over decades as best practices gradually gained official recognition as governments adopted this professional praxis. The Standards for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada and Ontario\u2019s Standards & Guidelines for Provincial Heritage Properties are other examples of this.\nThe designation criteria don\u2019t stand alone. As important as the criteria themselves is how they are applied: Following a systematic evaluation process in which all are considered, one or more must be met.\nIs it unclear why requiring two or more heritage criteria be met. Government says to provide further \u201crigour\u201d in designations.  Any number other than one is arbitrary and professionally unintelligible. The opposite of rigour.\nThis all results in on-the-ground consequences, intended or not.\nWith the early and widespread emphasis in the preservation field on buildings, on architecture more generally, use of designation has historically been skewed in favour of the homes and buildings of Ontario\u2019s settler societies and mostly well-to-do, Physical or design values such as the style of a mansion or town hall were uppermost in the minds of municipalities embarking on designation programs. As the field progressed, other, less obvious values of heritage places came to be better understood. Historic\/associative value and contextual value received greater attention.\nThe criteria in Reg. 9\/06 reflect this evolution.\nHistoric\/associative value. Currently a property can be recognized and designated for its historic\/associative value alone \u2014 by demonstrating that it has \"direct associations with a theme, event, belief, person, activity, organization, or institution that is significant to a community.\u201d In many cases there may be no building on the property or no physical\/design elements that would satisfy the physical\/design criteria (no \u201crare, unique, representative or early example of a style, type, expression, material or construction method\u201d). Nor may there be contextual value (where a property is \u201cimportant in defining, maintaining or supporting the character of an area\u201d).\nThe one-to-two change in the criteria would rule out designation and legal protection of London\u2019s Fugitive Slave Chapel \u2014 and countless historic places like it.  Similarly with buildings of \u201conly\u201d contextual importance in places like Kensington Market and Little Jamaica and other communities throughout Ontario.\nOntario municipalities large and small \u2014 encouraged by local groups of all kinds and heritage organizations like the Ontario Historical Society and Architectural Conservancy Ontario \u2014 are making slow strides in recognizing and celebrating the unsung heritage places of Ontario\u2019s diverse communities.\nThen we have Mr. Ford, Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism \u2014 who has just taken over the heritage portfolio and responsibility for the Ontario Heritage Act, and whose ministry \u201cleads the government\u2019s anti-racism and inclusion initiatives to build an equitable Ontario\u201d\u2014 who wants to make this more difficult.\nBill 23 sets Ontarians back 4 decades.  Cultural and Natural Heritage, which impacts our quality of life and our identities are being systematically attacked for the sole purpose of creating more housing \u2013 primarily of a kind that does not prioritize affordable housing but creates single family dwellings only accessible by major wage earners and in the process ignores the carbon benefits of re-use of heritage properties.\nBill 23 must be withdrawn.\n",

It seems extremely misinformed that the government of Ontario is taking a mutually exclusive approach to these two issues. In my 15 years of working in heritage in a small municipality, I have yet to encounter a situation where a heritage designation or listed property was a barrier to new housing.\nIt has repeatedly been proven that tearing down existing homes to build new ones is not a cost-efficient way to create more housing. This approach also has a much higher carbon impact (not that this government seems particularly interested in the environment). The proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will leave many perfectly good homes vulnerable to demolition, in an attempt to make way for poorly constructed slapped together homes that will be falling apart in 25 years.\n",

        "comment":"Some of these changes like being able to amend an HCD plan and applying regulation 9\/06 to listing of properties is positive. Unfortunately there are more negatives in this bill. The time limits applied to listed properties is especially unfortunate given the amount of work over decades that municipalities have put into compiling their heritage registers. Listing is a non-resource intensive way for communities to flag properties of potential heritage value and interest without proceeding through the intensive process of designation. There is no restriction applied to owners of listed properties beyond needing to provide notice of intention to demolish. In many small communities where not much development occurs, this protection for demolition is often considered enough protection especially where the municipality may not have staff equipped to handle heritage permits if the properties were designated. Listed properties can be radically altered to accommodate new construction and housing so long as demolition isn't undertaken. The proposed 90 timeline associated with planning events provides clarity around how such properties should be dealt with in the event of planning applications. The requirement to have all listed properties either be designated or removed from registers within two years makes no sense and is an affront to the heritage conservation efforts of communities across the province. Municipalities are not sufficiently resourced to designate the likely thousands of properties on registers within two years, though municipalities may try to advance designation for many which would only result in more restrictions on these properties than had they been left solely as listed properties. At the very least, the two year timeline should not be retroactive to already listed properties. Also concerning is the requirement for a property to meet two or more criteria under regulation 9\/06 for designation. Many sites associated with BIPOC communities do not contain grand architecture, but nevertheless have very important historical and value for those communities. By requiring two criteria the province will be taking heritage conservation efforts back to a focus of purely architectural preservation associated with primarily white Ontarians rather than heritage conservation, which includes the places of importance to BIPOC Ontarians. Lastly, the notion that heritage conservation somehow hinders new home construction is false. There are countless examples of adaptive reuse of heritage buildings to accommodate new homes that were once factories, warehouses, and schools. The conservation of these existing structures is more sustainable, provides jobs for specialized labour, and often results in the kind of missing-middle housing that would have been less likely if the existing building were torn down. In the same way that existing single detached, semi, and row housing of all ages provides opportunities for intensification without demolition, so to do our protected heritage properties. I would strongly encourage the province to take more time to consult with municipalities, BIPOC communities, and other stakeholders before passing Bill 23.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations are unacceptable. Bill23 does not address the issue of affordable housing in Ontario. Building more homes in Ontario does not mitigate the rising costs of buying and renting houses in Ontario. Wetlands in Ontario have been disappearing for years, we have lost the large majority of our wetlands and these proposed changes will be sure to eliminate the remaining wetlands in Ontario. It does not matter the size of a wetland, we know that they all matter in the fight against climate change. Wetlands are one the greatest carbon sinks and aid in the fight against climate change through their ability to sequester carbon, most specifically peatlands.  In addition, they filter water and manage flood risks for many communities. Wetlands also provide crucial habitats for many at-risk species, as well as being a common hunting ground for many Ontario hunters.\nEliminating the ability for Conservation Authorities to consider the risks of pollution, flooding, and more when evaluating land for development essentially makes these organizations useless. Many CA's have already expressed their worries that this bill will nullify their roles within their organizations. Ontario CA's are unique to Ontario's heritage and have provided us with many positive benefits. Why take that away? This bill essentially allows for development to be unrestricted, which leads to so many negative impacts on our environment. This bill is creating a level of chaos within our system that will lead to so many other uncertainties. In addition, this proposal completely disregarded any Indigenous input and puts First Nation territories and waterways directly at risk.\nWe know that climate change is the most pressing issue in society, and our officials have been trying to enact positive change to help mitigate the risks. This bill feels like the rug was pulled out from under the average working Ontarian that is concerned about our environment. This proposal will create a disaster that the young people of Ontario will be left to clean up.

I am frankly shocked that such a large section of the bill with such large ramifications against heritage buildings province-wide had ZERO consultation with any professional heritage organization and that the government refused the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario to speak to the Bill. This is horribly unprofessional and dismissive, as the work that has gone into listing buildings for decades will now be wiped off without a second thought by a government only concerned with pleasing developers and not the regular people of Ontario.\nListing buildings is a cost-effective way of demonstrating why some buildings are interesting architecturally, culturally, or historically, without having to meet sometimes cumbersome and expensive designation criteria. A listed building has NO associated costs with it, except a 90 day notice to the government before demolition. People can still renovate and work on these properties, and the properties are kept in place so that people can appreciate them for their significance. At a time when we are also trying to promote appreciation for more hidden histories (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, BIPOC) some of their most important histories and beginnings started in buildings that would not make the designation list but are important to list. This way, the buildings can still be adapted and changed as necessary, just NOT demolished.\nForcing a city to remove any listed buildings within 2 years of the passing of this bill is absurd and serves no purpose. Demolishing these listed buildings will not make space for affordable housing; the properties will be bought by large developers who will then just make more large and expensive condos that no one can afford anyway.\nThis is NOT the right direction to go in making affordable housing. If the government wants to introduce more rigorous methodology to list or designate in the future that could be understood (if they made cultural elements a matter of discourse) but to erase those that are currently listed will NOT help anyone, and certainly won't make room for affordable housing.\nAgain, I am outraged, but unsurprised, that Ford's government took no time to consult with actual experts in the field who would be able to give a nuanced understanding to this situation. But this is the same government that tried to demolish an actual designated property in Toronto (the Dominion Wheel and Foundry) so I guess we shouldn't be surprised, but I am extremely disappointed in this \"minister of heritage\". He is NOT interested in protecting Ontario's heritage at all.\nSincerely,\nA concerned heritage professional\n",

The Bill 23, Schedule 6 proposal to amend the Ontario Heritage Act illustrates to me how some politicians and developers fail to educate themselves on how critical heritage resources are to the supply of affordable housing, lowering carbon emissions, and extending the lifespan of landfills. By annihilating the s.27 OHA Register, the management and evaluation of the potential for adaptive reuse of older housing stock (much of it small-scale, detached or multiple units, with food garden areas, in neighbourhoods with character); and the reuse of vacated industrial, commercial, and institutional buildings (ideal for conversion to small housing units) is being discounted. The corollary proposal to elevate to a Regulation the threshold for listing on the Register, confirms that the drafters of Bill 23 and the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism have no concept of how this will increase the cost and effort to simply compile a planning tool intended to quick identify a resource for future study. To remove a listed property from the Register at two years, with no renewal for five years, is poor asset management. Heritage conservation is not driven by a few who like the look of historic architecture and the stories they preserve. These qualities are the value-added of utilizing heritage resources. Schedule 6 should be removed from Bill 23. It is ill-conceived, short-sighted, and damaging to all Ontarians.\n",

I detail some of most egregious changes I object to.\nThe City of Ottawa recently completed an overhaul (with results available online) of its Heritage Register, which now lists about 4,000 properties. Listing properties in a transparent way was seen as an improvement over having to respond hastily when demolition of a potentially valuable property is proposed, by requiring a 60-day advance notice. The proposed changes will bring us back to the inefficient status quo ante.\nWhile several of the proposals would not be retroactive (i.e., apply only to listings or designations going forward), the obligation to remove a property from the Register (and inability to bring it back for 5 years) if a NOID under Part IV is not issued within two years would ensure that a large number of heritage properties will be lost. Even in a large city like Ottawa there simply is not the capacity to evaluate and process so many properties in the next two years. Ottawa currently brings forward 3 to 5 designations per year.\nIncreasing the threshold for designation under Part IV or V of the Act may be detrimental to equitable heritage conservation. In practice, the City of Ottawa staff currently recommends designation only when two criteria are met, but there should be room for exceptions. The proposal would take away that flexibility.\nAbility to issue a NOID following an application for a zoning or official plan amendment or plan of subdivision only if the property was already on the Register may lead to loss of heritage property.\nI object to the LGIC having the ability to disrespect Standards and Guidelines for Conservation of Heritage Properties if that could \"potentially advance\" certain provincial priorities.  The Standards and Guidelines should apply to all parties everywhere. The wording is extremely vague.\nLike the rest of Bill 23, the proposals amount to a gift to developers and show an appalling lack of respect for heritage values. They pretend to introduce efficiencies but in fact will have the opposite effect.\nSchedule 6 should be withdrawn.\n",

Say no to Bill 23 and go back to the drawing board.\nBill 23 proposes to gut protections for wetlands and the crucial role of Conservation Authorities in restricting development that will negatively impact watersheds. 60-90% of wetlands in Ontario have already been destroyed and the few left struggles to function under the stresses of urban growth and agriculture. We need to save all remaining wetlands and restore those lost.\nWetlands help prevent flooding, purify water, recharge aquifers, support endangered species and trap and store carbon. Wetlands provide these ecosystem services for free, and when we build on wetlands, we put people and property at risk. Taxpayers and homeowners have to pay more. This makes housing less affordable, not more.\nBill 23 proposes to allow more wetlands to be destroyed with so-called \u201coffsets.\u201d The ecosystem services that wetlands provide are tied to their location. You can\u2019t just drain a wetland in one place and compensate for it somewhere else. Wetlands don\u2019t prevent flooding locally if they\u2019re destroyed, and then new ones are built miles away.\nWetlands are complicated ecosystems that take decades to centuries to develop. Restored wetlands may never reach the biodiversity of natural ones, and most species at risk can\u2019t just move.\nIn 2021, Minister Steve Clark promised not to develop the greenbelt or consider a \u201cland swap,\u201d but the government is now proposing to break that promise and open up 7,400 acres for low-density development. Breaking promises like this right after the election erodes trust in the government. It will not solve the housing affordability crisis because most regions already have enough land allocated to development to meet their housing needs and low-density sprawl development isn\u2019t affordable housing.\nStop Bill 23, drop changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and honour the government\u2019s promise to protect the Greenbelt. We need cities that are livable, housing that is truly affordable and doesn\u2019t destroy wetlands, and nature that is accessible to everyone.\n",

        "comment":"The More Homes Built Faster Act proposes various changes to the Ontario Heritage Act. Three changes should be particularly alarming for Indigenous communities in the province: 1) New Section 25.2 (7) of the Act 'will authorize the Lieutenant Governor in Council to, by order, exempt the Crown, a ministry or a prescribed public body from having to comply with the heritage standards and guidelines in respect of a particular property, if the Lieutenant Governor in Council is of the opinion that such exemption could potentially advance one or more provincial priorities', such as housing, infrastructure, or any other priority that is deemed significant. In practice, this would mean that any lands of importance to an Indigenous community could be developed if it is in the interest of the province, regardless of protection at a municipal or provincial level.\n2) Several fundamental changes to the process of 'listing' properties on municipal registers have been outlined in the Build More Homes Faster Act. A register is a tool used by municipalities to trigger heritage assessments on properties that have been deemed to have potential heritage value but have not yet been assessed by the municipality. If the Act is passed thousands of properties currently understood to have potential value to communities, including Indigenous communities, will be removed from the register within two years, with no mechanism to evaluate and conserve their value if an alteration of the site is proposed. This could mean that development may occur on lands currently used as Indigenous hunting grounds, sites that serve as wayfinding points, harvesting grounds, and ceremonial sites that do not include burials. With no mechanism to object on grounds of cultural heritage, Indigenous communities may be left with few options for protection of these areas.\n3) A change is proposed to ensure fewer cultural resources are identified in the province, accomplished by raising the bar of evaluation under Ontario Regulation 9\/06. As proposed in the More Homes Built Faster Act, a cultural resource will be required to meet two criteria outlined in Ontario Regulation 9\/06, the tool used when evaluating cultural heritage in the province. This will mean that many heritage resources may not meet the threshold, even though they have value to a community. For Indigenous communities, this will result in a further loss of control over culturally significant spaces or places, which will be in danger of removal to privilege settler development.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23 has many merits. I agree that there is a need for housing and intensification in some parts of the province. I agree that we should work to remove development charges for affordable and subsidized housing projects\/units. I also agree that we can use our zoning bylaws to have more inclusion by allowing for increased density in areas zoned for single family dwellings.\nI am concerned about the lack of consideration for the climate crisis. Our planet is becoming unlivable and the impact of this bill will increase the carbon emissions and climate adaptations available re. residential homes. I do not think we should build on the green belt as it will undermine the ecosystems that protect future generations by sequestering carbon, replenishing water supplies, preventing flooding and creating habitat for many species of plants an animals. This policy seems to be proposed to enable the landowners in this area to become more enriched. This is not a policy that is about housing for all.\nI do not think the provincial government should be reducing so many of the development charges. This will make it hard for cities to pay the bills and build the infrastructure needed to support new housing projects.\nAlso, I do not agree that cities not be able to set sustainable development standards. This will mean that housing projects will further contribute to carbon emissions. Cities have few tools to reduce their carbon emissions and to meet their carbon reduction targets. By not allowing for expectations for reduced emissions from builders, our carbon footprint will continue to grow meaning our children and future generations will be suffering the consequences and saddled with cleaning up the mess of this decision.\nFinally, the bill should not have been proposed at a time when councils are in limbo. This prevents a democratic response from cities and other stakeholders to be meaninful contributors. I request that this bill's adoption be delayed to accommodate a proper response. I hope the provincial government will roll back some of the changes that will negatively impact our climate.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to you to express my concerns with Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act 2022 and the proposed legislative and regulatory amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act. Heritage in Ontario needs more protection, not less. Indeed, preservation and promotion of local history and heritage is essential for economic development, tourism, and the health of viable communities in Ontario. The Ontario Historical Society (OHS) first became concerned about the protection and maintenance of pioneer cemeteries in Ontario early in the 20th century, when it became apparent that many of them had fallen into a dilapidated state. Under regulations of the current Funeral, Burial and Cremation Services Act, 2002, the OHS must be given notice if a cemetery owner or operator intends to close (relocate) a cemetery. The OHS then has the right to make a submission to the registrar, on whether closure is in the public interest, and if the OHS disagrees with the registrar, we have the right to appeal to a tribunal. On June 2, 2011, in a meeting with Hon. John Gerretsen, the then-Minister of Consumer Services, the OHS officially presented the Government of Ontario with a database of unregistered or unlicensed cemeteries. The OHS receives no notification and holds no right of appeal with regard to unregistered historic cemeteries that owners seek to close and relocate for private interests.\nI do not oppose the building of affordable homes for the people of Ontario. However, I believes those homes should not be built on the graves of our ancestors. To protect all cemeteries and burial sites, I am asking this government to vote, recommending that the Government of Ontario register\/license all unregistered cemeteries in the Province of Ontario. Additionally, I ask this government to vote, recommending that the Government of Ontario designate all cemeteries in the Province of Ontario under the Ontario Heritage Act as properties of cultural heritage value in recognition of their sacred and historical significance to all the peoples of Ontario.\nIt is in the public interest that Ontario\u2019s cemeteries be protected, preserved, and maintained in their original locations.\n",

We have already lost so much.\nHaving municipalities needing to officially designate a heritage property within two years and then not allowing those that are not designated within that 2-year timeframe to be reincluded for at least five will make it more difficult to prevent these properties from being demolished. Hence we continue to lose more heritage properties.  Municipalities need the time to identify properties with heritage value, so that they can then include them in their heritage registry before formally beginning the process to designate. This is an important way to protect properties from being demolished without approval.  Many of these beautiful structures have lasted for over a century. I ask you how many homes are built these days to last that long.\nRequiring heritage districts to meet more stringent criteria is short-sighted and ill-advised as well.  There are better ways to go, we can do better to ensure we don't lose our heritage properties and districts which communities hold with pride and neighbourhood cohesion, all important aspects of healthy communities.\n",

The presentation focuses on just one of the many misguided proposals in Schedule 6 of the bill: increasing the number of criteria to be met for the protection of heritage properties. This simple change will effectively exclude many heritage places of importance to Indigenous, Black and other marginalized communities who celebrate their culture in this province.\nAttached also is ACO\u2019s full written submission on Schedule 6 to Bill 23. We urge you to read it.\nHere are the main points to consider:\n1.\tHeritage buildings and places provide a wealth of opportunities for use and development for housing and other purposes. To suggest that heritage inhibits housing misunderstands how our systems work. Heritage protections DO NOT RESTRICT USE.\n2.\tListing of heritage properties on heritage registers is a widely-used, transparent planning tool to flag heritage properties and provide limited (90 day) protection. The proposed changes to the listing mechanism, especially imposing a two-year expiry on listed properties, will effectively destroy the usefulness of listing. Tens of thousands of heritage properties will lose what small protection they have.\n3.\tThe increase in the threshold for designation from one criterion for heritage value to two is incoherent and contrary to international norms. As outlined in the power point presentation, this will have a disproportionate effect on BIPOC and other marginalized communities.\n4.\tChanges affecting the Standards and Guidelines for Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties give the government the power to interfere with the evaluation process for provincially owned heritage properties and exclude sites, such as Ontario Place and the Foundry in Toronto, from its own rules. Instead of leading by example, the government is opting for convenience and go-arounds.\nOverall, the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will have a devastating effect on the ability of Ontario\u2019s communities of all sizes and kinds to preserve and protect the places we cherish and hold dear. The multicultural impact, with its anti-inclusionary effects, alone is an embarrassment to the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism.\nThese proposals will have NO DISCERNIBLE EFFECT ON HOUSING STARTS and will increase uncertainty and unpredictability in land use planning decisions.\nACO strongly recommends that the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act be removed from Bill 23.\nThe government must genuinely consult with heritage organizations and municipalities before proposing further changes.\n",

        "comment":"The Conservative's Government rapid move to introduce Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, the day immediately following the municipal election, in many ways runs contrary to good planning and focuses on quantity over quality. It will also have a devastating effect on heritage conservation efforts.\nBill 23 proposes sweeping changes to how development will proceed in our city, beginning with the imposition of a housing target of 151,000 new homes through 2031. I suspect this number exceeds actual need related to projected growth.\nThe Bill has already passed Second Reading, without consultation other than in the GTA. Ottawa, the province's second largest city, has been left out of the discussion, although the same government sees it fit to provide the city's mayor with far-reaching authorities. Additionally, this omnibus Bill will require amendments to multiple statutes that will impact the Ontario Heritage Act, The Planning Act, and the Ontario Land Tribunal, among others.\nAmong its potentially devastating effects, Bill 23 will give Ministerial power to override heritage protection, cripple the Heritage Register by making it impossible to keep a property listed for more than two years, change the criteria required for heritage designation of buildings and districts, and eliminate third-party appeals to the Ontario Land Tribunal by community organizations and residents (only developers and municipalities will have that right).\nIn addition, Bill 23 will prohibit municipalities from seeking details about development projects through Site Plan Control on matters pertaining to sustainable design, building appearance and landscape features. These restrictions will encourage poor design that conflicts, rather than works with our streetscapes, and will surely have an impact on the City\u2019s ability to create attractive spaces and our collective responsibility to promote sustainable development. Further, the proposed complete exemption of Site Plan Control for development projects with 10 or fewer residential units will only exacerbate these outcomes.\nBill 23 will also allow the development of three units per residential lot in the city. Without Site Plan Control and other checks and balances, this type of development could significantly compromise  carefully prepared guidelines that protect designated heritage conservation districts, devastate non-designated heritage character areas, and negatively impact residential areas.\nThere is a need for increased housing in Ottawa, including in downtown neighbourhoods. There are many development opportunities in our communities, but development needs certain controls. In this way we will not lose the character of the neighbourhoods that drew us here in the first place.\nI do not believe that Bill 23 is the answer. I certainly do not support a Bill that has been developed without consultation with the people most affected by it \u2013 homeowners, tenants, local businesses, and the unhoused, among others.\n",

Through the More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022, the changes will include greater support to the housing crisis. One of the key components to Bill 23 is its requirement of municipal regions.

See my published views on this in the recent OHA+M blog article (supporting link to the article is noted below).\nWhile there may be one or two proposals for regulations that, if considered and developed carefully, could be of benefit to our heritage protection system, they are totally overshadowed by all the other deplorable proposals.

        "comment":"In our community we did not opt to place all of our recognized heritage properties onto the municipal registry in one blanket motion,  rather over the years one by one we evaluated each property using the provided regulations and guidelines.  We have completed roughly 100 out of the possible 850 properties.  It will take us many more years to complete.\nThose that passed two out of the three sections were nominated for designation under part iv.  Those that did not were placed on the municipal registry.  Those that did not pass any section were recorded and allowed to be demolished.\nA significant fact is that the present homeowners are consulted and their approval is required before the asset can be placed with council\u2019s approval onto the municipal list.\nThis work needs to continue and some of the proposed changes do not support this orderly effort in the conservation of our heritage assets.\nThe use of the municipal registry plays an important part in our community.  Each properties evaluation gives all, present and  future homeowners, municipal staff, and developers the information on the heritage assets located on the property.  This allows the treatment of those assets to be preserved.\nFor example homeowners when updating their home can choose to bring the home closer to its original heritage construction. Which may lead to the property passing the second section making it eligible for consideration for designation.\nWe have noticed that the developers try their best to preserve those heritage features on a property once they are listed on the municipal registry.  Their HIA\u2019s are more direct to those identified assets allowing for better decisions and planning for all.\nThe key is the identification of the property on the municipal registry along with those listed heritage assets that should be preserved as best as possible.\nRemoval of the evaluated properties from the municipal registry after five years would destroy this work and eliminate the proper listing of our cultural heritage assets.\nI can understand why this is proposed if just a blanket or properties without proper evaluation is being done. These properties, in my opinion, if not properly evaluated should be removed immediately from the municipal registry.\nBut if applied as it is proposed, hurts  and destroys the work of these heritage committees that have formed evaluation sub committees to work the municipal registry as it was intended to be used when the proposal was established years ago.\nThere are a number of heritage committees in the province that operate in this manner and do not use the municipal registry as a weapon against development but rather the way it was intended to be used when introduced many years ago.\nBest regards\nMy opinion from serving on heritage committees since the early days of LACAC\n",

        "comment":"As an Ontarian who has resided in various parts of the province, including the Kawartha Lakes area, Durham Region, and Niagara Region, I am vehemently against Bill 23 on all fronts. Firstly, it seeks to destroy precious wildlife and various diverse ecosystems such as wetlands and woodlands, by stripping the Conservation Authority of the ability to do their job. At a time when climate change action and wildlife conservation is at its most crucial to the preservation of the world, Bill 23 will launch the province into an environmental catastrophe. Altering the Planning Act so environmental protection is not longer a consideration is a massive step backward. People must learn to coexist with our surrounding ecosystems, not simply tear them down every time we are mildly inconvenienced. Housing can be built upward instead of outward.\nThis bill is also wildly undemocratic. You want to place more centralized power in the hands of greedy, profit-driven developers, and strip any and all influence from those who actually care about the long-term preservation of not only the environment, but also of society. Taking away the Conservation Authority\u2019s rights is an issue for reasons discussed above, but taking the public\u2019s right to engage with planning decisions regarding development that will directly impact their neighbourhoods is an absolute undermining of democracy. As a political science student who is aspiring to one day work in the world of government and politics in this Ontario, I am disgusted at the complete overhaul of democratic rights that accompanies this bill.\nNot only that, but the elimination of conservation authorities in the planning process will also make several jobs in that sector obsolete, which will result in the loss of many jobs. The goal of this bill is to provide a better life for Ontarians and make living more affordable, but it will strip many people of their livelihoods. So, where is the more affordable life for conservation and planning workers when you take their jobs away? I know a few of these workers, and they are currently supporting children, or just scraping by on the salaries that they have, and this bill has a strong potential to leave them with nothing.\nPlease rethink the implementation of Bill 23. It is short-sighted and has severe consequences, even outside of the environmental impacts it will have. Ontarians deserve to have affordable housing without the destruction of their environment and their livelihoods as hard-working people.\n",

        "comment":"Heritage Centre Wellington (HCW) Advisory Committee, comments regarding Bill 23\nThere are a number of proposals that HCW agrees with, however we also believe\nsome will adversely impact our municipality\u2019s ability to conserve our already\ndisappearing heritage resources. As a smaller community outside the Green Belt, we\nare currently experiencing severe development pressures to infill the heritage areas\nidentified within our Cultural Heritage Landscapes (CHL) and to accommodate high rise\ndevelopment within them as well.\nWe agree with the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario\u2019s characterization of this\nlegislation in their press release of Nov. 10th, 2022 \u201cAs a knee-jerk response to a\nvindictive attack by the development industry on our heritage system\u201d.\nOf particular concern, is the removal of all existing listed properties from a local\nHeritage Property Register after two years from proclamation if they have not been\ndesignated and not allowing them to be re-listed for an additional five years.\nAdditionally, regarding the increase of designation criteria from one to two criteria as it\nrelates to smaller towns and communities, it is apparent that we have less contextual\nlatitude to draw from then larger communities. We believe that a number of simple local\nheritage resources may be excluded from conservation which would otherwise serve to\ntell the story of the humble beginnings of our community if this provision is adopted.\nHCW supports the points raised by Community heritage Ontario in their detailed report\non Bill 23, and feels they have captured our concerns in a constructive manner. We\nhave included a copy of it in our supporting documents, as well as the press release\nfrom the ACO on Bill 23.\nMoreover, we concur that heritage resources do not need to detract from growth initiatives as we have a number of examples whereby local heritage buildings have been thoughtfully re-purposed to accommodate residential units. As well, the majority of our downtown heritage core buildings contain available residential units above main floor commercial enterprise.\nWe urge the Minister to take these comments and concerns into consideration, as we\nbelieve it is possible to meet the aims of this legislation without the sacrifice of\nirreplaceable aspects of our culture and heritage. In order to have vibrant and\nsustainable communities, we believe heritage planning and preservation can work hand\nin hand with thoughtful and sustainable growth under the current guidelines.\nOur heritage identity is essential in promoting tourism. In short, our heritage plays a major\nrole within any growth vision and cannot be disregarded or made subservient to\ndevelopment and unrestrained growth.\n",

        "comment":"Stevens Burgess Architects (SBA) has worked within the heritage industry for over forty years. As an architectural practice that specializes in heritage conservation, our firm has had the opportunity to participate in the industry from both a heritage planning\/conservation and a development perspective. Over these decades our projects have ranged from policy planning, heritage evaluations and assessments, and conservation plans to restoration, adaptive re-use, and conservation projects, many with an aim to provide new life or use to a building. This variety of experience and perspective has helped us develop an insight into the heritage framework of our province.\nThe proposed Bill 23 is draconian and threatens to dismantle the sensitive infrastructure in place in the industry based upon an ill-founded assumption that heritage is at odds with development, affordable housing, and community growth. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill and the range of changes to the Ontario Heritage Act that it forecasts has the potential to create more of a problem than it aims to solve.\nOur concerns broadly relate to equity, consultation, and transparency. More specifically, the following outlines the issues we think are the most problematic in the proposed changes:\nSection 27 \u2013 Two Year Maximum Timeframe for Listed Properties\n-\tThe Heritage Register will cease to be a repository of municipal or community information with respect to the heritage of that city or town, etc.. The removal of any Listed property not designated within two years curtails the ability to think flexibly about heritage. It forestalls conversation about the myriad of ways forward an owner or developer has with respect to alterations, renovations, or redevelopment. Heritage does not preclude development. Outdated zoning by-laws do. No consultation will be required prior to the removal of the property, which limits transparency and therefore limits great opportunities for collaboration.\n-\tThe lack of transparency and the changes to the register will burden smaller municipalities and rural communities. Heritage policy is not meant to be rigid, as this new Bill makes it, but something that can adapt to its particular context and take into account the rich complexities of our built form, our landscapes, and our embodied history.\n-\tChanges to the way the register is managed will equal a loss of information about many built form, which correlates to a loss of the historical record for a municipality with respect to its own heritage. Within the Register, there is evidence of the ways communities have valued properties over time. By making the register merely a planning tool, we lose the ability to understand nuance. It also makes the process far less transparent, which will lend to more issues and objections rather than fewer.\nSection 27 \u2013 Expanded Objections\n-\tThe expansion of an owner\u2019s ability to object to a property being Listed prior to July 2021 creates an onerous burden within the industry. There is a startling lack of information regarding upon what grounds an Owner might object. It is unclear of the process going forward and the ramifications within the industry not to mention the pressure on the currently over-burdened Ontario Land Tribunal.\nSection 29\n-\tThe criteria for designation are forecast to change under the new bill, a move that will curtail recent efforts to bring more diversity, accessibility, and inclusion into our understanding of heritage. Increasing the threshold from one to two criteria that must be met in order to be designated has the potential to perpetuate outdated and colonial-centric valuations of provincial heritage. The flexibility included in the current O. Reg. 9\/06 criteria creates an avenue for deeper understanding of the history of marginal groups, Indigenous communities, and even members of a lower socio-economic bracket. Value ought not to be ascribed to only excellence of architectural design because such a limited \u201cvalue\u201d perpetuates systemic racism and exclusion.\nSection 41\n-\tHeritage Conservation Districts (HCDs) will be subject to increased rigour and will require HCDs to meet the criteria under O. Reg 9\/06. The proposed changes to the way HCDs are handled is a good idea. We think, however, that HCDs should be treated differently than single, built form. There is an opportunity to create criteria that captures the nuances particular to landscapes or character areas that will help to create greater flexibility in the mechanisms by which we can conserve heritage, but also work with existing heritage areas.\nPart III - (7) Exemption re: compliance\n-\tThe exemption from compliance proposed that would grant the Lieutenant-Governor the authority to give leave to a ministry or prescribed public body to circumvent the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties for a property when doing so was deemed meritorious for the furtherance of one of a number of government initiatives is particularly alarming. It creates a veto power within the province that is unchecked and without balance. The other changes proposed under Bill 23 all indicate the need for criteria. Rigorous criteria ought to be developed for the use of this particular power so that a high threshold is in place before such authority might be granted.\nIn light of the above, we suggest that greater consultation occur to create meaningful changes to improve the heritage framework and that will also be to the benefit of all provincial objectives related to affordable housing. For example, the current suggestion that the Register needs to be made available and accessible online is an excellent example of a positive step that increases transparency within the heritage industry, as does the review of HCD plans. Rather than create more prescriptive policies with respect to heritage and planning that are counterintuitive to change, the government could look to empower greater creativity within the industry that encourages density, growth, and design excellence using resources already available. The more constriction is added, the greater the challenge to achieve change in a way that is forward-looking for our province.\nOther excellent groups have provided feedback to these changes such as the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, the Ontario Association of Heritage Professionals, the municipalities of Toronto, Ottawa, amongst others, as well as other colleagues. We lend our voices to this chorus and echo the request for greater consultation and for more careful consideration of the changes currently proposed.\nThis bill will make what is a consensus-building industry adversarial and stymie real efforts to manage provincial priorities while still respecting our past.\nYours sincerely\nJane Burgess, OAA, CAHP, MRAIC, APT\nKelly Gilbride, OAA, P.Eng., CAHP, LEED AP\nSheldon Kennedy, OAA, CAHP, LEED AP\nJulia Rady, PhD\n",

Our Board of Directors and membership consists of private and public sector professionals from across Canada with an interest and expertise in urbanism.\nAs the Province continues to grow,  it is important to be reminded of the need for quality in the manner in which we plan and design our communities.  Urban Design plays a crucial role in shaping the quality of our living environment. It involves many different disciplines including planning, development, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, economics, law and finance, among others.\nAs an organization and as professional practitioners, we recognize the dire need for greater housing affordability in Ontario and the need to take action to help address our current housing crisis.  We are strong believers in supporting intensification and the streamlining of planning processes to deliver housing across our communities but not at the expense of delivering complete, sustainable, and liveable communities.\nHousing affordability is a measure of economic prosperity. Quality design ensures the creation of complete communities that influence the economic success and diverse social fabric of a community.\nUrban design plays an important role in facilitating more housing through good design ensuring all housing is part of a healthy, complete, and attractive community that can and does co-exist and fit into its context. Conversely, bad design leads to public backlash hindering the provision of much needed housing.  In short, urban design can be used as a very effective tool to ensure quality, sustainable growth.\nBill 23 proposes extensive modifications to a number of Acts and regulations and if passed as proposed, in combination with Bill 109, these changes will hinder the ability of municipalities and practitioners to ensure that complete communities can be delivered across Ontario.\nCanU is concerned with the following provisions affecting urban design and ultimately the quality of life, of all Ontarians:\nChanges to the Heritage Act have missed the opportunity to ensure heritage conservation, preservation and re-used co-exists with growth in a manner that history and the uniqueness of a community is retained and used as a powerful place-making tool that is key in the design of vibrant communities.\n",

        "comment":"Why would one want to implement profound changes to the heritage act without public hearings and only seek public comment once this flawed legislation has been drafted? This issue was not fully presented or debated in the election  this past spring and the lack of consultation or vetting of this issue is fundamentally anti democratic. This legislation should be withdrawn & and all party committee of the Legislature should hold public hearings to propose new legislation.\nThe proposed changes fly in the face of the direction of enhanced heritage protection that have been developed over the years in Ontario, Canada & the western world. Protections of heritage structures has been an uphill battle for communities in the province for many years prior to the last changes to the heritage act & these proposed changes only make things worse. For example the replacement of the function of the Conservation Review Board with the non-expert Ontario Land Tribunal is but one example. Heritage preservation as an encumbrance to development is a lie that is only fed by those who lack a understanding of the many reasons that heritage preservation is important.\nWere this a serious effort to improve access to the construction of new housing vis a vis the Heritage act, a place to start would have been to address the issue of demolition by neglect. Demolition by neglect has removed large numbers of housing, many of them heritage resources from the housing inventory of the province over the years as buildings fall into disrepair and ultimately become a safety hazard and often the target of arsonists. The province developing a policy that would addressed demolition by neglect, would rapidly put many homes back into the housing inventory. Not addressing this item alone, proves the lie that this proposed legislation is about housing.\nThe premise that Designation & Heritage Registers are somehow delaying construction of housing is frankly another lie. Several examples in our community abound where demolition of properties on the Heritage Register have occurred and the property site sits vacant months after demolition. The result of these demolitions, (under the current rules) means no new homes being built, and formerly occupied homes being torn down. If some of these changes are made, demolition permits will essentially become a right, and the trend described will become a much more common practice.\nReading the proposed changes, it is clear to the reader that making heritage preservation more difficult is the goal of these proposed changes. Heritage conservation trends, policies, and registers have been developed by communities by the popular will with approval across the province over decades. The proposal to essentially dissolve Heritage registers in two years flies in the face of the democratic popular will of communities across the province. As not every property on a Heritage Register is a number one priority & municipal heritage budgets are finite, Heritage Registers are an important tool that allows for communities to evaluate a property based on development pressures. Presently, Proscribed Events require municipalities to work with the property owner and in the case of a demolition application, to have a property on a register jump the queue to evaluate if the property is worthy of designation or not. The proposed changes will essentially do away with this ability. This one change will further negatively impact municipal heritage budgets as resources will have to be focused on ramping up work on Heritage Registries over the next two years rather than already partially completed goals and disrupting years long work plans. This will result in further stressing available resources. For these & other reasons, changes to Heritage registers should be removed from this proposed legislation.\nIncreasing the threshold for designation is an exercise in foolishness. Most properties that have a NOID publish often meet two or  more criteria but there are always going to be outliers. Having flexibility on this issue is a matter that allows for some properties to be designation based on one criteria that a community agrees merits designation.  Increasing the threshold for designation should be removed from this proposal as it removes this flexibility.\nOne must ask why new regulations for the development of HCD\u2019s is required. HCD\u2019s are already a long and costly process, and are not undertaken without community consultation, and underlying heritage elements being present. Adding more regulations to the HCD process is yet another example of increasing costs to municipalities and so the reference to change the rules for HCD\u2019s should be removed.\nIn conclusion, this legislation seems designed not to allow for consideration by the many impacted, nor were the the more retrograde elements of this legislation proposed during the past Spring's election. In the interest of actually achieving the stated goal of  building of more housing stock, there should be a pause and a full public debate be implemented prior to any changes being considered in new legislation.\n",

This silly idea that listed buildings have to be designated within two years of listing utterly doesn\u2019t understand the concept. The notion that listed properties suddenly taken off the list will be part of a serious housing shortage is utter nonsense. Please eliminate the two year designate or delist portion of the bill.\n",

This is not appropriate as the provincial government can't possibly be familiar enough with the local intricacies of land use, cultural relevance or any number of other factors determining how properties should be used. This legislation seems like a blunt instrument designed to bully past local planning groups and push forward the interests of land developers.\nAlso, and perhaps most concerning is the lack of any sort of reference to consultation with Indigenous Peoples on usage of land. There can be no determination of the historical significance of a site without adequate consultation with Indigenuous Peoples as they are much more aware of the history of the land in so called Ontario.\n",

We request that the Province consider our comments and the negative impact the proposed changes will pose to all municipalities, especially smaller rural municipalities.\nNew Requirements for Municipal Registers and the Inclusion of Non-Designated Properties on the Municipal Register\n\u2022\tThe Town has no concerns with requiring municipalities to make an up-to-date version of the information on the municipal register available on municipal websites, given municipalities are given sufficient time to complete this task. Given the volume on listed projects and limited staffing within small municipalities, we would request the timeframe be amended from 6 months to 12 months.\n\u2022\tThe Province is proposing to allow property owners to object to the inclusion of their non-designated property on the municipal register regardless of when it was added to the municipal register. If a non-designated property has existed on a municipal register for many years, we request that the property owner provide a Heritage Impact Assessment to remove the property from the municipal register.\n\u2022\tThe Town is supportive of applicant-initiated removal from the municipal register within settlement areas, however does not support the automatic removal of non-designated properties from the register if they are not designated within 2-years of the amendment coming into force.\nAn Increase in the Threshold for Designation of Individual Properties and New Limitations on Designation for Properties Subject to Proposed Development\n\u2022\tThe Town of Erin is predominately a rural agricultural community that strives to protect and preserve its cultural heritage. The Town is not supportive of losing buildings and structures with cultural heritage value or interest in its rural areas. As the goal of the proposed More Homes Built Faster Act is to reduce the barriers that slow down housing construction, it would be most appropriate to limit changes to areas identified for growth, as per the Growth Plan (i.e. Settlement Areas).\n\u2022\tThe Town does not have the resources (either financial or staffing) to issue Notices of Intention to Designate, as notices require a Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) to be completed. The Town does not have in-house expertise in heritage related matters, and therefore would be required to hire a heritage consultant to complete each HIA and assist with the designation process. Consider placing the onus on the property owner to provide a Heritage Impact Assessment to remove their property from the municipal register.\n\u2022\tIn addition, the Town has been unsuccessful in finding heritage consultants who are able to complete a HIA within the current 60 day review period for requests to demolish structures that are currently listed within the Municipal Register. Increasing timelines would help municipalities to obtain a Heritage Impact Assessment on properties which have provided a Notice of Intention to Demolish.\n\u2022\tIf permitting applicant-initiated removal from the Register, municipalities should be provided the ability to set minimum submission requirements to reduce for such an application, to reduce the financial burden placed on municipalities.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact me by email (Jack.Krubnik@erin.ca) or by telephone (519.855.4407 Ext. 253).\nSincerely,\nJack Krubnik, MLA, OALA, MCIP, RPP\nDirector of Planning & Development\nTown of Erin\n",

        "comment":"I am frankly shocked and dismayed by this legislation.  It will do nothing to help people find affordable housing when you are allowing developers to build on the green belt - this area will have large, estate-like homes.  Anyone in an affordable housing situation cannot live hours from their work either.  You do understand most people do not have cottages and big homes like Ford does.  The lack of rationale for the removal of land, which previously met Greenbelt criteria, undermines the value of existing laws, based on whim rather than rigour.\nYou proposing take away the right to consult by indigenous peoples who are the best land protectors.  This law may be held up in court for years.  Ontario, as the Crown, has a legal obligation to consult with Aboriginal peoples where it contemplates decisions or actions that may adversely impact asserted or established Aboriginal or Treaty Rights (court cases: Haida, 2004; Taku River, 2004; Mikisew Cree, 2005) .   This obligation now includes: formal notice, information, peer-review funding, and accommodation of the concerns raised during consultation. Further, that cumulative effects\nare the proper subject of consultation, and that private interests risk delayed projects by a\nfailure to consult (court case: SON, 2017).\nThe other shock is the loss of very environmentally important green land.  Once it is destroyed, it cannot come back.  The endangered species are gone FOREVER.  You can't replace an acre of green belt with an acre close to a city - it is laughable.  Wetlands are of vital importance for the role they play in purification of water, the regulation of flood waters, and the habitat for water creatures. Changing the way these are defined risks undermining both their cultural and economic significance for Indigenous communities.  Be ready to pay out millions in flood damage relief once the green belt is gone because floods will be bigger in the cities than you can even imagine.\nI respectfully advise the Government of Ontario to pause in its efforts on Bill 23 and\ndelay its third reading until such time as consultation with First Nations, as rightsholders and treaty partners, has been adequately conducted.  Or there will be court challenges which will suck up more tax payer dollars and every court case this government has fought, they have lost.\nThank you for listening.  Do the right thing.  Make your children and grandchildren respect you, not hate you for destroying the Earth.\n",

        "comment":"a.\tMaximum Two-Year Listing Requirement\nThe proposed changes to the Act will institute a maximum 2-year period for which properties can be Listed on the Heritage Register. Municipalities will be given 2 years to designate all buildings currently Listed. There are nearly 4,000 Listed properties in the City of Toronto. Each individual (Part IV) designation requires substantial research and a report to City Council. It is completely unreasonable for the City of Toronto\u2019s Heritage Preservation Services to write nearly 4,000 heritage designation reports in the next two years. This proposal can therefore be viewed as an attempt to purge nearly 4,000 buildings from the Heritage Register. Heritage Listed buildings do not stop redevelopment. There is no onus on the owners of listed properties, as they are only required to provide the City with 60 days\u2019 notice if they intend to demolish the building. Heritage buildings can and have been incorporated into housing developments on numerous occasions. The proposed mass listing purge is a pointless initiative that will result in the unnecessary destruction of Ontario\u2019s built heritage while failing to create housing.\nb.\tMultiple Designation Criteria Requirement\nFor a building to be designated it must meet one of the three criteria; Architectural, Cultural and Contextual. The proposed changes require buildings to meet a minimum of two criteria. This is a change which will make it more difficult to designate buildings, and lead to the destruction of buildings with heritage value, if they only meet one of the three criteria.\nc.\tThe proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will create chaos at municipal planning departments and result in the destruction of buildings which are both currently listed and buildings which merit designation. The proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will not create new housing. In addition to creating urgency to designate all listed buildings, the Bill will place an additional hurdle to designation, as two criteria will need to be satisfied to designate each building.\n",

Council for the municipality is submitting the following comments and resolution, regarding the proposed Bill 23 changes to the multiple legislations.\nWith these proposed changes several powers will be removed from local elected councils, including controls for design and development of the municipality.  The burden will be placed on the existing taxpayers to cover costs of development. The changes proposed under the Development Charges Act puts more burden on growth in small and rural communities. Existing tax base cannot be responsible for future growth and costs associated with increasing infrastructure needs as the reduction of the development charges will delay the implementation of required infrastructure for a community.\nBoth the phasing in of development charges and the removal of collection for affordable housing hinders councils\u2019 ability to provide new growth, as the collection of development charges will be prolonged and not assigned to projects as required and needed. Rural municipalities do not have sufficient tax base to deal with the capacities required with new growth. The further requirement of spending or allocating 60% of collected fees restricts the current timelines created by municipalities for the current planned infrastructure upgrades.\nThe inclusion of accessory residential units within communities further restricts elected councils\u2019 control toward planning requirements. This can create different issues within a community and removes the public and council from consulting to ensure there is no potential impact on how development and intensification can occur, including the limitations of existing capacity for communities.\nChanges to the heritage plans and districts for communities to include all properties under the heritage act is onerous for rural municipalities. This function will require more time and finances for heritage committees and municipalities to review with owners and a more appropriate amount of time should be considered to allow for these functions to happen.\nIncreased investments and support to municipalities should be considered by the province to accommodate the anticipated development goals required to allow for increased housing supply to communities. Bill 23, as presented, fails to address the stated goals of an increasing housing supply. Changes to the development charges legislation is not an appropriate means to create more growth as the planned projects may be postponed to not allow for growth as required.\nThe passage of Bill 23 More Homes Built Faster Act, should be deferred to allow for appropriate and fulsome feedback from municipal governments, including the consultation with other pertinent bodies including ROMA, AMO, OPPI, and Conservation Ontario.\nCouncil Resolution:\nTHAT Council receives this Bill 23 \u2013 More Homes Built Faster Act Report and attachments for information purposes;\nAND THAT Council direct staff to compose a commenting letter to the Premier of Ontario Doug Ford, Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark, Local MPP Lisa Thompson, and all other Ontario municipalities stating concerns regarding the following points under the proposed Bill 23 More Homes Built Faster Act Changes to various other acts and regulations;\nAND THAT Council strongly recommends that substantial Provincial investment be provided to support municipalities to fund anticipated infrastructure upgrades to accommodate new development goals and growth, and compensate for decrease of development charge funding opportunities as outlined in the proposed legislation;\nAND THAT Bill 23 as presented, fails to address the stated goals of increasing housing supply, housing affordability and improved process and instead will result in the loss of environmental protections, parklands, heritage conservations, urban design and accountability to the public;\nAND THAT the removal of development charge collection for affordable housing removes councils\u2019 ability to plan for future growth of services with less monies available, and the cost of services and expansion becomes a burden of the taxpayers;\nAND THAT the phasing of development charges over 5 years reduces councils\u2019 ability to provide for future growth within the municipality, as the collection at reduced rate from the calculation will slow the ability to allow for more housing and growth within the municipality;\nAND THAT the requirement to spend 60% of the collection of development charges towards water, wastewater and road services on an annual basis erodes the ability for council to plan for future growth, as the monies calculated can not be targeted for specific projects. Further this function will only delay responsibilities of some local governments and may create increased development charges in future years;\nAND THAT the inclusion of Accessory Residential Units in all serviced residential areas further erodes the local governments control on developing communities, as this may create different issues within a community or a municipality. Maintaining the existing use of local control with the zoning bylaw allows for appropriate growth based on community needs;\nAND THAT the updating of heritage plans and districts to include all properties to be designated under the heritage act is onerous and difficult for small rural councils. A more appropriate amount of time should be considered so that all heritage properties can be reviewed with property owners to ensure the properties are protected as required.\nAttachments:\nBill 23 More Homes Built Faster Act Report\nSincerely,\nChandra Alexander\nManager of Corporate Services\/Clerk\n",

For example, easements could be applied to properties that currently have greenspace and trails, or properties that form part of the public view-space, such as those adjacent to parks, trails, and beaches. The main point is that if property owners are willing, they can approach Councils to create easements so that the \"heritage attributes\" of the property (which include recreational, aesthetic, natural and scenic interest) are protected for the long term.\nThis mechanism of protecting the environmental aspects of our Ontario heritage must not be weakened by the proposed More Homes Built Faster legislation.\nProperties with recreational, aesthetic, natural, and scenic interest typically include a percentage of undeveloped land, and that land has characteristics of microclimate, flora, fauna, subsurface ecology, and drainage that can be destroyed by modern development. Easements and covenants can protect such features. There are proven positive health impacts of natural landscapes (such as improved mental health, and faster recovery times after illness or surgery), and there are proven negative impacts of development (such as climate change, heat islands, surface runoff, downstream flooding, polluted bodies of water, and loss of biodiversity).\nThe mechanism of easements and covenants in the existing Ontario Heritage Act is one of the few options open to property owners who value the natural heritage aspects of their properties, which in many cases they have spent money, effort, and even lifetimes caring for. Many property owners want their land protected for future generations.\nAll of us should be doing more to protect natural heritage for the future. We should not be drafting legislation that makes it easier to destroy our natural heritage.\n",

My parents were born in 1916 and 1919 and throughout their lives they worried about the future of farming: availability of good farm land to grow the needed food for our communities and to share round the world. Our small farms are the backbone of the good, healthy life we live in Ontario.\nThe Green Belt needs to be protected or there will not be enough good farm land for the next generations. There are lots of places in the province, away from the Great Lakes region where there is clay and stone and more undesirable land. That's where you build housing, not on our rich clay loam and sandy loam soils.\nEven the wind turbines that are to be part of our energy future, took big swaths of farmland out of production. The rhythm of these behemoths has even driven the worms from the soil. This taking of our good agricultural land in one way or another must stop. You, Premier need to be the person who saves our farming and food future, not the person who kills it.\nThe local people in each town and municipality know the needs of their citizens better than any outside source. They need to be consulted and they need to be part of the future of land development and land conservation. It is the right of every citizen of this province and of this country.\nWe also need to protect our heritage buildings. They won't be built again. They can be repurposed and all future generations can be amazed at the plain or ornate composition that the people of the past lived in and called home. There should not be a simple 2 year hold on these buildings as it takes time to find people who will steward the buildings and restore or redetermine their state of use. An owner need only give 60 days notice of demolition and the dreams of keeping our heritage buildings for the following generation is lost forever.\nHeritage cemeteries are another area in danger of disappearing with Bill 23. It is a basic human right to have a safe and secure burial location. These sacred locations should never be disturbed, moved elsewhere or be built upon.\nMy family have lived in what became Ontario, since 1792. We are founding citizens and in my opinion, our rights to our land has never been more superseded, ignored and stripped away than with this Bill than in the days when we arrived, after the American Revolution, when we lost everything.\nIt is your duty as our elected head of the province to see that Bill 23 is very wrong and damaging in many ways. I respectfully ask that you remove this Bill from becoming law immediately.\n",

        "comment":"Comments for Environmental Registry of Ontario\nNov.  23, 2022\nThe Frontenac Heritage Foundation is a volunteer based not for profit organization which has been protecting built heritage in the Kingston region for fifty years. Our view is that if there was ever a downtown that should be protected, the built heritage in the first capital of Canada would be one to protect.\nThe Bill 23 changes to the OHA introduced are draconian, and brought to the fore by Michael Ford, the new \u2018minister of heritage\u2019, the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism, who as it happens, is the nephew of the Premier.\nFrom our review, the Foundation notes what appears to be a unilateral view that Schedule 6 of the proposed Bill 23 will fundamentally and negatively change heritage planning in this Province.\nThe November 10 Media Release from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario (ACO)  describes the Bill 23 changes to the OHA as dropping a bomb into the Province\u2019s Heritage System, as shown at this link: https:\/\/acontario.ca\/show_news.php?nid=80  As the ACO media release says, \u201cTwo of the (Bill 23) proposals stand out. Forcing communities to drop \u2018listed\u2019 properties from their heritage registers if they are not designated in two years and requiring that the standard for designation of properties be hiked from at least one of Ontario\u2019s heritage criteria to two.\u201d  Both suggestions are needlessly onerous, and would force the re-think of hundreds of hours of analysis, by volunteers and staff, of properties on the municipal register.\nThe Community Heritage Ontario (CHO) umbrella group representing over 150 municipal heritage committees across the Province provided a ten-page analysis of the problems with the Bill 23. (https:\/\/uploads.documents.cimpress.io\/v1\/uploads\/c8c1b9ea-de2f-4e1f-963\u2026)\nVirtually the only item that the CHO supports is how Schedule 6 would deal with the fact that the OHA is silent on amending heritage districts. While this might be viewed as a positive move, the FHF expresses reservations about how such an amendment may be abused \u2013 and this comes from a municipality where a 23-storey tower was endorsed by City Council within a stone\u2019s throw of the NHS-designated City Hall.  The Foundation has concerns about how such amendments to heritage districts might be abused within the Market Square HCD surrounding City Hall, which is being considered for expansion in a heritage sensitive downtown, the Barriefield Village, the oldest heritage district in the Province, as well as the 550-building district plan in the Old Sydenham area located next to our heritage-rich Queen\u2019s University.\nThe Ontario Historic Society (since 1888) a not-for-profit charity, speaks on behalf of over 500 affiliated groups across the Province. They too, have made a submission to the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy, in which the economic importance of heritage designation is articulated, and that it is in the public interest to protect, preserve and maintain Ontario\u2019s cemeteries.\nIt is a curious thing that the Ford Government has not figured out that the Heritage Act is as much to protect them as it is to protect our built treasures. (The same holds for conservation lands.)  The OHA provides a guardrail for governments to claim they are protecting our built heritage interests.  After years of delegating assorted wide-ranging powers to municipalities, the about face by the Ford Government is an affront to municipalities which have been carefully and diligently protecting built heritage by developing their municipal registers, continuing the listing and designation process reflected on their municipal registers, and implementing and updating heritage district plans.\nThe government's self narrative is that heritage designation is unpopular. Owners of our precious built heritage in Kingston take tremendous pride in their buildings as is evidenced by the Foundation\u2019s annual awards ceremony which acknowledges owners and the trades people who take great pride in their properties.\nThe Frontenac Heritage Foundation therefore recommends that Schedule 6 of Bill 23 be deleted in its entirety from Bill 23.\nMany thanks for your time and consideration.\nShirley Bailey, President, Frontenac Heritage Foundation\n",

Laurie Scott, Chair\nThe Hon. Laura Mae Lindo, Vice Chair\nMembers Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy\nWhitney Block, Room 1405\n99 Wellesley Street W Toronto, ON M7A 1A2\nDear Chair Scott, Co-Chair Lindo, and Members of the Standing Committee,\nRE: Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022: Ontario Heritage Act -- Proposed Amendments\nI am a land owner with a dwelling on it in the town of Southampton (pop. 3700-4000 approx.), part of the Municipality of Saugeen Shores on Lake Huron.\nFor four generations my family has been an intimate part of Southampton, first as vacationing tourists and then as landowners. We love and have loved Southampton from our first visit. We prize its walkability, its many opportunities for activity and socialization and for the immediacy of the natural world including the sand beaches and Lake Huron. And for its undeniable charm! The charm is a combination of original homes and cottages built by the first settlers to Southampton and the later Victorian influenced homes and commercial premises such as the Walker House, 150 years young and still going strong serving the public as a hotel. As well, there are four churches that face each other on four corners at one intersection of High Street, a testament to the deep faith that guided and sustained our founders, a townhall whose bell tower and clock commemorated the young men who enlisted in World War I and a railway station that connected the town with the south - all of which express the architecture of their time and what was significant and utilitarian to these people. Since then, two major developments borrowed from our past architecture to create attractive homes that echo these themes.\nIt is with dismay and shock to read the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations! I am baffled by the amendments and the lack of understanding as to how an economy like Southampton\u2019s actually works.\n1.\tThe Numbers\na.\tHow does dismantling the heritage register create new housing? One listed place is torn down and one place is built on the same site. How is that adding \u201cmore\u201d homes? I do say \u201cone place\u201d, because in the older parts of the town that single house is replaced by another single house. Secondly, these new-builds are not \u201caffordable housing\u201d by any stretch of the imagination as the real estate listings clearly prove.\nb.\tSaugeen Shores, of which Southampton is a small part, has approximately 4,400 residential properties in total.  Of those, 105 are listed on the Saugeen Shores Heritage Register. That is less than 2.3% of all the residential properties in Saugeen Shores. Southampton has 43 listed properties and represents less than 1% of the housing stock. To insist that developers be allowed to demolish these 43 properties or even 105 will not create much of a difference, particularly as they are not likely to be affordable.\nc.\tMoreover, Bruce County projects that there will be a surplus of 1330 residential units in Saugeen Shores in the next 25 years. Bruce County\u2019s chart highlights the numbers.\nThese numbers make it clear that \u201cmore homes built faster\u201d is completely unnecessary in our situation.\nDevelopers have many options in Southampton and Saugeen Shores on sites that do not have heritage merit on which to build truly affordable and varied housing projects. There is also a continuing infill movement and the development of scrub land. A good many developers are way ahead of this Bill and good for them.\n2.\tThe Economy\nWith the decline of the fishery and the furniture industries, Southampton\u2019s economic base eroded. However, the business and civic community realized that instead they could build a tourism industry based on the historical ambience of the town and the access to Lake Huron to generate new jobs to replace the lost ones and, therefore, to create a means of generating new revenues for the town.\nThe Southampton Business and Professional Association has used the historical elements and buildings such as The Market to attract the tourists. Businesses cater to our visitors, cottagers and seniors whether it is a scoop of ice cream, a high-end meal, a bed and breakfast in a romantic Victorian mansion or a true rustic cottage. These businesses often are also the first opportunity for young people to enter the working world. Not only that, we have an influx of retirees who have chosen to reside here because of the town\u2019s character and the other elements I have mentioned above.\nTo create a carte blanche permission to destroy homes and buildings that drive the Southampton economy without an examination as to what is to be destroyed, in my eyes, is disrespectful to the existing history of Southampton and definitely not a positive prospect for the people who earn their livelihood here through tourism and the influx of retirees.\n3.\tWho We Are\nTo walk the streets in the \u201coldest port on the Bruce\u201d is to walk in the footsteps of the early settlers - builders, fishers, farmers, carpenters, seamstresses, etc. To see the railway station is to see one instance of their craftmanship, hard work, and entrepreneurship. There are many more. Many streets and lanes bear the names of citizens who were leaders of their time. We can see who these people were who built the infrastructure and the community with imagination and drive. We have benefitted from their labour and stand on their shoulders.\nAnd how do we honour these people who built this port into a unique and thriving community? Shall we now destroy what they built with their bare hands in the name of expediency? Shall we put their work into the jaws of a bulldozer to be crushed and discarded and so wipe away the traces of their existence?\nTo do so is to wipe away our heritage, to shred our roots, to bury who we are. After all, part of who we are is rooted in the people before us, whether they were they low or high.\n4.\tPlans and Drawings\nThe Act proposes that plans and drawings that show the exterior design of a new building, including its character, scale, appearance, and design features, will no longer have to be submitted for approval. In fact, the Act would specifically add exterior design to the list of matters expressly excluded from site plan control.\nTo disregard matters such as scale and exterior design is to invite a mishmash of designs, some of which would be jarring in the context of the unique ambience of old Southampton. It would be a flagrant disregard of the unique character of the west side of Southampton. Moreover, such a parachuting into the midst of the established streetscape would not honour our history and our predecessors and diminish the attractiveness of our town to potential retirees.\n5.\tHistorical Value and the List\nIt takes research to deduce if a site is of historical value. And it takes time. Saugeen Shores does not have the kind of money needed to engage researchers and depends mainly on volunteers to carry out such work. How many researchers are there in a town of under 4000 souls?  Yet this bill expects Southampton to complete the research in two years and then, in what appears to me a punitive strike, will not allow a site to be re-listed before 5 years have elapsed \u2013 enough time to raze the approximately 100 sites that Saugeen Shores has listed?\nThe restrictions and hurdles that this bill would impose on listing sites are unfair and draconian. A small town like Southampton does not have the means to meet these requirements. This is a deliberate attempt to stifle any conservancy.\nWhy is our history held in such low esteem?  Why is so little funding extended to research our history? Canadians spend millions visiting other countries who are proud to show off their historic places. Why are we not proud of the  accomplishments of our settlers and entrepreneurs?\n6.\tDemocracy\nI also find it disturbing how Bill 23 usurps the roles and powers of our elected officials. We vote for our local politicians because they have an intimate knowledge and relationship to the town and its people. They are in the best position to draw appropriate plans to meet provincial goals. And they have been doing that diligently! What is the use of an Official Plan when the province simply overrides what local people have studied and developed that meets the interests and needs of the local people and their future? How much money has been wasted on Official Plan development that could have been used for other needs? Such treatment of our elected officials and the people they represent, while not perhaps intended, is an overreach of the province\u2019s power and shows a high disregard of the town\u2019s people.\nIn conclusion, there are many places in Ontario, unique in their own way which will also lose their history and have their tourism income chipped away. If we have nothing to show to visitors and to experience people will go elsewhere. Bill 23 takes a cookie-cutter approach to housing and assumes conditions are identical everywhere. That is not the Ontario that I know. Southampton is not Toronto which is not Thunder Bay, which is not Kingston or Picton or Wawa and so on. It is time to re-think what has been proposed.\nRespectfully, I urge you to consider my concerns which I share with many others. Let us meet the goals of Bill 23 in a way that is collaborative and sensitive to the specifics of Southampton and every other municipality of this varied and huge province.\nA very concerned Southamptoner and Ontarion.\n.\n",

        "comment":"Municipal Registers\n\u2022\tThe requirement that municipal registers be provided online makes sense and aligns with current best practice.\n\u2022\tThe change to the objection process by allowing any owner of a property to object at any time will waste Council and staff time at the municipal level by potentially inundating Councils with these requests without the requirement to provide studies or background information that would provide a rationale as to the owner\u2019s request.\n\u2022\tIncreasing the standard for listing a property by applying Ontario Regulation 9\/06 aligns with current practice in some municipalities where there are staff and resources to support this work. However, this will be a challenge for smaller municipalities which do not have dedicated staff to undertake this type of work and evaluation and may now be required to hire external help to undertake heritage evaluations, even for listed properties.\n\u2022\tThe requirement to remove a listed property from the register after two years if a NOID has not been issued and prohibition from adding it again for five years will actively make it more difficult for municipalities to protect cultural heritage resource which are important to their residents and property owners. This will result in huge numbers of property being unprotected for years at a time as they cycle on and off the register, which will also waste staff and Council time removing and re-listing properties over and over again. There is not the capacity in municipalities to designate every listed property they have within two years, but this is what the province appear to be directing through this legislative change.\n\u2022\tMunicipalities will attempt to designate as many properties as possible to prevent their heritage protection from lapsing, and this will be done primarily without owner consent or engagement as the timeline is so short and the province is forcing the hand of Councils, Municipal Heritage Committees and staff. This places a substantial burden on listed property owners but the province is leaving municipalities little choice but to forge ahead. The appeals process will mean that many of these designations will end up at the Ontario Land Tribunal, likely creating further backlog and slowing the development process even further by forcing the Tribunal to address huge numbers of designations of listed properties.\n\u2022\tFurther, the forcing of municipalities to designate listed properties is an extremely poor way of involving communities in the preservation of their own heritage. Many municipalities across Ontario actively work with property owners to list their properties with the understanding that they will remain as listed properties; this is often what a property owner feel comfortable with and listing provides a good middle ground with limited red tape between designation and no heritage protection that people feel positive about. Listing is an important process that serves a purpose beyond tying the hands of developers, which this legislation treats it as. Many municipalities tell their heritage property owners that listing is not a stepping stone to designation \u2013 because it has not been \u2013 and these amendments make liars of staff, municipal heritage committees and Councils who have worked diligently with their community members to protect and preserve the things that make their communities unique and desirable places to live, work and play.\nIndividual Designation\n\u2022\tThe increase in threshold for designations will make designating properties more difficult for municipalities, particularly those which may have only architectural or historical value but still may be highly significant to a community. It creates less flexibility for municipalities to protect their owner resource based on their understanding of their own communities within the provincial framework.\n\u2022\tThe new requirement that a property must be listed in order to be designated after prescribed Planning Act events is clearly an active attempt to prevent municipalities from protecting properties of cultural heritage value through the land use planning process. Given the new requirements for the removal of a property from the Register after two years and prohibition on re-listing it for another five, this will lead to municipalities having to guess at what properties might have a Planning Act application coming forward for them and listing properties accordingly as opposed to in a transparent, methodical and data driven way. While this intends for the development process to be more transparent, it makes it more difficult and less transparent for everyone involved as municipalities will rush to list properties to ensure that the conditions can be met when a Planning Act application is forthcoming, as opposed to taking a measured and long term approach to listing. This will make it more difficult for municipalities to meet their obligations under the Provincial Policy Statement and other relevant planning policy that directs the preservation of cultural heritage resources as part of the land use planning process.\nHeritage Conservation Districts\n\u2022\tThe requirement for heritage conservation districts to meet a threshold through prescribed criteria creates predictability with regard to evaluation and consistency for municipalities and is a positive change in the legislation. However, the use of Ontario Regulation 9\/06 is not appropriate as it is heavily tailored for individual property evaluation and lacks the nuance required to articulate the cultural heritage value found in larger cultural heritage landscapes. It would be advisable to develop new criteria for this purpose. A sample criteria used by a number of municipalities for HCD designation is attached as a separate document. These criteria build on Ontario Regulation 9\/06 and expands it to include additional criteria to better reflect how heritage conservation districts are understood and evaluated and how they function as cultural heritage resources. A new regulation should be adopted with new criteria specific to HCD evaluation.\n\u2022\tAt present, there are many heritage conservation districts in development across the province including those where the study has been completed and the plan is in progress, but the designating by-law has not yet been brought forward. The MCM should consider that the new evaluation criteria should only apply to those HCDs where the plan phase has not yet been initiated by Council (i.e. those still undergoing study) to prevent municipalities from having to go back and amend already completed heritage conservation district studies which use different, older criteria as this would be a waste of staff time and municipal resources.\n\u2022\tThe ability to amend or repeal an HCD by-law and plan is a positive addition to the Act. However, the development of the processes should include extensive consultation with municipalities to ensure that they are not burdensome or subject to frivolous requests by third parties to amend or repeal and by-law that does not suit them.\n",

        "comment":"City of Kitchener comments attached and summarized below\nKitchener continues to be a leader in Ontario and has already undertaken some of the work that Bill 23 seeks to achieve:\n\u2022\tKitchener\u2019s Development Services Review was acknowledged by yourself in announcing the changes proposed by Bill 23. We are proud of our successes in streamlining development approvals and have seen tremendous results.\n\u2022\tKitchener Council recently approved a $2 million fund to pay development charges for affordable housing and in August 2022 through Council\u2019s approval of a parkland dedication bylaw, exempted parkland dedication requirements for affordable housing. I fully support Bill 23 changes to make affordable housing projects exempt from development charges and parkland dedication.\n\u2022\tIn 2021, Kitchener Council was one of the first municipalities in Ontario to update our zoning by-law to allow for tiny houses (additional dwelling units) on over 25,000 lots. To date we have received 37 applications for tiny homes with some already occupied. My team would be pleased to work with your team to assist with a potential consistent province-wide approach to regulating tiny homes.\nKitchener\u2019s key areas of concern, and where we have questions\/comments for the Province\u2019s consideration, include the following:\n\u2022\tDevelopment charge framework \u2013 Bill 23 includes changes in development charge (DC) eligible items but does not fully account for the need to continue to supply infrastructure in a timely coordinated manner to support growth. Further it proposes to phase in DCs over a 5-year period resulting in an approximate $17 million reduction in DC revenues for Kitchener. These changes move us farther from a \u201cgrowth pays for growth\u201d approach and has the potential to shift infrastructure costs associated with growth to existing residents. We are requesting that the Province carefully examine the implications of the proposed changes to development charges to ensure that infrastructure delivery continues to be aligned with housing supply. It is important that Kitchener can quickly deliver and adequately fund the infrastructure needed to support housing growth.\n\u2022\tParkland dedication framework \u2013 It is our understanding that under Bill 23 park land and cash-in-lieu of land conveyances will be reduced by at least 50%. The cap reduces higher density park land dedication substantially yielding negligible park land per person in higher density scenarios. In August 2022, Kitchener Council approved a new park land dedication bylaw together with a park land strategy, Places and Spaces. Kitchener\u2019s park land strategy is balanced and considers impacts on development proformas and sets realistic and achievable park land provision targets. We are requesting that the Province hold off on any changes to park land dedication to allow for recently approved by-laws that have been appealed to be tested at the OLT and be implemented for a period of time. This approach provides an opportunity to understand any potential implications and areas for refinement.\n\u2022\tChanges to regional planning authorities \u2013 Bill 23 proposes to remove planning responsibilities from the Region of Waterloo. There is merit in a continued coordinated approach to certain aspects that are currently within the Region\u2019s planning jurisdiction. Coordination of growth in geographic areas with shared interests and infrastructure, like groundwater\/sourcewater protection, wastewater and water treatment, natural heritage, and transit is beneficial. Coordination will assist with continuing to balance increasing housing supply while maintaining agricultural lands for needed food supply and protecting and conserving lands that are an integral part of our watershed and natural heritage system that cross municipal boundaries.\n\u2022\tSite plan exemptions \u2013 Bill 23 proposes to exclude buildings of 10 units or less from site plan control. Further, Bill 23 proposes to exclude exterior design matters including character, scale, appearance, and design features. Kitchener has concerns about exempting buildings from a site plan process where parking lots, significant grading, or new servicing is proposed. Infill developments are often improved through a site plan process to eliminate off-site impacts. Rather than exempt developments by the number of units, it is recommended that the Province consider exempting certain types of developments, such as street fronting townhouses and additional dwelling units from site plan control. Kitchener supports the exemption of review of exterior design matters such as colour, texture, type of material, and window details from site plan review. We request that the Province consider piloting these exemptions only at this time and monitoring to see if further exemptions are needed.\n\u2022\tNatural heritage system review\/evaluation jurisdiction \u2013 Bill 23 proposes to limit the role of the GRCA to matters related to natural hazards and will no longer permit MOUs for services. Kitchener works in partnership with the Region and GRCA on matters related to natural hazards and natural heritage to ensure a consistent streamlined approach to conservation, enhancement and restoration. Should the changes in Bill 23 regarding Regional planning responsibilities and conservation authorities advance, there will be no cross municipal jurisdiction to ensure a consistent approach to the conservation, protection and restoration of natural heritage systems. This is of concern especially in the areas of sub-watershed studies and related community\/secondary plan processes.\n\u2022\tCultural heritage register and designation \u2013 Among the changes within Bill 23 are changes to the timing of the review and addition of properties to the heritage register. Kitchener is concerned that these changes will diminish a municipality\u2019s ability to designate significant cultural heritage resources resulting in potential significant loss of Kitchener\u2019s cultural heritage. Completing an evaluation and designation process for all cultural heritage resources on Kitchener\u2019s register within a 2-year timeframe will at best be challenging. Kitchener is supportive of advancing work on reviewing its register and is requesting that the Province revisit the proposed 2-year timeframe.\n",

Proposed Changes: Listing of Properties on Municipal Heritage Register\nPotential City Impacts:\n- Increasing the threshold for designated properties from one to two criteria will have an impact on how Mississauga recognizes the heritage on equity-seeking groups. Many of the structures which play a foundational role in the community lack architectural value and are plain but have a significant importance and story behind them.\nComments to the Province:\n- Changing the threshold of designating properties from one to two criteria will limit the City's ability to recognize the heritage of equity seeking groups.\n- Many equity seeking communities solidified themselves in buildings and locations which hold significant associative value to the community, but little architectural or design value. As such, the heritage of these communities would be undervalued against the heritage of more established and better documented communities.\n- The Province could consider options and expanding the criteria to directly engage with equity-seeking communities and ensure that heritage is approached in an equitable manner.\n- The Province could reconsider the benefits of heritage review process, as most likely the proposed changes will slow down development\n2. Proposed Changes: Time Limits and De-listing of Properties\nPotential City Impacts:\n- Significant impact to the City's heritage resources by limiting the time a property can be listed on the register. Listing a property on the register gives Mississauga time to consider its heritage value and allow for other means of conserving and interpreting its heritage and history aside from protection through designation.\nComments to the Province:\n- This change will limit the City's ability to explore options of interpretation and commemoration outside of the standard designation process, making the heritage process less flexible and potentially cause more challenges to development.\n3. Proposed Changes: Freeze on Designation Process\nPotential City Impacts:\n- The City would not be able to add properties to the heritage register when 'prescribed event' occurs. This places the onus on the City to be pro-active in maintaining the heritage register and anticipating when a property may come up for development.\n4. Proposed Changes: Heritage Conservation Districts\nPotential City Impacts:\n- Minimal impact to the City as this is already the process used when establishing and amending Heritage Conservation Districts.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes would be devastating for heritage in Ontario. No only do the changes seem geared toward a bull-dozer and build mindset, dropping listed properties from the heritage register if they're not designated within 2 years is just folly. The area in which I live, which has a rich military and cultural history (very popular crossing for the Underground Railroad) has dozens of properties on the register but Council designates 1 - 2 of those properties per year. We have already seen historic homes demolished to make way for apartment buildings and do those buildings fit the stated goal to \"make housing accessible to all Canadians?\" Absolutely not. Losing instead of using heritage to provide homes for Canadians that are accessible is just foolishness. Requiring two of the legislated criteria will go a long way to further erase landscape of \"hidden history\" homes (Black, Indigenous, multicultural and 2SLGBTQIA+).\nYou must reconsider the proposed changes.

        "comment":"Re: Heritage Mississauga response to the proposed Bill 23\nTo whom it may concern,\nHeritage Mississauga has reviewed the Bill 23 (More Homes Built Faster Act, 2002) and the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and to heritage planning. In consideration of Mississauga\u2019s unique heritage context, Bill 23 presents some significant concerns and does not adequately suit the needs of our growing, evolving, and diverse population. Mississauga\u2019s cultural diversity offers both opportunities and challenges in terms of heritage conservation. The many ethnic communities that have established themselves here have enriched the city contributing cultural markers from their respective homelands. Spread throughout Mississauga, these markers include styles in architecture, cuisine, artistic expression, and many other tangible aspects of heritage strengthening the vitality and viability of Mississauga as a whole. Its dynamic character, the many historic villages, significant landscapes, and diverse cultural communities located within a modern urban setting give Mississauga a unique cultural identity that continues to unfold. In short, our city is a multifaceted, deeply varied, culturally endowed, and dynamic place to call home. Bill 23, through the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act, undermines all of this.\nBill 23 threatens to hamper, if not dismantle, ongoing efforts to identify and preserve Mississauga\u2019s built, natural and cultural heritage. Aside from the established histories of the city, the bill will make the protection of places, humble in appearance yet associated with the stories of underrepresented communities, difficult to protect.  Indigenous and Black history as well as early cultural locations associated with various ethnic and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities are at risk of disappearing. While the Ontario Heritage Act and existing municipal registers have often been viewed as having too great a focus on colonial era histories, Bill 23 threatens to limit our abilities to make heritage conservation and interpretation inclusive and reflective of our collective and evolving histories.\nOf particular concern are the proposals in Bill 23 regarding the treatment of Listed properties on the municipal heritage register. Heritage Mississauga agrees that properties proposed for Designation under the terms of the Ontario Heritage Act should meet more than one of the established criteria under Regulation 9\/06. However, we find it very troubling that there was no consultation with municipal heritage professionals when the bill was initially drafted. Bill 23 is a \u201cone-size fits all approach\u201d to development and disregards the uniqueness of Ontario\u2019s municipalities and regions in a manner that is very heavy-handed and centralized. Individual municipalities, along with residents, should determine what is valuable when it comes to telling their stories, as well as what should be preserved, so long as an established criteria is met.\nListing a property on a municipal heritage register is an important tool in the conservation and planning process.  Changing this process could potentially lead to the loss of significant heritage assets and contribute to a more combative planning process overloading the Ontario Land Tribunal, both of which would slow the development and building processes significantly. As such, we firmly believe Bill 23 will both pose significant threats to our built, cultural, and natural heritage (for existing heritage properties and potential future heritage properties) and be counterproductive to its stated purpose of efficiently increasing the province's housing stock.\nWhile we do not oppose the 2-year limit for Listed properties to be maintained on the municipal heritage register, we do request that properties already listed be grandfathered into the new legislation to allow for a longer window of time to assess and determine what may be eligible for Designation, and also to review what may be let go. The review task is enormous, and it would be egregious to not be able to review existing lists properly with due diligence.\nWe insist that this, and potential future legislation, not reopen the status of currently Designated properties and existing Heritage Conservation Districts. Municipalities and their residents have already determined that these are worthy of conservation and protection and do not want the provincial government to usurp the ability of communities to preserve their own culture, stories, built heritage and identity.\nYes, changes are required within the existing processes, and there is absolute value in shortening the approval process and reducing administrative redundancy with respect to development application and building permits. It behooves us to collectively review, and reconsider established legislation from time to time to meet our evolving needs and circumstances. But Bill 23 is not the way to accomplish this. Streamlining the process should not preclude considering matters of overriding social import - including built, cultural, and natural heritage.\nWe are calling for open and honest consultation to achieve an amenable solution. Afterall, no one knows Ontario\u2019s communities, and what is important to them, better than those who live and work there. To that end, Bill 23 should be withdrawn to allow greater dialogue and time to address issues impacting our built, cultural, and natural heritage. We cannot ever go back and retrieve these valuable assets once they have been lost \u2013 both in terms of tangible and intangible heritage values. Our heritage is, in a very real sense, a non-renewable resource. Collectively as custodians of the future we leave to the next generation we should always seek to walk carefully and respectfully, especially if we hope to grow, evolve, and move forward.\nOn behalf of Heritage Mississauga,\nDouglas Hancock, President\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the changes proposed through Bill 23, and specifically Schedule 6. The County of Brant generally supports changes proposed to listed properties. Currently, the Act only prevents demolition and not alteration. Stronger protection measures are afforded for designated properties.\nAccordingly, where properties warrant heritage protection they should be designated as opposed to listed. Requiring the listing of properties creates a simple but redundant process under the Ontario Heritage Act. Legally, an owner could potentially alter the fa\u00e7ade of a listed property which would lessen its heritage value.\nRequiring listing before designation creates an extra layer of work that is not helpful in municipalities with limited resources. Heritage is an important component of community character, one that is important to residents and professional, but is poised as barrier to development. When considering local heritage, building renovations are a very large component of the building industry and can be incentivized to encourage adaptive re-use of older buildings (regardless of their heritage status), ensuring that changes to the outside are sympathetic to the heritage value. Consider integrating a requirement into the Planning Act for municipalities to identify areas where properties and buildings of potential cultural heritage interest are located, essentially integrating 'listing' into the official plan of zoning by-law process and directly connects its policies for cultural heritage conservation to specific properties or areas that meet certain criteria (e.g. O.Reg. 9.06). This will also help integrate the heritage process more closely with applications under the planning act and building \/ demolition permits and add a level of transparency for property owners.\nPlease also see the attached report to Council, being RPT-0517-22 from the County of Brant for additional comments on the changes proposed through Bill 23. Should there be any questions about this submission, please do not hesitate to contact the County of Brant for assistance.\n",

        "comment":"From Heritage Grey Highlands (HGH), a sub-committee of the Museum & Heritage Advisory Council, Municipality of Grey Highlands (MGH):\nhttps:\/\/www.greyhighlands.ca\/en\/visit-and-explore\/heritage-grey-highlan\u2026\n\u2022\tOur committee agrees with all the comments and concerns as submitted on behalf of all municipal heritage committees (MHCs) by the Community Heritage Ontario board. Thus, we strongly urge you to seriously reconsider accepting the proposals that CHO has identified as posing a profoundly negative impact on the ability of any MHC in the province to continue the valuable work of heritage preservation not just for now but for a sustainable future.\n\u2022\tThe greenest buildings on the planet are already built. Repurposing and\/or retrofitting them is far more economically and environmentally responsible than permitting destruction of solid and often valuable heritage structures to enable replacement by \u201caffordable\u201d housing built using inferior (and likely imported) materials.\nBeing an MHC in a largely rural community where most heritage research and other committee work is done by volunteers with very little access to staff assistance, many of the currently proposed changes would have a disastrous effect on our previous efforts and would impede our future ability to identify or protect local cultural heritage resources (until now, the stated intention of the Ontario Heritage Act.) In rural Ontario there is no shortage of land for development. To us, the threats of bill 23 to greenbelt and heritage is a dangerous step that will in no way help to provide more housing.\nRE The ability to allow property owners of all existing listed properties to object years after they have been listed in the heritage register:\n\u2022\tIt is already understood, and precedents exist for repealing a designation or listing should a property owner have a compelling reason. Therefore, this proposal seems unnecessary and provides an open invitation for property owners to make unfounded or egregious objections.\n\u2022\tIn our case, every single property on the MGH register was designated or listed with the express permission of the owner. With this as municipal policy, we foresee no need for the above proposal.\nRE Greater evaluation criteria for including a property as listed on the Register:\n\u2022\tFor clarity and consistency, we agree with CHO that the regulation should establish an easily understood minimum criteria for required information.\n\u2022\tHaving said that, the criteria for added information required to justify a listing should neither be onerous nor as explicit as what is required for designation.\n\u2022\tRather than the proposal to demand designation or removal, it would be fairer to ask that registers be updated to include more information for older listings having just a name and address so that they would match new listings that adhere to new guidelines.\n\u2003\nRE The removal of all existing listed properties from the register after two years from proclamation if they have not been designated, and not allowing them to be re-listed for an additional five years:\n\u2022\tThis would have a destructively negative impact on most MHCs!!\n\u2022\tRemoving all listed properties from a register would destroy years of work by heritage committees and drastically reduce the local visibility of valued heritage.\n\u2022\tDesignation is complex. It takes time for all the conditions to be met. It may be costly. It means work for the volunteer committee, for council, and for staff.\n\u2022\tListing is faster and simpler, even with a requirement for more justification of attributes.\n\u2022\tThe many listed buildings that are cemeteries, churches, museums, municipal buildings, are in no danger of demolition.\n\u2022\tMost other listed buildings are proudly maintained by the owners and do not merit the added complications of enforced designation.\n\u2022\tListed buildings help educate the public about local history and heritage.\n\u2022\tListing draws attention to businesses operating in a heritage building.\n\u2022\tMany property owners who are proud of having their heritage building listed to the register would be far less comfortable with the added restrictions of designation.\nRE Increasing the threshold criteria for evaluation for individual property designation:\n\u2022\tIncreasing the threshold for listing and designation under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act would once again focus attention on mansions and halls constructed by our colonial forebears and may disqualify simpler, locally valued buildings in small towns.\n\u2022\tMany of the rustic and simple remains of Black or Indigenous communities could not qualify as having more than one value as outlined under the OHA.\n\u2022\tIn effect, this proposal would make it more difficult to address reconciliation as well as issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the protection of cultural heritage resources in Ontario \u2013 an odd move with heritage now under the ministry of multiculturalism.\n\u2022\tHere is a Grey Highlands example of a building that by all rights should be designated but under Bill 23 would no longer qualify. It is a simple, very ordinary two-storey brick house constructed 1880s. It is in poor repair and has none of the distinctly interesting woodwork or brickwork that qualifies other local buildings of that era as having design value. It is situated on a hilltop at the edge of a hamlet on a well-travelled county road, but it is totally screened from view by a tall thick hedge, so not a recognizable landmark. The only way to even see the building is to turn onto the short dead-end street at the western side of the property. That is where also largely obscured from public view there is a large blue & silver federal plaque identifying this as the long-time home of Agnes McPhail, first female MP elected in 1921. So associative value is the only justifiable attribute. But for women everywhere, it\u2019s a an important heritage site.\nWhile all of us greatly appreciate the current need for more affordable housing, I truly believe that Bill 23 proposed removal of current protections for heritage buildings endangers the efforts of heritage committees everywhere. Long-term there will be irreparable harm and, in all probability, none of these measures will help achieve the stated short-term goal.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23 and related changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and to the process for amending or repealing heritage conservation district plans threaten to undermine the province's cultural heritage.  The Province states that it seeks \"policy direction that provides for the identification and continued conservation of cultural heritage resources while creating flexibility to increase housing supply.\"\nFirst, if heritage protection is not to be traded off and lose out in the core quest to address the Province's housing needs, a clear succinct statement is needed in legislation and the revised Provincial Policy Statement, namely,  \"Heritage designation is intended to ensure that all development is contextually appropriate, not to preclude intensification that meets this test. To ensure contextually appropriate development, elements of built form, including height, scale and massing of development SHALL conserve the defined cultural heritage value and attributes of the heritage conservation district as set out in its HCD plan.\"\nSecond, the statement in the PPS that \u201cSignificant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes shall be conserved\u201d must be left intact if there is to be any hope of protecting the province\u2019s cultural heritage.\nThird, \u201cgentle intensification\u201d should not be imposed in HCDs where three units on a single property would conflict with the heritage attributes or values of the HCD. For example, the core heritage value\/attribute of a particular HCD is its 150 year-old parklike setting and abundance of trees and greenscape in which houses unobtrusively sit. Gentle intensification would destroy this.\nFourth, third party appeals to the Ontario Land Tribunal of heritage permits should be permitted for the very same reasons that the Province has decided to reverse its position and retain third party appeals to the OLT for decisions under the Planning Act.\n",

Additionally, we respectfully request that more consideration be given by the Ontario Government to recommendations from the Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force Report and incorporate such recommendations into the path forward for building more affordable homes across Ontario.\nMunicipality of Kincardine Resolution re Bill 23:\nWHEREAS the timeframe to comment on the More Homes Built Faster Act (Bill 23) has been exceptionally short;\nAND WHEREAS the bulk of the changes contemplated in Bill 23 will be enacted by regulations that are published on the government of Ontario website for comment by November 24, 2022;\nAND WHEREAS the following elements of Bill 23 and its proposed regulations are not in the best interest of the Municipality of Kincardine:\n1.\tamendments to the Planning Act which would limit third party appeals for all planning matters and remove the public meeting requirements for draft plans of subdivision;\n2.\tprovision regarding inclusionary zoning for affordable housing has a proposed limit of only 5% of units in a subdivision of 10 or more units which should be increased to be effective;\n3.\tprovisions regarding the Heritage Act which would have the effect of forcing municipalities to quickly make designation decision on all properties currently on the heritage register;\n4.\tprovisions relating to the Conservation Authorities Act which would have the effect of removing the Conservation Authority from providing effective and necessary comments on planning applications;\n5.\tprovisions relating to the Conservation Authorities Act which would allow development in certain wetlands on an offset basis;\n6.\tproposed changes to municipal development charged, parkland dedication levies, and community benefit charges that may contradict the goal of building more housing in the long term;\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Council of The Corporation of the Municipality of Kincardine advise the Provincial government that it does not support certain aspects of the More Homes Built Faster Act (Bill 23);\nAND FURTHER THAT the Council of The Corporation of the Municipality of Kincardine direct the Mayor to submit objections with respect to the provisions listed above through the formal comment process within the timeframes for comment;\nAND FURTHER THAT Council request the Province give more consideration for the recommendations in the Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force Report before proceeding with Bill 23.\nAND FURTHER THAT this resolution be circulated to the Premier Doug Ford, MPP Lisa Thompson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark, Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario (AMCTO), the County of Bruce and Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority.\nAdditionally, the Municipality of Kincardine puts forward the following for consideration:\no\tAdditional Residential Units (ARU) \u2013 Our community is open to this change; however, one major concern relates to infrastructure capacity required to support ARUs in serviced areas, including storm, water, and sanitary, which could lead to significant expansion needs and costs.  It would be beneficial to understand how this infrastructure change is intended to be funded for built-up areas. To support some intensification, the municipality could consider reviewing its own Zoning By-law to include rural properties, as there appear to be adequate tools under the Building Code to ensure adequately sized septic systems are on-site and this has no impact on our servicing that we primarily see in the urban areas.\no\tParkland \u2013 The Municipality is not supportive of the proposed changes to parkland dedication, as it appears that the proposal allows for land to be conveyed which may not be optimal for parkland.  Additionally, the Municipality is not supportive of capping parkland acquisition, as it is possible that the Municipality may wish to acquire larger parkland to accommodate a greater population given the nature of development in our community.  The Municipality would also like to have clearer information with respect to the requirement to spend or \u201callocate\u201d an annual amount of parkland reserves.  Clarity of the term \u201callocate\u201d related to parkland cash reserves would allow the Municipality provide comment back to the proposal.\no\tCommunity Planning Permit System \u2013 The Municipality of Kincardine is open to the proposal, however this may require additional local resources for support.\no\tThird Party Appeals \u2013 The Municipality recommends that instead of removing Third Party Appeals, the Provincial Government consider how to streamline appeals at the OLT to dispose of frivolous appeals that impact both timing and cost of development.\no\tLand Division \u2013 The Municipality recommends that a tool be required to allow the public to be made aware of proposals for plans of subdivision.  The Municipality believes that there is valuable information that can be provided to the municipality from the community for potential subdividers of information that may be lost if not afforded the opportunity to allow for public input and awareness, and which may not be available through technical review of a development package.\no\tDevelopment Charges Act \u2013 The Municipality is generally not in support of the changes proposed to the Development Charges Act through this Bill.  With this type of change Municipalities will not be able to sustain growth and existing asset needs. The Province needs to offer funding supports if they impose this area of change.\no\tPhase in of Development Charges \u2013 The Municipality does already provide for a phase-in of Development Charges, however does not support this as a statutory requirement.\no\tDevelopment Charges Act - Housing and Methodology \u2013 The Municipality is not in support of the methodological changes proposed to the Development Charges Act, as it would require the Municipality to find other sources of revenue to support growth.  Additionally, it appears that limiting municipal housing providers from using Development Charges to fund housing programs and projects could actually result in fewer affordable housing units.\no\tHeritage Act \u2013 The Municipality is not in support of the changes to the Heritage Act, and believes that it is important for the community to determine what areas of the built environment and culture should be celebrated.\no\tConservation Authorities \u2013 The Municipality requests that the Province consider the feedback from Conservation Ontario with respect to proposed changes to conservation authorities.\no\tOLT \u2013 The Municipality is generally supportive of changes to the Ontario Land Tribunal that allows the Tribunal to dismiss appeals that are unreasonably delayed and more ability to award costs against losing parties.\no\tAdditionally \u2013 The Municipality would request that the Province consider a comprehensive approach on developing skills in the trades that build homes, as there needs to be a focus, and perhaps incentives, to further trades people in the industry.\n",

Horrible move and transparently corrupt.\nMy industry already faces great struggles with the relationship we share with the Indigenous community. We've made great strides in repairing this relationship but this proposed by pass of what is deemed significant by untrained, biased parties will only serve to destroy the relationship we've built.\nIf you want our industry to move quicker FUND THE GOVERNMENT BODY THAT REVIEWS AND ACCEPTS OUR WORK ADEQUATELY. They have a backlog of work that is months and in some cases years long because they don't have enough funding to hire the amount of professionals needed to complete the work on time. The MTSC desperately needs more funding, more employees, and more power when it comes to how the heritage act is used. They're the professionals. Listen to them!\nIF THEY CANT REVIEW REPORTS IT SLOWS DOWN BUILDING, IT SLOWS DOWN PLANNING, IT SLOWS DOWN EVERYTHING.\nIf you want things built faster without a massive outcry from the indigenous community from the environmentalists and from those of us who work in these industries try giving us the resources to do our jobs efficiently. Superseding the law isn't the answer it'll just create irreversible damage to the physical history of this province.

The provincial government is looking to remove the heritage register and make the criteria more difficult to designate structures. If registered buildings are not designated after two years they will be removed from the registry and will not eligible to be reinstated for 5 years, leaving them vulnerable to demolition. Ontario has almost 30 thousand properties on the register that have been identified as having cultural heritage value. It will be impossible to designate all these properties in two years and many could be exposed to demolition. The register identifies potential heritage buildings and offers a 60 day demolition buffer to give municipalities time to investigate potential designation or heritage value. Often times, designation is used to prevent demolition and encourage incorporation of older buildings. Demolition has many negative impacts on the environment as well and we should be looking to reuse buildings for housing. We need win-win solutions.\nI would like your support to see some attention drawn to the proposed changes of the Ontario Heritage Act. I worry that Doug Ford will amend changes to Bill 23 in regards to the Greenbelt due to public outcry but could still proceed with the gutting and harmful changes to the Heritage Act. Bill 23 is a pro demolition bill and reverses years of public advocacy. I was volunteering in a heritage inventory project in my community  which has since been postponed pending a decision on the bill. I do not want to see changes to the heritage act proceed.

An example is a stone-built home in Ancaster that was knocked down recently overnight with no permit. This is deplorable, home s could have been incorporated on the land and designed to blend in, this happens in most European countries. They have learnt to keep the past and create dwellings that can add to the cultural landscape.   Many Canadians go on vacation to Europe to see old buildings, tourists do not want to come to Canada to see concrete and glass. We have some many beautiful heritage areas that many Ontarians are fighting hard to protect. They produce revenue, many can be converted into living space or small businesses eg the distillery district in Toronto. If areas like this that may not have designated are knocked down by developers, then Ontario loses so much.\nWe need stricter rules that enforce designation of more older unique buildings not less.\nOnce again a developer makes more money by knocking buildings down instead of renovating. This slash and burn approach happened in the 1960\u2019s and I thought that we had learnt that this has ruined many a downtown area. Please do not destroy Ontario\u2019s heritage.\n",

        "comment":"As with Bills 108 and 109 we are troubled by the fact that the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act did not involve engagement\/consultation with the heritage community (i.e., heritage planners, local municipalities, heritage volunteers), indigenous communities the public. As such, the proposed changes appear to favour development and have the potential to put heritage at risk. We are concerned how these new requirements will impact the management tools that municipalities already have in place. Further, it is unclear how these proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will result in more housing that is affordable.\nWe echo the response submitted by the Ontario Association of Heritage Professionals (OAHP) which notes that Bill 23 as proposed, introduces significant uncertainty. It will have unintended consequences and in our professional opinion, could result in greater delays and confusion.\nSpecifically, we are concerned about the proposed changes to municipal heritage registers that would mean that non-designated properties currently included on a municipal register would have to be removed if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force. It is not feasible to review all of these properties for designation within two years. To remove these properties from consideration of future developments is a waste of all the time and money that was spent reviewing and compiling these registers. Municpal heritage registered are not a barrier to development, but rather a tool that assists with managing change and facilitating creative solutions that result in better buildings for the local community.\nWe support OAHP and ACO in their concern that increasing the threshold for listing and designation will make it more difficult to address reconciliation as well as issues of equity, diversity and inclusion in the protection of cultural heritage resources in Ontario. There are many properties that reflect underrepresented groups that would no longer meet the criteria for designation under Section 29 Part IV. This will mean that the current inequity in the criteria will continue to assign more value to the contributions of architecture and well-documented histories rather than recognizing the diverse stories that make up Ontario\u2019s history. Any revision to provincial criteria must ensure that underrepresented communities can still protect the cultural heritage resources that are important to them. This is a significant concern for our company has as we have been directly involved in efforts to rethink traditional understandings of heritage designations and listings.\nAs a firm that regularly works with ministries and prescribed bodies, we are also concerned about the proposed changes to Part III of the Ontario Heritage Act. Specifically, that Minister can review determination of whether a property has cultural heritage value of interest for provincially owned properties or provincially occupied properties. Any review of the S&G should be undertaken with key stakeholders. We agree with the analysis provided by OAHP that if this proposed change is to proceed, at minimum there should be a process developed that is transparent and involves additional, or acknowledges existing, consultation. The threshold for the use of these powers should be high. It should only be considered for exceptional circumstances and not as a matter of course.\nWe find it incomprehensible that MCM is proposing to introduce an enabling legislative authority so the Lieutenant Governor in Council (LGIC) may, by order, provide that the Crown in right of Ontario or a ministry or prescribed public body is not required to comply with some or all of the 2010 Standards and Guidelines for Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties (S&G) in respect of a particular property, if the LGIC is of the opinion that such exemption could potentially advance one or more of the following provincial priorities: transit, housing, long-term care and other infrastructure or other prescribed provincial priorities. As one of the oldest archaeological firms in the province, we know that the S&G are the trigger for the completion of archaeological investigations on provincially owned properties as well the duty to consult. I can understand the desire for haste when it comes to building new housing, but it is simply inappropriate for provincially-regulated projects to be exempt from the principles laid down in the foundational document for the entire country. The Supreme Court has been clear that there must be no \"sharp dealing\" on the part of the Crown when it comes to the First Nations who, by virtue of being in a fiduciary relationship with the Crown, have been put at a disadvantage when it comes to protecting their own interests.\nMost First Nations communities in Ontario have treaty rights that include the right to hunt, fish, and gather foods and medicines from their treaty lands - into perpetuity. Taking such lands out of circulation as part of a resource development or a housing project impacts those treaty rights. If that process seems too onerous and the government excuses itself from that consultation via the requirement not to comply with its own Standards and Guidelines, it breaks promises which the highest court in the land has determined are unbreakable - and drives home the point made by some Indigenous community leaders that our legal system does not protect the interests of the First Nations.\" As was made clear in the final report of the Truth and Reciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), whenever Canadian governments have used their authority to ignore or suspend the legal rights of the First Nations, it has both harmed their communities and been an embarrassing blight on our record. It's 2022. We should be past this sort of thing.\nGiven that cultural heritage is a matter of provincial importance, it is therefore necessary to ensure that conservation of built heritage resources, cultural heritage landscapes, and archaeological resources be included in the list of matters that must be adequately addressed in any proposed bill passed in Ontario.\nWe add our voice to OHAP\u2019s to urge the Province to ensure that the path forward to addressing the housing crisis not be forged at the expense of built heritage resources, cultural heritage landscapes, and archaeological resources. Cultural heritage can be an integral component in the creation of housing and healthy, sustainable neighborhoods. We further urge the Province to delay the changes until adequate consultation with the heritage industry and indigenous communities on these important issues has taken place.\n",

        "comment":"This Bill's effect on heritage will be devastation of communities' identity, history and character. Since 1975 the Ontario Heritage Act passed and has helped to preserve through protection and resuse of our historic sites and landscapes. Many government departments on all levels were set up to create programs and assist communities with keeping their history alive through the visible, tangible works of architecture that identify their place in our provinces development and achievements.\nHow does one politician have the right to wipe out the work of countless professionals, community voluntees and government employees  of the past almost fifty years? He doesn't.\nThere are other options for assisting the housing needs of communities and enabling the destruction of history without public input or municipal policy is absurd.  Why not take over the acres of surface parking lots in our cities and build housing on them.\nThis is tyranny. Ford is acting like a dictator.  He must be stopped and enlightened by the many who have been working in the area of heritage preservation for many generations and by visionaries in other countries who have solved the housing shortage without giving free reign to developers and retaining our valuable architectural works of art.\nArchitecture is an art and the best examples of every period are the property of the tax payers of their communities. We choose our built heritage as an essential part of everyday life which supports our shared identity and quality of life. Destroying heritage sites is traumatic for communities.\n",

        "comment":"Dear MPP St\u00e9phane Sarrazin,\nWe call upon you to bring to the attention of your party important issues within Bill 23 More Homes Built Faster. There are elements within Bill 23 that compromise democracy, affordability, and Ontario\u2019s fragile environment. We at Eco East share these concerns along  with several other community organisations.\nThe intent of Bill 23 is commendable, but amendments are required to help it achieve its purpose. In its current form, Bill 23 includes some harmful changes: diminishing land protection, limiting inclusionary zoning, and limiting the ability of conservation authorities to serve as a check and balance on development.\nIndeed, we need housing, but as they say in real estate, it's about \u201clocation location location.\u201d Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is rich with natural heritage of forests and wetlands, and it also has some of the most productive farmland in Ontario. These are crucial assets that generate wealth (e.g., farmland) and help mitigate costly damages from extreme climate change induced weather events (e.g., forests from windstorms and wetlands from floods). There is ample approved land for development within existing urban boundaries, that negates the need to expand sprawl into wetlands, forests, and farm fields. In addition, Bill 23 severely undermines the ability for municipalities to make local decisions on land use planning.\nThe Bill\u2019s significant changes to the evaluation, designation, and protection of various greenspaces - from wetlands to farm fields, from urban parkland to forests - threatens our wellbeing and safety. For years, we have protected these spaces for many cultural, social, and scientific reasons. Now is not the time for less protected land, but more.\nOur local conservation authority, South Nation Conservation (SNC) performs a crucial function in this region. We are in a landslide area and we have the type of soil that needs to be monitored by professional engineers at South Nation Conservation. They study and protect water, rivers, ground and surface water, and they regulate building in flood plains, unstable slopes, etc. Bill 23 would constrain SNC\u2019s ability to continue providing municipalities advice and expertise on how to protect habitats that minimize potential damage from flooding. Currently, municipalities do not have the time and expertise to do this on their own.\nWe would also like to voice our concerns regarding the financial impacts of the proposed legislative changes to development charges. The changes proposed in Bill 23 would have a devastating impact on the budgets of small municipalities like those within Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. The changes will shift costs away from developers and onto tax payers, increasing the tax burdens of homeowners who are already suffering due to inflation. As we are certain you have heard from fellow residents in our riding, the cost of living has sky-rocketed. The crunch is especially felt by residents in need of affordable housing, such as those living on fixed incomes. The Bill raises many social concerns and, rather than helping those most in need of housing, it will have a significant negative impact on these vulnerable residents.This includes, cutting regulations which seek to protect tenants from \u201crenovictions\u201d, preventing municipalities from requiring that more than 5% of new developments be affordable housing, and allowing affordable housing to return to the market after just 25 years. This will deepen our housing and homelessness crisis, not alleviate it.\nWe at Eco East would be happy to share with you some ideas on how to address the Ontario housing crisis through affordable, connected, and sustainable ways; ways that have already been articulated through the Association of Municipalities of Ontario\u2019s (AMO) 55 recommendations to address the housing crisis released in February 2022. We urge you to stand united with local communities and oppose this destructive bill.\nRegards,\nEco East Board of Directors\n",

        "comment":"#1 - This places strict limits on Burlington\u2019s ability to heritage designate properties that are not on the heritage register and are subject to a development application*. A municipality has only 30 days to deem an application for an OPA, ZBA or SPA \u201ccomplete\u201d, so for a property not yet on the Heritage Register, Burlington will only have a month to consult its heritage committee and deliver a recommendation to Council. This is not enough time to study a property and will result in some candidates for heritage designation being demolished.\n*Official Plan policy 8.4.1(b) enables Burlington to ask for a heritage impact study for a property \u201cworthy of designation\u201d, if an HIS were required as condition of submission.\n# 2 - Requiring municipalities to review and designate all non-designated properties on the Heritage Register within 2 years or else remove them from the Heritage Register on a long term basis presents a difficult binary choice to municipalities:\n\u2022 City Council must choose to remove most or all non-designated heritage properties from their Heritage Registers and leave them unprotected for a significant period of time contrary to the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 and Official Plan requiring that significant built heritage resources be protected\n\u2022 Incur major financial and staff resource costs to study all non-designated properties on their Heritage Register for possible designation, culminating in a large decision-making burden for Council. Further, if a City Council initiates a campaign of continuous heritage designations over two years or an omnibus heritage designation bylaw of multiple properties at the end of a two-year study, it will face numerous Ontario Land Tribunal appeals that could monopolize heritage staff time for months or years.\nAlthough Burlington has a relatively small heritage register, it has 207 \u201cgrade A\u201d non-designated heritage properties including eleven significant churches, seven pioneer or historic cemeteries, five schools and Burlington\u2019s oldest home the Stewart-Spence house built in 1832. Studying all properties, or a subset, forces a potentially ugly confrontation between City Council and numerous property owners over the issue of \u201cimposed\u201d heritage designation. The City of Burlington has historically incentivized designation through negotiation and generous financial supports. This is the approach promoted in the new Official Plan, 2020, in which the City is supposed to encourage and support private stewardship of the City\u2019s cultural heritage resources. Burlington has implemented this incentives-first approach with its heritage grant program and the popular heritage tax rebate program. The ability to list properties on the Heritage Register enables Burlington to negotiate with owners for voluntary conservation at an appropriate time- when the property is being redeveloped or a demolition is proposed. The brief timeline proposed under this legislation does not create any time for these negotiations, which will likely take place under high pressure at Council meetings. Multiple high-profile, landmark heritage sites are threatened by this legislative change.\n#3 \u2013 This change will have minimal impact and is a positive change that will clarify the criteria an area must meet to qualify as a Heritage Conservation District.\n#4 - This has minimal impact and is a positive change that will creates a pathway for a municipality to revise its heritage conservation district bylaws.\n#5 This change introduces too much finality to Council\u2019s decision not to pursue heritage designation, since a property will have to be automatically removed from the register and cannot be added back for 5 years. This impacts the municipality\u2019s ability to monitor the property and pursue conservation if there is a new owner or council. For example, in 2012, a previous Council chose to repeal the heritage\ndesignation of a property in the City, because the owner argued it created financial hardship\nfor them. The property was then removed from the register, but not demolished. It was sold to new owners who wish to redevelop. The development site may have enough land that the house could be integrated into a larger development and converted to a multi-unit building, however because the property is not on the heritage register, staff would have very limited negotiating power. The owner\ncould demolish the property with no notice to the City.\nApproaches or alternatives for consideration:\n\u2022 Allowing municipalities to require the submission of certain materials (i.e. heritage impact study) as part of a pre-consultation submission, would allow the municipality time to determine whether or not the property is worthy of protection, prior to a development application being submitted.\n\u2022 The proposed legislation requires heritage registers to be reviewed within 2 years, which does not provide sufficient time for municipalities to complete the review of all properties. As an example, the City of Burlington would need to assess over 200 properties within the timeframe which would be very difficult. The provision of additional time beyond 2 years would be very beneficial and would allow municipalities time to complete this work in an orderly and thorough manner.\n\u2022 Under the proposed legislation, once a property has been removed from the heritage register, it cannot be added back for a period of 5 years. Shortening this time frame to 2 years would maintain the intent of the legislation but provide for an increased level of protection, should circumstances evolve or change.\n\u2022 Requiring municipalities to make a decision on whether listed properties are to be designated or removed from the register will have unintended consequences and potentially put cultural heritage resources at risk. An alternative approach could be to require municipalities to review their heritage register at defined intervals and assess each property using specific criteria to determine whether the property should remain on the register, be removed from the register or be designated. This process would also allow for public engagement to ensure that community voices have the opportunity to participate in this process.\n",

        "comment":"I am against Bill 23 because I do not think enough or adequate heritage professionals were consulted during its writing. If they had, heritage professionals probably would have agreed that the process for designating heritage properties should be revisited and redundancies dealt with. However, these changes should be done in consultation with municipalities and the boards who deal with the day-to-day reality of this. It is nuanced and not something we can slap a \"one size fits all\" solution onto. This bill will make it harder for municipalities in actuality to designate heritage properties. The result will mean that cultural heritage that should and would have otherwise qualified will miss their window and have little to no protection. Builders may be free then to build, but at what cost? Builders and heritage professionals should work together to create more homes for Ontarians, but in an appropriate manner that does not undermine irreplaceable cultural heritage. The spirit of such a bill should be cooperation, not bulldozing the expertise, heritage, culture, and spirit of our Ontario municipalities.\n",

It will also introduce negative externalities to these bodies such as the loss of developers' fees and weaker urban planning standards.\nIn order to introduce an acceptable bill that builds more homes, faster, the Ontario government must find a way to increase efficiencies throughout the whole planning\/approval\/development\/construction process, rather than compromise the standards and quality of life Ontarians and Ontario deserve.

        "comment":"Heritage Branch, Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism\n400 University Avenue, 5th Floor\nToronto, ON\nM7A 2R9\nCanada\nRe: 019-6196 Proposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) - the Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022\nThank you for the opportunity to share my views on the above-noted Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) posting prepared by the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism.\nThe government's stated goal \"to renew and update heritage policies, some of which haven't been reviewed in over a decade, to reduce red tape and remove barriers that are slowing down housing construction and other priority projects while continuing to conserve and commemorate key heritage properties that matter most to local communities\"   is commendable until you delve deeper into the details.\nA high-level view of the proposed heritage changes suggests an intent to set up communities to fail in their efforts to protect heritage resources in the name of expediency, which this government has not effectively proven necessary.\nThe heightened urgency to implement these changes is troubling because the primary impediment to building new homes is an insufficiently sized construction workforce, not the perceived heritage barriers. If municipalities have difficulty finding companies to undertake infrastructure renewal projects, what makes this government believe it can achieve a monopoly on construction firms? Recent events indicate otherwise.\nThe proposed requirement to either designate or remove any heritage resource on a municipal heritage registry within two years and not re-instate it for at least five years ignores local heritage values, decades of volunteer work identifying and honouring historical and cultural properties, and the labour and cost implications for a small community. Designation entails consulting with numerous entities and conducting research. Based on a 60-day turnaround schedule for a building , the number of resources registered, and municipal staff size, two years may not be sufficient to complete the task.\nIncreasing the criteria for heritage designation of individual structures and heritage districts compounds the labour and cost burden on communities, likely encouraging the abandonment of many listings. Adding to this struggle is the loss of income associated with Bill 23's proposed changes to development charges and other growth-related fees that could assist with reviewing costs or hiring temporary staff.\nEqually challenging is the expectation that only a listed heritage resource can be designated when it is part of a development proposal. Furthermore, only within 90 days of receiving a complete application for an Official Plan Amendment, zoning by-law amendment, or draft plan of subdivision approval. A small municipality's planning department will likely be understaffed and struggling to meet other aspects of the application by the expected deadlines, given new legislation that fines municipalities for their delays.  This increased pressure will likely threaten possible designation if municipalities have to prioritize their response.\nWhat if the heritage resource is not on the municipal registry, for example, waiting five years to be re-added? Does this mean the resource cannot be considered for designation, hastening its destruction?\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism's proposed override of a local municipal council's determination of heritage value or interest disregards the local context or point of view. Unexpected consequences will result from this strategy.\nWithout knowing the identities of \"certain public bodies\" and \"other priorities,\" assigning additional powers to the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council to exempt the province and certain public bodies from strict compliance with heritage requirements is concerning.\nSimilarly, how can one agree to support the creation of a regulatory authority to prescribe processes for municipalities to amend or repeal existing Heritage Conservation District (HCD) designation and HCD plan by-laws without knowing the specifics of the authority and processes?\nWe can all agree that additional housing is required, but the manner used by Bill 23 is controversial, unlikely to achieve its stated objectives, and likely to have unexpected consequences. We want this Bill to achieve its stated goals, but only if there is additional time to collect opinions from all impacted municipalities, organizations, and the public.\nThe best decisions are made when diverse perspectives and areas of expertise work together to solve a problem. Instead, the Bill's strategic timing to coincide with the transition between old and new councils silences the voices of reason and jeopardizes our ability to find a better solution to our housing crisis.\nThank you for considering my opinions. I ask you to postpone your proposed changes to allow more time to explore and develop more reasonable solutions to our shared housing difficulties and heritage interests.\nYours truly,\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23 is flawed and a tremendous cost to the ways of life of people in this province.\nIn a sense, this bill has so much against it that it is hard to know where to begin.  It affects the environment, in particular the Greenbelt.  It affects the ability of conservation authorities to ensure that housing is safe from flooding and that animals can live outside urban areas.  It affects the ability of municipal governments to make decisions about the character of their communities.  It affects the rights of citizens to comment on legislation and bylaws.  It affects the heritage of our communities.\nI want to focus on the latter.\nSchedule 6 should be deleted from Bill 23.  It has made a mess of heritage conservation efforts by dozens of municipalities in the province.  Each municipal government has spent thousands of hours with staff and community volunteers assessing the heritage values of thousands of properties.\nHaving listed properties eliminated after two years would make all that work pointless.  The legislation should abandon the two-year time limit for listing heritage properties and the five-year wait until they can be listed again.  Re-listing after five years is unlikely to happen.  If a property is considered to have heritage value, no staff would list it since it only has a two-year timeframe.  Instead, it would be added to the designated list for greater protection.  The changes to the listed property regulation would have more of an impact on developers\u2019 plans to build new housing.\nThis bill would give the minister the ability to change any municipal property owned by the province.  An order in council could be put in place to opt out of standards and guidelines if property is required for transit, housing, health\/long-term care, and other infrastructure. Ontario Place could be converted into long term care.  Heritage standards and guidelines would be null and void and allow for the demolition of current designated provincially owned buildings.\nIn my region of Waterloo, we have hundreds of beautiful, relevant heritage homes that are a part of the affordable housing strategy and beautiful landscapes.  My street, with many heritage buildings, is in an older district.  Families from China, Vietnam, Syria, Africa and the Caribbean have lived and thrived here.  Rents in these century-old houses are low and the families live in a community surrounded by trees, a park and a lake.  We are a thriving community.  Heritage buildings provide a sense of place and an understanding of our past.\nHeritage cultural landscapes have been identified by several municipalities in our region and we are richer for knowing about them.  No Indigenous landscapes have been identified.  We have almost no knowledge of the Indigenous heritage of our region, in part because we have not taken seriously the rights of Indigenous people.  The criteria for designation will not include contextual value, i.e, what is \u201cimportant in defining, maintaining or supporting the character of an area, is physically, functionally, visually or historically linked to its surroundings, or is a landmark\u201d (Ontario Regulation 9\/06).  Indigenous heritage is not in buildings because they no longer exist, and so heritage value must be about the contextual value.  Indigenous people view their heritage in terms of the land, the water, the animals and plants in them, not the built structures.  The legislation therefore makes it impossible to designate Indigenous cultural heritage landscape.  In short, Indigenous heritage has been devalued with this legislation.\nWith this legislation, we are wiping out the past.  To quote a famous book:\n\u201cDo you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there\u2026  Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right\u201d (George Orwell, 1984).\nWe need to know about our past.  If immigrants arrive at our doors, what are we to tell them?  We may be able to house them, but they will know less about the community in which they are expected to live.  When we show them what a nice place they are coming to, do we show them high rise buildings? No.  We show them pictures of old buildings.  Just look at a calendar showing scenes of Ontario -- old buildings, trees and parks.\n",

Many of the Ontario government\u2019s actions can only be described as undemocratic, as there is no mandate for these sweeping reforms. The province is dismissive of stakeholders, ENGO\u2019s and NGO\u2019s that express concern and\/or opposition. The ENGO community has gotten used to this, but the fact that the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario\u2019s concerns are also being ignored is unprecedented.  This head in the sand behaviour reflects an unwillingness to acknowledge the magnitude of public concern and to fairly listen to all experts and stakeholders.\nOur High Level Recommendations:\n1.\tSlow down: Do not pass Bill 23 or support the Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan until proper consultation is completed with affected stakeholders, key interest groups including Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Conservation Authorities (CA), and affordable housing advocates. The housing rationale used for these measures must be demonstrated to be sound; to date the measures proposed are not supported by planners, municipalities or housing advocates.\n2.\tAllow Conservation Authorities to maintain their current role in permitting in regulated areas, allow them to conserve land, reduce pollution via land use planning review and permits. Don\u2019t further consider land owned by CA\u2019s for housing development. Uphold the purpose and rationale for CA\u2019s, namely preservation, conservation and stewardship of land with natural hazard risks.\n3.\tRequire a full Environmental Assessment for the Duffins York-Durham Sewage System servicing northern York Region.\n4.\tAbandon the abolition of Regional Planning: There are issues with regional planning, but the only support for the proposal to eliminate the important coordinating role of regional government, particularly for infrastructure planning, is from land speculators and developers. If there\u2019s a rationale for the government\u2019s proposal that serves the public interest, please provide.\n5.\tDo not encroach on the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine: There\u2019s enough land to build the housing that Ontario needs for 30 years. Even BILD has said they don\u2019t need Greenbelt. This file stinks; any self-respecting MPP or Councillor should immediately distance themselves from these hand-picked, unjustifiable Greenbelt land removals.\n6.\tProtect Wetlands, Natural Heritage, Species at Risk and Ontario from the inevitable risks of Climate Change! It is unfathomable that we even need to say this. Southern Ontario is an \u201cecoregion in crisis\u201d. Removing more natural features here and adding protections to lands elsewhere obviously isn\u2019t going to improve our ecoregion. Do not change the OWES wetland evaluation system. Maintain strong prohibitions on alteration of landscape in Ontario\u2019s Natural Heritage System (NHS) and its features in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS). Do not allow offsets, trades, or \u201ccompensation\u201d agreements. Capitalize on the free service provided via natural asset management instead of infrastructure and capital intensive engineered solutions.\n7.\tAllow Members of the Public and CA to appeal Official Plan, Zoning Bylaw Amendments and Sprawl Proposals to the Ontario Lands Tribunal. Make the playing field level once more by providing the same rights to both project proponents and community players interested in challenging and\/or improving planning proposals\/Official Plans. Consider threshold levels to reduce appeals abusing the process.\n8.\tDo not override Official Plans. For better or worse they are far more democratic than the proposals flowing out of the government of Ontario at this time.\n9.\tMaintain the PPS & Growth Plan, its density requirements, and support rational infrastructure phasing policies to make the best use of limited taxpayer and developer dollars.\nFULL SUBMISSION\nThe Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) has indicated that Bill 23 is the most extensive and biggest package of legislative changes they have seen in over ten years. We do not offer an analysis as it is impossible to do with our limited resources and time given. We do express our support and agreement from the groups listed in Appendix 1 who have made statements and have or will submit comments on Bill 23 and the various Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) postings. We acknowledge there may be good elements in the Bill but we are overwhelmed by the magnitude of regressive changes and fail to see how they are in the public interest in a climate emergency and affordable housing crisis. Some quotes for perspective.\n\u201cThe proposed changes in Bill 23 will create a number of unintended consequences which roll back 70 years of successful conservation authority watershed management at a time when we need this work more than ever in order to address the growing impacts of climate change .\u201d Conservation Ontario.\n\u201cPreliminary analysis of the Bill indicates the transfer of up to $1 billion a year in costs from private sector developers to property taxpayers without any likelihood of improved housing affordability. Similarly, the bill\u2019s provisions designed to reduce environmental protection will benefit developers in the short term, with costs to the public and homeowners that cannot be calculated .\nMembers of the Committee and all Members of the Provincial Parliament will need to consider in whose interest they govern. Bill 23, as drafted, benefits private interests at the expense of public interests \u2013 at the expense of property taxpayers and Ontario\u2019s natural environment.\u201d AMO.\nTIMING IS ANTI DEMOCRATIC AND HOSTILE TO STAKEHOLDERS\nRecommendation: Slow down the process.\nOn October 25th, 2022  the day after municipal elections were held across Ontario\u2019s 444 municipalities, the current government introduced Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act and posted numerous notices for public consultation on the ERO. Additional notices were posted on November 4th approving York Region  and other municipal Official Plans as well as proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Act and redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act . Then 2 weeks later, on the day before the inaugural Council meetings of Niagara, Peel and York Regions, Bill 39 was introduced .\nNew Councils have not yet been formed, and have not been able to meet to approve or formulate responses to the Province. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), representing Ontario\u2019s municipalities, was not provided an opportunity to present to the Legislature\u2019s Standing Committee on Heritage and Culture at the Bill 23 hearings. The official opposition did invite them to present their submission and it was shared with all MPPs .\nVoters, especially those in two tier - regional governments, had no indication that the responsibilities of regional governance would fundamentally change or that the province would be appointing Chairs , likely extending Strong Mayor Powers to unelected Chairs of their choosing or initiate an \u2018assessment\u2019 of regional governance . It is unfortunate that the public went to the polls and elected a regional council without the knowledge that the province was going to fundamentally change regional governance.  The province conducted a 2019 Regional Governance Review, which was never acted upon and the recommendations remain confidential advice to cabinet .  The public does not know if what your government is proposing is consistent with the advice provided in that review. Thus there is no evidence, available to the public, to support the need for the aggressive changes to regional governance.\nGREENBELT REMOVALS IN YORK REGION\nRecommendation: Keep your promise; do not remove lands from the Greenbelt and be transparent about the downgrading that has already commenced.\nWhy are so many Greenbelt removals being proposed now outside of the ten-year review period, especially when a Greenbelt review and land removals were completed in 2017? The Ontario Government has quite simply lied to the people of Ontario by proposing to remove portions of the Greenbelt. Seven of the fifteen Greenbelt land removals and the only Oak Ridges Moraine land-use redesignation   are located in York Region.\nKing Township lands:\nThe Greenbelt removal in King Township has received significant media attention due to the timing of land transactions and a motion by King Council in support of the Greenbelt removal to facilitate a new Southlake hospital. It is unclear if the province is aware or supportive of the hospital proposal, if this is Southlake\u2019s preferred site or even a candidate site. There is also much concern about who knew what and when? The removal of Greenbelt protection and subsequent re-zoning would increase land value above the purchase price of $80M last September .\nUpper York has no servicing capacity to give, existing 2010 growth can\u2019t be fully serviced and the Upper York Sewage System, now abandoned, was supposed to be the solution for this growth. It is implausible that the lands in King Township would be an eligible candidate for new housing development; northern York Region doesn\u2019t have a servicing capacity solution for what was just approved in the new Official Plan. Why do Minister Clark and the Mayor of King believe these lands meet the eligibility criteria for Greenbelt removal and that servicing capacity could be prioritized and feasible, ahead of all other development projects awaiting servicing allocation?\nMarkham and Vaughan Greenbelt Removals Plus Downgrading Greenbelt NHS:\nThe Greenbelt removals in Vaughan and Markham are adjacent to, or contain Greenbelt \u2018fingers\u2019 that are part of Ontario\u2019s NHS and had land use designations downgraded from prime agriculture to rural to allow active parkland uses when Minister Clark approved York Region's Official Plan . These removals combined with Minister Clark\u2019s recent decision in the Official Plan are not consistent with the Greenbelt Plan and do not uphold previous tribunal decisions that clearly identify that expansion of urban boundaries is not permitted into the Greenbelt NHS . Are accessory uses such as parks that support adjacent developments a settlement expansion in the Greenbelt NHS?\nThe Ontario government appears to have little regard for compliance with its own policies. The current government\u2019s defense for inaction on Climate Change  is, in part, because it is a policy that can\u2019t be enforced. We are fearful that this attitude is percolating into land use planning, resulting in the destruction of Ontario\u2019s NHS; a policy, not a land use designation protected by regulation . The combination of the multitude of legislative changes that reduce natural heritage protection - ie. redefining wetlands could permit the dumping of soil of questionable quality, combined with a  reduction in  resources and legislated authority of independent government-paid subject matters to comment and approve land use decisions, appears to leave little oversight or protection. This leaves us extremely fearful that even the portions of the Greenbelt that remain intact will fail to be protected due to multiple threats, undermining the purpose and intent of the Greenbelt Plan.\nThe general public does not yet understand that this government has already downgraded Greenbelt protection in York and Peel Regions Official Plan Approvals by downgrading land use designations. This is not a removal but it is a lowering of protection that does not require a change to provincial regulations. York Region\u2019s Official Plan also concerns several alarming changes that indicate the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act regulations will be changed to allow future urban development in Vaughan and Stouffville. There\u2019s also reference that some existing developments which meet certain criteria may not need to comply with certain requirements of the ORM Conservation Plan . The government has failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of localized and province wide decisions and legislative changes.\nPROVINCIAL POLICY IN DISARRAY, DISREGARDED, DISRESPECTED\nRecommendation: Provide evidence-based rationale for policy changes & clean up your own house first\nThe changes, even simple administrative matters, do not appear well thought out. It seems implausible that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (the Ministry) has or will have the capacity, staff and administrative processes in place to be the approval authority for lower tier Official Plans and Amendments. The Ministry hasn\u2019t provided basic data on whether the Growth Plan is effective or ineffective, if municipalities are meeting greenfield density targets or have adequate housing supply approved in the pipe-line . This Ontario government has failed to provide reasonable evidence supported by data, facts or figures province-wide to justify such broad sweeping legislative changes.\nProvincial ministries with conservation, preservation, endangered species protection remain critically underfunded. The province has failed to address recommendations and shortcomings brought forward by the former Environmental Commissioner and now the Auditor General . Illegal land use is rampant on prime agricultural land, trees are being felled illegally . Our bylaws  and penalties are ineffective, the province is absent or worse giving approvals in the absence of approved zoning and then expecting by-law officers to enforce nuisance and traffic impacts. The changes to CA\u2019s will leave Ontario\u2019s Natural Heritage vulnerable and exposed because there will be no publicly funded institutions with sufficient resources left to speak, and act to protect our natural heritage. It is reckless to make these changes in the absence of any real and meaningful attempts to address the already identified shortcomings that have forced CA\u2019s to take on the very roles the province seeks to or has already eliminated.\nMASSIVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MUNICIPALITIES\nRecommendation: Consult with AMO and municipalities to ensure these changes do not bankrupt municipalities and do not affect the levels of services and park land that Ontarians have come to expect.\nMunicipal staff are warning of staggering losses as a result of reduction in development fees; the City of Markham estimates that property taxes would have to increase by 50 to 80 percent just  to maintain existing services . It is foolish to believe that smaller municipalities with less resources will have or be able to obtain specialized staff with the expertise to adhere to  specialized specific provincial policy plans and the knowledge to protect residents from natural hazards. Contracting out these services opens up a whole other set of administrative, financial and accountability issues that again do not appear well thought out. Reducing parkland requirements is the exact opposite of what we learn that we need most for our communities during the pandemic.\nCONSERVATION AUTHORITIES\nRecommendation: Allow Conservation Authorities to maintain their current role in permitting in regulated areas and allow them to conserve land and reduce pollution via land use planning review and  permits.\nOntario residents trust CA\u2019s because they have demonstrated they have the staff, expertise and resources to comment on complex planning applications with environmental and natural hazard risks. Further, they have been responsible stewards for the conservation and preservation of the lands entrusted to them. To direct CA\u2019s to put a list of land together suitable for development is nonsensical. Land comes into their ownership because it has been donated with expectations of having conservation status in perpetuity, or the lands contain environmentally significant features and natural hazards that require protection.\nUPPER YORK SEWAGE SYSTEM\nRecommendation: We support the Williams Treaties First Nations in their comment that a full Environmental Assessment of the southbound Duffins Creek route is needed.\nWe are pleased that the Upper York Sewage Treatment Plant is not proceeding, that the government recognizes the sensitive health of Lake Simcoe, the need to proceed expeditiously with the phosphorus reduction plant and the necessity of compliance with the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and Plan. However, it is frustrating that $100M has been spent on the Upper York Sewage System Environmental Assessment with little to show.  It is unreasonable to transfer this growth to Durham residents in the absence of a full Environmental Assessment and to suggest that York Region staff will be able to accomplish anything to approve and achieve the old or new growth targets set by the Province in the near future. Staff has been told to start over, develop a solution to deliver a third expansion of the York-Durham Duffins Creek Treatment Plant and pump water against elevations of 100m (twice the height of Niagara Falls). We are no further ahead to achieving growth in upper York.\nUpper York Region is a case study in what not to do in infrastructure planning with stranded assets and unrealized growth creating burdens on capital budgets because development fees can\u2019t be collected . This is a direct result of provincial inaction and inadequate, non-existent provincial support and resources provided to municipalities but still demanding growth targets be met . It is setting municipalities up to fail and Bill 23 will formally shift the blame for not achieving growth targets onto a lower level of government with no recourse to respond because they are \u2018creatures of the province\u2019 not recognized in the Canadian Constitution. It is unfair.\nCONCLUSION\nIf Bill 23 is passed in its current form then the Ontario government will have failed to listen to professionals, subject matter experts, and ignored science and established best practices. It will have failed to protect land that will be critically important to reducing the impacts and adapting to climate change - CA regulated land, the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine. They will have failed to provide the type and diversity of housing needed by Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable communities. The implications of Bill 23 place unacceptable fiscal and legal risk upon the Government of Ontario, municipalities and taxpayers -  it is short-sighted and reckless.\nWe urge you to slow down.  Do not pass Bill 23 or the proposed Greenbelt removals . Consult properly, and do the job that only the government can do: protect the public interest.\nSincerely,             .....\nExecutive Director\nRescue Lake Simcoe Coalition\nand ....\nCommunity Advocate and Member of Stop The 413, Stop Sprawl York Region, Stop Sprawl Ontario\nABOUT US:\nStop Sprawl York Region is a project of the Rescue Lake Simcoe Coalition, set up to coordinate public input and responses to York Region\u2019s Official Plan development in 2022.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act in Bill 23.  I believe that they will result in the loss of many of Ontario\u2019s heritage properties and landscapes but do little to improve the province\u2019s housing supply.\nI live in the Municipality of Port Hope, which is characterized by a natural landscape of deep ravines, tall trees, a winding river, and Lake Ontario views coupled with a built environment of fine 19th century commercial buildings, residences, churches, and country houses. Port Hope\u2019s heritage assets - our remarkable Downtown Heritage Conservation Districts, our distinctive heritage properties and our cultural heritage landscapes - are essential to life in the community.  They bring beauty, culture, vibrancy and economic prosperity.  The conservation and adaptive reuse of these assets bring new living spaces without harming the environment.\nWith the proposed changes in Bill 23, however, Port Hope\u2019s significant heritage resources could be eroded or lost entirely, and this will be true of the many historic towns, villages, and  neighbourhoods throughout Ontario.  Please don\u2019t allow these changes to be enacted.  So much of Ontario\u2019s heritage will be lost, but little will be gained.\nWe all know that new, affordable housing is a necessity for Ontario.  Why doesn\u2019t Bill 23 focus on the most effective solutions for relieving the housing shortage such as increased density in cities and the adaptive reuse of large older buildings for housing?  I live in an old Port Hope school that has been turned into a condominium building, and it is delightful.\nBill 23 will not solve the housing crisis, but the losses it causes will damage Ontario forever.  This bill must be amended.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Paula Kulpa,\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments to the Ministry of Citizenship and\nMulticulturalism on the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations proposed through\nBill 23. Cultural heritage is integral to the City of Brampton. True to its namesake as the Flower\nCity, Brampton recognizes its rich legacy and responsibility to identify, protect, manage and\ncelebrate the city\u2019s unique history.\nThe City is concerned with the proposed changes as a result of the challenges it will pose in\nheritage conservation moving forward, and the increased workload to meet the prescribed\ndeadlines set forth. The City has categorized and provided comments on all relevant proposed\nchanges, identifying opportunities to provide additional time and financial support to enable\nmunicipal staff to ensure the conservation of Brampton\u2019s valuable cultural heritage resources. The\nCity estimates that it will cost somewhere between $500,000 - $750,000 to complete this work,\nplacing additional burdens on the tax base that compound the impacts of other changes proposed\nthrough Bill 23. The City agrees with the intent to increase information sharing and is already in\nthe process of making the Register publicly available and accessible to residents to support\nknowledge of Brampton\u2019s cultural heritage.\nThe City has provided detailed comments through Appendix 1. A few key comments are\nsummarized below:\n\uf099 Proposal: Requiring municipalities to remove a property from the heritage register\ndue to failure to issue notice of intention to designate in a two-year timeframe\nCity Comment:\n\uf099 There are currently 385 Listed Properties that are valuable and should be designated.\nHowever, in amongst other requirements through these proposed changes and existing\nworkloads, the capacity to effectively evaluate and designate all properties requires\nadditional time and flexibility to avoid a \u201cdesignate it or lose it\u201d approach to irreplaceable\ncultural heritage.\n\uf099 Requiring a removal of properties from the heritage register because of a withdrawal of\nnotice, failure to pass a designating by-law or re-appeal through an OLT appeal, focuses on administrative-based criteria rather than protecting the value that such properties hold\nfor the community.\n\uf099 Listing a property on the register provides Brampton the time to consider its heritage value\nand allow for other means of conserving and interpreting its heritage and history without\ngoing through the formal designation process.\nCity Recommendation:\n\uf099 The City recommends maintaining the current regulatory framework for listed properties\nand not requiring municipal staff to pursue a notice of intention to designate within a two-year\ntimeframe. If the Province decides to put forward a requirement for a NOID, the\ntimeframe should not be limited to two-years.\nProposal: Review the criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest\nprescribed in O. Reg. 9\/06 to increase the threshold for designation\nCity Comment:\n\uf099 The City is of the opinion that creating a more robust framework is typically a good thing,\nhowever, this may have unintended consequences for equity deserving communities,\nparticularly if the heritage value only meets one criterion and not two. Ensuring inclusive\ncultural heritage planning is critically important across the Province, and especially in\nBrampton, to reflect and celebrate the City\u2019s diverse communities.\nCity Recommendation:\n\uf099 The City recommends the Province reconsider these changes and engage with equity\ndeserving communities to ensure locations across the city that hold value to the\ncommunity are not lost.\n\uf099 Proposal: The designation process would \u201cfreeze\u201d once a prescribed event occurs.\nMunicipalities would not be permitted to issue a notice of intention to designate a\nproperty unless the property is already on the register when the current 90 day\nrequirement for applications is triggered.\nCity Comment:\n\uf099 The City is concerned that this places immense administrative burdens on staff. In order\nto meet this requirement, the City would have to have a complete list of all buildings of\npotential heritage interest already included on the heritage register prior to the revised Act\ncoming into effect. There is insufficient time to conduct a thorough review of the heritage\nregister and evaluate candidates for inclusion in order to effectively anticipate properties\nthat may come up against development pressures but have significant heritage value to\nthe community.\nCity Recommendation:\n\uf099 The City recommends the Province support the municipalities financially or review this\nproposal to ensure that no heritage properties are lost as a result of this change.\nCity Questions:\n\uf099 The City seeks clarification on what is defined as a \u201cprescribed event\u201d, as this may provide\nfor a basis for additional comments.\n\uf099 The City requests clarification regarding property owners who want their property included\non the Register but may not want to go through the process of designation. The City is\nconcerned that there is still heritage value, but it is at risk of being lost due to a lack of\nwillingness from an owner to go through the designation process.\nThe City of Brampton would like to thank the Province for the opportunity to provide feedback and\ncomments on the proposed changes.\nSincerely,\nSteve Ganesh, MCIP, RPP\nCommissioner (A)\nPlanning, Building and Growth Management\nCity of Brampton\n",

        "comment":"RE. Proposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) - the Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022\nI work as a consultant in the heritage field, and I am gravely concerned about these changes which will have a direct and negative impact on my work as a heritage professional. While these changes are billed to create jobs, you are not looking at those who's jobs are being threatened now as a result.\nAs a single mother who is doing her best to make ends meet, and who may be in need of affordable housing depending on how this proposed bill change affects my employment, I am not at all confident these OHA changes (or many of the other non-cultural heritage related changed) will help alleviate the intense, and immediate need for affordable housing now or even in the future.\nI feel the heritage industry is a bit villified in the construction\/building\/development industry as an obstacle. I would like to ad my voice to the growing chorus that heritage conservation and housing development can be mutually beneficial. Reuse and adaptation of existing buildings and neighbourhoods, combined with well-designed and well-planned infill, can and will result in new homes for Ontarians. This tack will get MORE HOMES BUILT (or in these cases, REUSED) FASTER.\nThe heritage industry to which I belong, contributes to construction\/building\/development industry in a variety of ways including as tradespeople, engineers, architects, and planners. Heritage professionals have a unique understanding of the challenges and opportunities of working with older structures; but we have not been asked to join the conversation. We would very much welcome a seat at the table! We have solutions, ideas on ohow to create more housing.\nMORE UNINTENDED\/UNFORSEEN COST - Regarding person power needed to address these changes in the workforce in REALITY and in the trenches here, the proposed amendments would mean that non-designated properties currently included on a municipal register would have to be removed if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force. It is not feasible to review all of these properties for designation within two years. To remove these properties from\nconsideration of future developments is a waste of all the time and money that was spent reviewing and compiling these registers.With the proposed removal of planning responsibility from many regional and county governments, our field will see a further reduction in professional capacity as well as existing technical studies (such as archaeological management plans) that are critical to heritage management in this province. This uncertainty in the process is not good for homebuilders, communities or heritage experts. In some cases, it will also result in increased costs to homebuilders and tax-payers.\nUNDER-REPRESENTED (i.e., non-white) PEOPLE'S CULTURE IS BEING OVERLOOKED - increasing the threshold for listing and designation under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act will make it more difficult to address reconciliation as well as issues of equity, diversity and inclusion in the protection of cultural heritage resources in Ontario. There are many properties that reflect underrepresented groups that would no longer meet the criteria for designation under Section 29 Part IV. This will mean that the current inequity in the criteria will continue to assign more value to the contributions of architecture and well-documented histories rather than recognizing the diverse stories that make up Ontario\u2019s history. Any revision to provincial criteria must ensure that underrepresented communities can still protect the cultural heritage resources that are important to them. This is a significant concern for me as many of my colleagues have been directly involved in efforts to rethink traditional understandings of heritage designations and listings.\nPlease, pump the breaks on this damaging bill. Lets get the people with real experience and expertise contributing to solutions here. Please listen. This is not the Ontario in which I want my kids and my family to live, work and play.\n",

        "comment":"Schedule 6 of Bill 23 proposes multiple changes to the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.18 including requirements for listed properties to meet more stringent designation criteria  within two years\/removal of properties from the list, proposes changes to criteria for designation, and allowing municipalities to designate heritage resources, when such resources form part of development proposals, if they are already listed as a potential heritage resource and only within 90 days of a complete application being received for an Official Plan Amendment, zoning by-law amendment or draft plan of subdivision approval.\nThe Town of Kingsville\u2019s Heritage List includes 38 designated properties and 308 \u2018listed\u2019 properties - properties have contributed in some way to the cultural, social and economic development of Kingsville. Listed properties provide no legal protection, only a requirement that owners notify the municipality if they plan to demolish the property 60 days beforehand, instead of 10 days, which does provide opportunity to explore designation, or even opportunities to relocate or reuse listed buildings though it provides no further legal status.\nKingsville  supports efforts to make heritage listing and designation processes more efficient. However, having to remove listed properties if not designated within two years will require additional staff resources and capacity to assess heritage values and make recommendations for designation. This will likely cause the heritage registry to be limited only to those properties in the process of seeking designation. With properties not able to be placed back on the list for five years, the list will effectively be dissolved.\nIt has also not been demonstrated that listing a property is an impediment to housing availability or affordability. For example, Kingsville currently has over 2,000 new units in planning or pre-consultation review stages alone, separate and apart from existing development. It does not appear that heritage protection is a significant deterrent to residential development if at all, and removing homes from registry will not result in additional or affordable housing.\nFinally, residents of Kingsville are proud of the town's character, which is an attractant to people and businesses interested in investing in the town. Though not yet outlined, evaluating properties based on new, more stringent, provincially prescribed standards, despite research and local value, will impact the Town's community and economic development.\nKingsville would be happy to participate in further consultations to identify supports that could be provided by the Province to assist the Town in advancing designation of properties.\n",

I have read the AMO written submission and it is comprehensive and thoughtful.  I would urge the provincial government to strongly consider the comments contained in AMO's submission.\nThe development of a community by its very definition should reflect the uniqueness of each community.  While some basic consistent policies make sense, a cookie cutter approach across the province which runs roughshod over decisions that should be made at a local level by municipalities and conservation authorities is very troublesome.\nMunicipalities such as the City of Hamilton are already having financial challenges with meeting their existing infrastructure needs.  The approach contained in Bill 23 is simply going to exacerbate those challenges.\nMost people agree and recognize the need for more, safe and affordable housing. The Province needs to revisit its approach and collaborate with municipalities and conservation authorities who have the \"boots on the ground\" and can speak with knowledge and understanding of their unique communities, rather than simply imposing an ideology on those communities.\n",

Heritage listing is a \"win win\" for both property owners and municipalities. It should not be effectively eliminated (limited to two years). Moreover, it would be impossible to designate properties under the Ontario Heritage Act if they must be listed first but cannot be listed for five years after having been listed previously. This clause doesn't make any sense. It seems the goal of this change is to *prevent* heritage conservation.\nAlso raising the threshold (criteria) for heritage designation means fewer properties that do not represent wealthy landowners who could afford architects, etc. will be recognized. This is detrimental to histories of those of lower economic means.\nPlease take more time to consider these changes and consult.\n",

        "comment":"I write on behalf of the Port Hope Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario (ACO) in support of the position taken by the ACO provincial branch, regarding Bill 23, Section 6.  We, too, are very concerned that the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act in Bill 23 will adversely affect the ability of the people of Ontario to protect their heritage properties and landscapes.\nParticularly concerning are the proposals in the Bill which prescribe processes for municipalities to amend and repeal existing Heritage Conservation Districts, and which change the protocol for protecting provincially designated properties of heritage value. Equally worrying are the proposals to raise the threshold for Municipal designations and to completely modify the listing process, which will mean that protecting currently non-designated heritage assets throughout Ontario, going forward, will be even more difficult.  Yet, according to ACOntario, heritage-protected buildings make up such a small percentage of the Ontario building stock that none of these changes will help solve the housing crisis.\nHeritage Conservation Districts in Ontario require considerable research, and each district is defined by its heritage unity and cohesion.  This integrity could, however, become much more difficult to preserve, if the proposal regarding the amendment or repeal of a Conservation District is being made, as stated in the Bill, simply \u201cto better facilitate development.\u201d\nThe Province should be setting a high standard when it comes to protecting, conserving\nand maintaining cultural heritage resources in its ownership.  Instead, the proposals in Bill 23 stipulate that provincial designations may be revised or set aside.  This makes us fear that many provincially designated properties such as the 19th century village of Wesleyville in the Municipality of Port Hope could be lost.  For Port Hope, such a loss would be heartbreaking, as many Port Hope citizens have devoted money, time and effort towards the site\u2019s preservation and restoration.\nAs far as municipal designations are concerned, the Bill\u2019s proposal to require that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation rather than one will mean that a number of simple\/local heritage resources that help tell the story of one of our diverse communities could no longer qualify for designation. For example, under the proposed new criteria, a cultural area such as Reggae Lane in Toronto would no longer be eligible for protection..\nThe current listing process was designed to allow Municipalities to recognize properties of heritage value before all of the criteria-based research for designation had been completed, and listing has become a transparent and educational planning tool.  The proposal in Bill 23 requiring that all of the research for designation be completed in order for a property to be listed is excessive, especially when a second proposal requires that the listed properties must be de-listed from the register after only two years and not be re-listed until after 5 years.  Compiling and analyzing the information required for designation is a meticulous and time-consuming task, usually done by volunteers but often requiring costly expert advice. For most municipalities ear-marking resources for what would become such a limited purpose, will be challenging, leaving a significant number of currently non-designated heritage properties unprotected.\nIt does seem that the provincial government believes that heritage is \u201cin the way.\u201d Yet, heritage conservation plays a crucial role in a community\u2019s economic development, by enhancing the community\u2019s quality of life, strengthening its distinctiveness, stimulating revitalization and attracting film-making and tourist dollars.  Heritage Conservation also helps protect the environment not only through restoration and adaptive reuse rather than demolition and new builds, but also through the protection of old forests and cultural heritage landscapes such as Wesleyville or Walker Farm in Caledon.\nOur heritage inspires, enlightens, and enriches us.  Heritage Conservation should not be viewed as being in the way.  It should be perceived as a way of life that benefits us all.\n",

Certainly, we should not be paving over chunks of the formerly \"protected\" greenbelt with the excuse that it is suddenly mandatory that it be developed.  That is not only wrong, it is moving us backward in terms of protecting the environment.  Additional housing must be located in existing cityscapes, and that will involve housing density and building upward.  It should be obvious that local people know what should be preserved when it comes to heritage properties and landscapes.  Again, to suddenly give individual mayors \"strong powers\" so that they can ignore the will of duly elected municipal councillors erodes our democracy.  The will of the people must be reflected by listening to the voices of all elected officials, not merely a few of them.  Bill 23 should be shelved.\nI am an Ontario resident and I vote.

Specifically, the proposed changes requiring listed properties to be dropped from local heritage registers if they cannot be designated within two years makes no sense to me. Such a proposal seriously undermines the decades of work done by volunteer organizations to identify and protect listed properties. We should be doing more in this province to preserve our built culture, not just those structures that are architecturally outstanding. Requiring that properties meet two, rather than one, of the criteria for designation will effectively make it much more difficult to preserve buildings \"caught in the middle\" whose significance or historic associations to the community may be more modest. Taken together, these proposals could wipe hundreds of properties off local heritage registries and make it more difficult to preserve important heritage structures.\nI am a bit dumbfounded that it is the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism, directly responsible for protecting our heritage, that seems to be willing to tear up the Ontario Heritage Act with this new legislation. This proposed bill seems more like a direct attack on how we identify, value and preserve our heritage for future generations.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my concerns with Bill 23.\nAside from the bill itself, I have great concern over the democratic process surrounding this Bill:\n1. There is very little time for review and consultation on this wide sweeping bill (9 working days) impacting 9 provincial acts.\n2. Bill 23 has been announced following a municipal election cycle and will be decided upon as new councils begin meeting, thus in reality eliminating their input. This timing comes across as unjustified, non-collaborative and in poor faith as it directly impacts the development of Cities and their comment should be welcomed with sufficient time.\n3. It comes across that timing for Bill 23 has been used as a strategy to circumvent dialogue and collaboration from the most important partners at the table - municipalities.\nWith respect to the Bill itself, I do not support Bill 23 in its current form for some of the following reasons:\n1. We are in a global climate crisis. Bill 23 is single minded, showing complete disregard for the known threats and impacts on our province due climate change.\n2. Bill 23 lacks any consideration for the creation of sustainable and climate resilient cities by promoting sprawl.\n3. Bill 23 puts the health and well being of residents of Ontario at risk by a) potentially removing some checks and balances offered by Ontario\u2019s 36 Conservation Authorities who\u2019s mandate is to protect people and property from loss of life and property due to flooding b) weakening protections of our natural heritage system including forests and wetlands by allowing offsetting , which will ultimately speed up biodiversity loss and magnify the effects of climate change ultimately negatively impacting health of our citizens.\n4. Bill 23 may remove development surcharges which would impact items such as parkland dedication. Municipalities are stretched thin to develop new parkland and maintain existing as per the already abysmal per capita standards. It would seem that the removal of development surcharges would mean that the cost of development then falls on the taxpayer, quickly decreasing the affordability of home ownership of new and existing homes as already high property taxes increase.\n5. Bill 23 Removes any powers cities have to build and protect affordable housing.\n6. Bill 23 severely limits the building of \"missing middle\" housing (a variety of sizes and types of smaller, more affordable homes) on land already earmarked for growth within existing urban boundaries and instead legalizes and provokes a massive acceleration of suburban sprawl into wetlands, forests, farmland, and other areas on the rural outskirts of major population centers in Ontario\u2019s most sensitive ecoregions.\n7. Bill 23 allows the provincial government to directly impose sprawl on municipalities, without any opportunity to accommodate demand for housing and workplaces in their own way.\n8. Bill 23 proposes to entirely eliminate coordinated regional planning in Ontario\u2019s Golden Horseshoe. In Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara and Waterloo and York Region, regional planning is meant to prevent \u201cpatchwork\u201d sprawl that wastes construction resources and infrastructure, to enable regional governments to ensure that development can be serviced effectively, and to ensure that land isn\u2019t wasted.\n9. Bill 23 removes Green Standards from development expectations. We are in a climate emergency and this is the time to increase sustainability, not eliminate it.\n10. Bill 23 disallows modest, purpose-built walk-up apartments or even townhomes to be built as of right on the existing lots currently being squandered on single detached McMansions.\n11. Bill 23 will prohibit municipalities from accessing the expertise of Conservation Authorities (CAs) when  considering development applications, forcing them to hire outside agencies to fill that role, at taxpayers' expense.\n12. Bill 23 removes the power of the Conservation Authority to deny sprawl by developers and land speculators and permit to build on wetlands, river or stream valleys or to protect anything beyond managing floodwaters and erosion. It would leave vast swathes of Ontario\u2019s most important habitats largely unprotected.\n13. Bill 23 removes Conservation Authorities power to regulate and refuse permits based on \u201cpollution or the conservation of land\u201d, and thus remove the obligation of the Minister to consider those matters in appeals.\n14. Bill 23 may compel Conservation Authorities to identify their land holdings and make them available for housing, including donated land.\n15. Bill 23 will exempt any project that has received land use planning approval under the Planning Act from Conservation Authority regulations regulating water-taking, interference with rivers, creeks, streams, watercourses, and wetlands, or controlling flooding, erosion, conservation of land.\nThis is the time to think creatively, take an opportunity to address climate change and create a better future for generations to come by considering the impacts of decision making not only on \u2018immediate economic gain\u2019 but environment and wellbeing of the constituents you have been honoured the privilege to represent.\nThank you for your time and attention.\n",

        "comment":"Summary:\nSeveral changes are proposed to the Ontario Heritage Act (OHA) and its regulations, including Ontario Regulation 9\/06 Criteria for Determining Cultural Heritage Value or Interest, as part of the More Homes Built Faster Act (2022). These changes will significantly impact the Town of Halton Hills\u2019 heritage program as well as the ongoing work related to the Cultural Heritage Master Plan, which is currently in its second draft and anticipated to be brought before Council in Q2 of 2023.\nThe most significant changes to the Act impact the Town\u2019s Heritage Register, which was built over four phases with extensive public consultation. Multiple amendments are proposed within Section 27 of the OHA which speaks to the Register and Municipal Heritage Committee. The proposed OHA amendments also include legislative changes for Heritage Conservation Districts, amendments relating to Ministerial decision-making for Crown owned or occupied heritage properties, designation processes, amendments and repeals to by-laws designating Heritage Conservation Districts.\nKey Comments:\nCrown-owned\/Crown-occupied Heritage Properties\n\u2022\tAmendments to the OHA would permit the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism to review, confirm or revise the determination of cultural heritage value for a property for provincially owned heritage properties as identified by a Ministry or prescribed public body. The Lieutenant Governor in Council may provide that the Crown, Ministry, or prescribed public body may not be required to comply with Heritage Standards and Guidelines should the exemption allow the advancement of other priorities including, but not limited to, transit, housing, health and long-term care, and other infrastructure.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. The proposed amendments regarding Crown owned and occupied provincial heritage properties should not significantly impact the Town of Halton Hills\u2019 Heritage Register and the Town\u2019s ability to conserve cultural heritage resources. Should a project emerge that involves a provincially-owned property in this scenario, staff would work with key stakeholders to achieve key project priorities.\nMunicipal Heritage Register\n\u2022\tAmendments to the OHA would require that all information included in a municipal heritage register be made accessible on the municipality\u2019s website.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. This proposed amendment will require staff to expand current information available through the Town\u2019s website to the public.  Staff will be required to ensure that the information for each listed property is up-to-date and meets accessibility standards under the AODA.\no\tThe Town\u2019s Heritage Register page is populated automatically by linking to the Town\u2019s GIS databases. While the online Heritage Register identifies some information about each property, staff will be required to include additional metadata to the GIS for listed and designated properties, ensuring that the information identified in individual property listing reports is included in what the public can directly access.\no\tIf passed, proclamation of this amendment would be delayed by 6 months to allow municipalities time to make necessary changes to their website.\n\u2022\tAll future properties listed on a municipal heritage register must meet criteria for determining whether property is of cultural heritage value as prescribed by regulation, which is not yet provided.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. The Town consistently used Ontario Regulation 9\/06  criteria as a preliminary screening mechanism when determining whether a property warranted inclusion on the Heritage Register through its formal Heritage Register building process between 2007 and 2018. The Town has been pro-active in this approach and ahead of the proposed legislation. Additionally, any property that has been added to the Heritage Register following the Town\u2019s formal Heritage Register process has been preliminary evaluated and confirmed to meet at least one of the three prescribed criteria. This process will remain unchanged moving forward for the Town.\n\u2022\tOwners of properties added to a heritage register at any time would be able to serve a notice of objection on a municipality. The proposed amendments identify the objection process for property owners and require Council to provide the owner a notice of its decision once made within 90 days.\no\tStaff have significant concerns with this proposal. To create its Heritage Register, the Town undertook a four-phase, public-facing Heritage Register process between 2007 and 2018. This comprehensive, Town-wide review identified properties throughout the municipality and established whether they met one or more of the criteria as established by Ontario Regulation 9\/06 (O.Reg 9\/06). At the time, this level of evaluation was not yet required by the legislation, nor was public consultation or the ability for property owners to submit their concerns regarding a listing. In this regard, the Town was far ahead of the legislation at the time, as only with amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act through Bill 109 in 2021 were municipalities required to notify property owners and allow an appeal process of Council\u2019s decision. Opening up the objection process to all properties currently on the Heritage Register negates the comprehensive process the Town has undertaken.\n\u2022\tCircumstances are identified that would necessitate the removal of a listed property from the heritage register, including circumstances involving a Notice of Intention to Designate being withdrawn, a by-law not being passed, or a repealed bylaw, and properties listed on the heritage register before or after the MHBFA that are not subject to a Notice of Intention to Designate within two years of the MHBFA coming into force. Additionally, the council of a municipality would not be required to consult with its heritage committee should properties be removed from the heritage register in the above-noted circumstances.\no\tStaff have significant concerns with this proposal. The proposed amendments through Bill 23 would allow property owners to object to any property added to the Heritage Register at any time. This will require staff to undertake research and evaluation to determine whether the property met O.Reg 9\/06 criteria for designation under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act. Historically, the Town has been reasonable and collaborative with property owners in addressing concerns relating to a property on the Heritage Register, removing properties when it was demonstrated through a heritage evaluation process that they did not retain significant cultural heritage value or where there were other structural concerns with an engineer\u2019s report.\no\t This legislative change has the potential to have adverse impacts on the Town\u2019s cultural heritage resources. As currently legislated, listing a property on the Heritage Register provides a 60-day notice period for demolition applications, but also provides staff the opportunity to provide recommendations to property owners for minor alterations through building permits, incentivize excellence in heritage conservation through municipal funding programs such as the Community Improvement Program, and work with stakeholders through development applications to incentivize heritage conservation while achieving other planning priorities.\no\tThe proposed amendment would limit the Town\u2019s ability to prioritize the over 700 listed properties on the Heritage Register within a two-year period and would prevent future staff involvement in any discussions of a potentially significant cultural heritage resource unless designated.\n\u2022\tA municipality will be prohibited from listing a property on the heritage register for a period of five years following its removal in circumstances identified through the OHA amendments.\no\tStaff have significant concerns with this proposal. Prohibiting the re-listing of properties on the Heritage Register following their removal in accordance with Subsections 27(14-16) will be significantly impactful to the Town\u2019s Heritage Register. The Town\u2019s four-phase Heritage Register Process and subsequent individual additions of properties to the Heritage Register has resulted in a comprehensive list of those properties which do contribute, or are believed to contribute, to the cultural heritage value and character of the Town. Hundreds of properties will be impacted through this legislation, allowing a period of five years following their removal from the Heritage Register in which countless valuable cultural heritage resources will likely be lost.\no\tThe Town developed its Heritage Register through a multi-year, public process, allowing for property owner input and concerns through each stage of the project. As previously noted, the Town has also been collaborative with property owners seeking removal of their properties from the Heritage Register due to issues of cultural heritage value, structural stability, or life safety. A five-year moratorium on re-listing a property prevents the Town from providing advice and recommendations through building permit processes, working with property owners through development applications to achieve heritage conservation objectives while meeting other priorities, and limits any consideration of a property\u2019s value when faced with a demolition application.\nIndividual Property Designation\n\u2022\tA municipality would be prohibited from issuing a Notice of Intention to Designate any property unless it was included on the Heritage Register as of the date of a prescribed event as defined in the legislation.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. The proposed amendment will prohibit the designation of any property following a prescribed event unless the property was included first on the Heritage Register. As the Town\u2019s four-phase Heritage Register process was quite comprehensive, it is unlikely that a property with significant cultural heritage value has not yet been identified by the Town through this process.\n\u2022\tA regulatory amendment is proposed to require properties to meet two or more criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest as identified in Ontario Regulation 9\/06 Criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest. This would apply only to properties where a Notice of Intention to Designate is issued after the regulatory amendment comes into force.\no\tStaff have some concerns with this proposal. Future research and evaluation reports will identify where properties meet at least two of the three prescribed criteria for designation under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act. Staff will recommend those properties for designation that meet two or more criteria to Council, which has been typical practice for those properties historically designated under the OHA in the Town. However, this proposal could exclude some potentially significant cultural heritage resources which only meet one of the three criteria (i.e. highly significant historical and associative value) which could limit the Town\u2019s ability to conserve these resources through designation.\nHeritage Conservation Districts\n\u2022\tMunicipalities will be required to meet criteria for determining whether heritage conservation districts are of cultural heritage value or interest, in addition to having an official plan that includes provisions relating to the establishment of heritage conservation districts.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. Should the legislation come into effect, future Heritage Conservation Districts (HCDs) would be required to meet criteria established as part of a future legislation.\n\u2022\tAmendments to the OHA will allow the amendment or repeal of by-laws for heritage conservation districts with processes as described, however these processes are not defined.\no\tStaff do not have significant concerns with this proposal. The Syndicate Housing Heritage Conservation District (HCD) was established in 2005 and includes 10 properties. While existing legislation would require the repeal of an existing designation by-law and establishment of a new designation by-law, the proposed regulation would allow changes without the potential for appeals of the by-law to the Ontario Land Tribunal.\n",

Bill 23 proposes that the Minister can make unilateral decisions to remove provincial land from the protections of the heritage act. Profit for developers should be a lower priority than Ontario's environmental heritage. Ministers appointed by the premier cannot be trusted with the power to take land that b we longs to all citizens of Ontario and sell it off for development.\nBill 23 also makes it more difficult to designate properties for protection under the heritage act, and it makes it easier for owners and developers to remove properties from heritage protection.\nBill 23 is not about building homes faster, it is about making profits faster.\nThe crisis in Ontario is not a shortage of homes, it is a shortage of accessible, natural, greenspace. Natural areas are part of our heritage and should be protected for the future. We need them for our physical and mental health.  Natural areas need protection, not pavement-for-profit.\n",

This Bill strips municipalities of the ability to create their own Official Plan to control it's own development and the development charges necessary to build appropriate infrastructure.  It deprives the public of any say even the right of appeal. Furthermore, Heritage buildings and historic areas, considered culturally important or significant to the community, could well be targeted by developers for demolition. to push ahead their own agenda.  Much like our wetlands and agricultural land, once these heritage buildings or historic communities are gone, they are gone forever.  We are increasingly aware of the dangers of climate change and the importance of food security all of which are now threatened by Bill 23.\nI believe that this Bill is deeply flawed and ill considered.  I would strongly urge the government to scrap this Bill and move to build affordable housing in areas already deemed appropriate.\n",

It will greatly negatively impact the Ontario Heritage Act, the Planning Act, and the Ontario Land Tribunal Act, as well as environmental protections.\nI have been a renter for 12 years and I understand and acknowledge how important it is to have more housing, and affordable housing. However, heritage and environment protections are NOT barriers to growth, and in fact they are extremely important to continue to ensure that our communities can live fulfilling lives.\nThe impact of this bill on the environment especially is extremely worrying. There is no reason we cannot coexist with the important natural spaces that exist today. This bill quite frankly is just a way to push forward new regulations that will allow the developers and cities to make a quicker and bigger buck off of our disappearing natural spaces and will have a massive negative impact for future generations living in Ontario.\nAmong its potentially devastating effects, Bill 23 will give Ministerial power to override heritage protection, cripple the Heritage Register by making it impossible to keep a property listed for more than two years, change the criteria required for heritage designation of buildings and districts, and eliminate third-party appeals to the Ontario Land Tribunal by community organizations and residents -- only developers and municipalities will have that right.\nLeveraging the housing crisis to cut through hard-won heritage protections, and crucial environment protections, is not a solution.\nAs the saying goes about nature, \"when they go, we go\". I implore you to consider the short and long-term ramifications on your own families and communities in the future, of permitting this bill to pass.\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern\nOntario's conservation authority lands, along with our provincial parks  are the jewels of our province and have been held in trust by successive governments since their inception.  It has been the commonly held understanding that these \"conservancy\" lands would in fact be conserved in perpetuity. Having lived in Ontario for 63 years I would never have considered that these lands, or the Bruce Trail whose motto is \"Preserving a ribbon of wilderness, for everyone, forever\" could be threatened with development.\nThe Bruce Trail connects through land held and cared for by seven conservation authorities, representing 46 conservation areas along the Bruce Trail. Of the 70.2% of the 900 km Bruce Trail that is secured on permanently protected land, 25% or 146 km crosses conservation authority lands. The changes in Bill 23 could result in the permanent loss of the Bruce Trail and the conservation corridor containing it. This is a serious concern for the Bruce Trail Conservancy and all those who enjoy the iconic 900 km Bruce Trail.\nHaving hiked the entire length of the trail I can say with some authority that many of the developed lands and areas that already exist adjoining the edges of the trail contain large, very expensive, mansion like homes that do not represent the type of additional housing that could in any way be imagined as \"affordable\". The proposed development areas will destroy the very places that the folks who can't afford these lovely homes overlooking pristine nature lands can now access to enjoy our provinces natural gifts.\nI'm not politically ideological, and in fact have voted for the present government's party more than any other. This is the first time in my life that I've felt betrayed and upset enough to provide comment on a proposed bill. Please be assured that should you go ahead with this legislation I will not only never consider voting for your party again, but will do whatever I can to ensure its obstruction.\n",

However, given the breath of the criteria as drafted, this amendment alone will not be sufficient to remove barriers while ensuring the continued protection of heritage resource. Further amendments to O. Reg. 9\/06 are required to insert a standard of significance when considering each of the criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest, and an objecting definition of \u201csignificant\u201d should be added to the PPS that provides a measurable standard. Proposed amendments are included in the attached letter.\n\u2022\tIncreasing the standards for listing a property on a municipal register by requiring that the property meet one or more of the prescribed criteria may have the result of effectively removing the distinction between listing and designation. Any prescribed criteria for listing a property must ensure that the merits of designation are not pre-determined, as there is no appeal of a heritage listing.\n\u2022\tWhile the University is supportive of imposing timelines for a municipality to designate a listed property and preventing a municipality from designating a property that has not already been listed, the University is concerned that the proposed changes will have the unintended consequence of ultimately encouraging an increase in designations prior to the expiry of the two-year limitation period, particularly if the criteria for designation are not further refined. The University requests that provisions be added to allow the potential for the two-year time period for designation be extended upon the agreement of both the municipality and the owner.\n\u2022\tThe University is supportive of increasing rigor in the process of identifying and protecting heritage conservation districts, ensuring they are not used to freeze a community in a moment of time and restrict future investment and intensification. However, the economic needs of communities, such as the current housing crisis, and the needs of area institutions and significant employers must be given priority consideration before redevelopment is discouraged through HCD designation. Care must also be taken to not use HCDs as a tool for regulating standards of development that are properly prescribed by the municipal zoning bylaw.\n",

        "comment":"Comments on Bill 23, Schedule 6 Ontario Heritage Act\nI submit these comments based on 25+ years of professional experience in the cultural heritage field - first as a consultant, then as a heritage specialist for the provincial government, followed by managing the heritage department at an architecture firm and now as a partner in a heritage consulting firm.\nGenerally, I find the proposed amendments to be arbitrary, vague and excessively broad. Most will have a negative impact on the conservation of heritage properties in Ontario. None identify how they will advance the construction of housing in the province. My detailed comments are provided below.\nSection 27\nNew requirements for municipal registers and the\ninclusion of non-designated properties on the municipal register.\nProposed Change\nNew subsection 27(1.1) requires \u201cmunicipalities to make an up-to-date version of the information on their municipal register available on a publicly-accessible municipal website.\u201d\nComments: Many municipalities already maintain publicly accessible registers. These range from pdf documents to searchable databases to interactive maps. However, they can be five or more years old. Regardless, registers containing current information are a benefit to property owners and heritage professionals working on those properties.\nThe proposed change is a positive amendment which supports the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Recommend that the term \u2018up-to-date\u2019 be defined or guidance provided to municipalities as to how often to update their registers.\nProposed Change\nSubsection 27(3) will increase the standard for including a non-designated property on a municipal register by requiring that the property meet prescribed criteria. MCM is proposing to have the criteria currently included in O. Reg. 9\/06 apply to non-designated properties included on the municipal register and is proposing that the property must meet one or more of the criteria to be included, which would be facilitated through a regulatory change. MCM is further proposing that this requirement would apply only to those non-designated properties added to the municipal register on or after the date the legislative and regulatory amendments come into force.\nComments: Some municipalities are essentially using this approach to listing through a \u2018screening\u2019 process whereby one or more properties are screened against O. Reg. 9\/06 to identify potential cultural heritage value or interest. The potential cultural heritage value or interest can then be substantiated through a Cultural Heritage Evaluation Report (CHER) which requires in-depth research and analysis in order to support a designation by-law.\nThe proposed change is generally a positive amendment which supports the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: If criteria are to be prescribed, it is strongly recommended that the criteria in O. Reg. 9\/06 be used. The threshold for listing should remain at one criteria.\nProposed Change\nSubsections 27 (7), (8) and (13) will allow property owners to use the existing process under the OHA for objecting to the inclusion of their non-designated property on the municipal register regardless of when it was added to the municipal register.\nComments: Currently subsection 27 (7) and (8) permits a property owner to object inclusion on the register for properties included on or after July 1, 2021. It is unclear on what basis a property owner would object to a listing made prior to July 1, 2021.\nThis is a negative amendment and diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Recommend retaining the status quo. Property owners still retain the right to object to listings going forward and to the designation of their property.\nProposed Change\nNew Subsections 27 (14), (15), (16) requires that  non-designated properties currently included on a municipal register would have to be removed if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force.\nComments: This proposed amendment is arbitrary in terms of the two year timeframe for issuance of a NOID. It does not consider how many properties across the province will be affected by this, nor how many properties currently included on municipal registers are potential housing development sites. In short, this amendment does nothing to promote housing, rather it applies a blanket requirement on every municipality in Ontario regardless of current and proposed housing developments. It does not exempt municipally-owned properties. Why would a municipality remove one of its own properties from a register? Further, why should provincially-owned or controlled properties be removed if they are not subject to designation by municipalities?\nIt is also redundant given that Subsection 27(3) will require a higher standard for inclusion on a register using prescribed criteria, and that property owners have the right to object to their property being included on a register. Additionally, subsection 29 (1.2) is proposed to be re-enacted to provide that the municipality may give a notice of intention to designate the property only if the property was included in the register under subsection 27 (3) as of the date of the prescribed event.\nMoreover, subsection 27(3) requires increasing the standard for inclusion on a register. Why make municipalities undertake more work only to have it negated after two years?\nSubsection 27 (1.3) requires that before including a property on a register that the municipality consult with a municipal heritage committee. In my experience, the process for including properties on a register is substantial and transparent. It includes: public consultation; a heritage professional\u2019s  recommendations to city staff regarding heritage cultural heritage value or interest and a city staff reports to municipal heritage committee.\nThis is a negative amendment and diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Given that this amendment will impact upwards of 30,000 properties in Ontario (based on ACO estimate), it is imperative that it be removed from Bill 23 Schedule 6.\nIt is strongly recommended that MCM consult with the heritage community - volunteers, public and private sector heritage professionals on processes and timelines for either designating or removing \u2018listed\u2019 properties.\nProposed Change\nSubsection (17) maintains that consultation with the Municipal Heritage Committee is not required if a property is removed from the Register because the two-year time period has elapsed.\nComments: If subsection 27 (1.3) requires that before including a property on a register that the municipality consult with a municipal heritage committee why would not its removal also require consultation? This amendment is inconsistent with current requirements set out in the OHA.\nThis is a negative amendment and diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Until MCM can provide a rationale as to why this amendment is required, it should be removed Bill 23 Schedule 6.\nProposed Change\nSubsection (18) prohibits properties removed from a register under subsections 14, 15, 16 may not be listed again for a period of five years.\nComments: This proposed amendment is arbitrary in terms of the five year timeframe.\nThis is a negative amendment and diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Until MCM can provide a rationale as to why this amendment is required, it should be removed Bill 23 Schedule 6.\nIt is strongly recommended that MCM consult with the heritage community, particularly public sector heritage professionals on appropriate timelines for how and when properties are removed from a register.\nSection 29\nAn increase in the threshold for designation of individual properties\nand new limitations on designation for properties subject to proposed development.\nProposed Change\nIt is proposed to increase the threshold for the designation process by requiring that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation. This change would be achieved through a regulatory amendment to O. Reg. 9\/06.\nComments: It is not clear what this amendment is trying to address and why at least two criteria must be met. Has MCM conducted analysis into how many properties have been designated based on one O.Reg. 9\/06 criteria? Of these, how many have been the subject of an objection? How many are prospective housing development sites?\nThis is a negative amendment that diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: Until MCM can provide a rationale as to why this amendment is required, it should be removed Bill 23 Schedule 6.\nPrior to making any other amendments to Section 29, it is strongly recommended that MCM consult with the heritage community, particularly public and private sector heritage professionals.\nPart III.1\nChanges affecting the Standards and Guidelines\nfor Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties\nProposed Change\nMCM is proposing to introduce an enabling legislative authority that provides that the process for identifying provincial heritage properties under the S&Gs may permit the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism to review, confirm and revise, the determination of cultural heritage value or interest by a ministry or prescribed public body respecting a provincial heritage property. This process for Ministerial review would be set out through a revision to the S&Gs and may be applied to determinations made on or before the change comes into effect. If Bill 23 is passed, the ministry would develop and consult further on the proposed process under the S&Gs.\nComments: The S&Gs require that prescribed public bodies \u201cdevelop and implement a cultural heritage conservation policy and procedures(s) to identify and manage provincial heritage properties consistent with [the S&Gs].\u201d In addition, the ministry responsible for the S&Gs is the approval authority for the identification and evaluation process. Moreover, some prescribed public bodies have approved and well-established processes, but additionally heritage committees which review and approve of cultural heritage evaluation recommendations made by heritage professionals.\nAs such, it is unclear why this amendment is required. Further, applying it to determinations made prior to Bill 23 coming into effect undermines the effort undertaken to date by Ministries prescribed public bodies to identify and conserve provincial heritage properties.\nThis is a negative amendment that diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: This amendment must be removed from Bill 23. The Government of Ontario must be a leader in the identification and conservation of heritage properties, of local and provincial value in its ownership and control.\nIn order to be transparent and equal to the proposed requirements for municipal registers being up to date (subsection 27(1.1)), the government of Ontario must make the list of provincial heritage properties as well as their statements of heritage value publicly available.\nProposed Change\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council may, by order, provide that the Crown in right of Ontario or a ministry or prescribed public body is not required to comply with some or all of the heritage standards and guidelines approved under this section in respect of a particular property, if the Lieutenant Governor in Council is of the opinion that such exemption could potentially advance one or more of the following provincial priorities:\n\u25cf      Transit.\n\u25cf      Housing.\n\u25cf      Health and Long-Term Care.\n\u25cf      Other infrastructure.\n\u25cf      Such other priorities as may be prescribed.\nComments:\nAgain, it is unclear why this amendment is required. The S&G do not prohibit development on any provincial heritage property. The S&Gs does require that Ministeries and prescribed public bodies make \u201cbest efforts to avoid uses which adversely affect the cultural heritage value of a provincial heritage property\u201d (E.3) and that demolition is considered as a \u201clast resort, subject to heritage impact assessment and public engagement.\u201d (F.4) This is best heritage conservation practice.\nThe S&G apply to the ongoing protection, maintenance and use of provincial heritage properties as well as best practices for disposal and demolition. As a result, this amendment is too broad in its potential application. Would the government exempt itself from maintaining Osgoode Hall or the Sioux Lookout Courthouse (D1-D5), or mothballing the former Kingston Psychiatric Facility or Guelph Correctional Facility (F1-F4). Would it exempt itself from Minister\u2019s consent requirements for demolitions at Ontario Place or any other provincial heritage property of provincial significance  (F5)?\nThis is a negative amendment that diminishes the conservation, protection and preservation of properties in Ontario.\nRecommendations: This amendment must be removed from Bill 23. The Government of Ontario must be a leader in the identification and conservation of heritage properties, of local and provincial value in its ownership and control.\nIn order to be transparent and equal to the proposed requirements for municipal registers being up to date (subsection 27(1.1)), the government of Ontario must make the list of provincial heritage properties as well as their statements of heritage value publicly available.\nThank you.\n",

Not only will economic development be affected but housing and climate change will be unfairly implemented as well. Heritage land will not be protected and will negatively affect the lives of homeowners. A community should always have the right to be aware of what is going on within the public. This bill deprives them of that right and initiates unfair treatment. To protect this from happening, there needs to be steps that take place in order to protect this Bill from passing. The Greenbelt act will be changed through construction on households and communities within the land that needs to be protected. In conclusion, I do not agree with Bill 23. It is unfair that this bill holds consequences on the lives of hard-working individuals just to distruct valuable land.\n",

It will worsen climate change by destroying carbon sinks like forests, wetlands and grasslands. It will lead to more people suffering from mental health problems because of a reduction of natural spaces, which are known to be places of solace and healing for people with anxiety, depression and other conditions. It will lead to more damage to homes when they are built in flood plains or on unstable soils. And it will lead to the destruction of our built and ecological heritage, which will lead to lower tourism and civic pride.\nThese are just a few of the consequences that will result if this bill is passed in its current form.

        "comment":"As an emerging professional who has studied and worked in the field of heritage conservation over the past decade, I respectfully submit my objection to the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act as part of Bill 23. Amidst an inarguable housing crisis, I agree and support efforts towards creating affordable and safe housing options in communities across Ontario. However, I disagree with the posturing that the Ontario Heritage Act and the conservation of cultural heritage sites are actors perpetuating this crisis. Frankly, the proposed amendments will not create more affordable housing options for those that call Ontario home and they disregard and undermine representation of Ontario\u2019s multicultural history and cultural heritage assets.\nBy requiring the removal of buildings listed on the Heritage Register after two years (if there is no \u2018intent to designate\u2019 issued), and the subsequent restriction of including properties formerly on the register for five years, Bill 23 removes an important tool for communities in identifying and protecting valuable cultural assets. The strict timelines proposed alongside the prescribed evaluation criteria for designating properties would impose an impractical and impossible workload for municipal workers. Further, requiring the of properties from the register and from consideration of future developments wastes the effort and work that municipal staff have previously spent reviewing and compiling registers that capture an area\u2019s cultural significance. Bill 23 will wildly destabilize municipal registers whose contents will be defined by arbitrarily established 2 and 5-year cycles. Property will be added to the list, will come off due to a scarcity of municipal resources or absence of need, and then may return to the Register once the 5-year period has lapsed. The status of the province\u2019s 31,000 non-designated properties will be ever-shifting, creating a murky set of requirements to property owners, like a game with a shifting rulebook. Further, currently there is a deadline for submitting objections to a property listing, the proposed amendment would permit objections to be filed at any time, even years later. The impact would destabilize the heritage listing and approval process, creating more backlog.\nIncreasing the threshold for listing and designation under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act will make it more difficult to address reconciliation as well as issues of equity, diversity and inclusion in the protection of cultural heritage resources in Ontario. There are many properties that reflect underrepresented groups that would no longer meet the criteria for designation under Section 29 Part IV. This will mean that the current inequity in the criteria will continue to assign more value to the contributions of architecture and well-documented histories rather than recognizing the diverse stories that make up Ontario\u2019s history. Any revision to provincial criteria must ensure that underrepresented communities can still protect the cultural heritage resources that are important to them.\nAs noted by the Ontario Association of Heritage Professionals (OAHP), when the Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force was released earlier this year, OAHP supported recommendation 4, \u201cPermit \u201cas of right\u201d conversion of underutilized or redundant commercial properties to residential or mixed residential and commercial use\u201d; however, there are significant barriers that inhibit the conversion of existing buildings in Ontario, such as building code limitations\/requirements and a lack of skilled trades. Introducing policies to support reuse or repurposing of existing buildings and the removal of certain \u2018new build\u2019 requirements for existing buildings would lead to more housing faster. Addressing these barriers and providing incentives for the conversion and expansion of existing buildings as well as additional adaptive re-use training programs would increase the ability for the Province to provide affordable and sustainable housing. In the face of unprecedented and ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that the existing building stock and the embodied carbon of these materials be considered as part of our future. Heritage buildings and sites of cultural heritage significance can support intensification through building conversion and adaptation and allow for more homes to be constructed through infill projects.\nI with many others urge the Province to ensure that the path forward in addressing the housing crisis is not at the expense of built heritage resources, cultural heritage landscapes, and archaeological resources.\n",

        "comment":"According to what I've read, bill 23 appears to be primarily focused on economic gain while mostly ignoring the community and environmental effects. In terms of reducing climate change, these new regulations would be a huge step backward because they permit far more environmentally harmful development in the province. The government asserts that by offsetting, it will compensate for the loss of wetlands, woods, and other natural areas brought about by new construction. This would guarantee the loss of these significant natural lands, which would then be repaired or restored elsewhere. This legislation poses significant and possibly permanent environmental hazards. Building over wetlands represents a significant reduction in the ecosystem services that wetlands offer. Wetlands must be safeguarded through economic expansion and development. The implementation of housing and climate change policies will be unjust. Heritage land won't be protected, which will have a severe impact on homeowners' lives.\n",

        "comment":"--Following text is verbatim the PDF file uploaded--\nProposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) - the Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022\nComments Submitted to the Environmental Registry of Ontario\nAs a practicing heritage professional I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to critical legislation in Ontario. Periodic revision to the Ontario Heritage Act is key to ensuring it reflects national and international best practices, and remains an effective and efficient means by which to conserve the cultural heritage of this province.\nSome of the proposed changes represent positive refinements in how the Ontario Heritage Act operates and should be recongized as such. Generally speaking, these include the requirements for municipalities to keep an up to date version of their municipal register accessible; requirements for non-designated property to meet prescribed criteria in order to be included on the register; and requirements for new HCDs to meet prescribed criteria.\nHowever a number of concerning proposals represent fundamental changes to the ways that heritage properties are identified and conserved in Ontario. Some of these changes seem arbitrary in nature and will negatively impact governments\u2019 and communities' ability to identify and conserve cultural heritage. These changes also carry unintended consequences that may result in unnecessary increases in regulation and restriction on property owners. Please find below some specific comments on these items of concern.\n1.0 Regarding two year limits for non-designated properties included on the heritage register\n1.1 Proposed Changes:\n-Non-designated properties currently included on a municipal register would have to be removed if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force.\n-Non-designated properties included on the register after the proposed amendment comes into force would have to be removed if council does not issue a NOID within two years of the property being included.\n-If removed from the register under any of the above three circumstances, the property cannot be relisted for a period of five years.\n1.2 Comment:\nThese proposed changes represent a fundamental change in the way that municipal heritage registers are used by municipalities. Effectively, registers would no longer serve as a repository for non-designated and designated properties. They would instead function as a list of designated properties, with a smaller rolling list of properties that will either be designated or removed within two years.\nInevitably, the proposed amendment will result in the designation of a significant number of properties across the province that have hitherto been non-designated, but identified through inclusion on the register. Designation represents a far more rigorous form of regulation: it is more costly to property owners in terms of money and time, and restrictive in what changes can be made to a property. Under the proposed amendment municipalities will need to designate important properties they do not want to come off the register, inevitably imposing these new burdens onto countless Ontarians whose properties have been effectively managed, often for decades, through listing alone.\nThe proposed amendment implies that non-designated properties on the register are simply  those that have not been designated yet, and renders obsolete the long-standing use of non-designated inclusion as a status unto itself. This effectively removes a popular and non-invasive mechanism from municipalities\u2019 toolkits, which to reiterate, identifies properties of cultural heritage value or interest while minimizing costs and other regulatory requirements for property owners. The change would also affect municipalities\u2019 abilities to include property owned by provincial and federal governments on heritage registers.\nThis proposed temporary status for non-designated properties contradicts other parts of the proposed changes: requiring municipalities to demonstrate a higher standard for listing properties while simultaneously making it more difficult to retain listed properties on the register is logically inconsistent, counter-productive and inefficient for municipalities.\nThe basis and justification for a two year review period is unclear. For many municipalities it may be challenging to feasibly designate all listed properties within a two year period. In practice, many properties may be removed from municipal registers owing to a lack of municipal resources, rather than insufficient cultural heritage value or interest. With this in mind, the five year period under which properties cannot be re-listed may serve to be punitive and obstructionist to municipalities, further undermining their ability to identity and conserve cultural heritage resources.\n1.3 Recommendation\nThese proposed amendments will negatively impact communities\u2019 and municipalities\u2019 abilities to identify and conserve cultural heritage properties, while at the same time imposing stronger regulations onto property owners. It is therefore recommended that amendments requiring all non-designated properties to be struck from the register be removed from Bill 23.\n2.0 Regarding an increase in the threshold for designation of individual properties\n2.1 Proposed Changes:\n-MCM is proposing to provide further rigour in the designation process by increasing the threshold by requiring that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation. This change would be achieved through a regulatory amendment to O. Reg. 9\/06 Criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest. MCM is further proposing that this requirement would apply only to properties where the notice of intention to designate (NOID) is published on or after the date the regulatory amendment comes into force.\n2.2 Comment:\nOntario\u2019s heritage framework is premised on values-based conservation, whereby a place\u2019s heritage significance is determined according to the nature and strength of its particular values. As currently written, the Ontario Regulation 9\/06 criteria present a framework into which values must fit to be designated under the Ontario Heritage Act. However the ultimate determination of significance is based on the nature and strength of the particular values.\nWhile meeting two criteria can be considered a higher threshold in a numeric sense, it is not inherently indicative of increased significance within a values-based system. Public and private sector professionals have experience in applying the criteria, and determining significance based on the quality and strength of its values, not using quantitative metrics. As such, a requirement to meet two criteria in order to designate represents a potentially artificial threshold - one that is at odds with the system of values-based conservation, and one that undermines trained professionals\u2019 ability to determine whether a property should be considered significant and designated under the Ontario Heritage Act.\nA requirement for meeting several criteria may also impact the ability to designate Cultural Heritage Landscapes under the Ontario Heritage Act. Some Cultural Heritage Landscapes, (particularly associative-category landscapes, most often associated with Indigenous communities) are distinguished by an absence of physical artifacts or monuments. Associative landscapes are integral to the very concept of cultural landscapes as developed by UNESCO, and are reflected in cultural landscape practice throughout the world. However many associative landscapes may not qualify for designation in Ontario, given a requirement for meeting multiple criteria.\nThe proposal to create a higher threshold for designating individual properties will negatively impact communities\u2019 and municipalities\u2019 abilities to identify and conserve cultural heritage properties by creating an arbitrary and artificial new threshold for designation, undermining professionals trained in determining significance, and making it harder to designate sites without obvious physical or built resources, including cultural heritage landscapes.\n2.3 Recommendation\nIt is recommended that the proposed requirement for meeting two criteria be removed. If an increased threshold is desired, this should be articulated in terms of the O. Reg. 9\/06 criteria themselves. This means providing clearer instructions on interpreting the criteria, providing an opportunity to articulate thresholds for significance within a values-based conservation framework.\n\u2013END\u2013\n",

        "comment":"The end does not justify the means outlined in this proposal. The changes proposed in this document are apparent in their goals, which are to facilitate the development of a greater supply of housing, and to concentrate power in order to do so. I take issue with the flagrant disregard for local governance with the imposition of ministerial review and revision for assessments of heritage value, and the exemption of the LGIC from the standards and guidelines of heritage conservation. These apparatuses give disproportionate and arbitrary power to provincial officials to override both local concerns and the province's own rules. This is, at best, undemocratic, and at worst, an abuse of power.\nSimilarly, the automatic removal of non-designated properties from municipal heritage registers, the increasing difficultly to create new heritage designations, and the reshaping of heritage conservation districts into an \"iterative tool to facilitate development\" impose limitations on local government and their heritage priorities. Cultural heritage resources are finite and in many cases, provide both the character and tourism appeal for municipalities throughout Ontario. To squander these resources for the sake of rapid development would be foolhardy. Any amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act should prioritize the adaptive re-use of heritage structures to meet the needs of the communities in which they are found, rather than focusing on the removal of heritage protections and running roughshod over municipalities that seek to protect these finite resources. Greater municipal density and more housing options can be better achieved through collaboration with local authorities and not at the expense of local heritage.\n",

Has the government studied these possible economic losses?  This in turn will harm local residents ability to afford the housing Bill 23 is supposedly trying to create. In many communities small and large there is NO SHORTAGE of available land to build on. Why force the issue of the convention of municipalities using this \"listing\" function rather than designation when it doesn't actually put real constraints on the property owner beside providing notice to the city if planning to demolish etc? I have not been able to find a rational in Bill 23 for implementing this chaos creation.\nIn addition to the negative economic impacts of municipalities losing sites of significance for cultural heritage this Bill also blatantly ignores Indigenous communities and any different types of strategies they may need to protect areas of significance for their communities. It is not honouring Ontario's commitment to the TRC recommendations or UNDRIP. Has the government studied how these changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will impact Indigenous communities?

Rather the older buildings should be retrofitted for the new desired purpose. This would significantly reduce time of construction, reduce budget costs, and would greatly reduce the amount of building waste going to landfills and new materials needing to be manufactured which also creates an emissions impact. Use what's already in place!\n",

        "comment":"Official Statement from the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Network regarding Proposed Bill 23\nThe Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Network maintains UNESCO\u2019s mandate and designation of the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere\nThe Niagara Escarpment Biosphere represents an extensive stretch of forested land in south-central Ontario which includes two major biomes, boreal needleleaf forests and temperate broadleaf forests. The Biosphere remains one of Ontario\u2019s most scenic landscapes and offers a mix of both natural and urban environments. The main goals of the Biosphere are to preserve the region\u2019s ecological diversity, to encourage stakeholders to use sustainable practices, and to uphold socio-cultural relationships through educational programs and tourism.\nProposed Bill 23\u2019s erosion of the Greenbelt, which intersects the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere from Niagara to Tobermory, is effectively an attack on biodiversity and on the capacity of our natural areas and farmlands to provide ecosystem benefits, human physical and mental health benefits, and in this time of food insecurity, the ability to feed ourselves. If we learned one thing from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is that the best prevention for future recurrence is biodiversity and people\u2019s ability to immerse themselves in open spaces.\nThrough UNESCO\u2019s Man and Biosphere Programme, biosphere regions are established to cover internationally designated areas that are \u201cmeant to demonstrate a balanced relationship between people and nature\u201d and promote sustainable development. Biosphere regions contain three zones. These include Core Areas, which comprise strictly protected lands that conserve landscapes, ecosystems, and species and genetic variation; Buffer Zones, that surround Core Areas and are intended for activities compatible with sustainable ecological practice; and Transition Areas, that are intended to foster sustainable economic activities.\nOntario\u2019s proposed Bill 23 presents a clear and present threat to the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere.\nThe partners in our network are diverse and include sectors ranging from conservation trusts, to environmental organizations, to conservation authorities, to colleges and universities, to municipalities, to Indigenous nations, organizations, and groups, to sustainable businesses, to non-governmental organizations, and more, representing populations within Ontario that possess credentialed knowledge and the healthy human empathy required to provide responsible solutions to housing needs. All seek to maintain their agency and voice and to be respectively heard in responding to the singular strategy that Bill 23 represents.\nWhile several important sectors have been publicly muted, meaning some of the leading experts in conservation are being prevented from sharing their knowledge and insights, sitting in silence as the green and conservation lands previously believed to be protected are placed in jeopardy, numerous questions arise.\nFor example, what data or intel does the province have to suggest that allowing development in currently, and appropriately, protected lands is good public policy or good land use planning? Has the process included sound science including the traditional knowledge and perspectives of Indigenous peoples? Why does the legislation essentially eviscerate municipal, ie. community, authority over the manner and means by which local people define and shape their towns and quality of life? Has it assessed, for example, standing Indigenous land claims, treaty rights, and unceded territory recognition, or is the province leading development speculators and the public purse into protracted conflicts?\nWe agree that the provision of adequate and affordable housing is of vital importance. But destroying long-established conserved and protected lands in pursuit of that objective is neither a sensible, nor honourable, nor appropriate option. A thorough public process that allows for conscientious dialogue and consideration of creative options to protect biodiversity, and that provides adequate time for fulsome assessment and discourse, is one we would support.\nSincerely,\nPatrick Robson, MCIP RPP \/ President and Chair\nCharlene Winger, Water Walker \/ Vice President and Vice Chair\n",

        "comment":"Reiterating comments previously made that I wholeheartedly support -\nWhile the intent of the Bill - to create more housing - is laudable, there is nothing in the bill that guarantees that additional housing will be built. The Bill is in large part premised on the fact that if costs are reduced and timelines to decision advanced, that this will result in more construction, but it does not address other realities in the complex world of development. Developers deal with an array of issues that impact decisions to advance to development, including interest rates, financing, access to construction supplies and labour. There is nothing in the Bill compelling a developer to advance an approval to construction or to pass forward any cost savings to consumers; developers sell housing at the price that the market will bear. In addition, the revenue loss to the City would dramatically impact the City's financial position and ability to provide infrastructure necessary to support the significant growth in population; as a result, the Bill may have the effect of slowing housing supply, counter to Provincial objectives. In addition, there is nothing in the Bill to address the issue of affordability within the market. It is questionable if the Bill will result in the increased level of development envisioned, but the effects of the Bill on community infrastructure, parks, and affordable housing are certain and would have significant impacts on the livability of the City.\n",

I believe this is a misguided and seriously flawed piece of legislation and urge your Government not to enact this Bill.\nThe Ontario Heritage Act has been painstakingly crafted over the past decades with input from hundreds of eminently qualified people . The proposed changes to this Act undermine, and weaken the the regulations beyond reason. Effectively, you've used a sledgehammer to kill a flea in the effort to accelerate home construction.\nAdditionally, I believe the plan to use several thousand acres of Greenbelt lands for development is inappropriate and represents a dangerous precedent. The Greenbelt should be left intact as was originally intended.\nAlso, the planned changes to eliminate a citizen's right to appeal municipal zoning changes is a dangerous prospect which undermines the fundamental rights of Ontario residents. I don't believe there has ever been a period in my adult life when private citizens did not have this right of appeal.\nThe greatest beneficiaries of this proposed legislation will be private developers who will be constructing expensive, suburban homes for affluent buyers. The high profile and costly advertising campaign funded by the Ontario Homebuilders Association to promote this legislation is a testament to the anticipated profits of developers.\nI can say unequivocally that the voters of Ontario did not vote for this type of legislation when your government was re-elected this spring.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal fundamentally alters the purpose of the Heritage Register.  In Barrie, it has been used to provide identification of heritage properties.  This identification has been used to allow consideration of the impact of development on heritage properties.  Listing properties on the Historic Register in Barrie has been voluntary, and owners have been assured that registering their property does not imply a requirement to designate.\nThe proposal converts the character of the Heritage Register to a list of properties proposed for designation, instead of a tool for intelligent planning of development in heritage areas.  While listing on the Heritage Register has been free, the designation process requires considerable expense on the part of the proponent.  The result will be to discourage listing of heritage properties on the register, greatly to limit the number of properties on the register, and thus to deprive municipalities of an important planning tool.  It will facilitate development in heritage areas without consideration of the impact on the neighbourhood.\nThe soul of a municipality is manifested in its history and heritage areas; removing protection of most heritage properties will facilitate erosion of municipal character.  This will be most unfortunate.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23 proposes changes to the Ontario Heritage Act on the premise that its \u201cred tape\u201d and restrictions impede development.  There is absolutely no evidence to back up this assertion.  To use the affordability housing tag to fundamentally dismantle the Ontario Heritage Act is also not borne out by reality.\nHeritage designation under Part IV and Heritage Districts under Part V of the current Act have not deterred development.  In fact, many developers have used Heritage to add cach\u00e9 and charm to their otherwise mundane projects.  The bureaucracy of processing heritage applications can be time-consuming, sometimes due to the reluctance of municipalities to employ dedicated heritage planning staff and sometimes due to the reluctance of developers to provide adequate heritage impact assessments.\nIn the case of Heritage Conservation Districts, Design Guidelines are a requirement of the Act.  Most guidelines that I have written or reviewed do not in any way deter development but rather direct development in an appropriate manner consistent with the heritage character a municipality wants to retain.  Developers have actually found that this direction has led to desirable and profitable developments.  The Bill, therefore, does not need to tamper with the Ontario Heritage Act, as it does not deter from providing affordable housing.\nIn fact, many municipalities have recently enacted bylaw changes allowing \u201ccoachhouse\u201d development or additional units within existing residential structures.  Heritage guidelines actually encourage this development which allows small up to 1000 square feet units within existing stable residential heritage neighbourhoods with infrastructure and services already in place.  This approach would be much more likely to provide additional housing than any changes to the Ontario Heritage Act.  This practice could also be expanded further by giving financial incentives to encourage homeowners to explore this attractive option.  Such incentives would also help owners conserve and maintain there valuable heritage properties.\n",

        "comment":"The More Homes Built Faster Act proposes various changes to the Ontario Heritage Act. Three changes should be particularly alarming for Indigenous communities in the province: 1) New Section 25.2 (7) of the Act 'will authorize the Lieutenant Governor in Council to, by order, exempt the Crown, a ministry or a prescribed public body from having to comply with the heritage standards and guidelines in respect of a particular property, if the Lieutenant Governor in Council is of the opinion that such exemption could potentially advance one or more provincial priorities', such as housing, infrastructure, or any other priority that is deemed significant. In practice, this would mean that any lands of importance to an Indigenous community could be developed if it is in the interest of the province, regardless of protection at a municipal or provincial level.\n2) Several fundamental changes to the process of 'listing' properties on municipal registers have been outlined in the Build More Homes Faster Act. A register is a tool used by municipalities to trigger heritage assessments on properties that have been deemed to have potential heritage value but have not yet been assessed by the municipality. If the Act is passed thousands of properties currently understood to have potential value to communities, including Indigenous communities, will be removed from the register within two years, with no mechanism to evaluate and conserve their value if an alteration of the site is proposed. This could mean that development may occur on lands currently used as Indigenous hunting grounds, sites that serve as wayfinding points, harvesting grounds, and ceremonial sites that do not include burials. With no mechanism to object on grounds of cultural heritage, Indigenous communities may be left with few options for protection of these areas.\n3) A change is proposed to ensure fewer cultural resources are identified in the province, accomplished by raising the bar of evaluation under Ontario Regulation 9\/06. As proposed in the More Homes Built Faster Act, a cultural resource will be required to meet two criteria outlined in Ontario Regulation 9\/06, the tool used when evaluating cultural heritage in the province. This will mean that many heritage resources may not meet the threshold, even though they have value to a community. For Indigenous communities, this will result in a further loss of control over culturally significant spaces or places, which will be in danger of removal to privilege settler development.\nThe Chiefs of Ontario have unequivocally stated that the More Homes Built Faster Act is in clear violation of First Nations constitutionally protected treaty rights. Substantial heritage sites in the province, and particularly Indigenous heritage sites, will be lost if the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act are passed as written.\n",

        "comment":"Regarding: ERO number 019-6196\nProposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) - the Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022\nThe creation of affordable, accessible, and safe housing is a crisis in Ontario and actions are required to address this. Heritage conservation and housing are not, however; as the Report of the Housing Affordability Task Force may be seen to indicate, oppositional constructs or adversarial in their intents. The adaptive reuse of heritage buildings and the appropriate use of in-fill and new housing developments that are scaled and designed in consideration of their surrounding neighborhoods are an environmentally responsive, timely and sustainable way of providing more housing across Ontario.\nThrough this submission the staff from the City of Kingston\u2019s Heritage Services Department offer comment on the proposed legislative and regulatory amendments through schedule 6 to Bill 23. Given the brevity of the commenting timeline this submission represents City staff comments only and does not represent a position of Council. Bill 23 amends the Ontario Heritage Act with the stated intent of helping to remove barriers to housing development by updating how heritage properties are identified and conserved by municipalities and the Province of Ontario. There are several key themes in these amendments around which we organize our comments, and these are reviewed in the sections that follow.\nChanges to the Municipal Heritage Register:\nThe changes introduced in Bill 23 related to the Municipal Heritage Register are not without significant impacts, especially as the required information to be shared on the register has not been provided. At present the City of Kingston has its register available to the public, where the register shares the property address and provides some limited notes on the property and the category of protection.  If the information required to be shared were to include, as is anticipated, the relevant designation by-laws and\/or updated statements of cultural heritage value\/interest then significant work will need to be done to prepare these documents and update them to meet the current accessibility standards for municipalities.\nBill 23 additionally introduces that properties that are included on the register must meet a new test for inclusion; this test would require that even a \u201clisted\u201d property meet certain prescribed criteria. The new criteria have not been defined; however, it is anticipated that they will align with the criteria already established for the designation of individual properties under section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act. These criteria are defined through O. Reg. 9\/06. The City of Kingston has over 300 \u201clisted\u201d properties on its heritage register. These properties will need to be reassessed based on the criteria once defined. It is expected that this will be a resource intensive process and introduce a redundancy into staff workflows as it will force a detailed consideration of all listed properties within a prescribed timeline as opposed to the current process which sees staff provide detailed consideration in-response to specific requests to demolish or remove.\nThere are not enough Heritage planning staff at the City to support this process and budgetary constraint is a reality for all municipal departments. In short, there is neither staff resource, nor budget to address these changes. The outcome will be a loss of heritage properties across the City, confusion amongst \u201clisted\u201d property owners, and a distraction of staff focus to \u201cre-listing or defacto designating\u201d properties already on the register with little to no anticipated correlation to increased housing supply. The seemingly arbitrary two-year timeline introduced regarding these required changes only further compounds the concerns noted above and ensures heritage loses to be the likely outcome, as does the 5-year timeline prohibiting a property from being added back onto the registry.\nFurther, the removal of properties from the register does not remove their heritage value or the City\u2019s potential interest in designating them in the future. Once these properties are removed from the register perspective purchasers will have additional challenges when making an informed purchase decision and could be dismayed to later discover that the City intends to relist the property or designate the property. This adds uncertainty and a lack of transparency for new homeowners and adds additional burdens to municipal staff who will need to message the unclear intents of the mandated listing\/delisting cycle.\nThe bill will also allow all property owners of listed properties to object to the listing of their property regardless of when the property was listed. Dealing with these new and retroactive objections will be an additional drain on staff time and resources. The grounds for objections need to be clearly defined and limited to matters of heritage and\/or the to-be-defined listing criteria.\nChanges in Relation to Criteria for Designations and Heritage Conservations Districts (HCDs):\nThe changes introduced in Bill 23 related to the designation of individual properties and HCDs include that properties will need to meet additional criteria for a designation to be advanced. This change is expected to be implemented through forthcoming changes to O. Reg 9\/06. Requiring all properties to meet additional criteria raises concerns about equity and representation within municipal designations. The current regulation criteria disproportionately favour the protection of specific kinds of properties and increasing the number of these criteria that must be met for designation will act as a further barrier to a more diverse, equitable and inclusive approach to property designations and protections. The same concern exists for the criteria used to assess the advancement of listed properties.\nThe changes introduced in Bill 23 related specifically to HCDs include the creation of a process to repeal and amend an HCD or an HCD plan. Clear direction on how and when an HCD or HCD plan can be amended is welcomed as presently the Ontario Heritage Act does not provide any clear direction in this regard. We hope that the process will be transparent and limited in scope and frequency, as the value of HCD plans is in ensuring the stable character of a district while appropriately managing growth. If changes and amendments are frequently allowed it will destabilize the districts and create confusion for developers, property owners and the community.\nIn Kingston our rich inventory of heritage buildings and our three HCDs are part of a broader community ecosystem, defining community character and contributing to regional tourism and community vitality. Frequent alterations to HCDs could result in rapid changes in this landscape and will have associated economic impacts. Introducing specific criteria for the creation of HCDs and HCD plans could be assistive in regularizing the approach to these conservation tools across  Ontario. Care must be taken in defining these criteria, including meaningful public consultation, to ensure that the criteria do not discriminate against the designation of the cultural heritage landscapes, or further marginalize and remove the cultural heritage connections to underrepresented community histories.\nChanges in relation to \u201cPrescribed Events\u201d under the Planning Act:\nSetting aside what was introduced through Bill 108, Bill 23 effectively restricts Council from issuing a notice of intent to designate if a property, subject to a \u201cprescribed event\u201d under the Planning Act, is not already included on the heritage register. This restriction essentially removes acts of discovery as reasons to advance designations and assumes that at the time of application the City is fully aware of all heritage considerations on all properties. It also perpetuates the false assumption that heritage properties are inherently \u201cblocks\u201d to development and sidelines the value of adaptive reuse as an appropriate means of generating new housing.\nIn response to Bill 23 staff will need to spend time and resources to scan for emerging developments such that they can move to list or designate the property within the timelines established by Bill 23 and in advance of prescribed events. Community development and heritage are better served by the continued process as established through Bill 108, which allows for discovery and establishes a reasonable timeline for heritage protections to be advanced if appropriate.\nChanges in relation to Provincially Designated Properties:\nBill 23 introduces amendments to section 25.2 of the Ontario Heritage Act and provides the Ministry designated to administer the statute with further powers to remove publicly owned properties from municipal heritage processes where goals related to the development of transit, housing, health and long-term care or other forms of infrastructure are considered to have over-riding importance. It also extends powers to the Lieutenant Governor to offer exemptions. These removals and exemptions can also be applied retroactively. Some of Kingston\u2019s most significant heritage properties are those currently protected through the Provincial Standards and Guidelines. The threshold for these powers of exemption or removal should be transparent and high, such that they are only used in the most exceptional of circumstances. The protections offered through the Standards and Guidelines are significant and uphold the contributions these properties make to the collective history and heritage of Ontario. To allow for the frequent removal of these properties from heritage processes would be an exceptional move resulting in exceptional loses.\nThe changes introduced through schedule 6 to Bill 23 will have tremendous impacts on how we protect and conserve heritage within the Province of Ontario and in Kingston specifically. We appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments and remain interested in any opportunities moving forward to assist in developing strategies and implementing regulations that will improve the protections and processes of the Ontario Heritage Act. There are ways to support more homes to be built faster that do not place our valued cultural heritage resources at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for providing the opportunity for the County of Bruce to comment on Bill 23 and the associated legal and regulatory changes through the Environmental Registry.\nBruce County and our eight local municipalities are committed to supporting the province\u2019s goals to increase housing supply, bring more affordable housing to market and streamline the development process to get more homes built faster.\nAhead of the introduction of Bill 23, Bruce County and its partner municipalities were already working on initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing by updating planning documents to permit additional residential units as-of-right; creating an affordable housing tool kit for developers; and streamlining development approvals. Bruce County delivers planning services to our 8 partner municipalities and also delivers a range of housing services, including the construction of County owned\/operated housing.\nThe timing of the release and commenting deadlines associated with Bill 23 was not sufficient for staff to seek input from the newly elected County Council. As such, our comments reflect staff\u2019s input on the changes proposed in Bill 23 and are informed by discussions with municipal staff, area Conservation Authority staff (Grey Sauble and Saugeen Valley), and the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Environment Office.\nThis letter outlines areas of concern with the Heritage Act changes outlined in this ERO posting.\nChanges to the Heritage Act impact how municipalities can identify and protect cultural heritage properties. The proposed changes would require municipalities and municipal heritage committees to review and designate all properties listed on a municipal heritage registry over the next 2 years if they wish to protect them. If properties are not listed within 2 years, they could not be considered for designation for a further 5 years. Many smaller municipalities rely on the work of volunteers to identify and do the work to support designation of cultural heritage properties. It is unclear how these changes will assist with building homes faster in a Bruce County context.\nThere is uncertainty in the legislation where reference is made to regulations that include further criteria for designating individual properties and establishing cultural heritage districts.\nThe protection of cultural heritage is important to the residents and visitors to Bruce County. The built heritage in many of our municipalities ensures attraction of businesses and residents to invest in our communities.\nWe recommend that the province release further details of the proposed regulatory criteria for designating individual properties and conservation districts and provide additional time to review these regulations prior to changing the Heritage Act.\nConsultation on Bill 23 Changes:\nThe timing of the release of Bill 23 and the limited commenting period that has been provided is a matter of great concern. The tabling of this legislation the day after the municipal election during a period where many local Councils and County Council were unable to hold meetings to review the proposed changes with staff and provide formal comment through Council resolutions is problematic. Given the significance of the proposed changes, staff are providing comment in the absence of County Council having the opportunity to provide formal comment.\nBruce County appreciated the apparent extension to consultation on the proposed changes in Bill 23 and was stunned and disappointed at the move to pass the legislation regardless. This submission is to record the County's displeasure with these actions taken by the Province, and the missed opportunity for meaningful consultation with municipalities about the foundational changes enacted through this legislation. We encourage the province to come to the table with organizations such as AMO, ROMA and the Warden\u2019s Caucus\u2019s across Ontario who represent the viewpoint of upper-tier and local municipalities across the province.\nThe County also encourages meaningful dialogue and consultation with First Nations communities across Ontario about the changes proposed in Bill 23. The extent of changes in Bill 23 have an impact on Aboriginal and Treaty Rights. The changes in Bill 23, in addition to the changes in Bill 109, challenge the County\u2019s ability to engage in meaningful consultation with the First Nation communities in whose territory we provide planning services. Consideration of the Crown\u2019s Duty to consult with First Nations must be considered by the province as part of the consultation on the changes included in Bill 23.\nFurther Considerations:\nThe County of Bruce and its partner municipalities look forward to working in partnership with the provincial government to ensure the supply of attainable and affordable housing.\nThe County supports innovative changes that build on the County\u2019s best practices of streamlining the development process. County staff continue to work with the Western Ontario Warden\u2019s Caucus, County Planning Directors and AMO to share best practices.\nThank you for taking the time to read our comments and concerns on Bill 23 and the associated consultation.\n",

        "comment":"I am forwarding a letter I received from Faye Langmaid, a Heritage Planner in Clarington. Her criticisms of Bill 23 reflect mine and my colleagues who are in the heritage industry in Ontario. This bill, made without consultation with Indigenous and minority groups in Ontario, has the potential to do significant harm to the diversity of our heritage resources. Faye's letter follows:\nRE: Proposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) -\nthe Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022, ERO 019-6196 Bill 23, More Homes Built\nFaster Act, an Act to amend various statutes etc.\nPlease accept this Written Submission with respect to the ERO 019-6196 posting, part of\nBill 23.\nI am writing to the Committee as an individual and as a Registered Professional Planner in\nthe Province of Ontario with over 30 years of professional practice in this province. I\u2019m also\nwriting as an individual who has spent the majority of my professional experience working\nfor municipalities as a land use planner responsible for the review of development proposals\nand the development of greenland networks within neighbourhoods. Over the course of my\ncareer, I have facilitated the development of numerous parks, trails and open space\nsystems and housing through subdivision approvals while attempting to safeguard nature\nand balance the competing interests of the public and developers. My deep experience of\nhow our land use planning processes work as a manager and director provides me with a\nbroad understanding of the mechanics across the Acts and spectrum of changes being\nproposed.\nTwo of the proposals stand out. Forcing communities to drop \u201clisted\u201d properties from their\nheritage registers if they are not designated in two years and requiring that the standard for\ndesignation of properties be hiked from at least one of Ontario\u2019s heritage criteria to two.\nRequiring a property meet two of the legislated criteria for designation, instead of one, will\nmake it challenging to protect the often-humble buildings and places associated with the\nhistoric contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco-Ontarian, multicultural, and 2SLGBTQIA+\ncommunities to Ontario. This will seriously hamper communities like Little Jamaica or\nKensington Market currently seeking heritage status and protection.\nIn addition, there is an underlying assumption on the part of the Province that any and all\nheritage resources are being added to the register. I can attest that this is not the process\npursued by municipalities. While there were a couple of municipalities that moved\neverything from their list to the register when it became available as a tool, the majority of\nmunicipal heritage planners and committees where much more prudent. Regardless, prior\nchanges to the Act have addressed this issue.\nThe proposed changes recommended to the Ontario Heritage Act, regarding how the\nMunicipal Register can be used, do not address the issues identified by heritage planners\nand property owners regarding the insurance industry treatment of heritage buildings as\n\u201chigh risk\u201d properties. Heritage resources would be better served by regulation of the\ninsurance industries arbitrary rating to avoid insurance pay-outs.\nThe Municipal Register has proven to be a useful tool for both the property owners and\nmunicipalities in the protection of heritage resources, setting false time limits has no\nrelationship to the evaluations carried out by Heritage Advisory Committees in their role as\nadvisor to Council.\nIf the remainder of the proposed recommendations are to be implemented, the Province\nshould contribute the resources (e.g. transfer funds) needed to carry out the work required to\nevaluate identified properties. Most municipalities work away at these lists as time permits\nand unless additional resources are available the work needed to fully investigate a property\nand write up the necessary documentation is limited and thus the work is tackled over time.\nWith regard to the Heritage Conservation District Plans while review on a regular basis is\nwarranted. The review should address the processes used for review and approval of\nheritage permits not a re-hash of the underlying rationale for the HCD designation.\nIn sum, the proposed amendments are not about heritage resource conservation, rather they\nare designed to allow developers to avoid paying attention to heritage resources. The\ndevelopment of communities, that people love to live in, is contingent on the development\nhaving a sense of place and knowing the historical context of the land, this is the contribution\nheritage conservation makes to neighbourhoods.\nSincerely,\nFaye Landmaid\n",

It is apparent that the provincial government does not value our built heritage and sees it as a barrier for building houses.\nI agree that Ontario needs more housing but it should not be at the expense of our built heritage.  My main concerns with the proposed legislation are:\n1. There is no assurance that the proposed changes to the OHA will create any affordable housing.\n2. It forces communities to remove properties from their heritage registers if they are not designated within  a 2 year period. Based on the current legislation, most communities have many more listed rather than designated properties. Listing helps to protect heritage buildings because it requires a 60 day period of reflection if a demolition permit is requested. The designation process is much more complex and time consuming requiring significant effort on the part municipal planners. As a result, on average, only a few properties can be designated each year. This will force municipalities to cherry pick only a few properties that can be protected through designation during the proposed time period.\n3. The requirement that a property must meet two  of the legislated criteria for designation instead of one  will challenge the protection of the more humble buildings and places associated with more marginalized groups such as Blacks and Indigenous Peoples.\n4. This proposed legislation fails to recognize the sense of place that built heritage provides, and the contribution it makes to tourism and local businesses.\n",

        "comment":"The changes proposed to the Ontario Heritage Act through Bill 23 are done so under the guise of creating affordable and attainable housing. Not only will these changes not accomplish this, the proposed changes clearly threaten to reduce our EXISTING inventory of strong, long lasting buildings. This government doesn\u2019t seem interested in conserving what resources we already have \u2013 the best farmland, the most sustainable (already built) buildings. Why not? It seems this is a prime opportunity to give developers a clear road to building a lot of new houses on prime land for big profit. To then make municipalities suffer under these same changes, to have no say or recourse, while still being required to provide more infrastructure for the housing rollout is outrageous. Removing listed buildings after two years, a move which also removes any desire to list a well built heritage house to prevent its future demolition (why would anyone bother now?), and requiring two criteria to designate rather than one, these are moves designed to give more freedom to the developers that don\u2019t see any value, only impediment, in existing buildings. These proposed changes have little to do with fixing the housing crisis. It\u2019s the opposite of what should be done, which is to work harder to use what resources are already in place, and support (not destroy) the mechanisms that are also already in place to maintain and preserve those resources. We must first support low impact ways to create housing and preserve humble, attainable places for people. This is the time when we need to do more to protect and preserve our inventory of existing buildings (made with clay brick, stone, old wood - materials that are long lasting and too precious and expensive to use widely in new builds). I live one block away from a high school built over 100 years ago that for over ten years now provides low income housing suites. It\u2019s a no brainer. This bill as proposed is exactly what we DO NOT NEED if we really want to fix the housing (and the climate) crisis.\n",

        "comment":"re Bill 23\nAll too often we ignore the fact that policy decisions in various ministries have health consequences. Transportation, Agriculture, Natural Resources, Parks and Recreation, Municipal Affairs and Health are linked. We need to connect the dots and talk to one another. We are extremely concerned about the health consequences of Bill 23.\nURBAN SPRAWL\nJudicious land use planning is increasingly essential to public health, economy, housing affordability, equity, food security, and the escalating climate crisis. The window to implement fundamentally necessary and effective climate action to control greenhouse gas emissions (GHG's) that drive the climate crisis is quickly closing. To accommodate population growth we need to optimize densification while avoiding sprawl. This is critical to mitigating adverse environmental impacts while producing many significant health and economic co-benefits.\nUrban sprawl is associated with unhealthy car-dependent lifestyles and negative health impacts. Physicians are seeing ever increasing numbers of patients suffering from OBESITY, DIABETES, HEART AND LUNG DISEASE, POORER MENTAL HEALTH as well as  INJURIES AND PREMATURE DEATHS RESULTING FROM MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) recognizes the link between urban sprawl and health. Increased vehicle use also creates more AIR POLLUTION which in itself was estimated to prematurely KILL 6600 ONTARIANS annually and cost the provincial economy $49.2 billion dollars in 2016, Increased GHG's generated by increased vehicular transportation directly exacerbate the climate crisis which is considered the single greatest threat to human health as well as to the economy.\nFOOD SECURITY\nThe IPCC has stated that we must do everything possible to avert the climate crisis. Greenspaces, wetlands and well-managed farmlands sequester carbon thereby acting as natural sinks. This is a key component of counteracting GHG emissions. Wetlands themselves sequester methane, a GHG that is much more potent than CO2. Loss of farmland threatens food security. In Ontario we are losing 175 acres of farmland daily. We are dependent on the USA for food and the mid west and California are experiencing severe longlasting droughts. The Covid pandemic has demonstrated very clearly that Canada must not be dependent on other countries to supply its basic needs.\nSPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES\nThe climate crisis is a health crisis--HEAT ILLNESSES AND FATALITIES, spreading of insect borne infections like LYME DISEASE and WEST NILE VIRUS, WILDFIRES, DROUGHTS, FLOODING, FOOD INSECURITY  with DEVASASTATING EFFECTS ON FAMILIES.\nHOUSING\nInvesting in human health and equity is achieved by promoting vibrant more self-contained communities in keeping with the vision expressed by the majority of Peel residents themselves when polled. Densification need not consist of highrise towers and concrete. Intensification can be achieved with well-designed mid and low rise multifamily\/multi-unit, semi-detached and smaller single family homes promoting walkable, cyclable communities with ample zero-emissions public transit supporting common green infrastructure, easily accessible amenities, small independent businesses and enhanced human social interactions.  In the current context of housing affordability and equity becoming an increasing struggle for so many Ontarians, densification is also superior to sprawl and boundary expansion by creating larger numbers of more affordable housing options serving more Ontarians equitably.\nBy way of example, in June 2019 the city of Mississauga, Peel's largest city and major taxation base, officially declared a climate emergency. An in-depth extensively scoped city performance review was conducted to establish the city's first Climate Action Plan. The review showed that carbon emissions driving the climate crisis stem predominantly from 2 sectors: buildings followed by transportation. More than half of emissions from buildings arose from residential buildings. To reduce these emissions we need future energy efficient structures and deep retrofits for existing ones. We need increased cycling, walking and public transit use, and electric vehicles with a decarbonized energy grid. The city review determined this would also improve air quality and community health while generating an estimated 295,000 full time jobs by 2035 in Mississauga alone (REF: Siemens CyPT)\nWe bear responsibility to our children and grandchildren to assure them that they will live in a country that ensures their enjoyment and optimizes their health. Bill 23 does not do this. We owe it to them to withdraw  Bill 23.\nRespectfully,\n",

This will result in thousands of listed sites losing any protection they now have. Furthermore, it will force property owners choose between listing and designation if they want to recognize the heritage significance of their property.\nThe proposed changes to the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties leave provincially owned landmarks vulnerable to the whims of politicians and developers.\nIt is widely recognized by architects, conservationists and planners that re-use and adaptation of existing older buildings is the quickest and most economical way to create more housing. As examples of this we can cite the conversion of old schools to affordable apartments or homes for seniors. Fixing and re-use of older neighbourhoods that are already serviced and connected by transit are the most affordable and economical housing alternatives.\nDestruction of heritage sites and older buildings results in loss of jobs in the renovation and tourism industries, and loss of our sense of place.

It takes away my agency to have my house designated if and when I so desire. Furthermore, if a city review deems my house not immediately worthy of designation, this bill prevents my house from being registered ever. Forever. As if anyone in the current provincial government has the authority to deem that all heritage properties have been noted, and no historical discoveries will ever again be made in the entire province to contradict that assertion.\nIn what quantifiable way does de-listing MY heritage house equal more affordable housing? Absolutely NONE.

Bill 23 seems likevery poor policy indeed: facilitating the taking of land specifically set aside to protect its agricultural capacity, scenic and historic value and environmental importance (including flood protection) and handing it off to real estate developers.  Why then, is such a thing at the heart of this bill?  Ontario is already hard pressed by climate change in the form of major fires and floods.  Further, there are very disconcerting ethical questions attached to Bill 23.  It has been fully documented that developers with a direct interest in these previously protected lands are significant donors to the Ontario PC party.  It seems to me that the profit motive of a handful of developers has been placed before the long term best interests of Greenbelt communities. This opinion has been supported in recent days in opinion pieces and feature articles in The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, the Narwahl and several other major media outlets. Architects and urban planners recently signed an open letter condemning Bill 23 in Canadian Architect magazine.  Alternatives exist according to a number of commentators in the fields of housing and urban\/regional planning.  It seems this bill uses the urgent, even disastrous, state of housing in Ontario as a camouflage for gifting a liberalized regulatory environment to the development industry.  Environmental experts have been quoted widely on social media and elsewhere saying that damaging the Greenbelt's natural systems is a grave mistake.  Again, Bill 23 seems almost deliberately designed to do such damage.  The more I learn about Bill 23 the greater it seems like corrupt madness.  Stop it dead. It will damage our beautiful province permanently and do little to help us meet out housing needs.\n",

Use old abandon building sites for home building. Each city has abandoned factories, and large buildings that was closed years ago. For example, by my home there is a strip plaza that had a large Canadian Tire store attached to it. It was there for 16 years. However, a new Canadian Tire store was built in Niagara Falls- a much larger store ( it actually moved into an old Walmart building that was renovated to become a new Canadian Tire Stire)., hence this resulted in 2 old Canadian Tire stores sitting empty. Well the one by me is going to be demolished along with the strip mall and thousands of homes are going to be built here..single family dwellings, townhomes snd condos.

These decisions, however, are clearly intended to further benefit a very small number of already wealthy entities, and lack any foresight. Build in industrial parks, restore and expand on abandoned buildings in urban cores, and continue to build vertically where zoning allows. Southern Ontario is already becoming a non desirable place to live, with an over reliance on drive culture, and a lack of supporting infrastructure. Take steps to reverse that course. These decisions are irreversible and damaging.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI am submitting comment to the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act under Bill 23. The bill will greatly strip away the little power municipalities had to preserve built heritage in their communities. While heritage doesn't have the same \"wow\" factor as the other issues this bill threatens (mainly to our environmental and agricultural lands), heritage is still vital to communities. Built heritage helps contribute to a community's character, and is an incentive for people to live, and spend their time and money in these places. Heritage increases tourism in communities, think of Niagara on the Lake or Elora. Heritage also fosters a sense of pride and identity for communities. By removing municipalities' powers to preserve their heritage character, we risk all Ontario communities looking like sprawling suburban waste lands.\nThese changes to the Heritage Act will not help us build more affordable homes, faster. These changes will only make it easier for developers to destroy the character and history of the communities they come into, to build the homes that will make them more money.\nPlease, listen to your constituents. Please be a government that looks for long-term solutions that actually help the people you serve. Watering down the Heritage Act to nothing does not help the people already living in communities under threat. I grew up in Grimsby and now live here again after living in Guelph, Ottawa and Hamilton. I came back here for the small-town feel. I came back here for the heritage and the community. I don't want to live in another suburban sprawl of Toronto. There are plenty of other ways to build more affordable homes for the people of Ontario - namely, build on the brownfields and empty lots the sprinkle across the Greater Toronto-Hamilton Area. Please don't threaten our heritage, like the Greenbelt also under threat, once it's gone, it's gone forever. Please be a government that looks to the future, and wants to create a legacy that future generations won't regret.\nThank you.\n",

In its decision to open part of the Greenbelt lands for development despite clear and unambiguous representations to the contrary, the PC party has betrayed the public trust, including to the residents of our community who last spring elected a PC MPP.\nBill 23 will have adverse and irreversible environmental impacts including to wetlands, wildlife corridors and sensitive natural areas. The potential impacts to specific natural areas have not been adequately considered or reviewed prior to the passage of this bill. In its haste to build houses, Bill 23 threatens to give rise to poor planning decisions that are a step backward from decades of watershed and conservation planning. Apart from the ill considered planning implications and environmental threats, Bill 23 will result in hefty financial consequences for taxpayers.\nIn summary, Bill 23 is a mistake that should be repealed in its entirety.\n",

People do not want the proposed changes to this Act, listen to the protests! Stop undermining democracy!\nArchitectural Conservancy Ontario says Bill 23 is a \u201cbomb\u201d dropped into Ontario\u2019s Heritage System\n\"Whether intended or not, the changes proposed for the Ontario Heritage Act (OHA) in Bill 23 will make it practically impossible to protect most of Ontario\u2019s identified heritage properties,\" writes the organization.   This can only be seen as a knee-jerk response to a vindictive attack by the development industry on our heritage system. There was no consultation or consideration of the destructive impacts of these proposals across Ontario\u201d, says ACO Chair Diane Chin. \u201cWhy drop a cluster bomb of changes into the heritage system that will not create a single unit of affordable housing? The proposed changes to the OHA must be dropped from Bill 23\u201d, adds Ms. Chin.\nTwo of the proposals stand out. Forcing communities to drop \u201clisted\u201d properties from their heritage registers if they are not designated in two years and requiring that the standard for designation of properties be hiked from at least one of Ontario\u2019s heritage criteria to two.\nRequiring a property to meet two of the legislated criteria for designation, instead of one, will make it challenging to protect the often-humble buildings and places associated with the historic contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco-Ontarian, multicultural, and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities to Ontario. This will seriously hamper communities like Little Jamaica or Kensington Market currently seeking heritage status and protection.\nIronically this effort to stymie advancements made in recognizing and celebrating cultural diversity is being promoted by the \u201cminister of heritage,\u201d the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism, Michael Ford.\nThe change to the treatment of listed properties is equally confused, baffling, and counter productive. Listing \u2014 placing a property on the local Heritage Register \u2014 recognizes cultural value without the expensive and cumbersome process required to \u201cdesignate\u201d under the Ontario Heritage Act. Listing is an important planning tool, imposing no conditions on property owners save for requiring 60 days notice of intent to demolish.\n\u201cWhy make it so much harder to keep listed properties on the Heritage Register,\u201d asks Ms. Chin. \u201cDesignation should not be seen as the holy grail of heritage protection; listing is easy to implement and does the job in most cases. Why is the Ford government forcing unnecessary designations on municipalities and heritage property owners?\u201d\nIn most of Ontario, identification and protection of heritage is undertaken by volunteer organizations and members of Municipal Heritage Committees. Most listed properties are not in any danger, so listing is an adequate tool for local councils to identify and celebrate their cultural heritage. The changes to listing requirements proposed in Bill 23, forcing either designation or the dropping of thousands of properties from the register within two years, leaving them with no heritage status, will undermine decades of volunteer work identifying and honoring local properties of value to their respective communities.\nThis article above expresses my own concerns and those of so many.   Listen to the people!!\nFrances\n",

OBIAA shares some of AMO\u2019s concerns.

Designation entails consulting with numerous entities and conducting research. Based on a 60-day turnaround schedule for a building, the number of resources registered, and municipal staff size, two years may not be sufficient to complete the task.\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism's proposed override of a local municipal council's determination of heritage value or interest disregards the local context or point of view. Unexpected consequences will result from this strategy.\nSimilarly, how can one agree to support the creation of a regulatory authority to prescribe processes for municipalities to amend or repeal existing Heritage Conservation District (HCD) designation and HCD plan by-laws without knowing the specifics of the authority and processes?\nWe can all agree that additional housing is required, but the manner used by Bill 23 is controversial, unlikely to achieve its stated objectives, and likely to have unexpected consequences.\nThe haste of this Bill through the system, particularly when this timing coincided with the transition from old to new councils, has meant there has not been time to collect opinions from all impacted municipalities, organizations, and the public.\nThe best decisions are made when diverse perspectives and areas of expertise work together to solve a problem.\nI recommend that these Heritage Act changes be scrapped or postponed and that the Ministry and municipalities take time to explore and develop more reasonable solutions to our shared housing difficulties and heritage interests.\n",

I am also concerned that while the current Ontario Government claims that this will help reduce the cost of a home, nowhere does it force developers to reduce purchase price from the savings they will receive from reduced payments to municipalities and conservation authorities. I am also concerned that this will also just result in increased taxes on taxpayers through the municipalities to cover costs of permits and applications. This Bill seems to only benefit developers. It will damage the integrity of our natural systems, critical to our wellbeing, impact food security, and our right to a healthy, clean environment. We will see increased municipal taxes to cover the lost cost.\nOntario\u2019s conservation authorities have a valuable review and commenting role in the development process to ensure public safety and property protection. Working with our municipal partners, we use a variety of tools present in the Conservation Authorities Act and Planning Act to ensure that our communities are well planned, desirable places to live with resilient natural systems that will support the communities into the future.\nConservation authorities offer timely, value-added services for municipalities as well as certainty and predictability through the development review and permitting processes, without lengthening the approvals process.\nThe current legislation proposes to remove the \u201cPollution\u201d and \u201cConservation of Land\u201d tests, which are two of the five tests that are considered by conservation authorities in their review and decision making on permit applications. Natural systems are living systems, and their ability to perform their natural hazard mitigation role is dependent upon the systems remaining alive to perform their function. These tests allow conservation authorities to ensure that the natural systems, such as wetlands, are not adversely impacted by development and site alteration to an extent that they are not able to perform their natural hazard roles over the long-term.\n",

It's a useful mechanism for ascertaining the listed status of a building and can help inform development proposals for a site.]] [[reference: Terms of a Certificate of Immunity: https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/listing\/apply-for-listing\/]]\nIn my estimation, the proposed amendment to the OHA, appears to be a bastardization of the UK terms for issuing a Certificate of Immunity;  this new OHA term potentially provides a ZERO-COST blanket amendment for developers to completely ignore community heritage preservation interests in tens of thousands of properties across the province of Ontario, and, without the benefit of the safeguards provided in the UK Certificate of Immunity procedures.\nThis new OHA term issues a carte blanche to developers, many of whom potentially represent offshore investors who likely, mainly have sanitized investment, financial concerns about returns of assets, do not know anything about the heritage and aesthetics of the communities where their projects will be sited, are blithely ignorant of how heritage structures can be conserved and incorporated into their projects, and have no loyalty or cultural affiliation with Canadian history or Canadian community values.\nThis amendment term of the OHA requires substantive revision to provide at a minimum, a limited, controlled exclusion, at the very least, in line with the UK Certificate of Immunity provisions.  Contrary to the apparent underlying assumptions of this amendment term, Heritage Preservation is not antithetical to development, and, can be executed via well developed conservation plans that reflect the communities in which such projects will reside.\n",

MCM is further proposing that this requirement would apply only to those non-designated properties added to the municipal register on or after the date the legislative and regulatory amendments come into force.]\nI strongly recommend that the Ministry immediately conduct indepth international comparative research of 21st Century Heritage Preservation standards\n ( such as the UK 2008 Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance), and issue a report to inform this legislation and the public; In the interim, no further regulations should be issued concerning this term of the OHA.\nFirst, in my opinion, the current two tiered identification of 'designated' and 'listing-non-designated' represents a historical Canadian simplification of the complex UK heritage regulations which includes designated infrastructure as well as three tiers of nationally listed properties, as well as locally listed properties, all of which receive some degree of protection and conservation management.\nIn fact, it seems likely that many Ontario heritage properties, whether identified provincially or merely listed by a municipality, may be eligible for National Canadian Heritage Designation; But, based on the paucity of Ontario properties in the National Register of Historic Places, it seems very little effort has been expended to ensure that our provinces historical properties are added to the national register. For instance,  I am aware of a property,  the original Bank of Canada building in Toronto,  which likely would qualify, but, I found the required procedure too onerous to undertake myself, as a private citizen.\nIf the Ministry chooses to update the OHA terms at this time, in 2022,  changes SHOULD reflect  'best in class'  international heritage preservation standards, including but not limited to the following four factors :\na)applying a more nuanced and expansive definition of eligibility criteria as per:\n<< i)the UK 2008 Conservation PPG\n[excerpt: People value historic places in many different ways; 'Conservation Principles' shows how they can be grouped into four categories:\nEvidential value: the potential of a place to yield evidence about past human activity.\nHistorical value: the ways in which past people, events and aspects of life can be connected through a place to the present - it tends to be illustrative or associative.\nAesthetic value: the ways in which people draw sensory and intellectual stimulation from a place.\nCommunal value: the meanings of a place for the people who relate to it, or for whom it figures in their collective experience or memory.]\nAND,\nii) with consideration of the ICOMOS ISC20C framework for 20th century modernist heritage.\n[reference: https:\/\/isc20c.icomos.org\/education_items\/the-twentieth-century-histori\u2026;\nALSO,\nb) giving consideration of the resource limitations of Canadian\/ Provincial\/Municipal Heritage experts and community resources available to support and propose heritage conservation plans in the context of multi-million dollar development projects.\nc)expanding and refining the scope and number of heritage asset categories--\nper the UK example.\nFOLLOW-UP STUDY:\nOverall, my impression is that the current updates represent a slipshod effort to blindly shoe horn development projects in the guise of a 'housing' crisis , with scant consideration of the need to thoughtfully and objectively update the province's current heritage preservation regime to 21st century standards.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Ms Kulpa,\nI am writing to you on behalf of The Annex Residents Association, Toronto, to voice our objections to proclamation of the Bill 23, Schedule 6 changes to the Ontario Heritage Act. Those provisions are deeply damaging to both the preservation of Ontario\u2019s built heritage and to the provision of truly affordable housing.\nThe Schedule 6, s 3(4) changes to the listing of properties of heritage value (The Register) are particularly unwise, as clearly demonstrated by the impact they would have in the City of Toronto, and the Annex. The current practice of listing properties \u2013 with no time restriction \u2013 is a heritage planning tool of enormous value. For most communities it is a way to acknowledge places of local cultural heritage value and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 it offers a \u201cmenu\u201d of possible properties for designation, a long process involving considerable research and discussion. The City of Toronto is engaged in a citywide systematic heritage survey to identify properties of cultural heritage interest not already noted by listings on the City\u2019s register. As the City rushes to catch up on its listings, the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act  would, if proclaimed, prevent designation of heritage properties to be included in a development proposal if they were not listed at the time of the developer\u2019s application to the City.\nIf these provisions had been in place several years ago, an impressive new development adjacent to the Annex neighbourhood would have been negatively impacted. The Westbank-Mirvish Village development, which is now under construction, will house several thousand people in rental townhouses and apartments towers. It will include a market street and recreational amenities to replace those that have been demolished. Importantly, the development respects the history of the much-loved Mirvish Village as it retains \u2013 through designation \u2013 the Markham Street heritage streetscape. None of the heritage properties were listed when the development was proposed. It was through thoughtful collaboration between Westbank, the developer, and four residents\u2019 associations that the significance of the streetscape was fully understood, leading to its preservation as an evocative part of a large-scale multi-use project.\nMost properties in the Annex are not listed, yet the neighbourhood is known for its impressive range of architectural styles and housing types by well-known architects dating from the late 19th century to the present. Many of the properties provide rental accommodation to seniors, students from the University of Toronto and others on fixed or low incomes, and young professionals. More than 70 per cent of residents are renters in a city lacking rental homes. A recent preliminary study of the neighbourhood shows that gentle intensification has taken place for the past century. Large mansions have been replaced by low and mid-rise apartments, while others have townhouses or three- and four-storey apartment buildings in once ample back yards. Importantly, heavily treed heritage streetscapes remain intact, providing a healthy environment for those living in the area, effectively balancing the area\u2019s gentle densification. The Annex, through the goodwill of owners and developers, has worked hard to ensure that needed housing respects the unique heritage qualities of the place. Listing \u2013 with no arbitrary fixed term \u2013 would help ensure that heritage buildings, and the affordable housing they contain, are an integral part of overall planning and specific development proposals.\nWithin the Annex, consider specifically the houses along Spadina Avenue, which would have been lost through expropriation for the Spadina Expressway. Most are now owned by the City of Toronto and provide affordable housing and space for social service agencies. (The first woman\u2019s shelter in the entire country is still operating on Spadina Avenue.) Although some of the houses are listed, almost the entire streetscape needs to be considered as a heritage place that provides affordable housing for hundreds of people. Indefinite listing would acknowledge buildings that have served a diverse community so successfully.\nContrary to some public perception, historic buildings in the Annex provide the only affordable housing in the neighbourhood. They need to be recognized through open-ended listing \u2013 and seen as part of sensitive densification and redevelopment. Although listing is an important planning tool, it should not be seen as a requirement for designation, especially in the context of development proposals.\nThe Annex Residents\u2019 Association asks that Cabinet not proclaim the Bill 23 changes to the Ontario Heritage Act. The Annex \u201cstory\u201d demonstrates that heritage preservation, far from being an impediment to affordable housing, actually fosters the development  and maintenance of intensified, truly affordable housing that is well integrated into the fabric of the surrounding community.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

There is a reason so many people travel to Europe and other areas of the world that value and preserve their past. We don\u2019t need to make it easier to erase our heritage and cultural landmarks to build for the future.\nAllowing the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism (MCM):\n\u2022\tto revise the determination of cultural heritage value or interest by a ministry or prescribed public body respecting a provincial heritage property, and\n\u2022\tEnable the Crown in right of Ontario or a ministry or prescribed public body exempt themselves with complying to protections for designated heritage properties if the exemption could potentially advance one or more of the following provincial priorities: transit, housing, long-term care and other infrastructure or other prescribed provincial priorities;\ndisregards all the work local groups do to identify the heritage buildings that have meaning in their community and sets a dangerous precedent that no building, no matter what it\u2019s historic or cultural significance is safe.\nAs well, the MCM is making it much harder for municipalities to protect properties and Heritage Conservation Districts (HCD) by requiring that they now must meet two or more criteria for conservation. MCM is also making more difficult by: requiring that municipalities must drop listed but not designated properties within two years; making it easier for properties that have been designated to be removed from the register; introducing a regulatory authority that will create a process for amending or repealing existing HCDs.\nThe requirement that municipalities drop listed properties that haven\u2019t been designated within 2 years is an especially callous and a cruel blow to the ordinary citizens who sit on the local heritage committees and are tasked with doing all the work to find, list and potentially designate their communities\u2019 built heritage assets.\nCanada is a new, rapidly growing country but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have important historic and cultural buildings worth saving. In fact, it is deeply disturbing how many iconic and beautiful buildings have been lost to the wrecker\u2019s ball around the Province, especially through the middle of the last century.\nThese changes, if enacted, will herald in a new era of destruction that is both unnecessary and unwise.\nThe Architectural Conservancy Ontario has called the proposed Heritage Act changes a \u201cbomb\u201d dropped into the system that will make it virtually impossible to protect most of Ontario\u2019s identified heritage properties.\nI agree. Please do not pass these changes.\n",

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to the changes proposed in Bill 23, particularly the changes restricting the  traditional process for including non-designated properties (that is, \"listed properties\") on a municipal heritage register.\nThe existing Heritage Registers contain thousands of properties that are listed. The accumulation of these listings represents a huge body of effort by citizens, historians, city staff, and past municipal councils over a period of several decades. This considerable effort should not be set aside.\nGiven that many early listings predated current regulations and approval processes, and given that listing is merely a tool to record the interest in a property as having potential heritage value, with minimal restriction on the continued changes to the property, it is not surprising that there is less than full information available about these listings. The amount of \u201ccatchup\u201d work to research and document the heritage attributes of these thousands of listings, to the standard now required of the Designation process, is beyond what is possible of municipal governments in the period set out ie 2 years.\nIf the Province is determined to cull the existing listed properties and reduce the future use of this tool - which I oppose on the merits, the listing process is constructive - there should be a much longer period of grandfathering - potentially up to 10 years - to allow interested parties to make the case for designation.\nLastly, the entirety of Bill 23 and particularly the impacts on the Heritage process are hugely slanted in favour of hungry developers who will gladly trade off the Province\u2019s heritage in favour of short term profit. This entire proposal is wrongheaded and I strongly oppose it.\n",

In fact, the present OHA creates more housing by providing for restoring and adapting existing heritage buildings for housing.  The examples are many across Ontario:\nredundant heritage churches and schools have transformed into market housing and seniors housing; redundant industrial buildings have been turned into supportive housing and affordable housing.\nThose transformations have been more sustainable and energy efficient than purpose-built new housing constructed of materials with a large carbon footprint.  Heritage buildings were constructed with local labour and local materials, thus their embodied energy contributes to our sustainable future.\nOur municipality, Guelph, has had a posted Municipal Register for more than 10 years, a Register that was created over more than a year with extensive municipal, property owner and local consultations.  Each property included clearly rated using Reg 09 of the OHA.  The process requires much staff time and citizen input that could not be effective and would be cost prohibitive in a limited time span.\nThese revisions to the OHA are unsupported and unresearched and should be shelved until they involve further consultation, and more truthful assumptions based on accurate research.\n",

Is anyone asking that question? The current Liberal Fed. government is short-sighted with their questionable immigration targets of a \u00bd million people a year (the equivalent to building KW Cambridge population and infra-structure) each year. But this is another question.\nBut with regard to Bill 23, the proposed changes will not enable affordable housing to be built where it is needed, inside existing urban communities. The government is also eliminating key democratic processes, heritage and environmental protections to make it easier for developers to build what they want, where they want, and when they want, and forcing the rest of the Ontario taxpayers to bear the financial, social, heritage and ecological costs. The green belt is special land that many have fought to protect for generations and in one knee-jerk bill the decades of work will be erased. As fertile farmland continues to be gobbled up in Ontario, what are these many new and existing Ontarians supposed to eat???\nThis current provincial Bill is short-sighted. Bye, bye critical green space. I think the only green the provincial government sees is $$ (from developers). Green Party MPP, Mike Schreiner, has some urban area housing ideas that seem a lot more logical, using existing empty buildings, low-rise multi-dwellings, but because he is not the party in majority, does anyone in the majority want to listen to him? Also, why not fix and re-use our older neighbourhoods already serviced and connected by transit to offer affordable housing alternatives. Another key segment of the population not served here, are the retiring Baby Boomers...build young seniors housing, so they leave their big empty 3-4 bedroom existing housing.\n",

Would the Government consider making amendments to the proposed legislation to ensure that housing development is done in a way that protect the heritage value and environmental quality of Ontario neighbourhoods?\nSite Plan Control\nBill 23 proposes to reduce a municipality\u2019s authority to regulate the exterior design of a building. These provisions to review site plans help establish and maintain the heritage and unique qualities of neighbourhoods, which is tied to their identity, their live-work-play appeal and economic attractiveness.\nThese provisions can also influence their impact upon a community\u2019s natural environment. Bill 23 proposes to remove bird-safe design standards within municipal regulations, which is important as birds species and their habitats are threatened within cities.  It would therefore be important to reincorporate a province-wide bird friendly building design standard to encourage greater diversity and health of bird populations in our cities.\nEnvironmental Protection\nBill 23 undermines the checks and balances that conservation authorities provide when assessing development that impact waterways and wetlands.  Conservation Authorities play a key role in ensuring that future development will not adversely affect the eco-systems that contribute to our ability to manage climate change, including by reducing the risks of flood events.  The Nature-based solutions, including protecting urban or urban adjacent green spaces, have been shown to be effective and cost-effective for helping to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to promote biodiversity. There is growing recognition of the importance of nature-based solution in Canada but also internationally and Ontario should not lag behind in this regard.  Canada\u2019s recently released, and first, \u2018National Adaptation Strategy\u2019 notes enhanced biodiversity and nature conservation as one its key themes: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/services\/environment\/weather\/climatechange\/cli\u2026\nParkland Dedication\nBill 23 also proposes to reduce parkland dedication requirements. As an Ontarian who lives in an urban neighbourhood in which increased densities will over time strain our existing parks, reductions in parkland dedication rates for new development will be problematic for future welfare of our residents (both current and new residents).\nA United Nations Conference of the Parties on Biodiversity is currently underway in Montreal, which highlights the importance of protecting biodiversity, which is dangerously threatened in Canada and worldwide.  The conference notes the importance of biodiversity (including parkland) conservation by reducing land-use change; overexploitation; pollution; climate change risks; and the spread of invasive species.\nWe need to have an Act which reflects long term thinking about Ottawa (and Ontario) residents access to greenspace, while building healthy and resilient ecosystems.\nPlease consider these points and revise Bill 23 accordingly.\n",

The total disregard for environmental protection and preservation of heritage laws. Many years of negotiation have taken place with lawmakers to protect these values and with the stroke of a pen these important principle are merely disregarded and disgarded..\n2. And even more important the lack iof democratic decision making is a slap in the face of democracy. I CAA it and will not accept the fact that decision makers can ram decisions down the throats of citizens with only minority support. This dictator style approach cannot proceed further.

        "comment":"Re: Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 (ERO #019-6196)\nOntario Museum Association\nDear Ministers,\nWe are writing to provide comments on proposed changes under Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022. The more than 700 museums, galleries, and historic sites across the province are located in every community\u2014 urban, rural, Northern, Indigenous, east and west\u2014and serve as vital community-building infrastructure. Museums are heritage assets, key to education, employment, economic development, tourism, culture, and equity. As trusted public institutions, museums foster social wellbeing and visitor engagement through high-quality, authentic experiences and connections. Museums play a vital role in rebuilding and reconnecting Ontario, both socially and economically.\nThe Ontario Museum Association (OMA) calls on the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism and the government for legislation that ensures Ontario\u2019s irreplaceable heritage is protected. The OMA calls to maintain all possible protections for heritage assets, including through the Ontario Heritage Act, and calls for support of heritage designation with broad applicability for the stewardship of valuable heritage assets and museums across the province. The OMA discourages proposed changes to existing protections (listing and designation under the Ontario Heritage Act and the Standards and Guidelines for heritage Properties) as these changes may put at risk museums and the important places that are part of the heritage of diverse communities across Ontario.\nBill 23 proposes changes to the Planning Act and Development Charges Act that substantially threaten the essential support provided to museums by municipalities. Municipalities contribute the largest amount of funding for community museums and are vital to their sustainability. The Province must protect the level of operational funding provided.\nThere is recognized responsibility of government to protect heritage assets held in the public trust and to maintain public confidence. The museum and heritage community stands ready to provide expertise and experience to ensure legislative changes are community-driven in the service of all Ontarians, and protect sustainable funding for museums.\nOntarians value the presence of museums in their communities; they improve quality of life\u2014this public value drives investments in preservation and revitalization made by individuals, the private sector and governments. Museums deliver a social return on investment that makes our communities vibrant and vital places to live, work, visit and invest now and in the future.\nBill 23 jeopardizes Ontario\u2019s potential to offer a variety of distinct places and experiences that attract local, provincial, national and international tourism.\nPlease see the attached fulsome submission.\n",

        "comment":"While I appreciate the intent of this legislation, its objectives must not be pursued at the expense of other societal priorities, including heritage stewardship\u2014these are not mutually exclusive objectives. The proposed changes, as currently presented, threaten our heritage but won\u2019t lead to more truly affordable or attainable housing.\nThe changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will stymie recognition of cultural diversity in Ontario. For example, the change in the \u201cthreshold\u201d for designation, requiring that two criteria be met rather than one, will make it almost impossible to protect modest buildings and places associated with the historic contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco-Ontarians, multicultural and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities.\nProposed changes also undermine the importance of the local heritage planning process by limiting the role of municipal heritage committees and placing undue pressure on municipal staff and volunteers to protect local heritage properties through municipal registers and listings. This is exacerbated by requiring municipalities to designate all listed properties within two years or drop them from the register. This is an unrealistic requirement that threatens tens of thousands of listed sites. Furthermore, property owners shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose between listing and designation to recognize the heritage significance of their property.\nChanges to the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties also leave provincially owned landmarks such as Ontario Place vulnerable to the whims of politicians and developers.\nA more productive way to create more housing is to re-use and adapt existing older buildings. For example, converting old schools to affordable apartments or homes for seniors would take advantage of existing building stock that is already serviced and connected by transit. By upgrading and re-using our older neighbourhoods, affordable housing and heritage conservation objectives can both be realized.\nOntario\u2019s heritage is a non-renewable resource that contributes greatly to the fabric of our society. Loss of heritage sites and older buildings threatens employment in the renovation and tourism sectors and contributes to climate change through release of stored carbon. A housing strategy that approaches heritage conservation and development as complementary rather than opposing objectives would yield much greater benefits overall.\n",

        "comment":"I am reviewing the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act in Bill 23 from the perspective of a professional planner having lived and worked in southwestern Ontario for the past 45 years. I appreciate the opportunity to comment even after the Bill has been rushed through the legislature with minimal review, public discussion and debate.\nI\u2019m reviewing the specific propositions being put forward as they impact the cultural heritage resources for Ontario, and more specifically (where my experience\/knowledge is situated) onto the City of Guelph, the Royal City. Overall, I disagree with what is being propositioned here as it reflects a \u2018blunt instrument\u2019 to enact change for the benefit of development interests without considering the more subtle endeavour of building a community that people want to care about as they go about their busy lives, today and into the future.\nI understand the premise of the current government to go out and cut what they refer to as development \u2018red tape\u2019 respecting our common historical heritage, but what the rest of us consider valuable regulation to give substance and character to our communities. This is especially important for a City such as Guelph that was a British town-designed community from its inception in 1827, and is now facing the onslaught of new infill development that impacts the character and substance of the overall community. My basic fear to all the Bill 23 change is that the community known previously as Guelph, becomes known as an \u2018outer ring\u2019 settlement area within the Greater Toronto megalopolis, i.e., the one size fits all Bill mantra will remove vestiges of a former \u2018character full\u2019 Guelph community to one of the faceless, placeless sameness of all the other GTA places.\nThe City of Guelph has thousands of buildings and landscapes comprising historic and cultural value. Bill 23 with its ruthless short-term time horizons of 2 and 5 year timelines for the community to do something with its heritage resources is nonsensical. There are insufficient staff and funding resources within the City to complete the necessary background work to investigate and determine the specific and detailed heritage value of all of these resources. From the background of the Bill 23 proposal, there is insufficient justification analysis that I can find warranting the significant changes to the Ontario Heritage Act at this time.\nMy following comments are focused on the provisions of the Government\u2019s Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), the primary policy document that guides development within the Province. This Statement is quite clear that all policies in the document need to be considered to create healthy, safe and vibrant communities, now and into the future, i.e., not simply removing perceived short term barriers for new housing development. The PPS is very clear in Policy Section 2.6.1 that, \u201cSignificant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes shall be conserved.\u201d The setting of arbitrary dates in Bill 23 to enact local decisions on existing heritage\/cultural resources does not meet the intent of the PPS. From first hand experience in the community, some property investors have already diminished the available heritage resources in the community by not properly maintaining the resource, i.e., demolition of cultural heritage \u2018by neglect\u2019 or mysterious fire. Bill 23s provisions of either designate something or forget it does not bode well in the conservation of resources\/landscapes into the future. Guelph City Hall staff prepared an \u2018emergency meeting report\u2019 to Council on November 22, 2022. See attachment with cogent commentary from City staff as to the impact of Bill 23 on the City\u2019s heritage resources (Table 9 on pdf pgs 24 through 26).\nThe current government\u2019s push to permit development to happen everywhere will have deleterious impacts on the protection and encouragement to preserve cultural heritage resources of our community. In addition, there are several other logistical questions that can be generalized to places across Ontario: 1) How was the rather arbitrary 2-year time clock established to determine \u2018significance\u2019 for a community heritage asset?  Heritage asset determination needs to stand up to the strict classification standards of the Ontario Heritage Act; the heritage certification professional field is not that extensive in Ontario, and will the imposition of this timed deadline put incredible (also unreasonable) stress on available experts? 2) How are archeological assessments being considered as these may also be deemed to hold up potential housing developments, i.e., \u2018red tape\u2019 as classified by this government? It is my assertion that Bill 23, on its simple overall premise to require municipalities to permit development to happen (with minimal government requirements), will not in the long run provide for healthy, resilient places to \u2018discover\u2019. Instead, the current government\u2019s approach may\/may not aid in making Ontario \u2018a place to grow\u2019 but in a poorly designed and non-sustainable monolithic manner.\nAs a conclusion, I would urge the government to abandon its bull-headed approach to planning against the accepted best practices of broad community engagement and dialogue, i.e., not simply having the development sector sit at the planning table. The public interest to building sustainable, distinctive communities is built on a foundation of trust, mutual respect and dialogue \u2013 something that is sadly missing from Bill 23 and its impacts on the cultural heritage resources of Guelph and I suspect other communities throughout Ontario.\nSincerely yours!\n",

Places that have been around far longer than current politicians shouldn't be rushed through a process to be destroyed. We should not leave provincially owned landmarks such as Ontario Place vulnerable to the whims of politicians and the developers who line their pockets. These changes in designation requirements from one criterion to two also mean that some of the less obvious buildings of historical significance, including buildings of significance to Black, Indigenous, 2SLGBTQQIA+, and other diverse communities in Ontario, are more likely to be destroyed.\nFurthermore, the destruction of buildings is damaging to the environment and contributes to the climate crisis by releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and taking up unnecessary space in landfills. A faster and more environmentally friendly option would be to retrofit existing buildings for affordable housing, which would already be part of communities and connected to transit instead of being in the middle of the greenbelt.\nFinally, these changes are completely unrealistic and do not reflect communities' abilities to process buildings. There is no possible way for municipalities to be able to designate all properties on the register list within 2 years, and to put that kind of pressure on them is unfair.\n",

        "comment":"Hello\nI would like to offer my comments on the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act.  I have been a heritage planner both in the private and public sectors for over 30 years.  I have generally been supportive of the changes to the Act over the years as they have been mostly positive, well-researched and fair to all involved in the process. However, that is not the case with the changes in the recent past nor the current amendments.\nThe proposed amendments seem to strive to make it more difficult to conserve and protect the heritage resources that are important to communities across Ontario.  Conservation of heritage resources is not an impediment to the provision of additional or attainable housing. There are countless examples of heritage resources being incorporated into new housing developments and it has made those areas very special as they help tell the story of our evolving communities.\nMy key points:\n\u2022\tChanges to the Act have been so complex it makes it challenging for the volunteer sector or those communities without staff assistance to understand the process and to adequately protect our resources (even heritage staff are having difficulty).  We are not all Toronto!  Whatever happens, please quickly release educational materials such as a new Heritage Act Toolkit to help those in the wilderness.\n\u2022\tTo force the removal of listed properties from the Heritage Register after two years if not designated is extremely troublesome, impractical and contrary to the objective of originally creating these types of listings.  And not to be able to return to the Register until after five years (what in the world does that achieve other than leaving identified heritage resources unprotected?)  A Register is supposed to provide a transparent public inventory of all the protected and potential heritage resources in a community.  Listing provides no protection other than notice if demolition is proposed.  Many municipalities have spent countless dollars, staff resources and volunteer time creating these Registers (as requested by the province) and listing resources only now to be told that the objective is to dismantle the inventory and to do it in an unreasonable timeframe.  There are many more arguments against this senseless proposal that others will make, but my basic request is - Please let us retain our listed properties \u2013 they harm no one but do alert us when the resource is threatened with removal.\n\u2022\tThe concept of making designation more difficult by increasing the number of criteria a property has to meet is also of major concern.  We are told to start designating listed properties, but it will also be more challenging to achieve if this is pursued.  Some very significant properties only meet one criteria, and raising the bar will certainly exclude a number of simple\/local heritage resources that help tell the story of my community. Designation should reflect what is important to the local community from a heritage perspective and this may be different across Ontario.  Again this proposal seems to be another solution looking for a problem.\n\u2022\t My last request \u2013 Consultation \u2013 we used to do it in Ontario and it used to be meaningful.  Legislation can (and should) always be reviewed and improved and should be amended from time to time to resolve issues of concerns to all who use it.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case here.  There are many participants in the heritage community who have much experience with using the Heritage Act and could help make meaningful improvements that address issues experienced by all parties.  Can we not put a hold on these amendments and start a civilized period of consultation and dialogue?  I hope we can.\nHeritage resource comprise such an infinitesimal percentage of buildings in our communities and even with our current policies, they continue to disappear.  These changes will make it even harder to protect our heritage and will no doubt lead to its loss.   Which will be a real shame, and not the type of province I want to live in.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide my feedback.\n",

While the comment period has been extended, it is obvious to me that the government really doesn't care what Ontarians think about the legislation or what its ramifications will be on our quality of life. However, I will take this opportunity to ensure that my comments are received. The changes to the Heritage Act will take away the ability of the City to protect its heritage buildings, many of which provide the much-needed \"gentle density\" housing this government claims to be promoting. Instead, the priority seems to be \"development\" - under the guise of providing housing, older buildings can now more easily be demolished and replaced with giant condominium towers, full of \"luxury\" units priced over $1 million. To claim that this is about providing housing is disingenuous at best. \"All listed properties on the Heritage Registry to be Designated or removed within 2 years.\" What is this about, if not simply grabbing more real estate for Real Estate Investment Trusts, asset management firms and other \"investor\" tools?\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my strong opposition to certain proposals in Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act. These proposals will have an extremely negative impact on our community\u2019s ability to protect its cultural heritage resources. My concerns are outlined below.\nHeritage Registers\nHeritage registers are internationally-recognised tools to protect cultural heritage resources. Toronto\u2019s heritage register has been in existence for decades and contains many thousands of properties considered to possess cultural heritage value. Thousands of hours of research by volunteers and staff were involved in adding properties to the register. Currently, the City is conducting a City-wide heritage survey to ensure that properties with heritage value are identified on the register. This will enable better response to development proposals when heritage resources are involved.\nI am extremely concerned about the proposal that all properties on the heritage register that are not designated under Parts IV or V of the Ontario Heritage Act, (that is, listed, but not designated) will be dropped from the register after two years unless they are officially designated within that period. Currently, an owner of a listed property is not subject to any restrictions except for having to give 60 days notice of intent to demolish the property. This time period can give city staff time to evaluate the heritage value of the property and to recommend designation of the property if warranted. This proposed change is a complete disaster for the heritage register and for the protection of heritage properties.\nThe proposal that once a property is dropped from the heritage register, five years must elapse before it can be considered for re-addition to the register, is frankly baffling and can only be seen as damaging to heritage preservation efforts.\nDesignation Criteria\nAlthough not addressed directly in the Act, the Ministry proposes that a property must meet two, instead of one, of the criteria for designation. This would make it more difficult to protect heritage properties. At present, obviously-significant heritage properties can qualify for designation based on only one criterion. The proposal to require meeting two or more criteria makes no sense and will disqualify properties worthy of designation. Importantly, properties that may not be architecturally significant, but have strong associations with local communities, may no longer qualify for designation. This goes against current government policy to afford more recognition to marginalized and minority communities.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nI conclude that Bill 23, in its current form, presents a significant threat to our cultural heritage resources \u2013 both now and in the future. At the same time, the I do not understand how the proposed legislation will result in a significant increase in affordable housing. Housing and heritage are not mutually exclusive as can be illustrated by numerous examples of re-purposed industrial and commercial buildings. Heritage is also an important factor in improving a community\u2019s \u201cliveability\u201d.\nI recommend further discussion with heritage advocates and professionals to mitigate the potential harm of this legislation. To this end, I recommend a further extension of the time period allowed for review of the proposed changes.\n",

It is clear, however, that the changes threaten our heritage.\nThreatening our heritage also threatens our existing affordable housing. As many historic homes have been subdivided into multiple living units, their demolition will eliminate much-needed housing.\nThe communities that are under- represented, such as 2SLGBTQIA+, Indigenous, Black, and new Canadians, will be only further under-represented if the \"threshold\" for designation is changed to requiring at least two criteria being met.\nThis will make it almost impossible to protect our more humble buildings and places, and would help strengthen the already powerful bias towards the rich, white, European sociocultural and historic voice.\nThe changes to listing properties on the Municipal Heritage Register will place undue pressure on municipal staff and volunteers, especially in smaller municipalities. It is unrealistic to require listed properties to be designated within two years of being listed on the Municipal Heritage Register.\nThis requirement will put historic properties at risk because municipalities may not be able to enact by-laws to protect them in time.\nHistoric buildings are great options for conversion to affordable housing.  Located in older, established neighborhoods,  these buildings are often near public transit and have amenities within walking distance. Many have already been converted to multiple units and offer more affordable housing options. Putting historic buildings at risk, then, also puts affordable housing options at risk.\n",

Even without designation, a \u201clisted\u201d property on the heritage register is currently afforded some protections. Removal of a property from the register places it at great risk of demolition or serious loss of its heritage value.\n\u2022\tSection 29 places further restrictions on the designation process on the basis of as yet undefined \u201cprescribed events.\u201d It is expected that the \u201cprescribed events\u201d will include development applications.\n\u2022\tSection 41 places further restrictions on the designation of Heritage Conservation Districts, which are important ways for municipalities to protect streetscapes and neighbourhoods.\n\u2022\tSection 42 (1) removes protections of Heritage Conservation Districts against demolition or removal of structures within the district.\nWe are further concerned about the Bill\u2019s amendments to the Planning Act, in Schedule 9 of the Bill, and in particular that:\n\u2022\tSection 23 gives the Minister excessive powers to override a municipality\u2019s Official Plan.\n\u2022\tSection 51 diminishes public involvement by placing limits on public meetings.\nWhile it is clear that new homes are needed in Ontario, this point does not preclude the protection of heritage places. In fact, the retention and protection of heritage places may serve to enhance the appeal of new neighbourhoods. As well, there could be cost and environmental benefits to re-purposing or restoring existing heritage structures, rather than tearing them down and adding them to a landfill. With the current shortage of building materials, re-use of existing heritage structures may, in some cases, expedite housing development, while at the same time retaining the valued heritage character of our villages and hamlets.\nWe hope that you, as our MPP, will be in a position to address our concerns.\nKind Regards,\ne-signature\nSue Warren\nChair, MHAC\ne-signature\t\t\t\t\t\t\te-signature\nDiane Haskins \t\t\t\t\t\tKim Lulashnyk\nMember, MHAC\t\t\t\t\t\tMember, MHAC\ne-signature\nAllison Smith\nMember, MHAC\n",

        "comment":"I am very concerned that the government has decided it is necessary to threaten heritage protection of buildings in order to build new housing.  It seems like an unnecessary and draconian wiping away of any impediment to developers putting up giant new condos.  I do know something about this, as a resident of downtown Toronto.  My neighbourhood has been transformed by the construction of huge - really huge - towers on tiny lots.    In the St. Lawrence area where I live, there is a development notice on every block.  Especially in the Old Town, i.e. the original 10 blocks of the Town of York.  The towers are tall.  They all have Shoppers Drug Marts and cannabis shops at street level. Some aspects of the street heritage on some has been maintained by the keeping of small parts of facades, but that is not heritage protection.\nWhy are you not promoting moderate densification in suburban areas instead?\nDowntowns are bearing the brunt of the development and, ironically, becoming ever less liveable as more thousands of people pour in.\nAnother perspective I bring to this is as a leader of architectural and historical tours for ROMWalks, a volunteer program of the Royal Ontario Museum.  For the past several years I have had the privilege of pointing out to interested citizens how certain buildings have been preserved and repurposed, with careful attention to their history, and have also pointed to sites where beautiful old buildings have been destroyed.  The ones that have been saved, we owe to the dedicated efforts of citizens who stepped up to counter the prevailing politicians of the day, and now those efforts are lauded and appreciated.  This is what heritage designation is for, to save us from ourselves!  From you!\nMaking it harder for municipalities to protect their heritage properties by increasing the criteria and decreasing the time will not help to create more housing.  Old buildings that are important to the history of communities are not the problem.  Developers and architects have shown that they can work with the fabric that is there to create interesting repurposed structures.   The recent solution that was found to the proposed demolition of the Foundry buildings in the West Donlands is an example.  Y'all were going to just bulldoze it in the middle of the night.  But when active citizens forced your hand, a proposal was approved that does get housing built and also protects the most historically valuable parts of the complex.    Why can't you just do that?  Talk to people.  People who are not NIMBYs, who want affordable housing built, but not at the expense of the history and heritage that is all of ours to enjoy into the future.\n",

Moreover, substantial evidence from across Ontario shows that heritage conservation and housing development have been proven to be mutually beneficial and not in opposition to each other as the proposed Bill (and the Report of the Ontario Housing Affordable Task Force that proceeded it) would seem to suggest.\nHere are our key concerns, underscoring those already identified by our provincial heritage counterparts:\n\u2022\tThe natural environment and cultural heritage of the traditional territories of Indigenous communities will be adversely impacted by proposed measures in Bill 23. A lack of consultation and accommodation of the concerns of Indigenous communities risks violating their Inherent and Treaty Rights. Indigenous organizations have called on the Ontario government to pause their efforts on Bill 23 until consultation with First Nations, as rightsholders and treaty partners, has been adequately conducted.\n\u2022\tThe current bill does not address the inherent systemic barriers to building reuse which if removed would both create housing faster and eliminate the additional carbon footprint associated with new construction. Building code requirements\/limitations, a lack of skilled trades, and tax system distortions currently impede the adaptive reuse of Ontario\u2019s existing buildings.\n\u2022\tIncreasing the threshold for listing and designation of heritage properties under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act will make it much more difficult to address reconciliation as well as issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the protection of cultural heritage resources in Ontario.\n\u2022\tBill amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act would mean that non-designated properties currently included (\u201clisted\u201d) on a municipal register would have to be removed if municipal council does not issue a notice of intention to designate within two years of the Act coming into force. This will greatly reduce the opportunity for communities to identify places of heritage significance, and dramatically increase the likelihood of their loss. Robust heritage resources inventories serve as a basic building block of any local \/provincial historic preservation program and are an internationally recognized best practice.\nOur national heritage conservation organizations support intensification, including well-designed and planned infill as well as the conversion and rehabilitation of existing buildings as housing. We discourage any measures that would incentivize the demolition of existing buildings and impact both the environment and affordability. We would support tools that encourage subdivision of single unit homes into multi-family buildings and give credits for the reuse of existing buildings and materials or incorporating cultural heritage resources into new developments.\nGiven the magnitude of the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act proposed in Bill 23, consultation with heritage organizations, such as us and our provincial counterparts, is necessary. We urge you to undertake further review of the implications of the amendments prior to proclamation. We welcome the opportunity to share our technical expertise related to the Ontario Heritage Act amendments and proposed changes to the prescribed criteria for evaluating cultural heritage value or interest.\nYours sincerely,\nCanadian Association of Heritage Professionals\nIndigenous Heritage Circle\nICOMOS Canada\nNational Trust for Canada\n",

If this truly applies to provincially owned and culturally significant buildings, then the MCM would be the ultimate decision-maker.  However, it does seem to also apply to some privately owned buildings as it mentions \"property owners\" for which the MCM should have no input.\nIt is common knowledge that the Heritage Registers for most municipalities are woefully behind schedule, sometimes many years behind schedule because it takes knowledgeable and experienced individuals to perform the required assessments to put a building\/bridge\/park on the register.  The new legislation would be more credible if it offered the time, budget and experts to allow municipalities to complete their commitments to the register.\nOf course, people should have decent housing, but the demolition of Ontario's culturally distinctive features is NOT the answer.   Changing the regulations to allow faster demolition, with fewer requirements and oversight by the LGIC is NOT the answer either.  Once these buildings are destroyed, Ontario's history is also destroyed.  We have already lost too many important buildings in the name of 'development' or 'improvement'.  Please do not continue in this vein.   The only ones who prosper from these changes are the developers.\nMunicipalities are supposed to work in conjunction with the MCM as it pertains to Cultural Heritage Districts and make it easier to insert 'missing middle housing' in the middle of a CHD. Stop right there!!  Do you know\/appreciate that many municipalities are able to prosper from the streetscapes, from the heritage buildings by participating in fundraisers, in films and movies (many studios coming from the US to use our protected spaces) and maintain the tax base which the province needs.   The changes you propose could drastically impact the ability for municipalities to prosper.\nThis last paragraph applies to all the proposals:  the province, the provincial Ministers and the LGIC have no intimate knowledge of the cities or towns where they propose to interfere.  They should not be able to simply blow into town and order the indiscriminate demolition of a building.  The decisions must be the responsibilities of the City Councils and the citizens of those towns.  They will decide how housing density goals will be met.  They will decide how and where to house newcomers.  Please remove these amendments as they do not support \"More Homes Built Faster\"; they only support \"More Buildings and History Destroyed Faster\".\n The province has no business meddling in the affairs of municipalities, when it is self-evident that the province has no idea what it is doing.\n",

I note that this change introduces significant uncertainty with respect to previously identified provincial heritage properties. Oftentimes, provincial heritage properties are landmark spaces and structures which have influenced the form, functionality, and identity of communities across Ontario for decades, sometimes centuries. By virtue of their stable provincial oversight and heritage protections, they are reliable points of reference for planning, tourism, recreation, and other aspects of community life. This proposed change raises the spectre of heavy-handed and arbitrary government intervention on these community landmarks, regardless of the process. Therefore, I suggest that this change only apply to new provincial heritage properties and not previously identified ones.\nRE: The proposed enabling legislative authority to exempt provincial projects from the S&Gs in application may unintentionally remove consideration for provincial heritage properties from the Ontario Heritage Act altogether. The sole purpose of Part III of the OHA is the establishment of the S&Gs as a flexible mechanism to identify and manage provincially owned and, in some cases, occupied structures. This legislation foregoes the more specific protections identified in Parts IV, V, and VI of the OHA, leaving the details of heritage management to the S&Gs. By exempting properties from all or part of the S&Gs, the government functionally removes these properties from the OHA altogether. The one exception would be properties with known archaeological sites. As currently composed, the S&Gs trigger archaeological assessments (exclusively so on properties without existing archaeological sites), require community and Indigenous engagement on government decision-making affecting heritage, and trigger and guide heritage assessments and conservation planning. The criteria for considering proposed exemptions, as currently laid out, are also so broad as to not represent limiting criteria at all.\nRE: The requiring of up-to-date municipal heritage registers on municipal websites. This is a positive change that will improve review times and predictability for developers and planners alike.\nRe: Removal of listed properties of heritage registers. The introduction of new limits on listed properties remaining on the municipal heritage register will require more deliberation when adding new properties. However, by retroactively starting a countdown on all existing listed heritage properties, municipal resources will be unnecessarily tied up for the next two years trying to sift through large existing registers to try and prioritize designations. This will result in more heritage designations in the short term. Please consider exempting previously listed properties from the two-year deadline to avoid this unanticipated consequence. Extending the window for previously listed properties could be another alternative.\nRE: Limitation of NOIDs to already listed properties when considered under a prescribed planning event. This change will force municipal heritage planners to proactively list and designate heritage properties regardless of whether a development application exists and when compounded with other changes. These activities will create a strain on municipal capacities and increase, rather than decrease, delays, particularly in the short term.\nRE: Proposed legislative authority to repeal or amend HCDs.

Together with our members, we address common challenges facing our residents and provide advice to the government about solutions to them. AMO has been actively involved in housing and homelessness advocacy for years, as Ontario\u2019s 444 municipal governments are responsible for building strong, complete communities, of which housing \u2013 both home ownership and rentals \u2013 is a key component.\nHousing affordability and building supply is a challenge all Ontarians share. There is much that can be done collectively by working together to increase housing supply, diversify the mix and increase affordability. Solving the housing crisis will require an all-of-government approach by all three orders of government and the development industry.\nIntroduction\nAMO appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on several consultations related to Bill 23 \u2013 More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022. These are in addition to the written submission to Bill 23 AMO provided to the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy.\nDespite the Bill\u2019s passage on November 28, municipal governments remain concerned that the legislation:\n1.\tShifts the cost burden of growth\n2.\tUndermines planning and community livability\n3.\tExacerbates risks to the environment and human health.\nOn November 30 AMO was pleased to see the government\u2019s response to AMO\u2019s preliminary analysis of the Bill which indicated a need for a transfer of up to $1 billion a year in costs from private sector developers to property taxpayers without any likelihood of improved housing affordability. Our focus will now shift towards making sure the housing pledges and targets are feasible and reasonable given historical data. To tie funding to unreachable targets and narrowly-defined \u201chousing enabling infrastructure\u201d are details we look forward to discussing more.\nIn the meantime, AMO is asking the province to work with all of its housing partners to take an integrated approach to environmental, social and economic policy that allows Ontario to take its place ahead of competing jurisdictions.\nTo that end, AMO respectfully submits comments on various consultations related to Bill 23 and the More Homes Built Faster Plan.\n\u2003\nProposed Changes to the Ontario Heritage Act and its Regulations: Bill 23 (Schedule 6) \u2013 The Proposed More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 (ERO 019-6196)\nThe Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism is proposing changes to heritage considerations to remove barriers that are perceived to be slowing housing construction and making it difficult to protect most of Ontario\u2019s identified heritage properties.\nAMO is supportive of measures that streamline provincial and municipal approvals in a way that speeds up development while balancing important liveability considerations. For example, the newtwo-year time limit on listing of non-designated buildings with a five-year limitation on re-listing could have the unintended consequence of creating more reactionary designations, and more appeals to the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) on matters of designation.\nThat is AMO supports the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI\u2019s) recommendation that mutual-consent clauses be allowed if the property owner agrees to allow for properties to remain on the Register past the two years, or to designate a property not previously listed.\nConclusion\nOn behalf of municipal governments across Ontario, thank you for your consideration of the comments provided in this submission.\n",

Heritage buildings and properties are valuable assets that support teaching of history to younger generations.... If we don't understand history, we don't understand ourselves!  The presence of Heritage buildings and properties in our communities reinforce our awareness that valuable aspects of our ways of life are lost in the face of change, and that change isn't always progress.

        "comment":"I strongly oppose the changes to Ontario Heritage Act proposed by Bill 23.\nI am the descendant of a family that built and stewarded some of the oldest homes in the Etobicoke area, one definitely dating back to 1834, others likely earlier.  Some of these buildings are already designated, but several of the other early structures associated with my family are only listed. Whether designations can be achieved within the time constraints of the new law is a great worry given the likely flood of applications that will occur, and if designation is not achieved, those historic buildings will be excluded for five years and vulnerable to the wrecking ball of developers.  I believe that should demolition occur, it would be a shameful outcome and a loss to our City and Province.\nI further note that The Annex, where I live as a tenant, is filled with unlisted and\/or undesignated buildings, many of real heritage value, that in many instances provide affordable accommodations. Examples include including very early (Edwardian, 1920s, 1930s) apartment buildings, notable mid-century modern apartment buildings, and old houses that have been subdivided, many offering social housing.  There is a great variety of building styles and all add to the idiosyncratic visual charm of a neighbourhood whose built form encompasses over 100 years of Toronto history.  Equally, the mixed human variety of the Annex, created by the mix of rental buildings and family homes, is very particular and precious.  Students share streets with the elderly and investment bankers rub shoulders with the residents of Toronto\u2019s oldest women\u2019s shelter.\nIf so many of our buildings are now vulnerable to demolition without due consideration, it will be a loss to the City and the Province, as part of our collective memory will disappear and an exciting, eclectic neighbourhood will be visually and socially homogenized.  The consequences will also be tragic for incumbent renters and for newcomers seeking affordable housing as the proposed developments in our area are almost exclusively at the expense of purpose built rentals in favour of luxury condominiums.\nFinally, I note the severe environmental cost of demolition, that the quality of older buildings can no longer be replicated due to cost and loss of craftspeople, and, as best said by the ACO, \u201cthe faster way to housing is to re-use and adapt existing buildings\u201d.\nI vehemently urge the Minister to reconsider the very risky modifications to the OHA found in Bill 23.\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to the Ontario government taking pieces of the worlds largest green belt protecting farmland, forests, wetlands, rivers and lakes (https:\/\/www.greenbelt.ca\/learn). The green belt also preserves cultural heritage and supports recreation and tourism in Ontario's Greater Golden Horseshoe, and is also the home to Mississauga of the Credit first nation (http:\/\/www.newcreditfirstnation.com\/ )\nBy approving bill C23, infrastructure costs that pre-date bill C23 were developer costs.  Now these costs will be downloaded to municipalities which will in turn most likely increase property taxes.\nNot to mention the environmental impacts it will have. The green belt holds many of the headwaters of watersheds that drain into Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. These lakes provide Ontario residents and first nations communities with clean drinking water and recreational activities necessary to maintain a healthy and balanced way of life.\nI do not feel the government is acting in the best interest of Ontario residents, its workers, and\/or their wellbeing. Rather acting in the best interest of corporations and developers who may own environmentally sensitive lands, that once developed will be worth much more money than the average resident can afford, not to mention the low income residents that will certainly not be able to afford the proposed future housing in these areas.\nAs an example of the negative impacts that are bound to surface, I\u2019ll use the example of current development in Brant County. Being located along a section of the Grand River between Paris and Brantford that has been designated \"Exceptional Waters\" (https:\/\/www.grandriver.ca\/en\/our-watershed\/Exceptional-Waters.aspx). Exceptional Waters is a provincial program, because of the Grand River and its special characteristics in this area. I'm very concerned as currently we have already experienced a substantial amount of development along the Grand River and its tributaries in the areas holding this designation.\nIt appears the designation has done nothing to help manage or protect the natural areas from irresponsible fast tracked development in the area.  This irresponsible development only benefits developers and enhances tax base for the county of Brant and its municipalities.\n",

All of these buildings in towns sprinkled everywhere in rural Ontario and urban Ontario are our culture. They must be protected and preserved, restored, protected and remain in their original states, to tell our history.

        "comment":"I have the following concerns:\nThe proposed Bill 23 frames the conservation of heritage resources generally and within the current tools as being a barrier to more housing. I do not agree with this and I believe it is not a fair statement, and it is one that does not recognize the many accomplishments to date where heritage resources have been incorporated into development to into beautiful, sensitive and inclusive developments. Heritage Conservation as a practice has been demonstrated in countless successful redevelopment projects to be a consideration that can work within a proposal and  in fact it enhances our ever progressive communities and aligns with sustainability targets. Heritage is not opposed to more housing. Heritage is for quality and meaningful, human centered places. I am really concerned, that making it a more rigorous legislated process to list properties actually creates barriers and eliminates options for the general public to articulate, understand, share information, integrate resources into development and appreciate culture and cultural heritage sites as well as amend and reevaluate our understanding of a site as time goes by. How can we truly reflect and embrace culture in our surrounding environment and in a modern, inclusive, kind, empathetic society if the bar to appreciate, identify, tell transparent stories of our society and protect culture and cultural resources through listing and designation is set so high and asks for so much justification that it becomes unattainable for the general public? We should leave listing requirements the way they are, and not add requirements to meet more than one criteria in order to designate under Part 4 of the OHA. Pleade do not make the listing and designation process require more time and money because it makes culture inaccessible. People want to identify and keep the essence of a place and allow for smart change and keep a balance. Instead, please make designation easier to complete, clearer and faster, not more cumbersome and unattainable. People and communities need cultural resources as part of our balanced wellbeing. The process to identify and protect cultural resources has to be accessible to all.  I believe we live in a country where the value we cherish is to embrace culture and its resources, not discount them.\n",

        "comment":"Loss of heritage sites and demolition of older buildings means loss of jobs in the renovation and tourism industries, and loss of our sense of place.  In addition, destroying older buildings releases embodied carbon and contributes to climate change.\nPlease reconsider the two year time limit after which properties would be removed from the Municipal Heritage Register. In addition, a proposed five-year ban on re-listing is punitive (Section 27.18.) Further, the two year timeline puts significant pressures on municipal staff to perform a task that would likely be impossible.\nThe Province should consider the role that the Ontario Heritage Trust can play in collecting and managing data about non-designated property included on Registers. Creating a publicly accessible Register that is posted to a municipal website takes time and resources. The Ontario Heritage Trust's Ontario Heritage Act Register of designated properties can be leveraged to serve as a shareable open dataset that municipalities can use to meet requirements for making information about designated properties publicly accessible on municipal websites.\nOne criteria is sufficient for designating a property. To quote an article regarding the proposed changes to the Regulation 9\/06 designation requirements: \u201cHere\u2019s a better one: membership admission criteria for an orchestra. To join an orchestra you only need to play one instrument well, not all of them. Or this one\u2026 to be considered marginalized you only need to belong to one marginalized group, not all of them. To say you have to belong to two or more marginalized communities to be considered marginalized would verge on the absurd. Is it clear now why requiring two or more heritage criteria be met \u2014 to provide further \u201crigour\u201d in designations, says the government \u2014 is such a bad idea?\u201d\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will not result in more affordable housing being built, AND they will have a very negative impact on heritage conservation and attitudes about heritage, multiculturalism and citizenship in Ontario.\nThey should not be implemented as presented.\nMost worrisome is the proposal to require that two criteria, instead of one, be met for designation to occur. This will practically ensure that no humble buildings and places associated with the historic contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco-Ontarian, multicultural and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities can be protected.\nSites like the John Freeman Walls Underground Railroad Museum in Emeryville, the Portuguese Cultural Centre in Mississauga, Potters Field Burial Grounds in Owen Sound, Reggae Lane, Little Jamaica Toronto  -- all very important to their local community -- could not be protected under the proposed new Ontario Heritage Act regulations.\nThis is shameful, coming on the heels of a strong movement within the heritage community to respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Black Lives Matter movement, Canada's adoption of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, and other social trends, to broaden and diversify ideas and practice of heritage.\nIt is embarrassing to see backward step just as heritage moves under the wing of the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism.  What a slap in the face of Ontario's multicultural citizens!\nRemoving any protection from properties which the local community has taken the time to list as important enough to safeguard will not, in itself, create more housing, let alone more affordable housing.\nOn the contrary, one of the quickest ways to provide affordable housing is to adapt existing heritage buildings. There are many examples of heritage buildings making great affordable housing, e.g. Victoria School in Kitchener adapted to geared to income housing, Toronto's Cabbagetown Rooming Houses, Victorian rowhouses converted to 44 rental units,  Windsor's Welcome Shelter for Women, a 1916 building converted into an emergency homelessness shelter for women, with or without children.\nInstead of attacking heritage, Ontario should be incentivizing owners of heritage buildings to convert them to housing. This would produce great results, quickly.\n",

        "comment":"I'm horrified by both the motivation behind the omnibus-style Bill 23 and the implications if it is enacted. Two (and many more) wrongs don't make a right, and the current housing crisis (as well as the effects of the climate crisis) can only be made worse by creating more of the kinds of problems and short-term thinking that will weaken our society and economy long term.\nIf this Bill isn't modified, it will be embarrassing to admit that I live in Ontario and no doubt it will become a less desirable place to live and work overall.\nI agree with many of the comments and concerns raised already by people and groups, including municipalities, architects, heritage groups, environmental experts, Indigenous groups, and Parks Canada. Bill 23 includes so many concerning details that it is hard to know which to comment on here. But some of the most alarming problems include:\n-- Allowing subdivisions to be built on parts of the Greenbelt, which will destroy non-renewable natural resources and create more of the kind of urban sprawl-style housing that is ugly, inefficient, and ironically is unaffordable and inaccessible to many anyway.\n-- Presenting the appearance and arguably reality of corruption and financial gain for developers at the expense of citizens\n-- Removing requirements for public meetings for planning of subdivisions\n-- Giving the Minister the power to amend municipal official plans without public consultation\n-- Severely limiting the role of Conservation Authorities, removing environmental protection and conservation from their oversight\n-- Freezing, reducing, or exempting developer fees used to pay for new development services such as public parks, road and sewer infrastructure, and community centres, thereby offloading even more costs to municipalities and citizens through property taxes\n-- Weakening or eliminating many housing regulations that exist to protect the natural environment and communities from bad building practices. The so-called \"red tape\" being removed actually represents important policies and protections that improve the quality of life and safety of Ontarians; removing these is reckless and dangerous.\nThe Greenbelt, as is, must be protected, and building standards and regulations are essential. This Bill seems to imagine a self-contained bubble in which businesses can do whatever costs the least and takes the least effort -- slapping up poorly designed housing at any social \"cost\" -- all without suffering  real-world consequences. But the opposite is true:  changes that happen based on this Bill could cause real harm for the real lives of real Ontarians for years to come.\nIt is the job of government to be responsible for maintaining society's best interests. With this Bill, this current government is not doing its job. We can address the current housing crisis by using creative solutions that involve better use of space and resources in urban areas where infrastructure already exists. A larger debate on rent control and housing as a human right would also be useful, but in the meantime paving what is left of our agricultural and environmentally sensitive areas is a disasterous approach to the current situation. Enabling a free-for-all by removing regulations and protections verges on criminal negligence.\nThank you for taking the comments and concerns of Ontario citizens into consideration\n",

I believe that growth can be accommodated without making all of Ontario\u2019s towns and cities look like carbon copies of each other.\nIn their report to St. Catharines city council, the Planning and Building Services department notes that, in the city\u2019s official plan, heritage preservation is important \u201cnot only because it connects us to our past and helps us to interpret our history, but also because it can benefit the local economy by attracting both visitors to the city and new investment or residents.\u201d\nThey also observe that throughout the province, \u201cthe most significant concern [about Bill 23] relates to the dismantling of Heritage Registers through the removal of listed properties after two years unless they are designated by the municipality. The resources required to designate each property individually under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act would be immense and will result in the loss of thousands of heritage properties across the province.\u201d Heritage and development can co-exist. The combination of old and new can create vibrant communities that maintain their sense of place. Property owners as well as other members of the community can help to shape their town or city \u201cand determine what they value about its past and hope for in its future.\u201d\nIn a recent news release, Diane Chin, Chair of The Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, echoes the concerns of St. Catharines city planners: \u201c\u2026 the changes proposed for the Ontario Heritage Act (OHA) in Bill 23 will make it practically impossible to protect most of Ontario\u2019s identified heritage properties. This can only be seen as a knee-jerk response to a vindictive attack by the development industry on our heritage system. There was no consultation or consideration of the destructive impacts of these proposals across Ontario.\u201d She adds, \u201cWhy drop a cluster bomb of changes into the heritage system that will not create a single unit of affordable housing?\u201d\nAn article in Canadian Architect states that \u201crequiring a property to meet two of the legislated criteria for designation, instead of one, will make it challenging to protect the often-humble buildings and places associated with the historic contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco-Ontarian, multicultural, and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities to Ontario. This will seriously hamper communities like Little Jamaica or Kensington Market currently seeking heritage status and protection\u201d (canadianarchitect.com). I don\u2019t understand why the Ford government, and the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism in particular, is forcing this cumbersome and expensive process of \u201cdesignating\u201d properties when \u201clisting\u201d properties recognizes their cultural value in an efficient way without undue demands on the limited resources of a municipality.\nHow does this help the government to achieve its stated intent of building more homes faster?\nThere is a reason that Canadians travel to Europe.

The heritage register represents a \u201cwatch list\u201d of buildings that have heritage value, which are protected from demolition for 60 days, whereas designation provides legal protection for a property.\nUnder Bill 23 all listed properties on the municipal heritage registry (that are not officially designated) will no longer have listed status after two years, unless they are designated within that period.  Right now, municipalities have 60 days to prevent the demolition of buildings with potential heritage value. Under the new provincial rules, there will be only 30 days to protect the building, which is too short for municipal council action \u2013 and some buildings may even be exempt from heritage designation the moment a development application is submitted. This is turning back the page on nearly 50 years of cultural heritage protection in Ontario.\nWhy is heritage important in the first place?  \u2026.because heritage recognises the authenticity of a place (like a neighbourhood).  This means the ability to connect to its past, interpret its history, and also benefits to the local economy by attracting both visitors and residents, in a holistic and efficient way that reflects local realities. The latter is especially key to main street commercial properties that are at risk of losing their scale and fine grained character.\nSo why is heritage important in Leaside?\n \u201cLeaside is probably the best example we have in Toronto \u2013 or perhaps Canada - of a fully-planned  \u201cgarden\u201d or \u201crailway suburb\u201d that was built in the 1930s\/40s in accordance with a single overall plan. As such it may well qualify as a potential Heritage Neighbourhood \u2013 one that comprises a set of clearly identified and planning and design features that are repeated right across the community\u201d\nThis is a quote from noted Planner John Van Nostrand in 2015 when Leaside was being considered in the City\u2019s Heritage Conservation District (HCD) shortlist.\nWhile to this point not obtaining an HCD, Leaside has a number of listed and designated heritage properties in Leaside. So let\u2019s consider the threat to cultural heritage in Leaside resulting from the OHA amendments. Reviewing the listed properties (i.e. those not designated) that were either listed by the former Borough of East York (1975 to 1997) \u2013 four properties (including two original Lea family homes, or the City of Toronto (1998 to present) \u2013 33 properties including 22 Research Road, a WW2 plant that made radar, and main street commercial properties on the east side of Bayview Avenue.  These properties would be automatically de-listed by Bill 23, unless designated within two years.\nThis creates a real risk of irretrievable loss of cultural heritage due to demolition, not to mention the wasted energy by generations of municipal councils (East York, Toronto), staff, and volunteers.\nThere are many misguided proposals in Schedule 6 of the Bill, such as increasing the number of criteria to be met for the protection heritage properties. This change will effectively exclude many heritage places of importance to Indigenous, Black and other marginalized communities who celebrate their culture in this province.\nThe changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will have a devastating effect on the ability of Ontario\u2019s communities of all sizes and kinds to preserve and protect the places we cherish and hold dear. The multicultural impact, with its anti-inclusionary effects, alone is an embarrasen to the Minister of Citizenship and Multiculturalism. These proposals will have NO DISCERNIBLE EFFECT ON HOUSING STARTS and will increase uncertainty and unpredictability in land use planning decisions.\nThe Leaside Residents Association (LRA) requests that the changes to the Ontario Heritage Act NOT BE PROCLAIMED.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments.\nI have tremendous concerns about the proposed changes in Bill 23 More Homes Built Faster Act 2022 to the Heritage Act because the result of these changes will be the loss of many properties with features that have heritage value.\nIncreasing the threshold for obtaining a designation will deter people who are even slightly hesitant about undertaking designation. Many people are already reluctant to apply for heritage designation for their property due to the restrictions and anticipated cost associated with designation. Many properties that merit designation are being lost each year under the Heritage Act without any changes. It stands to reason that many more will be lost if the rules for qualifying for heritage designation are made more difficult.\nImposing a two year timeline on the properties on the municipal heritage register will also result in many more properties being lost. It will also tend to deter municipalities from maintaining complete and thorough heritage registries, particularly in the smaller municipalities that have very limited budget and staff allocated to work on the heritage registry and designation work. In smaller municipalities, undertaking the process of creating a heritage registry can take years of effort.  This work relies entirely a very small number of people, or in some municipalities, due to these limitations, the work to create a heritage registry has involved the assistance of members of the municipal Heritage Advisory Committee, who do the work on a volunteer basis.\nIn light of these limitations, it is completely unrealistic to demand that every eligible property achieves heritage designation within two years otherwise they are to be removed from the registry. The reality is that years of work, in some cases hundreds of hours by volunteers that has gone into documenting heritage properties will be completely wasted. With these changes, all of the work that has been will be wiped out, with the exception of those few properties that successfully apply and achieve heritage designation within two years - if they meet the higher standard that is being proposed.\nIt is very difficult to imagine a better, or more effective way to completely frustrate municipal staff who work on heritage and at the same time discourage members of the public from volunteering their time to assist with Heritage Advisory Committees. And if that happens it is easy to see that the Heritage Act will have no meaning and heritage will no longer be a consideration in the development process.\nWhile it is important to address the need for more homes in Ontario that are affordable, it is more than a little far-fetched to propose that the demolition of structures with heritage value will do much, or anything to achieve that goal. Many people who live in Ontario (or will move here over the next 20 or 30 years)  require affordable homes, but at the same time, people also want to feel like they are part of a community. There are many things that make communities enjoyable places to live. One feature is a community's unique charm and beauty. The architectural heritage of a community is a huge contributor to what makes communities distinct from each other. The architectural heritage and other heritage features need to be preserved and protected because this helps to protect more than just the history of and it contributes to the unique identity of a community. These features are often part of what provides a draw for tourism in communities. Tourism is an important economic driver for many communities in Ontario. If the architectural and other heritage features are lost, it will not be nearly as interesting to travel and explore Ontario. Communities will lose their uniqueness. When communities all look the same, the result will be that people will choose to travel elsewhere instead of vacationing and traveling around Ontario.\nIt takes some creativity and effort, and sometimes extra cost, but preserving the heritage features of communities is important. While it appears The Housing Affordabilty Task Force does not attribute much value to heritage as it appears in the report with quotation marks, the report also states that the amount of land available for residential development is not the cause of the lack of affordable homes. Their assessment was there is plenty of land available to build affordable homes. It does not require opening up the Greenbelt or taking away the powers of Conservation Authorities or these proposed changes to the Heritage Act to build affordable housing. It requires funding, some targets and it requires cooperation between municipal, provincial  and federal governments.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 23: More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 is a full frontal attack by the Progressive Conservative government on the people of Ontario. There are many aspects of this bill that are destructive, but the proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act demonstrates a blatant and high-handed disregard towards heritage property owners, municipalities, environmental best practices, community sentiment and values, and due process.\nThis bill forces heritage property owners to choose listing OR designation. It forces  municipalities to designate listed properties within 2 years or lose them from their heritage properties registers, which is totally arbitrary and irresponsible. Municipalities lose crucial local planning ability, and their mandated volunteer heritage advisory committees will be rendered impotent.\nHeritage properties, conservation districts, and cultural landscapes are vulnerable at the best of times. It hardly matters whether the consequences are intended or unintended, Bill 23 will ensure the destruction of heritage assets that volunteers, property owners, and municipalities have valued and protected for decades. Our community has recently witnessed the willful destruction of landmark properties at the hands of rapacious developers, and this bill will ensure the floodgates open. Demolition by neglect is already releasing carbon emissions, and filling scarce landfills, when preserving, adapting, and reusing existing structures is the responsible course of action.\nI have observed government ministers in the assembly mock and disparage the legitimate concerns expressed by Ontarians about this draconian bill. Listen to the voters. Revise it, repeal it, spike it. This bill is a failure as it exists now.\n",

Development should not encourage urban sprawl with its need for new roads and urban infrastructure. This expansion is most unfortunate given that the Premier promised that the Greenbelt would not be touched. This will contribute to increasing cynicism regarding the honesty of politicians.\nParkland Requirement Reduction\nThe proposal to cut in half the amount of parkland that developers must allocate to new development is most unfortunate given that the vertical nature of new condo developments increases the need for more common space.\nConservation\nThe proposed limitation of the role of conservation authorities is distressing as they have an important role in managing watersheds.\nClimate Change\nTighter, not looser, environmental standards are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new construction.\nProtection of Cultural Heritage Resources\nThe proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will make it more difficult (if not virtually impossible) for municipalities to identify and protect their heritage resources using their heritage registers. In Toronto, heritage planning staff will be put in an impossible situation from the standpoint of increased workload!\n",

        "comment":"I will quote thoughts from the websites I attached:\nThe changes proposed for the Ontario Heritage Act (in Bill 23 will make it practically impossible to protect most of Ontario\u2019s identified heritage properties.\nRequiring a property meet two of the legislated criteria for designation, instead of one, will make it challenging to protect the often humble buildings and places associated with the historic contributions of Black, Indigenous, Franco Ontarian, multicultural, and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities to Ontario. This will seriously hamper important sites like Owen Sound's Potter's Field (unmarked graves of 1300 indigents including many Black settlers fleeing slavery)  and communities like Little Jamaica or Kensington Market currently seeking heritage status and protection.\nToronto\u2019s heritage register currently has over 11,000 properties, which is a reasonable number, and possibly lower than other comparable cities. Of that number, nearly 4,000 are listed but not designated. The notion that the City could process the designation of 4,000 properties in a two-year period is simply impossible. So the unintended (or possibly intended) consequence of Bill 23 is that many listed properties will simply be thrown off the register, without any potential protection for a period of five years.\nThe bottleneck could be easy to solve if the legislation simply recognized the need for a transition period, providing municipalities with time to make the change.\nIn contemporary Canadian culture, many things can be understood to have cultural or heritage value. Heritage is no longer as simple as the Ontario Heritage Act would like it to be. In fact, with consideration of Indigenous Reconciliation and Black Lives Matter, as well as many new immigrant communities, even newer aspects of heritage are being revealed.\nWe need to supplement the limited resources of the Ontario Heritage Act with a stronger recognition and respect for the diversity that exists in our culture, and the need for dialogue on heritage values.  The changes proposed in the More Homes, Built Faster Act are a backward step.\nUNDRIP:\nThese proposed changes also go against UNDRIP article 19 and 32. As of June 21, 2021 UNDRIP is now enshrined in Canadian law and must be followed. The land included in Bill 23 development proposal is the traditional territory of many Indigenous Nations. As such, prior and informed consultation with each of these Nations is a REQUIREMENT BEFORE passing any laws or Bills mandating development, including Bill 23. No such consultation has occurred. Posting on an open message board on ERO cannot be considered consultation. Was any attempt even made to advise Indigenous Nations of this ERO message board? If not, it cannot remotely be considered consultation.\n",

In the stroke of a pen, the Ford Government will attempt to erase that history to make way for housing!

        "comment":"I believe the Ontario government\u2019s Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act, is an attack on the multicultural and socioeconomic diversity of all communities in Ontario.  I am a proud owner of a designated heritage building.  My house and the other older buildings in my town help define the rich history and character of our area; and they attract visitors and locals alike to stop, spend time with their families, and visit our local businesses.  Sadly, Bill 23\u2019s proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act will make it almost impossible to protect most heritage buildings and historical sites in our province.\nAccording to the government\u2019s own website: \u201cThe Government of Ontario recognizes that the province\u2019s heritage tells us who we are, where we have come from and what we have accomplished.  This knowledge is a source of strength and confidence.\u201d  Those are very wise words.  However, it has become apparent that the Government of Ontario no longer believes in these principles and values.  With the passage of Bill 23, the current government is prepared to sacrifice Ontario\u2019s heritage in the name of development and profit.\nEnabling the development industry to bulldoze Ontario\u2019s cultural heritage as if it was an obstacle to be removed is outrageous and foolish.  Diane Chin, Chair, Architectural Conservancy Ontario said: \u201cWhy drop a cluster bomb of changes into the heritage system that will not create a single unit of affordable housing?\u201d  The destruction of heritage buildings is not needed to meet long range housing targets.\nIn Bill 23, the changes to the Municipal Heritage Register and listing undermine the importance of local planning, limit the ability of local Municipal Heritage Committees, and place undue pressure on municipal staff and volunteers to protect local heritage properties.  Forcing municipalities to designate all listed properties within two years or drop them from the Register will result in tens of thousands of listed sites losing what little protection they have.\nInstead, fully protecting our heritage buildings would contribute to the communities in areas already designated for development and within municipal settlement boundaries.  Beautiful existing older buildings can be re-purposed for condos, small businesses, homes for seniors, and affordable apartments; especially those already serviced and connected by transit.  Conserving Ontario\u2019s heritage sites and our historic buildings means jobs in the renovation and tourism industries, and a healthy sense of place in our communities.  The Government of Ontario should be enhancing and expanding protection under the Ontario Heritage Act, not throwing a bomb at it!\nRepeal Bill 23, rethink, and halt these proposed changes to the Ontario Heritage Act.  Please be reminded that Ontario\u2019s cultural heritage belongs to ALL Ontarians!\n",

        "comment":"Changes affecting the Standards and Guidelines for Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties\nI am opposed to the concept of Ministerial review powers and strongly recommend no further action.\nOnly a qualified heritage professional can make the determination of cultural heritage value or interest by a ministry or prescribed public body respecting a provincial heritage property.\nThis is the hallmark of our accepted best practices and legislative processes globally including the World Heritage Committee which has been functioning for 50 years.\nEach Ministry and Prescribed Public Body has an Advisory Panel in their Identification and Evaluation Process to review and advise government should a circumstance arise around the determination of cultural heritage value\nThis peer preview is objective and professional versus a political decision.   If the Minister wishes to decide NOT to list a provincial heritage property, then this is a matter for the government to consider and vote similar to a municipal council does for designation under Part IV and V.\nNew requirements for municipal registers and the inclusion of non-designated properties on the municipal register\nI support clear and transparent standards and goals for municipal practices around the inclusion of non-designated properties on a municipal register, however this should only be done once there is consultation with municipalities.\nI oppose all the proposed legislative changes except for requiring municipalities to make an up-to-date version of the information on their municipal register available on a publicly-accessible municipal website.\nThis amendment should be delayed by 1 year to allow municipalities time to make the necessary changes to their website. Municipalities may seek approval to extend this transition deadline, if needed.\nI note that the Ministry has yet to have the list of provincial heritage properties publically accessible after 12 years of the Standards and Guidelines came into effect.\nIncreasing the standard for including a non-designated property on a municipal register by requiring that the property meet prescribed criteria is contrary to the principle of Listing which is to be timely decisions by Municipal Council.\nWhile generally there is a practice for some municipalities (with staff) to apply the criteria included in O. Reg. 9\/06 (Criteria for determining cultural heritage value or interest) this regulation has yet to be examined in 17 years.\nFor example, the identification of sites of spiritual and Indigenous Heritage may not qualify under this colonial construct which is feasible without criteria.\nRemoval from the register\nIf council moves to designate a listed property but a designation bylaw is not passed or is repealed on appeal, the property would have to be removed from the municipal register.\nI oppose this entire concept of a temporary record and request to follow the City of Toronto practice to keep demolished properties and the by-law repealed as a public record and a tool for comparative analysis and research.  The Register notes the date of demolition.\nI strongly oppose the proposal to remove non-designate properties from a municipal register if council does not issue a notice of intention to designate (NOID) within two years of the amendments coming into force.\nThe confusion and unintended consequences of making the Register a transitory or temporary record are numerous and are as follows.\n\u2022\tLack of understanding of the fundamental principles purpose to list non-designated properties including recognition and celebration, flag to demolition applications.  Keep planning related matters to the Planning Act and PPS.\n\u2022\tAdministrative burden and red tape on tracking the two years and the five year \"penalty box\" of not being able to relist\n\u2022\tChaos on what is listed or not listed as it will lead to unofficial heritage inventories\n\u2022\tMost municipalities average 1 or even less NOIDs a year and do not have the capacity to designate properties in 2 years resulting in the potential loss of over 30,000 heritage properties (see attached document).\n\u2022\tSince Bill 108 amendments came into force in July 1 2021, the appeals of NOID has dramatically increase and anticipate the increase of appeals will unnecessarily overload the OLT capacity\n\u2022\tProvincial properties are often included on municipal register and are not allowed to be designated. The properties and landmark sites will not be identified in planning matters\n\u2022\tMunicipalities typically list \"contributing properties\" of a Heritage Conservation District study to ensure that these properties (many of which are commercial properties) have a flag for demolition.  To designate hundreds or thousands of properties under Part IV while awaiting the outcome of a HCD study or when a HCD Plan is under appeal defeats the purpose of the Part V designation.   There should be no expiration of listed properties and especially while the matter is under appeal at the OLT.\n\u2022\tCurrently the Historic Yonge HCD appeal has been ongoing since January 2016 and may not be resolved until 2023 or 2024.\n\u2022\tSince 2021, the City of Toronto has 60 Prescribed Events and these time limits have greatly stressed the municipal capacity.  With the exception of two Prescribed Events, owners have signed waivers to the 90 days limit and want to have the flexibility for the timing of the designation and to reach a mutual understanding.\n\u2022\tForcing designation on active places of worship or institutional landowner e.g., universities and colleges\n\u2022\tMunicipal and civic sites will be a low priority as they are not subject for rezoning of housing leading to confusion on their cultural heritage value\nListing is not nor should be a requirement of a NOID and the two should not be coupled. There are many benefits to listing, but it should not limit the ability of a municipality to designate a property subject to a Planning Act application.\nThe 90-day time limit already addresses and provides the opportunity for transparency and early engagement on what properties have cultural heritage value.\nDespite numerous requests for clarification, the Ministry would not explain the proposal\nincreasing the threshold by requiring that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation\nThe question for clarification - these two of nine criteria or two of three categories.\nWhatever the answer, it is not one that should be changed until there is great research on the regulation and consultation with municipalities.\nHeritage Conservation District studies\nI have spent the last 8 years leading the development of 18 HCD studies.  There is more\nrigour in the process of identifying and protecting heritage conservation districts (HCD) and does not require applying prescribed criteria to determine a HCD\u2019s cultural heritage value or interest.\nThis would include a requirement for HCD plans to explain how the HCD meets the prescribed criteria. MCM proposal to have the criteria currently included in O. Reg. 9\/06 apply to HCDs is absolutely the wrong approach as this criteria is for an individaul property and does not apply to a district or collection of properties.  The lack of understanding of the criteria and HCD evaluation is discouraging after offering numerous examples of HCDs.  The current HCD study of Baby Point in the City of Toronto is one to understand before even considering criteria due to the Indigenous heritage and archaeological sensitivity of the site.\nThe Ministry has promised for several years to issue new guidance on HCDs and should focus their attention to this effort and work with CAHP and training professionals and interns.\nI do support and welcome the proposal to introduce a regulatory authority to prescribe processes for municipalities to amend or repeal existing HCD designation and HCD plan bylaws.\nIn general, I am disheartened and discouraged by the lack of research to inform this public policy and MCM's lack of effort to offer meaningful consultation with municipalities and heritage professionals during the introduction and the Government's hearings of Bill 23.  The Ontario Heritage Act will be gutted and have limited benefit to advancing and resolving the housing crisis in our communities.\nThank you\n",

        "comment":"Here is an example of what happens to Heritage Buildings in Vaughan.\nBlocks 47, 44 & 41 - Teston & Pine Valley Area\n10390 Pine Valley Road (Item 5: https:\/\/pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com\/Meeting.aspx?Id=ad6661f3-4ac6-4\u2026), is confidential and been added as an addendum to the Committee of the Whole meeting, abutts and is somehow been approved on portion of the Greenbelt, has a long controversial history and an OLT\/LPAT 2016 decision that appears to have enabled development outside of York Region's approved 2010 urban boundary on the Greenbelt and ahead of York Region completing the North East Vaughan Water\/Waste Water Servicing Solution EA in 2019.How The City of Vaughan and York Region proceeded to approve development on Blocks 47, 44 and 41 (Block 41 approved by a MZO and home of the controversial ROAP7) have proceeded under LPAT\/OMB\/OLT decisions in 2016 (https:\/\/www.omb.gov.on.ca\/e-decisions\/pl150684-Apr-06-2016.pdf) ahead of York Region completing the EA in 2019 remains a mystery to me. I don't understand why this is at the tribunal again when there was a decision on this property in 2016, that Vaughan has provided zero information when there is certainly much that is public about this development makes it appear that Council and staff are not being tansparent about what is being asked and what they are deciding upon.\nIt is clear that the natural and cultural heritage is being decimated by these development and either there is nothing the City can do or they are facilitating development that undermines and is questionably compliant with the Provincial Policy Statement, Ontario Heritage Act, Endangered Species Legislation and more. The Purpleville Post Office located at 10733 Pine Valley Dr.(Pine Valley & Teston Rd - https:\/\/pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com\/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=46719) has been delisted due to a fire. There was no indication that Vaughan fire services was called or any type of investigation was completed.\nNow on today's committee of adjustment agenda as we move west along Teston Rd there are two properties requesting delisting as heritage status one a log cabin at 3911 Teston Rd quoted from the July 20\/2022 staff report: \"Today, the site consists of a pile of debris where the log building once stood.\"\nhttps:\/\/pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com\/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=1157\u2026\nNo explanation as how it came to be a pile of debris. Nor the timing of the applications attachments to the Heritage Committee, there is demolition request from 2019 and a request from the landowners consultant to delist the property b\/c there is no structures left that are of cultural significance. Then there is the delisting for 3180 Teston Rd also destroyed in a fire with the consultant landowners request (https:\/\/pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com\/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=1157\u2026) that it be delisted. The staff report on today's agenda provides a link to the Heritage Committee report due to the size of the attachments rather than listing them as attachments. Suggesting they are too large to attach does not seem plausable given that there are no issues attaching documents that are master plans and 100s of pages long. Again transparency is lacking here too, intentional or not.\nWas there any due diligence done on behalf of Vaughan staff to protect or investigate why 3 properties on the same block, under intense development pressure, identified for protection under Ontario's Heritage Act have either caught fire or become a pile of debris? It seems highly coincidental.\nAll you have to promote Vaughan's heritage is to point people to the archives as was done in Councillor newsletters and City social media statements recently.\nVaughan Planning staff insult residents and provincial planning and environmental legislation when they continually parrot that any and all development applications are \"consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement\" when they clearly are not; it is a slow, relentless push to destroy what little cultural and natural heritage remains in Vaughan. By the time developments are complete they look nothing like what was in approved Official Plans, Secondary Plans or what the public was actually consulted upon for approval.\nI understand there is relentless pressure for development and limited resources but that does not excuse ignoring issues of compliance and enforcement. The only way these issues can be addressed is if they are identified, recognized and brought to light. To not do so makes Council and Vaughan staff culpable and perpetuates what can only be described as a 'culture of complacency\".\n",

        "comment":"It is quite ridiculous, that the Ford government has passed the legislation related to this ERO before these comments were even collected, let alone reviewed. What kind of system do we have, where comments on environmental impact are clearly and so obviously ignored by the government. It should be criminal, quite frankly, that any government would so blatantly ignore both their responsibility to hear from the public (whom they are engaged by, and responsible to, by the way) and their responsibility to approach their planning in an environmentally respectful manner. It is shameful that such widespread and impactful legislation was passed so hurriedly and without discussion or contest.\nI believe the changes to the Heritage Act will have a negative effect on the quality of our cities and small towns in Ontario. Our heritage buildings represent our history, which deserves to be remembered and reflected upon in the flesh, not merely through photographs. They add character to our towns and cities that just cannot be replicated with modern architecture. Our heritage buildings represent fascinating times in both architectural and building methodology history. To lose an old home or building is akin to burning a book. There is something lost that cannot be recreated through pictures or a modern re-print. They add life and charm, and wonder to an otherwise stale landscape of boring building designs.\nTo make it easier for Heritage Homes and properties to not become registered, or to make it easier to object to inclusion of certain properties is a clear and obvious sell-out to the development industry. It is no secret that many developers have no interest in the historic or architectural value of a home or property. If they can demolish and build something that will make them money, they will. It is a tragedy and greed in its purest form. The changes to the Heritage Act will see more old buildings destroyed for no more good reason than money, and that is sickening. I am extremely against it. Whoever was responsible for the creation of these changes in the act I am sure knew exactly what the outcomes would be. For shame. The historic properties are of public value and interest regardless of whomever owns it, or how deep their pockets are.\nTo place such a tight timeline on councils to put forth a notice of intention to designate, makes it obviously possible that some buildings will fall through the cracks in a bureaucratic backlog, and be removed or not added to the historical designation. Developers I am sure, will only hope that that happens.\nOnce a heritage building is gone, it is gone forever. We have already lost, and are continuing to lose many heritage buildings across Ontario, particularly in areas in and around the GTA and other populated centres. Some buildings which you will not find examples of elsewhere in Ontario, due to the historical wealth in the area. As an example, we farm North of Toronto in historically wealthy farming areas. Many of the old brick homes are large, and have bi-chromatic brick work- an extra expense you do not often see elsewhere in the province, with brilliant gables and porches. These home are owned by wealthy developers and intentionally encouraged to rot so they may tear them down later. They pull shingles from the roof, and leave the windows open to encourage moisture and rotting. It is a shame. They sit empty, and could be loved, and used as housing, and as beautiful examples of our historic architecture. They can and should be included in new developments should they happen. We should be encouraging them being saved, not abruptly passing legislature that works to tear them down.\n",

These are things that give a sense of place and of home, and their loss would be significant. Preserving these areas is a continuous effort, and should you move ahead to allow development on these lands, that loss is permanent and irreversible. Even beyond their intrinsic value, the more sensitive lands protected by Conservation Authorities provide may ecosystem services including improved water quality and stormwater management. In my understanding, this bill fails to account for this. Additionally, building over wetlands and floodplains, while possible, is a bad idea as it will result in property damage. I would like to see a bill proposal that builds sustainably and respectfully, up rather than out, and works with not against out land and the organizations that protect it\nI think that many of these concerns are communicated in the OMA's and Conservation Ontario's submissions regarding this bill.

        "comment":"These proposed changes are irresponsible to society:\nIt is wrong to force municipalities to drop \u201clisted\u201d properties from from their heritage registers if they are not designated in two years.\nIt is wrong to enable the Crown in right of Ontario or a ministry or prescribed public body to exempt themselves with complying to protections for designated heritage properties if the exemption could potentially advance one or more of the following provincial priorities: transit, housing, long-term care and other infrastructure or other prescribed provincial priorities.\nIt is wrong that the proposals will make it harder for municipalities to protect heritage conservation districts (HCD) proposing that the HCD must meet two or more of the criteria in order to be designated.\nIt is wrong that proposal introduces a regulatory authority to prescribe processes for municipalities to amend or repeal existing HCD designation and HCD plan bylaws.\nBy making it easier to remove properties from the register these proposal are simply overriding the extensive work and evaluation that has been put in to get these unique natural heritage properties on the register in the first place.  Designating buildings is a cumbersome process that has been left to volunteers on heritage communities within communities. These changes, especially the delisting of properties that have not been designated after two years, devalues decades of work by these volunteers .\nThis government should be doing more to show that conservation of heritage buildings matters not eliminating them so developers can tear them down and build.\nIn summary I object to all the above provisions mentioned above in the new proposal for the Heritage Act.\n",
