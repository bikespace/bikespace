        "comment": "I cannot but think that this proposed piece of legislation is anything more than an appeal to garner votes. Traffic engineers and urban planners agree that the root cause of traffic congestion is the presence of motor vehicles, and then the solution to congestion is to move motorists towards alternative forms of transportation such as cycling and transit. The Ministry clearly does not understand the concept of induced demand, in terms of which the introduction of additional vehicular travel lanes to reduce congestion has the opposite effect of inducing congestion. I am extremely disappointed that the Province would seek to override the expertise of local planning professionals and dictate to municipalities how best to solve their traffic issues. It is furthermore unimaginable that the Province would propose to remove active transportation infrastructure where it has been implemented at a time when Ontarians are without adequate medical care, are struggling to put food on the tables and pay their rents. The priorities of the Province are out of touch with reality.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ludicrous bill. Municipalities need to prioritize alternate modes of transportation to car traffic in order to reduce reliance on cars as the preferred method of transportation within their boundaries. This is clearly an overreach to take power away from the locally elected Toronto city council. The population of Ontario is growing faster than road infrastructure; there is not enough room on the roads for everyone who wants to drive - we need people to ride bicycles and transit instead. Every person on a bicycle or on a bus is one LESS car on the roads. Removing bike lanes will kill cyclists and have negligible impact on gridlock. Gridlock is caused by too many cars and having a subpar transit system that people don\u2019t have confidence in. How about the province focus on opening the incredulously overdue metrolinx Eglinton LRT and further investments in municipal transit instead. I am a driver, cyclist, transit user and parent who works and lives in Toronto. I do NOT support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "As a business owner on Bloor West I do thinking it would be beneficial to work with those customers affected by traffic congestion. However, instead of planning to remove existing bike lanes there should be an equal emphasis on improving regional transit and this trying to reduce car traffic as much as possible. Our North American attitude that the car is the best way to get  around will never keep pace with our population and thus congestion will always be an issue. We need to look at world cities that have prioritized moving all people around from a big picture view versus the false narrative that we have both cars and people moving well in a city such as Toronto. Instead of diving voters let business thrive with reduced congestion and make so more people are moving around easier and not just focusing on car traffic/infrastructure. We are already so behind on change but if we continued to believe car traffic is the only issue to focus on we will miss out what could make a Toronto a better functioning city.\n"

Bike lanes provide a safe method for people to travel freely across the city, without impeding on cars space within car-specific lanes.\nThe removal of bike lanes will lead to more congestion by proxy of having more people forced to use motor vehicles to get around, as well as push bikes into car traffic, slowing the pace of traffic, and ultimately causing more congestion for road users like myself.\nAs a car driver myself, I feel like I'd rather bikes be in a separate lane, where there is a lower risk of me coming in contact with them.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212.\nPlease consider the fact that better bike infrastructure is good for everyone, including people who drive in the city. The fact that I bike almost everywhere in Ottawa means that I am one less car contributing to traffic congestion and parking shortages \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing for people driving cars!\nBill 212 is NOT a serious approach to tackling traffic congestion \u2014 making it harder for cities to expand bike lanes will deter people who might be persuaded to ditch their cars in favour of sustainable alternatives like transit, biking or other micro-mobility devices. By contrast, more traffic lanes and more highways might slightly improve congestion in the short term but will inevitably encourage continued reliance on car travel and make the problem much worse in the medium to long term.\nBill 212 would increase the already unacceptable risks that face cyclists and people with disabilities who rely on safe separated bike lanes.\nFinally, I am very concerned that Bill 212 seems geared towards stoking a senseless culture war between drivers and cyclists. The tone is needlessly divisive and will increase tensions that are already running high on Ontario\u2019s streets. This is totally irresponsible and I hope that the Government of Ontario will reconsider adopt a more civil and inclusive tone and approach.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal in Schedule 4 that states: \"it is also amended to require Ministry approval before municipalities may construct bicycle lanes in certain circumstances, and to require municipalities to provide the Ministry with information, including information relating to bicycle lanes\" is an overreach of provincial government that will create unnecessary bureaucracy and clog up municipal development in red tape.\nThe provincial government should, instead, be acting to reduce restrictions for municipal developments approved by mayors and councilors, NOT increase them.\nThe focus on bicycle lanes in Bill 212 is also completely arbitrary, since the government has not been able to show that bicycle lanes do, in fact, increase gridlock when a motor vehicle lane is removed. There is not even any information provided in the Bill on requirements or methods for granting approval \"in certain circumstances\", or what kind of information is needed from municipalities for city planning. The arbitrary focus on bicycle lanes in the Bill is specifically significant since many municipalities across the world have shown that creating infrastructure that increases bicycle use actually does more for reducing gridlock than increasing lanes for motor vehicles.\nFurthermore, particularly in larger cities like Toronto, a significant (and significantly growing) number of citizens choose to use bicycles to commute to and from work, school, shopping centres, and places of leisure and socialization, simply because cycling is one of the most convenient and fastest modes of transportation. The proposal to hinder the development of bicycle lanes and favour lanes for motor vehicles will not only fail in reducing gridlock, but will make commuting more difficult for both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers. The bill does not give reasons why citizens who choose to commute via motor vehicles should be favoured over those who commute via bicycles.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will only serve to increase congestion and therefore contribute to an increase in the negative environmental effects of single-occupancy passenger vehicles.\nThis bill unfairly punishes those who are attempting to do their part to reduce congestion by choosing green alternatives the take cars off the road, rather than contributing to it.\nThe economically proven principals of induced demand dictate that even if there is a reduction in motor vehicle travel times, it will only be temporary.  The number of cars will expand to consume additional capacity, negatively contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and, as such, reducing the life expectancy of all residents of Ontario.  The same principals dictate that a bike lane network, when properly separated from vehicular traffic, will induce more people to ride as an alternative to driving.  This will reduce the number of cars on the road \u2014 leading to less congestion and having a positive environmental impact.\nAnd even if this plan was going to be effective (which it will not be) no amount of congestion reduction is worth the cost of a single human life is lost in an accident that could have been avoidable had proper bike lanes been present.\nThe committee and the MPPs should take a moment to imagine their loved ones smushed and dying under an SUV before voting for a dangerous, environmentally destructive, non-solution to a much bigger congestion problem.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act, is just another attempt to fix traffic by doing exactly what doesn't work: building more highways. The fact that the policy seems to ignore the well-known issue of induced demand\u2014where adding lanes only leads to more cars, more congestion, and the same problems this bill supposedly wants to solve\u2014makes you wonder if anyone actually read the research on this.\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re stuck in some outdated mindset, refusing to learn from years of evidence that shows that car-first infrastructure doesn\u2019t fix the problem, it just makes it worse. Instead of investing in real solutions, like better public transit, encouraging cycling, and making our cities more walkable, they go for the quick and easy option of throwing taxpayer money at yet more roads.\nAnd the whole idea of \u201cbuilding faster\u201d probably just means less oversight, less environmental review, and cutting corners. We should be planning for cities that are sustainable and resilient, not dumping resources into projects that\u2019ll just make air quality worse, contribute to climate change, and keep us locked in a car-dependent loop.\nThis bill is nothing but a handout to the same old car-centric status quo. It's not about reducing gridlock\u2014it's about making sure we stay stuck in the past. We need leaders who aren\u2019t afraid to push for real, evidence-based urban planning, not more temporary fixes that\u2019ll leave us exactly where we started, if not worse.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in opposition to the proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act related to bike lane approvals.\nThe proposed amendments that would require municipalities to seek minister's approval for new bike lanes is redundant and unnecessary. The Environmental Assessment Act and Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process already establishes a framework for assessing potential impacts from infrastructure projects such as the redesign of roads. There is also already a process for \"bumping up\" Municipal Class EAs for provincial review if members of the public feel that a municipality has not followed the process correctly or has not appropriately considered impacts.\nThe effect of the proposed amendment will be to create a barrier to the implementation of bike lanes in dense urban areas where the public right of way is already primarily occupied by motor vehicle lanes. This places an unfair and unequal burden on dense municipalities with narrow rights of way compared to lower density municipalities with wider rights of way and is counter-productive considering the denser municipalities are in a better position to encourage cycling due to the shorter distances between destinations.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are also inconsistent with the recently enacted Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 and will frustrate the province's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Provincial Planning Statement.\nSection 2.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Planning authorities shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing options and densities  to meet projected needs of current and future residents of the  regional market area  by:  c) promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure  and public service facilities, and support the use of active\ntransportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act contradict this direction in the new PPS but adding an administrative layer to the installation of new bike lanes to serve new residential development that supports the use of active transportation. The proposed amendments will have the effect of discouraging municipalities from repurposing existing motor vehicle lanes, even in areas that have surplus capacity.\nSection 2.3.1 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"2. Land use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses which:  c) support active transportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act would have the effect of discouraging active transportation by adding an administrative layer to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes for bicycle lanes. The proposed amendment will frustrate the province's objective of ensuring settlement areas support active transportation, especially in established settlement areas where the public right of way is not wide enough to accommodate new bike leans without repurposing old motor vehicle lanes.\nSection 2.4.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 includes provisions for the intensification of development around Major Transit Station Areas. This intensification cannot proceed on the basis that primary mode of transportation outside of the transit system is by motor vehicle. Bicycles and public transit go hand in hand. Including bicycle lanes in close proximity to transit stations provides an important \"last mile\" connection between the transit station and people's homes, jobs or other destinations. Existing Major Transit Stations are often located in denser, urban areas where the majority of the public right of way is already occupied by motor vehicle lanes, without additional space available to accommodate bike lanes without repurposing the motor vehicle lanes.\nIn the absence of bicycle lanes, residents in intensified Major Transit Station Areas are more likely to drive, which will result in more traffic and gridlock. If they are provided with safe space to bike, this will reduce the traffic impacts of new development. Implementing barriers to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes to bike lanes will frustrate the province's objective of achieving greater intensification in Major Transit Station Areas.\nSection 2.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Planning authorities shall plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate  through approaches  that:  d) promote green infrastructure, low impact development, and active transportation,\nprotect  the environment and improve air quality.\"\nBicycle lanes promote active transportation. Prioritizing the retention of motor vehicle lanes over their repurpose as bicycle lanes, and requiring an extra bureaucratic step of obtain minister's approval, directly contradicts the direction of the PPS, 2024 and will negatively affect the Province's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nReducing reliance on motor vehicles supports the PPS objective of improving air quality by reducing vehicle emissions and micro-particles related to rubber tire wear and brake pad wear which make their way into air and water.\nSection 3.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Transportation systems should be provided which are safe, energy efficient, facilitate the movement of people and goods, are appropriate to address  projected needs, and support the use of zero- and low- emission vehicles.\"\nBicycle lanes improve the safety of roads for all users. They reduce the frequency and severity of collisions involving motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.\nBicycle Lanes are energy efficient by encouraging human powered transportation options instead of fossil fuel and electrically powered vehicles that require significant resources to build, transport and operate.\nBicycle Lanes facilitate the movement of people and goods, often with greater efficiency than motor vehicle lanes because of bicycles smaller size and greater maneuverability. Delivery companies have begun shifting to cargo bikes for deliveries and food couriers on bicycles have proliferated greater in recent years.\nBicycle lanes are particularly appropriate to address the projected needs of large and growing municipalities like Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Ottawa, Vaughan and elsewhere.\nBicycles are zero-emission vehicles.\nAny legislation that would have the effect of slowing down the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister approval, especially if the criteria for the minister's approval is not clearly stated, would be contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nPrioritizing motor vehicle lanes over the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister's approval of any bike lanes that would repurpose vehicle lanes is contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nSection 3.2 also states, \"3. As part of a multimodal transportation system, connectivity within and among transportation systems  and modes should be  planned for,  maintained  and, where possible,  improved,  including  connections which cross jurisdictional  boundaries. \"\nBicycle lanes are an important part of a multi-modal transportation system. The proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act do not establish any standards, criteria, or methodology that the minister would use to evaluate proposed bicycle lanes. This makes planning for a multi-modal transportation system difficult or impossible because planning authority will not be able to anticipate how the minister will determine if their proposed bicycle lanes will be evaluated.\nThe Province of Ontario already has an established set of guidelines for the design of bicycle lanes in its Ontario Traffic Manual Book 18, and we already have an established process for evaluating the impacts of infrastructure projects through the Environmental Assessment Act.\nSection 3.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Healthy, active, and inclusive communities should be promoted by: a) planning public streets, spaces and facilities to be safe, meet the needs of persons of all ages and abilities, including  pedestrians, foster social interaction and  facilitate\nactive transportation and community connectivity.\"\nBike lanes provide safe facilities for active transportation.\nOverall, the PPS does not state that active transportation should be subordinate to motor vehicle transportation. Read as a whole, the PPS provide clear direction that the Province of Ontario intends to prioritize active transportation, densities that will not function if the priority is motor vehicles, and a comprehensive response to climate change.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are not consistent with the Provincial Planning Statement and will in fact frustrate the implementation of the PPS. The proposed amendments are redundant and unnecessary considering existing requirements under the Environmental Assessment Act, and the proposed amendments do not provide any direction on how the minister intends to evaluate bike lane proposals or any methodology for determining the impacts of removing motor vehicle lanes.\nFor these reasons I am opposed to Bill 212 and the provisions related to bike lanes should be removed.\n"

It is well studied in several academic, observational, and other well documented studies (public and private) that bicycle lanes have a POSTIVE impact on businesses, health, and traffic congestion. Appointing the Ministry to approve bike lanes is an a perfect way to waste the publics time and money by delaying the approval process. From evidence of previous projects (GTA West now Highway 413) we can see how this government has fumbled important infrastructure projects and drawn them out as long as possible and wasted public money. The government should concern itself with allowing municipalities to plan their transportation planning with the experts they have. Municipalities are perfectly adequate in doing their transportation planning and have an elected council who vote on these recommendations.\nRemoving bicycle lanes is setting this entire province back 20 years which is not an Ontario I want to live in.\n"
