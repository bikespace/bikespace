Instead invest in more bike lanes, public transit, and park space. Doug ford is a complete goon and needs to step down. The green belt should not be touched. Stop this corrupt development , and focus the budget where people live\n"

        "comment": "Research has shown time and time again that building more roads does not reduce traffic congestion.  In a few years the congestion returns as more people opt to travel by car.  Given the need to reduce GHG emissions and fossil fuel use policies that encourage travel by car (ie building more roads) are not what Ontario needs.  The funds to build this highway would be better spent building, encouraging and subsidizing public transit and bike lanes (or other small personal means of transportation).  Bike lanes have been shown to reduce congestion ... which is the stated goal.  So municipalities should be provided incentives to build bike lanes.  With e-bikes growing steadily in popularity these lanes become more and more important and more and more the way Ontarians get around.  With a clean low GHG grid this means that fewer GHGs will be emitted per capita.  So bike lanes and public transit are a win win.  They reduce congestion, get people to their destinations faster, ultimately cost less and are better for the environment.  The current policy direction of building more roads is not backed by evidence, will not reduce congestion and will create problems for many years to come.\n"

        "comment": "This bill should not go through as we should not be prioritizing the most inefficient form of transportation over our small amount of precious landscape. The Environmental Defence estimates that 400 acres of our precious greenbelt may be destroyed with the construction of the 413. Before we settled in North America it was home to the indigenous peoples and many different animals roaming the vast natural lands that we are on today. Since we arrived in North America we have destroyed the indigenous people's and countless species homes and replaced it was large scale agriculture and unsustainable suburbs. We cannot undo the past, but we can control the future. The greenbelt is all we have left of a natural Ontario and we should be doing everything we can to protect it. For this reason, I am strongly opposed to Bill 212 (ERO #019-9265).\n"

        "comment": "I definitely do not support this bill. Removing existing bike lanes and making it more difficult to create bike lanes in the future seems to be a costly and inefficient idea. Not only could I not find concrete evidence to support the idea that reducing bike lanes also reduces traffic congestion, I was able to find multiple scientific articles claiming the exact opposite (two example papers added as links). I'm sure appealing to science is not the best way to communicate with the current Premier, but it's worth trying I suppose. Please don't go forward with this bill. Bikers aren't going to switch to cars when you remove their lanes. This just ensures more people will get hurt on our streets.\n"

        "comment": "Good afternoon,\nI am deeply disappointed with the proposed bill and I am strongly against it, specifically in regards to the bike plane provisions.\nFirst, I am very surprised that a conservative government wants to be so involved in municipal affairs (determining which streets should have a bike lane), resembling a nanny state.  I thought the conservative government would be in favour of small government and less intervention in municipal affairs, not the opposite.\nSecond, removing existing bike lanes is a complete waste of our hard earned money.  I am a car driving, taxpaying home-owner.  I can understand if additional scrutiny would be placed on new/proposed projects that are funded by the province, but removing existing bike lanes is a complete petty overreaction.  I thought that a conservative government who claims to care about safeguarding our tax dollars would have eliminated wasteful spending like this proposal.\nThird,  the proposal will not aleviate congestion.  Study after study has shown that adding car lanes only worsens traffic due to induced demand.  Providing alternatives such as public transit and bike lanes is the best way to reduce congestion.  This proposed bill makes the Ontario government look like its run by a bunch of amateurs.\nLet municipalities make their own infrastructure decisions and cancel this bill!\n"

        "comment": "Transit infrastructure works better if it gives people options. The existing infrastructure favours cars and only cars. With the cost of living crisis, purchasing, insuring and maintaining a car is not feasible for many Ontarians.\nBy ripping out existing infrastructure and imposing restrictions on a municipality's ability to built bike lanes, it will only make the roads less safe for anyone who cannot own a car. Bikes and scooters are just as much part of traffic as motor vehicles and pedestrians are. Planning roads without them in mind will leave everyone vulnerable to accidents.\nGridlock would be better alleviated by taking full advantage of all our existing transit infrastructure, particularly rail lines. The GTA in particular would be tremendously helped by two-way service of GO Trains and 24-hour service of the subway on weekends.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly opposed this proposed legislation. It is shortsighted and dangerous, and will put lives at risk by removing/preventing essential safe cycling infrastructure. It is extremely misleading to claim that this bill will reduce gridlock, as study after study shows that adding bike lanes reduces traffic congestion. There are few, if any, studies that I indicate the opposite, so it appears this government does not rely on research or fact when establishing policies. Furthermore, this bill would reduce municipal autonomy and override local decisionmaking, which is antithetical to this government and the Premier's previously stated priorities, as evidenced in past legislation ie. \"strong mayor\" powers. Why has the Premier flip-flopped on this? One can only conclude that this anti-cycling rhetoric is being employed to distract the public from the fact that this bill would also reduce property owners' appeal rights with regard to expropriations. This proposed legislation is unconscionable, and even this government, which has a poor track record, should be ashamed.\n"

Induced demand means those lanes fill up with more cars and more cars means more traffic\nBike lanes are to protect the people who use their bikes for transportation. If you remove those bike lanes, then as the law allows them, they are entitled to their own space on the road, travelling much slower than the speed limit, which sounds to me like it will slow car traffic down as well.\nSeparating bicycle and car traffic firstly makes sure less bicycle riders are injured and killed by cars and also prevents bicycles from slowing down car traffic.\nBicycles and bike lanes are not the enemy\n"

        "comment": "I exclusively drive my own car and live in Brant County, though I visit Toronto once or twice a month. I don't understand why the government under Doug Ford believes these measures will improve traffic when every competent city planner says they will do the opposite. If it's an attempt to score political points with people like me who don't care about biking and generally drive everywhere, it's not going to work.\nLet's consider what we're talking about here: Eliminating bike lanes on major streets in Toronto doesn't mean bikes will take back streets exclusively, they'll just use the car traffic lanes because it'll still be faster for them. This slows down traffic and makes it more dangerous and difficult to drive in Toronto. I don't want to run over a cyclist and have my life turned upside down for a year while I'm dealing with the fallout from that. Removing bike lanes makes that a lot more likely.\nHighway 413 is a pointless boondoggle. It's just going to create more car-dependent housing which means more Ontarians will drive, and it doesn't even go anywhere useful! There are practically zero attractive destinations on the proposed route, so the extremely obvious result will be more traffic on the 401 and 400. Some people will feel like they're saving time once a week on the way to cottage country, but in reality it'll just shift the traffic north onto the 400 around Barrie. In fact it'll probably result in hours-long jams on highway 11 because of induced demand.\nStop pandering to the lowest common denominator. If you want to help drivers and decrease traffic, do what works: Get people off the road! Lots of Ontarians are struggling right now and if they had affordable housing they could live in, in an area with excellent public transit, they could save money and get out of the way of those of us who are more successful. It's not a liberal idea, it's a common sense idea. Developers can make more than enough money building dense transit-oriented communities, and as someone who lives in a rural area, that's what I want. It takes people off the road, and that's how you reduce traffic, period. Listen to the experts. All this other nonsense simply doesn't work.\n"
