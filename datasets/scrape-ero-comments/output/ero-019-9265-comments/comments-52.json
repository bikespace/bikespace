        "comment": "Over the past 10 years, as bike lanes have increased, I\u2019ve felt it much safer to ride to work and now do daily. It used to be a scary commute. Removing them will make things less safe for me and I worry about my child losing her father.\nRemoving bike lanes will add more cars on the road and increase congestion. I also drive in the city and feel drivers pain. But there are much better ways to improve that. We need to stop construction companies taking whole lanes out for years just to have convenient parking. We need to stop cars clogging intersections with higher fines.\nWe need to teach bikes and cars to live better together. It\u2019s two ways - some cyclists flaunt the law when cycling (running lights and illegal lane crossing), and a concerted effort to crack down on that may appease drivers more than dropping $50m on taking out some lanes.\n"

For the province to meet climate goals as well as mitigate and adapt to climate change we need to encourage more sustainable options such as bike lanes and complete streets. Moreover, tearing out lanes is expensive and wasteful, and is a poor use of tax-dollars and resources\n"

        "comment": "It is irresponsible of this government to ignore research countering the proposed solutions in this bill in regards to Highway 413, and Ministry approval of municipal bike lanes.\nSkipping the Environmental Impact Assessment for Highway 413 is a decision that will have fiscal consequences. Bulldozing through wetlands will impact the area's ability to handle water, something the GTA already struggles with. It will devastate local wildlife, which all play a part in our environment. Any future costs for flooding, food insecurity, clean water, environmental cleanup/restoration will be borne by tax payers.\nBuilding Highway 413 will encourage more drivers to get to their destinations in areas that will not support any more car traffic. The concepts of induced demand, sprawl and the astronomical costs of maintaining all of that have all been researched. Adding more cars and roads will introduce more gridlock, the complete opposite of this bill's intention.\nWe are in a climate crisis and this government is not taking the steps to provide any alternatives to car dependency.\nSecondly, removing bike lanes will just cause more morbidity and mortality. Collisions, even when not causing death, often cause permanent mental and physical damage for both the vulnerable road user and driver. It also discourages new cyclists that are not confident on the road with dangerous and speeding drivers (of which, there is very little enforcement).\nI am an orthopaedic nurse. The amount of serious injuries from cars I see is devastating. If airplanes or any other form of transit caused as much death and destruction, no one would use it. The research exists to reduce this, but this government has chosen to ignore science.\nI cycle to work, and my family and friends worry every time, wondering if I will make it there in one piece. Why do I still do it? The hospital has limited parking and I want to save spaces for people who have no option but to drive. It also keeps my mental health and physical health in shape. It addresses my eco-anxiety, as I try to do what I can, even though I know the climate cannot be fixed by my singular actions.\nOpponents to cycling lanes often cite their physical need to park closer due to disabilities and their age. What about people who cannot afford vehicles? What about children who cannot drive? There are complaints that youth can't cope, but they have no opportunity to practice independence due to dependency on cars. Many would be in a healthier mental and physical state if active transport options were made a priority.\nNot only will removing the bike lanes endanger lives, it will continue to make congestion worse. As a cyclist, I will take the whole lane (as is my right) to protect my life. Too many drivers pass too close as a \"misjudgment\" of distance, or don't see me when I ride too close to the right.\nBike lanes are a municipal matter and should not require approval from the Provincial government.\nThis bill is intended to be inflammatory on climate, vulnerable road users, the poor, and the people who care about the above. I am so disappointed that the government is choosing to ignore their own research, statistics from businesses around bike lanes, research from around the world that contradicts the sections for Highway 413 and requiring Ministry approval of bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not based on thorough unbiased research, science or the health and well-being of Ontarians. By removing bike lanes we do not reduce cyclists or move them to different routes, but mix cyclists and vehicular traffic into the same lanes opening up citizens to further risk of injury and death on Ontario roads. By skipping environmental studies to speed up highway construction we open up our citizens to countless ecological impacts from pollution to flooding. I would suggest, as someone who is tired of having their money wasted on vanity projects from Premier Ford, that the province begin to tackle congestion by maintaining the roads we already have, removing non-driving activities and installations like patios from driving lanes and ensuring that highways have lanes painted on them. Have included an article from Forbes to demonstrate that bike lanes are an asset in any urban environment.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212 - the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act, 2024. This legislation appears to misinterpret the root causes of traffic congestion and undermines the progress made towards sustainable and efficient transportation solutions. Here are several key points I would like to highlight:\n1. Bike Lanes Do Not Cause Gridlock:\nResearch consistently shows that bike lanes do not contribute to increased traffic congestion. In fact, they can help alleviate it. The principle of induced demand indicates that expanding road capacity for cars often leads to more driving, not less. When new lanes are added, they attract more drivers who were previously discouraged by congestion, ultimately leading to a return to previous traffic levels or even worse conditions. Conversely, dedicated bike lanes encourage cycling and can reduce the number of cars on the road by providing a safer alternative for transportation.\n2. Counterproductive Impact on Traffic Flow:\nRemoving bike lanes from main streets would have a counterproductive effect on traffic flow. This action would force cyclists to take more circuitous, impractical routes, potentially discouraging cycling altogether and pushing people back into cars. The question arises: Does the government truly want more people in cars on city streets? If cyclists revert to driving due to a lack of safe, direct routes, they will contribute more to traffic congestion than they would as cyclists. A single car occupies significantly more road space than a bicycle and moves fewer people per unit of road space.\n3. Safety and Economic Benefits of Bike Lanes:\nBike lanes significantly enhance safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. Research indicates that dedicated bike lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents involving all road users by creating a clear separation between motor vehicles and cyclists. This separation not only protects cyclists but also contributes to a calmer driving environment, leading to safer roads for everyone. Studies have shown that cities with more bike infrastructure experience lower rates of traffic-related injuries and fatalities. Furthermore, bike lanes can boost local economic activity; businesses near bike lanes often report increased customer traffic as cyclists tend to shop more frequently and spend similar amounts as car drivers.\n4. Cost Implications of Removing Bike Lanes:\nThe removal of bike lanes would not only be costly in terms of construction but could also exacerbate gridlock during the removal process. The disruption caused by such construction would likely lead to increased congestion in the short term while failing to provide any long-term solutions.\n5. Equity and Accessibility:\nBike lanes provide an affordable transportation option for those who cannot afford or choose not to own a car. Removing this infrastructure disproportionately affects lower-income individuals and limits transportation choices for all residents.\n6. Inconsistency with Government Policy:\nThis bill contradicts the government\u2019s own Bill 185, which aims to remove minimum parking requirements in Protected Major Transit Station Areas and Major Transit Station Areas. This policy encourages residents to utilize alternatives such as biking and public transit instead of relying solely on cars. Supporting Bill 212 undermines these efforts by promoting car dependency rather than fostering a diverse and efficient transportation ecosystem.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the implications of Bill 212. Rather than focusing on expanding highways and removing bike lanes, we should invest in infrastructure that promotes safe, efficient transportation options that benefit our communities. Thank you for considering these points as you deliberate on this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "We need bike lanes - it\u2019s dangerous for bikers to share the road with cars, for both the driver and the biker. Additionally, removal of bike lanes will not remove bikers, and there will still be gridlock. As well, this is a far too expensive measure that can be used to reduce the number of people on the road through measures such as making the city more transit-friendly. As a tax payer I do not believe my dollars would be best served here.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m 25, And I know people personally who have been affected by unsafe bike infrastructure - leading to death. Bike lanes save lives, simple as that. As someone who does not bike in the city too often, every time I bike in the city I\u2019m almost hit or run over by a vehicle. Half of those times it\u2019s because the bike lane turns into a regular car lane, putting me directly in the line of traffic - but still safer than if there was no bike lane at all. My Dad bikes to work downtown from East York every day, I want him to be safe. My Downstairs Neighbour bikes around the city, I want them to be safe. My roommate bikes around the city, I want her to be safe. I bike around the city, I want to be as safe as any car.\nStaying safe as a cyclist is difficult when someone simply opening a car door can break your arm.\nWhen I think about Toronto, I see images of the CN tower, street cars on Spadina, round little raccoons, and bikes. Discouraging this important part of our city\u2019s culture discourages our city\u2019s identity. This will also have an incredibly negative effect on both the autonomy of movement for those without cars, as well as the mental health and physical well-being of Toronto citizens.\nI am a human being, trying to live my life and get where I need to go. I just want to get home safe. If that\u2019s an inconvenient for those in cars, maybe they should try to bike a mile in our helmets.\n"

        "comment": "I do not think that the construction of highways should be made without adequate environmental assessments being done. Wetlands are a large part of our local ecosystems and support life in many different ways. This includes migratory birds, amphibians, fish, and insects. The highway will not only heavily damage local ecosystems, a critical habitat - but fragment them and displace wildlife.\nSecondly, water quality will be heavily degraded by runoff and pollution. Runoff can contain oil, heavy metals and chemicals that can leach into the wetland. This is a provincially significant wetland and it would be a shame to run a highway through it.\nSpecies at risk have also been seen in the Holland marsh. After these sightings were made, construction was stopped. It should be brought up and discussed - as we do not want to endanger the lives of these species at risk by destroying their habitat.\nHydrology would also be heavily disrupted. The Holland marsh naturally stores and regulates water in the area. This reduces flood risks and maintains groundwater levels. Highways can divert and block water flow.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access, including myself. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n"
