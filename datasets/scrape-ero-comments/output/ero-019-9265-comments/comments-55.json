Decision to place a bicycle lane on a particular road should rest with local community/municipality and does not require involvement of provincial politics (in fact, the provincial government by definition lacks the knowledge and understanding of the community needs at such a local level).\nVague definitions from the bill:\n...would reduce the number of marked lanes available for travel by motor vehicle traffic along any portion of or on either side of the highway where the bicycle lane is to be located...\nWhen considering whether to approve the design for the construction of a bicycle lane, the Ministry may consider whether it would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic...\n"

        "comment": "\"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" would negatively affect the future of mobility in the Province of Ontario. Slowing or reversing the installation of bike lanes will have an adverse impact on children\u2019s health and the environment.\nAccording to the Government of Canada, only 37.6% of children aged 5-17 are getting the minimum 60 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity recommended by Health Canada. Across Ontario, fewer kids are using active modes of transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, rollerblading, scootering and rolling for wheelchairs or other mobility devices) for their school journey: 22% of kids walk to school and 4% cycle, whereas 74% travel by motorized transport. Bicycle lanes are important for kids who currently ride their bicycles, but also for reversing these trends.\nDriving kids to school has led to several serious impacts:\nMore inactivity. Kids miss the opportunity for much-needed physical activity, fresh air, and quality interaction with parents, caregivers, and friends.\nLess focus. Students are less focused in class, contributing to poorer academic outcomes.\nWorse congestion. An estimated 25-40% of vehicle congestion during morning rush hour is related to school drop-off.\nRiskier roads. 78% of Ontario parents reported witnessing unsafe driving behaviours in school zones.\nMoreover, evidence shows that creating more car-centric lanes and roads ultimately leads to even more congestion. Reducing congestion and creating safer, healthier roads requires creating additional bike lanes and encouraging people who are able to switch from driving to cycling. Clearly, we need more safe routes to school \u2013 not fewer \u2013 to get children and families walking and cycling to school safely.\nHigh quality networks of protected bike lanes on main streets are critical to providing safe routes to school and supporting higher rates of physical activity. By design, Ontario communities do not generally have side streets that run parallel to main streets for long distances. In suburban communities, they are designed to discourage traffic, and in urban communities like Toronto and Ottawa, they are often fragmented, with designated one-way sections that prevent traffic. While neighbourhood streets are important for bike lanes, main streets are the major connectors providing direct routes for students to get to school.\nOntario\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are rising: in 2022, they rose to 2017 levels after a pandemic-induced reduction. Road transportation is the largest source of pollution in the province, responsible for more than a quarter of all of Ontario\u2019s emissions. While we acknowledge that the intensity of Ontario\u2019s emissions reduced as Ontario\u2019s population and economy grew, we are concerned that emissions from road transportation continue to rise and that we are not on track to meet our 2030 climate goals.\nProtecting the health and safety of our communities, while also reducing congestion and fossil fuel pollution, requires that we do as much as we can to encourage cycling. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is unequivocal: \u201cTargets to reduce carbon emissions by 2030 in line with the 1.5-degree limit for global warming cannot be achieved without a systematic increase of cycling.\u201d\nAccording to research, a standard vehicle releases around five metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. Choosing a bike instead of a car just once a day cuts an average person\u2019s transportation-related carbon emissions by 67%.\nOntario contains the most densely populated areas in the country and is home to 40% of Canada\u2019s population. We urgently need the government of Ontario to demonstrate leadership that provides its residents with more \u2013 not fewer \u2013 opportunities for achieving a sustainable, safe, and prosperous future.\n"

        "comment": "Cars are the cause of gridlock, not bicycles.\nThere is ample literature from around the world suggesting that enhanced infrastructure for cars in urban areas only has temporary positive effect and eventually results in the same level of gridlock as before - or worse. This is true for both North American and European cities. Thinking that there somehow is a Canadian exception is misguided.\nWhat reduces gridlock is a concerted, coordinated and long-term effort to get people to leave their car and choose alternate means of transportation: transit and active transportation. This requires vision from decision-makers, and the willingness to achieve results in the long term, not for the next 12 months.\nBicycle infrastructure across Ontario cities has, over the past decade, resulted in a significant increase in bicycle usage as a legitimate means of transportation for all ages, helped by the rapid development of e-bikes.\nDedicated infrastructure has encouraged youth or seniors to embrace cycling because of the increased safety it affords. Without this infrastructure, and in the absence of credible enforcement on some motorists' repeated disrespect for bicycles as legitimate, full-fledged users of roadways, an increase in accidents is to be expected, followed by cyclists likely returning to their cars and adding to traffic issues.\nThe proposed dismantling of bike infrastructure, and the greater hurdles for municipalities to implement them, is an ill-informed, short-sighted measure that will not help mobility in our cities in any effective or durable way, but rather undermine it. It will only set Ontario further back, and make the future achievement of livable cities more difficult and costly.\n"

As a daily cyclist and a Toronto resident, I rely on bike lanes to commute safely and efficiently to my healthcare job at Mount Sinai Hospital.  I use the Bloor and University bike lanes daily, and often with my young children on the bike with me.\nBy choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone.  Pedestrians are also safer on streets with cycling lanes as they are farther away from fast moving and dangerous vehicles.\nRemoving cycling lanes will force me into traffic lanes on my daily commute down Bloor, and thus endanger my life.  The TTC, while an option, has frequent security delays resulting in me delaying vital patient care.  Driving takes 3x as long as cycling and parking is $25/day at my workplace.\nCycling is accessible to all socioeconomic groups, as owning and driving a car is prohibitively expensive for many.   By having safe cycling infrastructure children can safely ride to school, novice cyclists can feel safer navigating the city, and there will be less pollution, road wear & tear and less congestion.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth, Yonge and University have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling and public transit infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.  Let Toronto be a true world class city like Montreal, Amsterdam, Paris by de-centering cars, and funding pedestrian, cycling and transit infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding Bill 212, specifically, Schedule 4: Amendments to the Highway Traffic Act (HTA).\nBike lanes move people more efficiently and do not increase congestion, more people on bikes means less cars on the road.\nBike lanes separate cars from bikes which means it is safer for cyclists and cars resulting in fewer collisions. This safety factor encourages more people to use bikes instead of cars.\nBikes lanes are good for business they provide a positive economic impact with an increase in the number of customers and an increase in customer spending.\nInstead of attacking bike lanes for political gain, the provincial government should focus on provincial matters like improving healthcare, education, housing, transportation and the environment. Municipalities should be responsible for making decisions about bike lanes not the province.\nMost of the traffic and gridlock in Toronto is caused by the multiple construction projects in the city and of course too many cars on the road, not because of bike lanes.\nRemoval of bike lanes in Toronto would be extremely complex resulting in traffic and gridlock and have a huge financial cost. Removal of bike lanes is not a solution since it will result in even more cars on the road leading to more traffic and gridlock.\nBikes lanes are good, good for reducing traffic, good for business, good for safety. They are good for both cyclists and drivers.\n"

Like many denizens of midtown Toronto I am cyclist, pedestrian and transit user. I no longer own a car because these other forms of transportation replace such a need. I am a member of a car sharing organization and drive occasionally when transporting family or larger items.\nI deeply applaud Toronto municipality for its actions over the past number of years in establishing bike lanes across the city.\nAs a long-term and aging cyclist I regard dedicated bike lanes as being essential to both improve safety of existing cyclists and encourage those who are contemplating this low emission and health promoting activity. We lag behind European leaders such as Denmark, The Netherlands and Germany and should be doing more to separate large, fast moving vehicles from vulnerable humans on bicycles as well as pedestrians.\nI regard Bill 212 as a backward step in meeting climate goals, reducing traffic injuries and controlling public spending.

I\u2019m now 39, and I\u2019ve never felt more safe commuting than I do now.\nFor most of my time cycling I\u2019ve navigated the city using side streets, and although it\u2019s pleasant, it\u2019s far from efficient. Since the establishment of proper bike lanes, I\u2019ve been able to get around much faster, and with a greater deal of security.\nToronto should not be told what infrastructure it should have from someone not elected to represent our City. Nor should residents and businesses needlessly suffer by having to go through MORE construction on account of this politically driven proposal. Toronto is a global city, and our cycling infrastructure should aim to be aligned with that of other progressive cities around the world. It is frankly an embarrassment on the world stage to even have this being considered.\nThis is transparently a crass attempt for the premier to achieve a political game. We cannot allow this to happen, and have GOOD PUBLIC policy be negated because of one person\u2019s ambitions. To do so would be an extremely dangerous precedent.\nIt goes without saying you have my full support to oppose this action proposed by the premier.

        "comment": "As an Ontario citizen who is both a driver and a cyclist, I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212. I have significant concerns about the effects this bill will have on the environment, local communities, and cyclist safety.\nIn terms of environmental impacts, by increasing highway construction, this could lead to irreversible damage to vulnerable ecosystems, including wetlands and endangered species habitats. These areas are essential to fight the effects of climate change and protect biodiversity. Prioritizing the development of more highways poses a critical risk to the environment. This will lead to an increased reliance on personal vehicles and higher greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, we should use these resources to improve public transit, ensuring it caters to all communities, including low-income individuals who rely on transit and cannot afford cars. Prioritizing highway expansion serves the wealthy and car owners, and as a Toronto citizen, this feels inequitable and unethical.\nLastly, one of the most critical issues to Bill 242 is its dangerous impact on cyclist safety. Without bike lanes, cyclists are left to navigate traffic alongside larger vehicles. This creates a hazardous environment where even minor mistakes by drivers can lead to lost lives.  A recent report indicates that from 2015 to the present, 28 cyclists have been killed and 380 seriously injured in Toronto, with 68% of those incidents occurring on streets lacking cycling infrastructure (Draaisma, CBC News, 2023).\nI am disgusted that the safety of cyclists is being sacrificed in the name of highway expansion/reducing gridlock for cars. We must prioritize the needs of ALL road users, not just drivers. Bike lanes save lives and make cities more equitable, and by focusing on car-centric development is a step in the wrong direction.\n"

In our neighbourhood in Mississauga, several roads have bike lines placed in them that have reduced the number of traffic lanes for cars and thus increased lineups, traffic confusion, traffic, congestion. The addition of bike lines on the road in Mississauga has led to more danger for car drivers due to reduce lanes head-on traffic trying to turn left with people coming into your lane because they\u2019re swerving the people in the bike lane. On the Aquitaine bike lanes here in Mississauga there\u2019s been virtually no bike use of this road over 30 years and since these bike lanes have been installed, there\u2019s been absolute minimum use of the bike lanes. I use this roadway every day 3 to 4 times a day and since the lanes have been introduced, I have seen less than 10 bikes on the Road. There have been several meetings locally with our counsellor and although we continually tell them, we do not want these bike lanes on the road.

We do not feel safe on our roads. Cyclists and pedestrians pay taxes to the city just like drivers but are not afforded the space, care or protection that a car-owning class is given. For many, biking or similar forms of motion are our only way to get around, taking that away from us is classist, environmentally short-sighted  and cruel.\n"
