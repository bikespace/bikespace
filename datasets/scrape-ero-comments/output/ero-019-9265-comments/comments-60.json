        "comment": "I am a driver, walker, transit rider and cyclist. I use the method that is safest and most efficient in the situation. My primary consideration is getting from one location to another, not to advocate for a single travel modality.\nThe considerations when developing transportation must balance moving the most people in the most efficient way (time and cost). Depending on the specific location this may be walking, cycling, public transit, shared vehicles (e.g. taxi, rideshare) or private vehicle. Most importantly, some methodologies which are best in one location (e.g. private vehicle in rural or sub-urban\u00a0Ontario) are different in another (e.g. public transit, walking, and cycling in dense urban environments). Trying to impose an inefficient solution will actually make transportation efficiency worse - building a subway in a small town is as ill suited as depending solely on private vehicles\u00a0in a large city. It is impossible to successfully build an urban environment which relies on private vehicles, there will always be serious traffic congestion, there is just not enough space to build enough roads as there is in low density rural and suburban spaces.\nPeople have the freedom to choose between transportation strategies - the primary influence for this choice is safety, and second time efficiency, of course within affordability parameters.\u00a0\nRemoving bike lanes is counter-productive. A safe and efficient bike network will complement safe pedestrian infrastructure and efficient public transit. Such a system cannot be built\u00a0only on secondary roads, they are not continuous and intended for transportation, they are designed for local access. To remove and limit a city's ability to design their transportation is counter-productive: in the long term it will only create more congestion and ensuing loss of productivity among residents in cities and those who commute into cities.\nThere has been a significant increase in cycling in Toronto in the past several years. As the network grows, this trend will continue, which will alleviate road congestion. Removing infrastructure will put people back in cars, and will increase congestion. Either strategy creates a feedback loop.\nThe priority must be moving people - Bill 212 has the false premise that we need to build more highways and roads as the primary way to reduce congestion. This only has a very temporary impact - many studies have proven this repeatedly. The only way to reduce congestion and improve transportation efficiency is an overall system view, not a single parameter (private vehicle).\n"

        "comment": "As a regular bike commuter in the province, I strongly disagree with this proposal to allow the Government to remove bike lanes as they so choose. I commute to work 3x a week (and often to other places as well, such as the gym and social activities) via cycling as it saves me both time and money compared to driving or taking the bus. If I didn't have as many safe, separated bike lanes to take on my commute, I would certainly think twice about cycling, especially in the early mornings and evenings when it is darker outside, as I would start to be concerned about my own safety as a cyclist. According to StatsCan, an average of 74 Canadians die each year from cycling collisions, 73% of which were collisions with cars. Areas where cycling is more prevalent, and therefore with better cycling infrastructure, tend to have lower rates of bicycle-related fatalities. The proposal to remove bike lanes on busy roads throughout the province to \"improve traffic\" shows no consideration for the safety of cyclists and active commuters and will almost certainly result in higher bicycle-related collisions. Are the safety and lives of active commuters less important to your government than the amount of time it takes drivers to reach their destination?\nAccording to a poll by CAA, 40% of Canadians say that they would be more motivated to cycle more if bike lanes are separated by a physical barrier. In this period of time where many people are rightfully concerned about climate change and are actively looking for ways to go green, the government should be encouraging active transportation, not discouraging it by removing infrastructure that makes it safer and more convenient for the public.\nThis proposal is extremely shortsighted and serves only to address an immediate concern that commuters such as the Premier have to sit in their cars for a few minutes longer on their drive into downtown Toronto. It does not show consideration to the fact that active commuting is on the rise: between 1996 and 2016, the number of Canadians using bicycles as their main method of commuting doubled (The Globe and Mail). It additionally does not show consideration to the taxpayers; this proposal will result in millions of dollars being spent to undo work that already cost millions of dollars. I don't see any way that taxpayers should be happy with your government spending double the initial cost with nothing to show for it at the end, not to mention that EVERY commuter will now be inconvenienced by construction road closures yet again while the bike lanes that were just recently installed get ripped up.\nIn summary, I strongly urge the government to reconsider this shortsighted and costly proposal, which shows no consideration for the safety of active commuters, no consideration for the environmental benefits of active commuting, and no consideration for the cost and inconvenience to taxpayers for yet more pointless construction work on their roads.\n"

I have a business degree, I manage a store, and I vote for parties that are prudent and don't get in the way of my life. With the rising cost of living, I have made the choice to opt out of driving as much as is reasonable. It's one area where I can improve my life while also lowering my cost per trip. It's not necessary for me to drive if the route is safe, and I am happy to make less traffic so that the people who choose to drive because that's the best tool for their trip, can do that more efficiently.\nThis bill is wasteful red tape. It limits personal choice. And the increased traffic from more cars unnecessarily wearing down and clogging up this expensive infrastructure will hurt our economy now and for years down the road.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"

I urge Premier Ford and the MPPs not to pass this act which will, contrary to its stated goals, be a massive waste of money and cause even worse traffic in some of Toronto's main thoroughfares.\nI lived nearby Bloor during the bike lane construction and was indeed annoyed by the congestion, although it never came close to the levels of gridlock seen in transit corridors like the 401 and Gardiner. Having gone through this construction once it seems ludicrous to go through it again, especially seeing as Toronto City Council has estimated the removal will take years to plan and 9 months (which in contractor terms means 1+ years) to actually execute, in addition to a cost of 48 million. How is this how we're spending our transit-related money, while the TTC regularly breaks down and Metrolinx still hasn't established regular coverage across the province?\nAgain I want to emphasize the wastefulness of taking out infrastructure that has already been paid for and put into place - and is seeing usage! The City's report on bike usage along the main bike lanes targeted by Bill 212 has seen increases of up to 600% - a classic case of build it and they will come. And lets face it, with climate change coming and our winters only getting milder, cycling is becoming more of a viable transportation method than ever before. Removing infrastructure only to return to a state of being that already didn't work is absolute folly, a waste of taxpayer money and government time.\nPlease Premier Ford, don't take us backward and don't waste our money.\n"

        "comment": "This is a regressive bill that proposes unproven strategies which recklessly endanger Ontario's wetlands and ecological health, farmland and food security and citizenry and public health. Projections do not anticipate any material benefit (i.e. time savings/reduced gridlock) to the construction of such infrastructure, and in fact show just the opposite: notably time saved in the case of highway 413 would be only on the order of a few minutes compared with existing infrastructure. This is clearly an abuse of provincial powers and a siphoning of taxpayer money into development projects which do not benefit the people of Ontario, except for those few in office orchestrating this farce and the developers who would build such useless projects.\nFurther, the destruction of the newly constructed bike lanes along University Ave., Yonge St. and Bloor would also be extremely regressive. The answer to reducing gridlock in the heart of downtown is not to limit access to cyclists but rather to explore multi-modal solutions which would alleviate the burden of car traffic as the only means of transportation instead, which must inevitably be the case in the most populous city in Canada, where the streets can be only so wide, and the parking only so dense. Demand for access to the city must be met by other means, especially for those who live within the city and who would simply no longer need a car to get around--of which there would no doubt be many--all to the effect of reducing gridlock and saving time for all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to outline my concerns with multiple aspects of Bill 212, primarily Schedule 3 but also Schedule 2 and Schedule 4.\nSchedule 3 focuses on Highway 413 and beginning early works before the environmental assessment has\nbeen completed. The Highway 413 proposed route goes through a large area of what is currently\nprotected under the Greenbelt Plan. On the Ontario Government\u2019s own site\n(https://www.ontario.ca/document/greenbelt-plan), it defines the land protected by the Greenbelt Plan as\nareas \u201cwhere urbanization should not occur in order to provide permanent protection to the agricultural\nland base and the ecological and hydrological features, areas and functions occurring on this landscape.\u201d\nThe areas build a resilience to and mitigate climate change, protects agricultural lands, and \u201cprotect the\nnatural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health.\u201d Yet, this bill\nintends to fast-track the construction of a highway that would go right through those lands, defeating\nexactly what the Greenbelt Plan was enacted to protect in the first place.\nBecause of the environmental importance of the Greenbelt areas, Tim Gray, from Environmental Defense,\nhas submitted a letter requesting Highway 413 to be designated for a federal Impact Assessment as part of\nthe Impact Assessment Act (see attached). It goes through the negative environmental effects that\nbuilding the highway will have on multiple habitats and currently endangered species that rely on those\nhabitats. Severe damage to these areas of the greenbelt may already be done and not reversible if the early\nworks are allowed to continue before the environmental assessment is complete. This also goes against\nthe prescribed order for a project. If work is completed before all studies are performed and the risks are\nassessed, what happens if the environmental assessment outlines several mitigations that need to be\nperformed to reduce the negative effects but can no longer be implemented, or if the project is decided to\nbe too damaging/not worth it? Money and materials will have already been wasted and the damage would\nhave been done.\nBuilding the highway will have a negative effect on Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions targets as well. A\nstudy on US cities, performed by Gilles Duranton at the University of Toronto, had found that vehicle\nkilometers travelled increases proportionally with the amount of highway present and has an effect that\nleads to an, \u201cincrease in driving by current residents; and increase in transportation intensive production\nactivity; and an inflow of new residents\u201d. The study has been included as an attachment for reference. If\nCanada\u2019s overall goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will building Highway 413 lead towards that\nfuture? The Environmental Defense letter made an estimate that CO2e emissions may increase by 0.57\nmetric tonnes per annum. This new highway will cause a large amount of CO2e emissions during its\nconstruction, and keep emitting due to drivers using the highway in personal vehicles over possible\nalternatives. It will push more people to use personal vehicles as their main method of transportation\ninstead of considering alternatives that work towards our greenhouse gas emission targets.\nIt is also difficult to understand why Highway 413 must be constructed, who will benefit from it, and how\nmuch it will cost. The Ontario Government\u2019s website for Highway 413 (https://www.highway413.ca/)\nstates that \u201csomeone travelling the full length of the route would save 30 minutes compared to the time it\nwould take via Highways 401 and 400.\u201d Yet there are other studies, some performed by the Ministry of\nTransportation themselves, that shows that using the 407 will be even faster than what is possible using\nthe proposed Highway 413. This is covered in the Toronto Star article: Will Highway 413 actually cut 30\nminutes from your commute \u2013 A Ministry of Transportation Analysis\n(https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/will-highway-413-actually-cut-30-minut\u2026-\nministry-of-transportation-analysis/article_2ceab5ed-342e-54cf-8c94-518c344d3800.html). I have also included a PDF of the article for review. The main claim of saving people time is being brought into\nquestion by the government body in charge of the project.\nHighway 413 had first appeared in the public space approximately 20 years and has been amended a\nhandful of times over the years. Many things have changed in the last decade alone with regards to the\npopulation of Canada and Ontario, the economy, and the climate. There should be proper assessments for\nnot only the environmental impacts that Highway 413 and other Highways may have, but a new\nassessment on whether these proposals are even beneficial to the people of Ontario and worth the\nfinancial and environmental costs. Are alternatives like using the money to subsidize 407 tolls for trucks and people a viable option instead of building a new highway? This would make better use of existing infrastructure and can be implemented immediately instead of within a decade.\nMany of the points I have mentioned above are with respect to  Highway 413. But Schedule 2 of the Bill outlines other highways that it is attempting to fast-track. Will those fast-tracked projects, and others in the future, follow in the same footsteps of Highway 413 if this bill is accepted and implemented?\nMy issue with Schedule 4 is the Ministry of Transportation, a provincial body, is requiring information from municipalities to prove the benefits of bicycle lanes to ensure drivers are not negatively impacted and it will approve what the municipalities can and cannot do. This is overstepping the ministries jurisdiction. The ministry had gone to the Supreme Court of Canada for a similar issue with regards Highway 413 not long ago as well. Highway 413 was designated for a federal impact assessment and the ministry argued that the federal government had overstepped their boundaries. This is the exact same thing that is happening, but not it is the provincial government overstepping boundaries into how municipalities choose to govern themselves.\nIt is also hypocritical of the Ministry to require data and then decide if it will approve the implementation of bike lanes. Where was all the data and information with regards to Highway 413 that led to the decision that it must be built? The Highway 413 site (https://www.highway413.ca/2021/03/31/timesavings/) states that, \"not everyone will enjoy the direct benefit of time savings\" and then argues other examples such as building hospitals and how it benefits the local residents in the area. The same argument that they use to argue for Highway 413 applies to the bike lanes they want to limit and even remove along Bloor, University, and Yonge. There is a group of people who benefit from the bike lanes, but that is not enough to expand the bike lane networks anymore, yet it is enough to argue for more highways.\nThere have been multiple studies on the return on investment when investing in cycling networks in cities. Australia's Queensland government has a website (https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/travel-and-transport/cycling/cycling-strateg\u2026) speaking about the topic. They invested into their cycling networks and wanted to promote a more active lifestyle for their citizens. They found that for every dollar they invested into the cycling infrastructure, it led to approximately 5 dollars worth of benefits. This came in the form of improved health benefits and reduced traffic congestion to name a few.\nExpanding the cycling network also helps deal with the first/last mile issue, where people using multiple forms of transportation require more options for the first and last mile of a trip. Cars and walking are typical forms, but cycling also can be used to solve this issue as the individual can go wherever they need to and are not limited by the predetermined routes used by buses and trains.\nOverall, alternative methods, including cycling, should be explored and developed more to reduce traffic congestion, improve the health and quality of life of citizens, and reduce GHG emissions and pollution. Just like how induced demand applies to new highways and roads, it applies to cycling networks as well. The amount of people using Bike Share programs in Toronto has been dramatically increasing over the years. People want to cycle, but they want to be safe when doing so.\n"

        "comment": "Ask any transport planner, city planner, or engineer, not only will Bill 212 cause incredible violence on vulnerable and racialized citizens, it will INCREASE gridlock.\nReducing cycling lanes will not only lead to the reduced physical safety of many road users (WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT - remember the death of Alexandra Amaro on Dufferin St?), it will also result in increased congestion and gridlock.\nTransportation planning 101 tells us that adding driving lanes only momentarily reduces congestion. Induced demand, which means travellers from other routes, modes, and times, will use up that additional capacity and the system will return to equilibrium and the same level of service as before. There is simply not enough physical space to have enough lanes for everyone to sit in a 5 x 2 metre steel box (AKA car). The math doesn't add up, and there is no amount of lanes you can add that will make it add up. The only way to reduce congestion is to have better transportation demand management, which means getting some portion of people to use transit, bikes, and walk. That way, only the people that need to drive are driving.\nIf you actually want to reduce gridlock, provide users with alternatives: add more bike lanes, add more frequent and reliable transit, and enhance the pedestrian realm. This will not only reduce congestion, it will also enable people to have healthier lifestyles and more environmentally sustainable communities.\n"
