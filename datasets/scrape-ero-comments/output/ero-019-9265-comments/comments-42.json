Removing bike lanes will increase injuries and fatalities of bikers, but also increase traffic by forcing the bikers with the cars. Home owners will be forced out of their homes just so the developers can build their highways. Again, the lack of environmental assessments is a typical Ford government trait of any dumb policy or bill. Do we really want floods in communities and impact the environment and wildlife? Is this bill REALLY for Ontarians or is it for Doug Fraud and his rich buddies? YUCK to this government, let's look at the facts instead of playing around with Ontarians' emotions and causing division. Despicable!!!!! SHAME!!!!\n"

At the same time, it will encourage further sprawl of the GTHA, thus damaging the Green Belt for future generations.\nRather than spending the billions on Highway 412, I would suggest these funds be used to reduce the toll charges on Highway 407 to increase its usage and to invest in better transit to give people alternatives to using personal vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed addendum to a framework that would require the province to remove sections of Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto is extremely concerning. Equally disturbing is that the proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed.\nFollowing are reasons this proposed framework is concerning:\n1.\tLocal road infrastructure is a municipal responsibility and should remain that way for the following reasons:\na.\tLocal expertise and context \u2013 municipal governments have a deep understanding of the specific needs and challenges of their communities and are better positioned to design and implement infrastructure projects, including the installation of bike lanes, that address local traffic patterns, population density and urban planning goals.\nb.\tCustomization and flexibility \u2013 municipalities can tailor infrastructure projects to fit the unique characteristics of their areas such as factors like local climate, geography and cultural preferences, which might be overlooked by broader, more centralized planning.\nc.\tSafety and Efficiency \u2013 Local governments can implement safety measures and traffic management strategies that are specifically designed for their roadways. This can lead to more effective solutions for reducing accidents and improving traffic flow.\nBy keeping roadway infrastructure under municipal control, cities can ensure that their transportation systems are safe, efficient, and aligned with the needs and values of their residents.\n2.\tThe proposed framework is not grounded in research. There is no evidence that shows bike lanes cause gridlock. Below is some research for consideration:\na.\tAfter New York City installed a protected bike lane on Columbus Avenue, bicycling increased 56 percent on weekdays, crashes decreased 34 percent, speeding decreased, sidewalk riding decreased, traffic flow remained similar, and commercial loading hours/space increased 475 percent.\nb.\tAfter Chicago's Kinzie Street protected bike lane was installed, a travel time study found little to no effect on automobile traffic: Eastbound morning rush hour travel time from Milwaukee Avenue to Wells Street increased by less than one minute. - Westbound morning rush hour travel times from Wells Street to Milwaukee Avenue slightly improved. - Evening rush hour travel time in both directions slightly improved.\nc.\tA survey of Portland, Oregon, protected bike lane users found that 70 percent of respondents thought the lane made cycling safer and easier. Motorists generally thought it didn't make driving any less convenient or slower. Only three percent of cyclists didn't use the protected lane, compared to before it was installed, when 12 percent of riders rode in the street instead of in the bike lane.\n3.\tBike lanes create a safer environment for cyclists, enhancing safety and saving lives. Studies have shown that cities with well-designed bike lanes experience fewer accidents involving cyclists. Below is some research for consideration:\na.\tBecause they shorten crossing distances, control turning conflicts and reduce traffic weaving, New York City's protected bike lanes reduced injury rates for pedestrians by 22%.\nb.\tCycling lanes reduce fatalities for all road users \u2013 roads are safer for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists in cities with robust bike facilities.\nc.\tStudy shows that bicycling infrastructure is significantly associated with fewer fatalities and better road-safety outcomes.\nOn a personal note, I consider myself a cyclist but am also a motorist. My mode of transport to get to the office is by bike as I enjoy having the physical activity built into my day and being able to be outside to get to and from work. In addition to the health and mental health benefits of biking to work, there is the positive impact on the environment by lowering my carbon footprint. Research shows bike lanes saves lives and I am disappointed that the Ontario government is looking at putting legislation in place to remove them.\nI urge the government to reconsider putting in place this legislation as it is short-sighted, not progressive and is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. It compromises the safety of cyclists, discourages environmentally friendly transportation and increases traffic congestion by reducing the number of people who choose to bike instead of drive. Research shows bike lanes help reduce gridlock, build stronger and more vibrant cities and protects all road users.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 26 year old PhD student and I find this proposal extremely concerning. It is bills like these that completely falter any hope I have for a decent future living in Canada. When my government seems to, against all educated advice, advocate for deepening our dependence on owning personal motor vehicles for travel it shocks me. I find it most concerning and I want to emphasize INCREDIBLY concerning that this bill proposes to allow for the government to build through any land they choose for highway projects they deem necessary with no way for displaced peoples to appeal their case. I find this incredibly controlling and I do not believe a government should have the power to completely decide whether or not people's homes will be destroyed and for highways that I do not believe will be necessary or even a well educated decision.\nAny densely populated well developed nation leans heavily into public transport including subways and high speed rail. Another solution to a dense population is to create population centers that are walkable or easily traversed by transit or bike. The proposals laid out in this bill are not friendly to bike let alone walkable projects and I find this a step in the wrong direction if we are to become a better-developed densely populated nation. I feel as though our dependence on cars has arose from a lack of population and far distances between destinations. A highway system served Canada for a time but now that we are becoming a larger nation we need to step away from those old solutions that are starting to no longer work.\nIt is bills like these that make me want to leave Canada after my graduation. It is bills like these that make me lose hope in the nation as a whole. It is bills like these that will turn Canada destitute as any talent with sense will go elsewhere not as a means of maximizing profit, but as a means of survival.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern about the proposed removal of the Bloor Street bike lanes. These lanes have proven their value by significantly increasing cycling volumes\u2014up nearly 49% since their installation\u2014while reducing conflicts between cyclists and vehicles by 44%. Removing them would not only erase these safety gains but also increase the risk to children who now rely on these protected lanes for safe and active transportation.\nFrom a cost-benefit perspective, the bike lanes are a high-value investment. They have optimized the movement of people along Bloor Street by accommodating thousands of cyclists daily while reducing motor vehicle congestion modestly. Their removal would impose unnecessary costs for dismantling, disrupt the area during construction, and waste the resources already invested, all while undermining the city\u2019s efforts to promote sustainable and efficient urban mobility.\nMaintaining the bike lanes is a practical decision that aligns with the province\u2019s goals for safer roads, healthier communities, and reduced emissions. I urge you to consider the long-term benefits of keeping this infrastructure in place rather than incurring the financial and social costs of its removal. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "The three major bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge and University Avenues have been game-changers for me as a professional commuter in Toronto in the last few years. I have been commuting to a downtown-core office since 2017, primarily as a cyclist. It's my primary method of getting to work because it is (a) free; and (b) faster than any other option, including driving or TTCing. When I'm cycling, I'm in full control of my schedule to get to work, and not governed by construction delays, transit delays, or any other external impacts.\nBefore these bike lanes were formalized as separated, protected spaces, it was much scarier and less comfortable to get to work. Driving culture in downtown Toronto has been incredibly intense for years (and was intense and full of drivers who would be pushed to do illegal / scary things because they felt desperate in gridlock even before those bike lanes went in... this is NOT a context caused by the bike lanes), and the commute to work was not safe - but I did it anyway because of the reasons mentioned above.\nThe bike lanes have completely changed my experience. They make me feel safe, secure, and able to commute in a way that's much less stressful and on guard. I have been so proud to live in a city that's building progressive multi-modal infrastructure, which is in line with best practices in urban planning (I am an urban planner, with a Master of Planning degree). Beyond politics, there are many things your government is doing that are in line with best practices in planning (e.g. acceleration of the provision of housing, major moves to address municipal red tape), but this one is explicitly regressive and counter to best practices. Cyclists are also your constituents, and the fact that we don't necessarily have access to vehicles to drive to work, or that we just know it's always been impractical to drive into Toronto's downtown core during rush hour, should not exempt us from substantial infrastructure for a safe commute.\nFinally, the massive waste of taxpayer money involved in ripping out infrastructure that has JUST been built is mind-boggling, and it's amazing to me that this is even under consideration. Please, please don't do this.\nThank you very much for your time and attention.\n"

        "comment": "I hope the Ontario Government eliminates the bike lanes on major streets and avenues in Toronto.  This has been a nightmare for business and driving around the city.  I no longer spend money in Toronto, where I live, but leave the city to get things done, go to restaurants and parks.  The bike lanes in my opinion make things more dangerous on the streets. Frustrated drivers do not drive better. As a pedestrian in Toronto, I am also afraid to cross the street.  Never seen such traffic before, all because there are not enough lanes for cars to go through and everyone is pushing through to get through the intersection or turn right or left.  Just horrendous. Bike lanes are fine, but on adjacent streets where there is no major traffic. The vast majority of bikers do not obey traffic rules, that is the simple truth. I hope the Ontario Government gets rid of these bike lanes for good. We have a lot of problems in the city due to traffic above ground, and underground. These bikers bring on their dirty bikes into the subway during rush hour. They dirty our clothes and take up space for riders. I saw a woman unable to move her baby carriage because a bike was blocking it, she missed her stop. Further to this the return back to the office initiative by companies is increasing the problem. There is too much traffic, with many working from home, now if they return to the office full time, you will get even more traffic in the subways and on the streets.  For many people with health issues or age, riding the bike on the streets of Toronto is not an option, they need to be in their cars due to disability or health challenges. Or take the subway and not worry about bikes getting them stuck unable to leave, or dirty them. Please get rid of the bike lanes, and get the city moving again! Police officers should also be encouraged to ticket the bike riders since most of them break the rules of the road.\n"

The existing toll highways should be better utilized to help reduce traffic and congestion rather than spending so much to create another highway and further destroying the environment.\nBike lanes keep people exercising and our air cleaner and should be prioritized, especially with rising costs of owning vehicles, gas, and parking. It's very clear this government cares more about making their rich friends even richer than helping citizens. Show us the research proposals that this will make things better, why are bills not based on research.

        "comment": "Your proposal to remove municipal bike lanes is counterproductive to reducing gridlock. Science shows that the more lanes you build, the more cars go on the road. The gridlock might temporarily be reduced, but will go right back up to what it is now. If toronto is going to be a world class city, we need to invest those millions that would be WASTED by removing existing bike lanes into supporting the TTC and improving public transit, so that citizens can get places more quickly and safely using public transit. Has Doug Ford ever taken the UP Express? Imagine that quality of public transit everywhere in the city. Gone would be the grimy state of most Line 2 stations. They would be clean and loved. The sign of a healthy city is one where the rich take public transit. I\u2019m a cyclist and have commuted year round. The bike lanes have enabled me to save so much money and stay fit in the process. If these are removed, my daily commute will become more dangerous. But I believe Doug Ford doesn\u2019t really care about some of the people he represents. I believe that he doesn\u2019t care about cyclists. Prove me wrong Doug.\n"

        "comment": "The name of this Bill is offensive cheap sloganeering.  It shows what this government thinks of us.  Can I suggests the government adds on the end \"without worrying about the impact on the environment\" as that would be more accurate.\nThe measures included here are ill considered and have not been proven to accomplish what the title of the Bill says.  In particular:\n- the exemption of the Highway 413 project from environmental review is unacceptable.  There are proven sensitive watershed areas affected that are home to sensitive and endangered species - are these not worthy of consideration?  Once paved over, there is no going back.  In addition, the additional warming of the environment that will be caused is real for all area residents.  Don't believe me?  Stand at the corner of Highway 401 & 403 in July.  Then stand in one of the targeted fields near Caledon.\n- there is no evidence provided that the building of 413 will reduce any gridlock to any meaningful extent.  Indeed previous studies show that any possible travel time reductions are limited to a minute or two at most.  What will actually happen is that the lucky developers who conveniently/coincidentally own land along the route will develop the land - which is remote and will not have any public transit development associated - attracting additional traffic and quickly creating new gridlock.\n- the removal of existing bike lanes seems suspiciously aimed at the Premier's route into Queen's Park.  the government has cited how low the bike riding numbers are, without acknowledging that cycling infrastructure development in the GTA is quite limited compared to the best examples in other cities.  Been to London UK lately?  Don't believe me?  Join me for a ride into Toronto from Oakville - and I am better off than most!  Without a COMPREHENSIVE network you will get more people on bikes - it's too dangerous!  Restricting new lanes and removing existing lanes only takes us backwards - more cars, more pollution and more gridlock\n"
