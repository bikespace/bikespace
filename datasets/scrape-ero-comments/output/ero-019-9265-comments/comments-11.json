        "comment": "\"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\". Why drivers and not\nsimply people? Are my transportation needs less important simply because I'm choosing a bicycle over my car for as many of them as I can?\nI've spent years cycling to work, to take my kids to daycare, to go and spend money at local businesses, to visit friends and family etc. It's baffling and disappointing that the current provincial government either does not understand that people cycle for all sorts of practical and essential reasons, or pretends not to.\nThe Premier's well-documented personal disdain for cycling and cyclists should not stand in the way of municipalities making well-reasoned decisions about transportation infrastructure. It defies logic that the province is somehow better equipped to make hyper-local decisions like this.\nOn top of all of this: building more lanes for vehicles leads to induced demand. I'm not including references to support what I'm saying here because there is a significant body of research which does so. I already pay plenty of provincial tax so that the provincial government can develop relevant expertise, which it is manifestly failing to do in this case.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill proposal is awful for the environment. I\u2019m a student at Fleming College and I\u2019ve learned the importance of habitat destruction on the ecosystem and animals. The areas proposed for the new highways could potentially have species at risk and need to properly be evaluated and assessed before building should be started. There could be migratory species at risk that pass through especially at this time of year which need to be checked. Not to mention the effect that large scale construction would have on the species that inhabit those areas. It is vital to check every part of the proposed construction area thoroughly, especially the areas near the Holland Marsh. As a concerned citizen I urge you to take the proper time to evaluate these areas before starting construction. We have been living with the highways we have now for years and can wait until things are done right for new ones. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "As the rest of the world commits to enhancing multi-modal transportation solutions, Ontario appears to be actively driving backwards, literally and figuratively. The mere suggestion of legislation of this nature leads me to believe the Province lacks an understanding of how to move people from Point A to Point B safely, efficiently, and effectively.\nI take issue with this legislation for a number of reasons. After reading the legislation I\u2019m left with numerous questions that I think the Province should be prepared to answer.\nWhy is the Province looking to limit and restrict safe transportation options for all road users?\nWhy would the government want to have less options available for people to safely get around their communities? Would this not increase congestion and traffic?\nWhy is the Province looking to prioritise the time of motorists rather than create equitable solutions for all road users?\nBased on comments from the Minister of Transportation and the Premiere in the media, the time and safety of motorists seems to be of greater importance than that of other road users, cyclists and pedestrians included. Could you please articulate why this is the case?\nThis legislation demonstrates a lack of understanding behind the reasons for traffic and congestion\nResearch has demonstrated that bike lanes help reduce congestion because they create a modal shift away from driving, which allows existing vehicle traffic to move more efficiently. Please see link to research below. Could the Province please demonstrate how removing bike lanes would allow all roads users to get to their destinations safely and efficiently?\nHas the Province considered road safety, especially that of vulnerable road users?\nRoads in Ontario are dangerous; I read about people being seriously injured or killed by motorists weekly in this province. Bike lanes make using the roads safer for thousands of people daily in Toronto. Why is the government supporting policy that could so clearly impact the health and safety of individual road users, and by extension the broader community by increasing pollution and emissions in local communities? Can the Province explain the steps it has taken to mitigate the impact on vulnerable road users, namely children and the elderly who use bike lanes?\nHas the Province considered the equity and affordability impacts of this legislation?\nThe province is dealing with an affordability crisis. Not everyone can afford a car to get around. Bike lanes provide a safe way for non-motorists to navigate our communities. Has the Province considered the broad range of road users that use bike lanes, from students to delivery drivers?\nWhy is the Province creating legislation that increases red tape and costs?\nWhy is the Province proposing to rip-out millions of dollars in new infrastructure and cause further delays and congestion for all road users and in the process limit the safe options road users will have available to navigate their communities. The thought of ripping out millions of dollars of infrastructure when schools have leaking roofs, and our emergency rooms are at the breaking point is infuriating.\nHas the Province honestly considered where thousands of cyclists are going to go if the bike lanes are removed?\nWhat happens if those road users no longer feel safe cycling, what happens if they choose to use a car to drive (if they have one/can afford one), where are they going to go? More cars on the road will lead to greater congestion, that\u2019s just a reality. How does the government propose to address that issue. Perhaps, bike tunnels?\nWhat happens to the cyclists who still choose to cycle on less safe streets? The have the right to take the lane to get to their destination, however, some cyclists, including those with children might not feel safe and may use the sidewalk, which is also not ideal.\nWhen legislation is this poorly thought out, I can only predict it will be poorly implemented.\nI would like the Provincial government to focus on its supposed priorities, namely rectifying the dismal state of our healthcare and education system, both of which are struggling significantly. Moreover, I\u2019d appreciate the Province focus on getting transit built, namely the Eglinton Crosstown which is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.\nOn a very personal note, I have three young children. I am honestly more afraid of them being killed by a motorist on road in Ontario than most other potential threats. The network of bikelanes where we live in Toronto is finally getting to a standard where I feel safer on the roads. We do not have a vehicle. We use bikes, specifically a cargo bike, the TTC and a car-share to get around. Removing bike lanes makes my family less safe. This legislation makes me less safe. I ask the Province to explain how legislation designed to make people less safe is good for anyone.\nI encourage the Province to review the work of the Centre for Active Transportation and collection of research on the positive economic impacts of bikes, the positive health and safety benefits of bikelanes, as well as research outlining how bike lanes do not increase congestion.\nInfrastructure can always be tweaked and improved, but ripping it out of the ground makes no sense. If you want me to believe this Government is actually serious, then come forward with serious policy and solutions for improving road safety and making sure all road users can get where they are going. Can the Province point to any jurisdiction where prioritising motor vehicle traffic has improved the transportation for all road users?\nI always appreciate it when members of the government work to really understand an issue. I would like to encourage the Minister to do as his boss did and actually get on a bicycle and try to navigate his local constituency or my neighbourhood. I would like to understand how he felt using roads with and without bicycling infrastructure.\nTo quote the Premiere, \"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\u201d and  \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was.\"\n"

People need to get to work, however the people getting there in cars are not more important than the people getting there via bike or attempting to walk on a sidewalk that this proposal would have filled with bikes.\nA final and more personal point is that it will be a cruel joke if the streets of Toronto are once again disrupted by endless construction not to provide new methods of transportation but instead to REMOVE ones that obstructed our streets for ages making this and the prior construction jobs both exercises in insulting futility. Approve this bill only if your goal is to show the people of Toronto that you can disrupt their commute any time you like even without any good reason. Embarrassing.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI completely disagree with the purpose and intent of this bill. We should NOT be reducing bike lanes but instead creating more of them. Many people believe that Netherlands\u2019 has always been a bike friendly country, they were not. In the early 1970\u2019s they were a car heavy culture like Canada, but through a significant policy shift they found away to dramatically increase bike trips and become one of the leading bike friendly countries in the world with all of the benefits. This bill is doing the opposite and taking us backwards. I also have 2 specific issues with this bill:\n1. Reducing bike lanes will only temporarily reduce car congestion. 100 years of cars has proven that more roads only creates more cars. We will never escape car congestion by creating more roads or lanes. It\u2019s time to re-think this issue.\n2. I find it ironic that the Provincial government is ok with meddling in municipal affairs in terms of overridden a municipalities decision with how to integrate biking but would be outraged if the Federal government meddled in a Province government\u2019s area of responsibility. If you want the Federal government to respect your jurisdiction, you need to respect municipalities jurisdictions.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who regularly drives and has access to a car, I get really anxious when sharing the road with cyclists if there is no bike lanes. I think it is unwise to remove them especially in a city like Toronto. In order to reduce gridlock, we should give people more options to commute other than driving. Also, not everyone can afford to rent or own a car. People who bike should not have to fear for their lives every time they need to get somewhere. Enough folks have lost their lives to easily preventable accidents.\nA lot of studies have already proven that increasing the number of lanes on streets doesn\u2019t actually improve congestion, as we will eventually return to the same levels of congestion as before.\nReducing gridlock should involve maintaining a diverse approach to travel, and will provide peace of mind for all in knowing that we can all be in our designated lanes to get to our destinations safely.\n"

Bicycle lanes in my community have improved accessibility and safety for myself and my family. Reducing cycle and pedestrian safety will not improve vehicular congestion, only fewer cars on the over-stuffed roads can do that. Cycle lanes, sidewalks and paths, and better transit infrastructure are essential to the healthy growth of our communities. I support a sensible, balanced approach for everyone - not just those who chose to drive over the other alternatives. And I do not believe we should be engaging in dialogue that pits one group of people against the other disproportionately.\n"
