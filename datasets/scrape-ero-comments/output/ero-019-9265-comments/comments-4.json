        "comment": "This bill is a clear example of the needless wastefulness present in the current iteration of the Ontario provincial government.\nThe provincial government demanding the removal of completed bike lanes is not only a gross over reach of authority but also a complete waste of public funds. Furthermore, it is a waste of time and money for the provincial government to be overlooking municipal responsibilities that they are more than capable of managing themselves.\nThe most effective way to remove gridlock is to have less people using cars for transportation and more using alternatives such as public transportation or bike lanes.\nThis bill also demonstrates the current government's complete disdain for the environment. Encouraging more people to use cars for transportation rather than investing in cleaner alternatives is frankly laughable. Even worse however is the proposed exemption of the unnecessary highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. Proposed routing runs through environmentally sensitive areas and the idea that an exemption should be provided shows disdain for the population (including the wildlife) of Ontario.\nThis bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this Bill - to the person who has to amalgamate all this information, I commend the work you do! Good luck :) My perspective is in regards to supporting the cycling infrastructure in Ontario. I hope that there is the ability for the ministry to not just put motor transportation ahead of cycling transportation. I understand that the Ministry's mandate is to focus on \"Moving people and goods safely, efficiently and sustainably across Ontario to improve quality of life and support a globally competitive economy.\" I believe the Ministry has been working on a multi-modal plan for years, hoping to allow for more cycling and multi-purpose infrastructure throughout the province. Cycling speaks to moving people sustainability and improving the quality of life. I understand that the Ministry has to balance the ability to move good and services in a fashion that meets its mandate and that can be a juggling act. Cycling has grown in interest and is a healthy way to commute, and enjoy recreationally. There are many cities throughout Ontario (e.g., Toronto and Sault Ste. Marie) that encourage cycling as a mode of transportation to help alleviate gridlock, but also to promote healthy/active living. I understand the need to balance public transit and traditional road infrastructure needs with the needs of other modes of transportation, but try not to reduce biking - it has great externalities that might not be able to be quantified, but there is a positive impact to society overall. Think about how other cities that have a healthy cycling network (e.g., Chicago) - Chicago is a similar population size to Toronto, and has one of the best cycling infrastructure networks in the US. It's possible that Ontario (e.g., Toronto) can have a growing cycling network, that might compromise traffic lanes but doesn't have to compromise the overall health of a city which is willing to cycle and has the desire to cycle.\n"

        "comment": "I'm afraid we are mired in 1950's thinking, that we can continue to build more and more roads to accommodate more and more private vehicle traffic.\nThe GTA is already at capacity for vehicle traffic, no matter how many roads we build, congestion will not be alleviated. We have proceeded on the current course for many decades, without managing to reduce congestion in any significant way.\nNumerous studies, worldwide, conclusively demonstrate the viability of public transportation systems to alleviate congestion in cities. Bicycle lanes also are proven to reduce traffic congestion. Encouraging people to use public transport and other modes of transport, such as bicycles and scooters, by implementing congestion charges and tolls has proved to be successful.\nFor heaven's sake, can we not examine successful multi mode transportation systems, rather than rehashing failed systems? Go to Japan, Scandinavia even Montreal and New York and see how it can be done.\n"

        "comment": "Taking away bike lanes is counter intuitive to the goal that is trying to be reached. By dedicating the lanes to cars it makes active transportation impossible and more dangerous. Cities should be focusing on solutions to allow people to have access to more space and time efficient solutions instead of forcing everyone to drive. By taking away these cycling lanes, people who would potentially bike are disincentivized due to the dangers.\nMore people taking transit / cycle to their destination means less people on the roads allowing the people who need to be on the road less traffic. Cities should prioritise people, not cars.\n"

Ontario doesn't need another highway, the people living here need more options to be able to travel. Dedicated high speed rail lines, expansion of the GO network, more effective intercity bussing solutions are what is needed.\nTransit within cities needs to be worked on as well to allow people options to not need to take a car everywhere. Ontario is a large place, but when the majority of our population lives along the 401, we cannot just keep adding lanes. Other solutions need to be prioritised instead of another highway.\nOr just save the time and money and buy back the 407 instead of proposing wild ideas like building a tunnel. One more lane won't fix the problem, neither will another highway.\n"

We are stewards of our environment and we owe it not just to ourselves but to our children, to protect the environment. The Environmental Assessment Act is a key component of that environmental stewardship. Building such a large infrastructure project without understanding the environmental impact of such infrastructure is wholly irresponsible and downright negligent.\nI urge you to work with your party and other MPPs to make the voices of your constituents heard. We do not want Highway 413, and we certainly do not want it to proceed without proper assessment as required by the Environmental Assessment Act.\nA preliminary report has found that Highway 413 will have massive negative impacts on our environment, air quality, and precious agricultural greenbelt. If this is what a basic report can anticipate, surely such a project must require a more thorough assessment conducted by the government.\nMeanwhile Schedule 4 adds nothing but red tape to bike lanes. Countless studies have shown that bike lanes save lives, and improve the environment while also having  minimal negative impact on car users.\nWhy are you adding red tape to bike lanes, but removing it from Highway 413?\nAgain I urge you to ensure the voices of your constituents are heard, and we want better bike infrastructure!\nSincerely,\nOntarian\n"

The idea that having the cyclists on the roads taking up their own lane is going to help traffic is absurd, and ignoring the fact that this will 100% cause more cyclist accidents and deaths is actually pretty on par for Ford. The traffic congestion downtown is only ever going to be decreased by making it easier to access the core without using a car.\n"

        "comment": "Concerning Bill 212:\nSchedule 1 -no comment\nSchedule 2-not necessary at all. the minister does not need these special powers. The current highway construction process is sufficient. The possible time savings cannot justify overriding municipal by-laws, the expropriation act and the court appeal process. These are necessary parts of a functioning democracy and those processes require time. The Ministry may look at cities such as Detroit, Buffalo and Los Angeles and see that eventually the extra highway infrastructure bankrupts the cities nearby and does NOT solve congestion. Congestion could be solved by charging drivers for using the highway as demonstrated by highway 407. The government should considered removing the ban it imposed on such possibility.\nSchedule 3-the highway does not need these special concessions. It is in a not very populated area, outside of the GTA and not many will benefit from it. The minister should consider applying this framework to transit projects such as GO Expansion so that it is completed as soon as possible. That will provide an alternative to highways that will actually reduce traffic.\nSchedule 4-the ministry does not need to get involved with municipal bike lanes. The amounts involved are so small and the space on the roads so plentiful, compared to the Billions that will be spent on the three highways in Schedule 2, that it is incomprehensible why the ministry has an intersect on bicycle lanes. The ministry should aim for a balanced transportation system as opposed to becoming like Texas where 95+ % of the population drives cars. Wouldn\u2019t there be less traffic if only 50 % of people were car motorists and the rest used bicycles and/or transit?\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is so overreaching and misguided it would almost be funny if it weren't also intentionally cruel. I'm both a cyclist and a driver, and when I'm driving I love not having to worry about sharing a lane with a bike. Bike lanes keep us BOTH safe \u2014 I don't want to injure or kill a cyclist, and as a cyclist, I don't want to BE injured or killed. Weird, right? By removing bike lanes, you force cyclists back into sharing a lane with drivers, which will just slow drivers down and increase congestion, but I can tell you haven't thought about that because you haven't thought about anything to do with this plan other than, \"Hurr durr, let's stick it to those bike-riding lefties.\" Also, let's talk about the expense of ripping out perfectly good bike lanes that, in many cases, were only installed as recently as earlier this year. I'm not down to pay for that with my tax dollars as it's an incredible waste. You claim this plan is extremely popular, because you're not actually interested in looking at any data or opinions from cyclists. Lastly, for a party that is ostensibly 'pro-small government,' this is comically overreaching. Let the municipalities do what they want and, frankly, stay in your lane.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto is facing a critical turning point in shaping a sustainable and efficient city. Law 212 limits the expansion of bike lanes, despite the proven environmental, health, and economic benefits that accessible cycling infrastructure offers. We, the undersigned, urge Toronto's City Council / Ontario government to prioritize installing more bike lanes and not enact Bill 212 to create a greener, safer, and more connected city.\nContrasting the provincial government\u2019s policies, which promote car use, rapid greenbelt development, and increased alcohol accessibility, the city\u2019s potential for reducing congestion and emissions lies in fostering accessible and safe transit options like biking. While Premier Ford\u2019s government has prioritized policies that cater to short-term convenience, often at the expense of long-term environmental and public health, cities like Toronto must lead the way in sustainable solutions.\nOpening the greenbelt and undermining conservation efforts do not ease congestion but worsen air quality and contribute to urban sprawl. By making sustainable choices locally, we can counter these provincial decisions and set a forward-thinking example.\nBike lanes ease congestion by providing an alternative to cars and transit, reducing both traffic and wait times. According to the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 75% of Toronto residents support increased cycling infrastructure, reflecting a widespread desire for greener alternatives. By prioritizing bike lanes, we can create safer streets and offer residents healthier transportation choices that reduce our collective carbon footprint.\nWe ask government officials to not support Bill 212 and invest in a sustainable, people-focused city by expanding Toronto\u2019s bike lane network. Together, let\u2019s create a city where people of all ages can travel safely and efficiently without relying solely on cars. Sign this petition to demand progress towards a cleaner, less congested, and more liveable Toronto.\n"

Studies after studies have shown that in order to reduce gridlock, you must give commuters the choice for great reliable ways to move. Increase the public transport offer if you really want to reduce gridlock. Invest in the future, not the past. The highway is not the answer. I can't fathom how archaic this bill is.\nStudies have shown that the more roads are build, the more cars, there will be (assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124/latest-evidence-on-induced-travel-demand-an-evidence-review.pdf). Sure, for a short period of time, it is possible we will see a decrease in traffic, but it has been researched that after a year or tow, traffic will be just as bad, if not worse. Isn't that what happened when lanes were added to the 401? Why try the same wrong solution again?\nGridlocks are not going to resolved themselves, they are only going to keep happening if the only answer is to build more roads. Public transport is the key!!!\nAlso, what is this nonsense attack on bike lanes ? There is no evidence that these lanes increase congestion. Most studies agree that there is either no added time for car travellers or at most 1 minute from the usual time when protected bike lanes are added. In fact, I highly recommed the following read: https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026 for members of the government to make a thoughtful decision on this bill.\n"

The province need public transit infrastructure, and getting rid of bike lane in the city will force cyclist on the road which then slow down traffic even more and cause more accidents. This is a feel good infrastructure plan with no consideration what will be actually helpful to reduce gridlocks.\nImprove driving education, tell people to stop blocking intersections and create laws to regulate it. Invest in public transit so cars don't have to be driven all the way to toronto or other major city hubs.\n"
