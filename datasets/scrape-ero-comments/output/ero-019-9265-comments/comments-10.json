        "comment": "I have recently begun cycling to work, as someone who does not own a car and does not have a direct transit route to my workplace. The only reason I feel safe cycling is because of designated bike lanes. I only take routes with protected bike lanes (with barriers) because I value my life, and personally know a young woman who died after a collision with a dump truck. I strongly oppose any intervention by the province into municipal bike lane builds and especially oppose the ripping out of current bike lane infrastructure. This infrastructure is necessary, and encourages more new riders each day to try a sustainable, fast, inexpensive form of transit.\n"

        "comment": "Closing bike lanes will not help with traffic congestion. Instead it will kill cyclists, and increase motor traffic as cyclists are forced to drive cars for their own safety, as well as deterring new cyclists.\nIt has been proven that bike lanes actually reduce congestion, and cycling is the fastest way around the city. We need to do more to protect cyclists, and give them safe infrastructure, and encourage more people to cycle bikes.\n"

        "comment": "As a student from Toronto being represented by your government, I am deeply disappointed by the lack of environmental concerns being considered in this bill. Not only does it ignore the empirical evidence of other countries around the world who have successfully integrated bike lanes without increased traffic congestion (see below links), but also is a bandaid fix to a larger issue. Instead of aiming to fast-track highway production by paving through Greenbelt areas, your government should be focusing on investing in safe, convenient, and environmentally conscious transportation infrastructure. Bill 212 is an overstep by the province into a jurisdiction that should be left up to municipalities. I hope you seriously consider the grave consequences that this Bill will have if put into action. We need to be thinking about the future, not just the here and now. And while this bill may seem to be the appropriate course of action for the present, that shortsightedness will be regretted years down the road as the climate crisis deepens.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal of the removal of the bike lanes you will not stop cyclists, you will only be killing them and allowing more room for cars to take over. There are many people that commute to work, school, to run errands, all on their bikes. By taking away the bike lane you will be taking away a chosen mode of transportation for just under half of the city\u2019s population.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a travesty regarding understanding of the factors to reducing traffic congestion, will result in billion dollars of spending for the province and will have deadly consequences for little to no benefit to the public at large. There will be a slight decrease in traffic for a brief period of time \u2014 then induced demand will bring the roads to a standstill within no time at all. Studies show time and time again that adding lanes of traffic, over the long run, actually serves to make traffic worse while deprecating the quality of life for those who do not drive and makes our province even less navigable for those who do not drive. These billions in taxpayer dollars can far better be utilized by transit solutions that are actually planned for long-term sustainable growth and urban development that prioritizes mobility while deprioritizing personal motor vehicles.\nThe demonization and destruction of cycling infrastructure is the most tragic part of this plan. Drivers will see a meagre improvement to their travel time for a brief moment before returning to baseline. Meanwhile, us and our neighbours who do not drive, and choose to take an efficient, sustainable, and healthy way around our town will suffer for it and risk getting seriously injured or killed, all for what? A few minutes shaved off of drivers\u2019 morning commute? Your convenience as a driver does not outweigh cyclists right to safety. This thinking demonstrates a complete carelessness for the wellbeing of ALL Ontarians, increasing inequality between drivers and non-motorists.\nIf you really care about reducing congestion - create reasonable and effective alternatives to driving (transit, cycling infrastructure, better pedestrian access to amenities). Reduce the need to drive and make it easier to not need a car. The success of GO transit in getting suburban commuters to downtown should be a sign that we need more of this and less reliance on inefficient, costly, high-emissions travel modes. Plan smarter.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently oppose Bill 212, especially its detrimental impact on bike lanes. This legislation is not only poorly grounded in data but also represents a misguided use of taxpayer money. By undermining biking infrastructure, the government is turning its back on a growing movement for sustainable transportation that resonates with young adults and families. If this bill moves forward, it will alienate a significant portion of the electorate that values biking as a viable and healthy alternative. Since I switched from driving to biking, I've become one less car on the road and embraced a healthier lifestyle. We cannot afford to roll back progress in favor of outdated thinking. This bill must be stopped.\n"

With the amount of cyclists lives we see lost every year in toronto it boggles my mind that anyone would think about taking away the precautions we have in place that help prevent accidents and make it easier for cyclists to get around the city.

        "comment": "City planning strategies that seek to make car use more convenient has a historical pattern of increasing the overall number of vehicles in lock step. Adding more roads for cars only while removing cycling infrastructure pushes people away from alternative modes of transport, which, get this, means there are more cars on the road. Fewer cars means less congestion. Almost every other form of transportation is more space and cost effective. Stop what you're doing, fund bike infrastructure and public transit.\n"

I would have continued to use it (and get out of my car) if it had been safe here.\nHighway 413 is not needed.

        "comment": "The existence of bike lanes and trains has a huge impact on the accessibility of Toronto and Ontario more broadly. With more Go transit options, including holidays and weekends, a car wouldn't be necessary for me to get in and out of the city.\nBike lanes keep me safe, as I commute by bike every day, and is often full of other bikes, all of who would struggle to merge with traffic if bike lanes were removed. If people on those bikes drove, it would only increase congestion, and make biking even more unsafe than it already is in a now congested and construction ridden downtown.\nI urge everyone looking at this bill to understand no one wants more traffic in toronto, and bikers mean less people in cars, and less traffic. Plus what takes up more space, a new car lane or an existing bike lane? Please don't spend money destroying infrastructure people in this city use every day.\n"

        "comment": "It's a well-known fact that getting people out of their cars and transporting them by other means reduces traffic. Getting rid of bike lanes, especially in dense urban cores will do nothing but endanger people's lives who still bike and congest the roads more through increased traffic. While bike lanes take up space on the road, they increase throughput and maneuverability, increase in people's ability to access shops, services, and leisure.\nStorefronts with bike Lanes out front have noticed an increase in both the number of consumers who enter as well as the amount consumers spent.\nIn short, getting rid of as well as making it harder to install bike lanes will decrease urban growth, congeat roads in urban areas more, and make voters lives more dangerous. Bike lanes are an essential part of urban planning and must be considered accordingly\n"

Exempting any projects from a full environmental assessment is both reckless and short sighted. During the pandemic we learned how important it is to have food locally produced. Sacrificing prime farm land for the sake of improving commuting times by a few minutes (let\u2019s use the honest assessment of 2-3 minutes of time savings rather than the government\u2019s inflated figure of 30 minutes), is not worth the investment and loss of land. Studies have shown, if you build more roads they quickly become more congested again as it encourages more people to drive. Let\u2019s keep investing in reliable, cost effective public transportation to get commuters off the roads.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI write to express my deep concern about the proposal to review and potentially remove bike lanes in Ontario and to urge you to abandon this short-sighted and highly damaging proposal.\nI am a driver, cyclist, and pedestrian in Toronto. I am also a professor and social scientist at the University of Toronto with a record of published research that bears directly on energy transition policies. So I have both personal experience and expertise on this topic.\nMost importantly, bike lanes are essential infrastructure to protect my and my family's safety as well as the health and safety of all Ontarians. I have bike-commuted to work for over 5 years. I have also used my bike, equipped with a kid's bike seat, to regularly transport my two children to daycare during that time. My children are now 8 and 5 years old and ride their own bicycles. According to Toronto Police Services data, 34 people have lost their lives to fatal car collisions so far in 2024. Six were cyclists. Eliminating protected bike lanes from widely used thoroughfares will put our safety at risk. Less appreciated, but equally devastating, are the health effects of continued investment in car infrastructure. A 2021 federal study found that 500 Ontarians and 170 Torontonians died prematurely as a direct consequence of traffic related air pollution in 2015. Given the rise in both vehicles and Toronto's population since 2015, we can reasonably expect these figures to be underestimates of the current counts. Reducing the number of cars on the road saves lives in multiple ways.\nI commute by bike daily. There are two things that I notice on my commutes. First, I notice the growing number of Torontonians using bike lanes for their daily travel. Due to growing demand, the building I work at downtown has added two additional bike racks last spring. They were at capacity again this summer. Bike Share Toronto statistics, the most reliable bike usage figures we have, back up my observation. The number of trips have grown from 665,000 in 2015 to 5.7 million trips in 2023--a near 10-fold increase in less than a decade! Bike lanes increasingly provide essential transportation infrastructure for Torontonians and this trend is expected to only accelerate.\nThe second thing I observe on my commute is a line of cars, many are SUVs and the vast majority with a single occupant--the driver. Passing one single-occupant car after another throws the absurdity of blaming bicycles for the traffic problem in sharp relief. Cars cause traffic, not bicycles. I sympathize with the residents who have no other option except to drive and must endure gridlock. So let's focus on actual solutions, encouraging and enabling commuters to make other choices. Bike lanes are one option that commuters are increasingly choosing. Let's focus the conversation on questions that actually matter. Why do many commuters who live near public transit lines still choose to drive (this includes many in my neighbourhood in Toronto, just 5 km from downtown and on a streetcar line)? Why does the Eglinton Crosstown LRT remain incomplete with apparently no accountability? Why are TTC fares some of the highest in the world?\nToronto is expected to grow by 1.1 million residents (35%) by 2051. If the Government wants to address transportation in a sustainable, forward-looking way, they should focus on answering and addressing questions like the ones I listed above, not on taking away choice from Ontarians.\nThank you for your attention.\nSincerely,\nFedor A. Dokshin\n"

Stepping into their jurisdiction, and endangering lives by trying to prevent or remove some bike lanes is overreaching. We vote for and support the actions of MPPs of all stripes, but we did not elect them to make decisions about our local roads.\n"
