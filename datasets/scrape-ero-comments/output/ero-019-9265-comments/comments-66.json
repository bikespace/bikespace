More trains, more public transit, more bike lanes.\nIf the people of Ontario had reliable, frequent transit options, the need to drive into our major metropolitan areas would decrease.\nFurthermore, all studies point to the bike lanes in Toronto helping congestion, hospital emergency vehicle times, and improving traffic for businesses.\nThe conservative government cares more about keeping developers happy than caring for the basic needs of its citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Registered Professional Planner, specializing in Transportation Planning with nearly 10 years of experience working for both public and private sectors in Ontario. I, along with all of my colleagues, are absolutely opposed to the proposed changes under Bill 212, for several reasons.\n1) The political theatre created around the inclusion of bike lane changes into this bill is not only fundamentally dangerous for mobility and WILL undoubtedly result in an increase in congestion, reduction in road safety, and increase in deaths and serious injuries.. but it also furthers the politicization of mobility as a fundamental service. In an era of increased polarization, basic infrastructure should be immune to politics and determined based on facts not feelings.\n2) I urge MPPs see that the range of experts and professionals opposed to Bill 212 far exceeds transportation planners, traffic engineers, and road safety professionals.\nSafe streets and bike lanes have multi-disciplinary (and positive) implications across public health, emergency services, educators, data and tech, business owners, and are critical tools to activate the public realm for community building. The elimination of bike lanes and increased red tape will cause significant harm to communities across Ontario who are looking to activate their public spaces, reduce transportation costs on households, and rejuvenate their main streets.\n3) It is a disgrace that the main effort of this bill to eliminate EA requirements for highways has been slid under the rug and hidden from public discourse over the last several weeks. It is shameful that the province, after repeated assurances that they will \u201cnot touch the greenbelt\u201d continues to push ahead to build a highway that none of the communities want, that will expand auto-dependant sprawl and worsen congestion across the region, and will pave over the very environment we need to protect to reduce the severity of flooding and effects of Climate Change in the densest region of the country.\nThere are plenty of areas across the province that would benefit from the development the premiere is intent on \u201cunlocking\u201d for his friends who purchased the land along the 413 alignment. Communities on the other side of the greenbelt who have developable space for housing and services. Concentrating everything around Toronto and investing in highways instead of rapid regional rail services is a policy rooted in the 1950s with no regard to the lessons learned from our mistakes over the last century that led us to the crippling congestion and unsustainable land use we experience today.\n4) Equal and accessible mobility has no gender, no race, and no political affiliation. At least it shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s simply about moving more people, more efficiently, safely, and sustainably through our communities. But somewhere in the past decade Mobility - and in essence anything related to environmental sustainability, accessibility, or equity - has unfortunately fallen victim to the left-vs-right culture wars, enveloping our whole society. There is no winning side, everyone loses when congestion worsens, active mobility is too dangerous, and when limited tax dollars spent on infrastructure are wasted to rip up the same because a few in power prefer to find a group to demonize for votes, rather than further invest in a proven solution.\n5) this has been said endlessly by others - but the data used by this administration to justify this Bill is fundamentally flawed, rooted in a desire to pad the pockets of the oil and gas lobby, and stoke anger among suburban voters who are not even directly effected by these bike lanes.\n6) If the province wants to fix congestion, then activate the uptown and midtown CP and CN rail corridors through Toronto (parallel to 407 and south of the 401) as indicated in the provinces own Regional Transportation Plan. Activate these for Rapid GO rail services with stations across the city to service trips that cross the region and not concentrate downtown. Expand the tracks and run the trains as we had them decades ago, and watch how many cars you can take off the 401 tomorrow.\nFinally, expand transit investment to an Ontario Line North (to Shepard or finch), Ontario Line western extension (up Dufferin to Downsview, or up Jane to Wonderland), accelerate construction of the Shepard east and west subway projects, extend the finch LRT south to Pearson and east to Scarborough, and fund the Waterfront east and west LRTs.  Outside Toronto, upgrade the Lakeshore BRT to an extension of the Waterfront LRT, increase funding for YRT operations, and extend daily GO service to London.\nThe possibilities are endless, but the current vision is limited to short sighted desires for votes against the public interest.\nFinally, I urge decision makers consider how this Bill is rightly opposed to the Provinces own planning legislation, and policies in communities across the province. This is anti democratic, will worsen congestion, hurt the environment by destroying the function of Greenbelt, and cost many lives.\n"

As a rural Ontario citizen (postal code N0B 1S0), I strongly oppose this bill for the following reasons:\nRegarding the removal of bike lanes where a lane of traffic has been replaced with a bike lane:\n- Research has shown that adding bike lanes helps to reduce gridlock by getting vehicles off the road; even though anecdotes may make you feel like the bike lanes are contributing to gridlock, they are NOT\n- The bike lanes in downtown Toronto have been thoroughly researched and approved by the municipality and are very new; ridership will only continue to increase as bike share becomes increasingly popular and people become familiar with the new bike lanes\n- Biking in downtown Toronto is extremely dangerous; removing the bike lanes will only force cyclists to bike in more dangerous areas therefore CAUSING the deaths of more Ontarians\n- Canada's public transit lags behind that of many other developed and developing countries; this is where investment should be made to improve gridlock so that we stop lagging behind countries that show advancements in these areas\n- Induced demand makes it so that additional road infrastructure will encourage more cars to be on the road, worsening air quality in cities and going backwards when it comes to environmental considerations\nRegarding highway 413\n- Highway 413 is slated to go through valuable greenbelt land and will disrupt many important ecosystems; we are in a climate crisis and moving backwards in terms of environmental protections is irresponsible and short-sighted\n- This highway will encourage urban sprawl and induced demand will make it so that travel time is NOT improved, and in fact worsened due to increased urbanization\n- If you want to spend money on a big project to help clear congestion, improve GO train and transit service in and around the GTA, and make it so that less of the GTA is zoned exclusively for single-family homes; this will help clear the roads for those who HAVE to drive\nAll together, Bill 212 is irresponsible and will damage the environment, worsen traffic congestion, increase the number of cyclist deaths, and contribute to Ontario becoming more of a disgrace in the eyes of both urban and rural individuals.\n"

        "comment": "We don\u2019t need more highways to combat traffic and long travel times. Every study on increased lanes and more highways induces demand for car travel and we end up with more traffic and longer travel times. It\u2019s something we should have learned a long time ago with highway 401 and its endless expansion from its very inception. Studies on Highway 413 have shown that it will only alleviate traffic in the short term and then cause travel times to become much longer. We need to invest in alternative modes of travel to alleviate traffic.\nFinancially, these projects for Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and others are going to be super expensive and cost the taxpayers billions to construct and maintain. The 407 took 14 years to complete so it\u2019s most likely that we won't see highway 413 for decades even with everything the Provincial government is trying to expedite this process. At the end of it all we won\u2019t even save travel time.\nThe Premier has already been told by Ontarians and the Federal government that we don\u2019t want him paving through the Greenbelt. Instead of listening to any of us, the Premier and the PC\u2019s decided to write Bill 212 so included a small section on bike lanes (1.5 pages of the 28 page bill) and made that the talking point. That way the public wouldn\u2019t notice that he and his government put things in Bill 212 like exceptions to the Environmental Assessment Act so they could start construction of certain items before completing a limited environmental impact assessment. If the environmental impact assessment says by building these highways you\u2019re going to do major damage to the wetlands, protected native species and the environment at large, how are you going to fix that when the construction has already begun? Hide the assessment from the public under the new clause in Bill 212 that allows the government to keep it secret if they \u201ccontain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters\u201d? Any environmental assessment is basically guaranteed to have information on sensitive or cultural heritage matters so I guess we\u2019ll never know the damage you\u2019ll do until it\u2019s far too late.\nI would also really appreciate the Provincial government being open about whether or not Highway 413 will be a toll road. What reason do you have for Bill 212 to include a clause to expedite the construction of broadband for highways if not tolls?\nThere seems to be a total disregard for municipalities and Ontarians in general in this bill. We don\u2019t want 24-hour construction and you shouldn\u2019t be able to override most municipal bylaws that ban or limit such practices. I also don\u2019t agree with more projects being given this priority status in the future. You can\u2019t just force highways and other construction projects through because that\u2019s what you want.\nIt\u2019s exhausting having to tell this government to just listen to the experts like engineers (see the response from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers) and Ontarians instead of just forcing through whatever they want to do for them and their buddies. It seems that if you don\u2019t like it then they\u2019ve thought of that too with increased fines for anyone who interrupts construction. Yet another part of Bill 212 I object to.\n"

The province should not be wasting time and resources introducing new bureaucratic red tape that micromanages municipalities.\nThe idea that removing bikes lanes will improve gridlock is not grounded in evidence. Allowing more cars doesn\u2019t reduce gridlock; increasing public transit and bike infrastructure is shown to improve congestion in cities. The Premier is knowingly choosing to put the lives of Ontarians at risk by choosing to make cycling more dangerous. Removing existing bike infrastructure that cities have spent extensive time planning and constructing is also a gross waste of tax dollars.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is a short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and tauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure-forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn't care about the environment and is not serious about eliminating gridlock but instead cares more about the interests of developers and not the interests of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. After careful consideration, it is clear that this legislation fails to address its stated goal of reducing gridlock while introducing significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and public health.\nHighway 413, which is exempt from environmental assessments under this bill, will destroy crucial Greenbelt lands, including wetlands and farmland. These areas are vital for flood prevention, carbon storage, and biodiversity. Environmental Defence has reported that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of this protected land, irreparably harming our ecosystem. Exempting a project of this scale from proper oversight undermines the integrity of Ontario\u2019s environmental protections.\nFurthermore, the removal of bike lanes contradicts well-established principles of sustainable urban planning. Bike lanes improve traffic flow, promote safer streets, and reduce emissions by encouraging active transportation. They also provide economic benefits, as demonstrated by increased retail sales along bike-friendly corridors in Toronto. Removing this infrastructure will lead to more congestion and undermine local economies.\nThe financial cost of Highway 413, projected at over $8 billion, is another cause for concern. This money could be better spent on public transit, healthcare, and affordable housing\u2014areas that provide far greater economic and social returns. In short, Bill 212 prioritizes costly, outdated solutions over modern, sustainable alternatives.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation. Ontario\u2019s future depends on bold, forward-thinking investments that prioritize environmental stewardship, public health, and fiscal responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "I think that the government is really focusing on the wrong things with this bill.\nPart XII of the bill says that a municipality cannot create a bike lane on a highway or part of a highway unless it has been approved by the Ministry.\nIt is stated earlier in the bill that \"highway\" has the same meaning as in the Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act, where it is defined as \"a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct, trestle or any other structure incidental thereto, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof\".\nThis part of the bill will be applied where the bicycle lane would reduce the number of marked lanes available for cars, meaning that this can be applied to almost any street in any municipality, which will waste an enormous amount of time and money when the Ministry has to review proposal after proposal for bike lanes.\nThe municipal governments are the ones who know their city and streets best and are the ones that should be making this type of decision, not the Ministry, whose employees may never have even seen the municipality whose bike lane they will be reviewing.\nDoug Ford is also planning to rip out bike lanes in Toronto, wasting the millions of dollars spent on building them in the first place, as well as millions more get the work of removing them done in order to speed up car commute by a few minutes, or seconds. I consider this as well as the money that will be spent reviewing all the bike lane proposals to be a very poor use of funds.\nAll that money could be used to focus on actually building planned LRT projects, improving train infrastructure, bus infrastructure, or many, many other options for public transit. We need more ways of getting people out of cars and onto busses, trains, and bikes. These all take up much less space than cars and will free up road space for drivers and make their commutes shorter because there will be fewer cars on the road.\nMore options for transit will also put money back in the pockets of lower income families, which could be critical for them. Being able to bike more often, or take the train or bus instead of driving everywhere will mean they can save huge amounts of money not having to pay for gas. They can drive their car when it is necessary and enjoy other methods of getting around when it is not. Instead, this bill will make it even harder to survive without driving.\nFewer cars on the road will also mean less maintenance is required for their upkeep, saving millions of dollars. Fewer cars also means less traffic on the 400 series highways, and less of a need to continue expanding them. The farmland, wetlands, waterways, etc. that will be damaged by the proposed 413 are much more valuable to Canada than another highway that will soon be clogged with traffic as well because we are not reducing people's need to drive everywhere.\nSpeaking for myself, the only thing holding me back from biking to work is that there is one stretch of incredibly busy road that is very dangerous for cyclists. I can get most of the way there safe in a bike lane, and if there was also a bike lane on this last stretch of road I would not hesitate to bike to work. There are many other people like me, and we should focus on building more bike lanes to get people out of cars and off the roads, reducing traffic and speeding up commute times for everyone instead of adding useless bureaucracy and making it harder to make the lives of commuters better.\n"

        "comment": "I believe a proposal to re-acquire Highway 407 would be more suitable to remediating passenger vehicle traffic congestion in the short-to-medium term through Southern Ontario. This would allow for work to to better develop active transportation and public transit solutions to traffic with a long term emphasis. People driving automobiles on its' own is not necessarily a bad thing - but in high density population centers and there is a point where there are simply too many cars to handle the volumes of traffic using these roads (particularly in Toronto). Removing pedestrian/cycling/transit infrastructure would take away some of the features that allow cities to thrive. Additionally, the removal of said existing infrastructure to re-develop more car lanes is short sighted. The issue will come back for residents to deal with once more |(due to induced demane), and proceeding this way would be short-sighted at best (as well as unnecessarily destructive).\nI also believe the development of a hew highway 413 would be highly counterproductive to long term environmental conservation and pollution reduction efforts. We should be looking to develop higher modes of transportation within and between Ontario cities, including getting the Eglinton Crosstown LRT system  working once and for all.\nBased on the above I state my opposition to this bill.

Our streets are public domain, we have the right to use them as pedestrians, bikers and mobility-scooter users, cars have the privilige of using them, they are a guest in our street landscape but this has been lost in the last 80 years. For thousands of years we have used the streets as not only places to go through but places to go to. What makes the Danforth, Bloor, Yonge and most of downtown is the fact that they are so full of places to go to, instead of parking lots or lanes or traffic that only serve as a thoroughfare to out of city folks.\nIf you were really serious about the economy, you would not allow cars to dominate the transportation landscape, making it so more and more businesses need to buy parking lots or go bankrupt because not enough people live within walking or biking distance to them. Parking lots are a waste of space and money. Downtown Toronto and the City of Toronto's more walkable, mixed-used, low car areas are subdizing the suburbs, where kids are stuck in their cul-de-sacs, far away from their friends and hang-out spaces. If you were serious about caring about Ontarians and Torontonians, you wouldn't be limiting our mobility to cars, but expanding it to bikes, scooters, walking, public transit and anything else out there. It's not about limiting cars, that comes as a byproduct of giving pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders their space and priority. When you have privilige, equality feels a lot like oppression.\nAs an engineer and social safety advocate, this bill makes no sense, it feels like a government-controlling attempt at destroying our quality of life. This bill reads as a political move rather than a well-thought-out, well-structured, well-meaning, and sensible bill. Engineers, economists, TRAFFIC ENGINEERS, and a plethora of professionals disagree with this bill. Climate change disagrees with this bill. All the families of people who have lost their lives to a car accident disagree with this bill. This call for change is not about bikes or bike lanes, this is about enjoying our communities and bringing back common sense and science to our government.\nI plead, ask and demand that this bill is dropped completely and we let each jurisdiction in our province decide what makes their streets better. I unfortunately don't think this will happen, and the misinformation that have led the automobile-centric policy of Toronto and Ontario will persist, but I still hang onto a sliver of hope that the province will make the right decision, for my future kids, my friends, my family and all my neighbours and co-citizens.\nSafe streets save lives, it's just common sense.\n"
