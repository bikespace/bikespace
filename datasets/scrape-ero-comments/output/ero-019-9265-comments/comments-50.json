In a few years when car usage increases because of the new highway (which is almost 100% guaranteed based on data, I know the Conservative hate data, from around the world) there will be no timed. Instead habitat will be destroyed and money wasted for no reason. Look at improving intercity connectivity through transit and you will actually see a decline in traffic. Look at Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan etc. All these places have more people that Toronto has but better systems that do not include more highways that move people around effectively. Stop thinking about which developers will give you millions when you get booted from the government and think about the future of ON. Take one trip to Tokyo/Japan and tell me cars are the best option.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nI am writing to you as a concerned constituent, regarding the proposed Bill-212 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act 2024.\nAs both a cyclist and a driver, I am greatly opposed to this bill. Not only will it be ineffective, it will inevitably result in a loss of human life when cyclists get hit by cars.\nClosing bike lanes won't reduce gridlock or save you time. Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\n\u2022\tBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\n\u2022\tBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\n\u2022\tBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\n\u2022\tReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nI urge you to revoke your support for Bill-212.\n"

I\u2019d like Ford\u2019s government to look into removing the bike lanes on Broadview and Cosburn.\nI can never park my car without other drivers honking at me. It takes around ten minutes to get the car out of the driveway and in.\nJust imagine having to park at the 5:00 pm rush.\nNobody has the patience or time for this. Better to keep the city the way it was. It took a ridiculous amount of tax payers money to put those lanes in and I know it will cost a fortune to take out but I rather the latter if it will mean a more peaceful commute.

Into the bicycle lanes that are not used during the season? All this while drivers are limited to single lanes?\n"

        "comment": "It is sad to watch the government deliberately misuse the word gridlock to remove bike lanes.   Gridlock starts when a car enters an intersection, and can not clear it before the light changes colour.   This prevents cars from moving when they have a green light.   Worse, if this happens at multiple intersections, it can take a long time to resolve.   It happens because of the greed and short sightedness of drivers.\nIf the government is blaming gridlock on bike, they are being misleading and deceptive.\nIf the Ford government wanted to improve travel times on major streets, they  should encourage municipalities to remove parking, and crack down on illegal parking/stopping by couriers and delivery people.\nHighway 413 will not be a long term solution to traffic.   It will be a very costly way to build more suburbs, where people will be more reliant on cars.   The environmental damage will be tremendous.   We would be better off building transit, and building communities around transit.\n"

        "comment": "This is not Europe! We need vehicles in this country especially to commute back and forth to work or to the subway. The fact that the government has decided to put bike lanes on major arteries is absolutely ludicrous to begin with. The government complains about pollution yet doesn't see that reducing travel for vehicular traffic does just that. It causes pollution and also frustration to drivers. Not to mention the frustrations that will come to those that deliver goods to businesses and homes, emergency vehicles and police vehicles and what about public transit? No one likes to be stuck behind a bus now but at least we have an alternative - we can move over to the next lane to pass the bus. What do we do when there is no lane we can move over to? I guess we'll all use the centre lane which will cause chaos. The centre lane will not only function as a \"turn\" lane but it will act as a passing lane as well. Big Mistake for sure.\nPLEASE, LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE. DON'T REDUCE LANES FOR BIKE LANES. BIKES DO NOT FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD AND THEY ARE ONLY SEASONAL. CARS ARE LICENSED, INSURED ABIDE BY THE RULES AND USE THE ROADS 24/7/365.\n"

Considering that cars and buses are the reality of most residents in Ontario it's important to keep improving on infrastructure for the developing cities.  With the housing crisis and the promise of additional affordable housing and the expansion of the LTR it is important that we keep the focus on roads and the efficient movement of traffic to help the majority of residents.\nThere is definitely a place for bike lanes, however taking away existing roads is not the answer. With our climate and our spread out communities a very small percentage of residents use bikes as their daily mode of transportation.  It is important to keep the focus on common sense strategies and build roads and infrastructure that help the majority of residents that use cars and buses as their primary source of transportation!\n"

NFU-O policy calls on all levels of government to enact and follow transparent, rational planning guidelines, regulations, and bylaws to ensure fairness to all citizens, to protect farmland and ecologically sensitive areas from development, and to prevent the further privatization of public lands.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of the Greenbelt and another 2,000+ acres of Class 1 and Class 2 farmland \u2013 some of Ontario\u2019s most productive agricultural land \u2013 but the farmland loss won\u2019t stop there as the highway will only accelerate urban sprawl until much of the remaining prime agricultural land farmers require to feed Ontarians is encased in cement and covered in asphalt. Choosing highways over farmland is a grave mistake.\nThe Government has yet to provide any independently verified data to prove that the Highway 413 project will achieve the Acts goals of actually reducing gridlock or saving commuters\u2019 time. Instead, the research suggests that the highway will save less than one minute of commuting time on average and will have the effect of increasing overall vehicle traffic within the GGH.\nThe NFU-O urges the provincial government to revoke these Acts before it is too late. Instead of spending a minimum of $10 billion on an unnecessary highway that will vastly increase our CO\u2082 emissions at a time when we must play our part in reaching net zero emissions, we call on the government to do the right thing and instead make better use of the existing Highway 407 to alleviate current gridlock and to reallocate taxpayers\u2019 money destined for Highway 413 to support a public transit-orientated GGH.\nThe NFU-O strongly objects to the measures in these Acts that exempt Highway 413 early works projects from any environmental impact assessment (EA) under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA). All three of these early work projects (ramp embankment near the existing Exit 330 on the westbound Highway 401, a bridge near Highway 10 in Peel Region, and a bridge near Bovaird Drive West in Peel region) are on or directly adjacent to arable farmland and/or sensitive natural heritage; the environmental impacts of these early work projects are unknown. Fast-tracking these early works projects by eliminating any EA deliberately avoids an assessment of the cumulative impact of the entire Highway 413 project and will make it much more difficult to change course and offer sustainable solutions to traffic gridlock in the GGH.\nSimilarly, creating an \u201caccelerated EA process\u201d that exempts all activities by or on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) that are for or related to Highway 413 from the EAA is giving the MTO license to irrevocably destroy farmland and our natural environment without any legally-binding assessment, public consultation, or real analysis of alternatives. The environmental impact assessment report process that will replace the EAA has no legal teeth and offers no requirement that the Government take into account objections from Indigenous communities, environmental and agricultural organizations, or the broader public that show evidence of the negative environmental impacts of the Highway 413 project. These Acts pave over the democratic processes of the EAA.\nThe NFU-O is of the opinion that any Highway 413 proposal should require a legally-binding comprehensive environmental assessment under the EAA wherein the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks must review all documents, require the approval of the Minister and Cabinet to proceed, and allow for public requests for more extensive review or public consultation. Public consultation should include full public access to all the key documents related to Highway 413, consultation events where the public can provide feedback, and the opportunity to submit written comments directly to the Ministry about their concerns. Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act disallow these most basic processes to ensure our natural environment is protected.\nThe decision to exempt Part II of the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 that allows for an amendment or revocation of an instrument for or related to the Highway 413 project is nothing less than a wholesale denial of the right of all Ontarians to ensure that their government upholds \u201cas a common goal the protection, conservation and restoration of the natural environment for the benefit of present and future generations.\u201d\nFinally, the NFU-O objects to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act empowering the government to expropriate land for the purpose of the Highway 413 project. We also protest the Act\u2019s weak Indigenous consultation plan wherein there is no real ability for Indigenous communities to exercise their land or treaty rights to stop or significantly alter the project, beyond minor alterations in the course of the highway.\nIf built, Highway 413 will be an irrevocable and costly mistake that will forever be seen as a betrayal of the public\u2019s environmental rights, a huge step away from a green and just transition in the face of climate change, and the beginning of the end of farming and environmental protection within the Greater Golden Horseshoe. It\u2019s not too late to prioritize the protection of our finite farmland and dwindling natural heritage and pursue sustainable public transit networks over a highway destined to endanger the quality of life for all in its vicinity\nSincerely,\nMax Hansgen\nPresident, National Farmers Union - Ontario\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes does not benefit anybody in the city of Toronto.\nFor drivers:\n- Bike lanes allow for cyclists to not rely on main lanes, allowing drivers to move more quickly across roads. If bike lanes were removed, cyclists would continue to ride their bikes, but have to rely on the same lanes as cars, slowing down traffic.\nFor cyclists:\n- Bike lanes protect cyclists from often fatal collisions with cars.\nFor store owners on Bloor:\n- I often have trouble finding space to lock my bike up at the bike stands. Bike lanes instead of cars allow for more people to park in front of stores via bike than could possibly park with cars (maybe 1.5 cars per store versus 4 bike lock spots in front of each shop).\nThe unprotected areas of the Bloor Street bike lanes already feel unsafe as cars pull into the bike lanes. When cars pull into the bike lanes, cyclists have no choice but to enter the main road. The problem here is that when there are bike lanes (that are inaccessible), drivers do not expect cyclists to be on the road and thus it is drastically more unsafe for cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "I am wholeheartedly disappointed in our Province for proposing such a dangerous bill that compromises the safety of its citizens by removing bike lanes and using this as a ruse to hide the fact that this bill permits the Province to to take lands from registered owners in order to \"expedite building highways\".  The Province should not be granted such power that they can infringe on property owners without permission and public discussion.  This Province continues to disregard provided facts and statistical data from the transportation and traffic experts that bike lanes do not contribute to congestion but primarily provincial infrastructure construction (eg: Metrolinx construction, utility upgrades).  Furthermore, it has been historically proven that the solution to congestion in major cities around the world is not to build more highways, that only contributes to creating more traffic and congestion.  Removing bike lanes will not stop cyclists from biking, but doing this will force them into sharing the road with ill-informed and aggressive drivers putting them at high risk to be killed. It also does not help that when collisions happen between a car and a cyclist, the general car-centric attitude of our provincial government is to side with drivers.  As both a cyclist and a driver in Toronto I agree that congestion is a huge problem that needs to be addressed and people understand that traffic is expected in order to complete critical projects for infrastructure development (ie: public transit, utility maintenance, etc.), but Bill 212 is absolutely not the way to go about this.  People do not have a problem with the Province trying find solutions to create better living conditions but they do have a problem with a corrupt government that puts its own needs and benefits above its citizens in pursuit of profits.\n"

        "comment": "Introduction\nThe comments set out below stem not only from my views on such matters, but also from over 30 years professional experience working on the planning and design of transportation systems (of all types) for towns and cities. This experience gives me huge insight into the need to holistically consider all forms of transportation, and their interactions with land use, the built form of the city and economic development. It is imperative that transportation analysis and development considers the merits of ALL forms of transportation and how each is best placed to contribute in each circumstance. There should not be a sole focus on a single form of transportation to the detriment of all else. And to be clear, this is reflected in my personal life where I walk, cycle, drive or take transit depending on the trip being made. Better decisions are made when one has personal experience of all the possible options.\nSchedule 3 \u2013 Highway 413 Act \u2013 Exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\nI am opposed to Schedule 3 of the Bill. The Environmental Assessment Act is there to ensure a robust, transparent and credible analysis of all the environmental impacts of major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed Highway 413. Given the contentious nature of Highway 413, it is imperative to set out the environmental impacts fully, alongside the broader case for the project. To simply pick and choose what projects the Act applies to is wrong.\nOf course, this exemption is for a project that itself should not be built. Aside from the obvious adverse environmental impacts, in the long term it will do little to alleviate congestion. Empirical evidence over decades has shown that induced demand, that well known phenomenon whereby traffic in urban and suburban areas simply expands to fill the available space, will return congestion to the same level. Even the MTO\u2019s own modelling is showing this (see https://www.thetrillium.ca/news/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026). Experts at the Bill\u2019s public committee hearing on Monday September 18, 2024 were of this view. Overall, Highway 413 simply locks us further into the failed 1950s car dependent planning paradigm.\nSchedule 4 \u2013 Highway Traffic Act Part XII Municipal By-Laws and Bicycle Lanes\nI am opposed to Schedule 4 of the Bill.\nFirstly, it is egregious overreach and anti-democratic for the Provincial Government to interfere in matters best left to local municipalities. The local municipalities are best placed to consider the needs and interests of the local populace for local matters such as bicycle lanes. They will take a holistic view of all the competing demands for road space, alongside wider policy objectives around safety, improving transportation options (not just cars), equity, business impacts and environmental considerations (from micro to macro). Of note, bicycle lanes are often an integral part of complete streets that aim to recognize and accommodate the needs of all users of public space, not just those in cars. In short, bicycle lanes should be a matter for local municipalities ONLY.\nSecondly, the proposal to waste taxpayers money to REMOVE existing bicycle lanes in the City of Toronto (on Bloor, Yonge and University) is counter to all contemporary thinking around city building and placemaking. Not a single credible organization has supported this proposal, with the Ontario Traffic Council, the Ontario Professional Planning Institute, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Bloor Annex BIA, and 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto against this proposal. To date, the Province has provided no data or evidence to support it\u2019s assertion that these bicycle lanes are materially impacting motor vehicle congestion; only anecdotal and misleading evidence has been provided. To state that only 1.2 % of people commute by bicycle and 70% by car as justification is disingenuous and frankly fraudulent when these numbers relate to the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), an area that stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe and includes places like Richmond Hill, Oakville and Vaughan. When considering the case for bike lanes, a much more focused area or corridor analysis is the appropriate level for data analysis and these show much higher levels of bicycle usage on these corridors with the bike lanes. Even if the bike lanes are removed, most of these corridors will have some level of parking, such that there will still only be 2 lanes for traffic for most of the time, thus achieving no material benefit. And any material benefit will quickly be nullified by induced traffic, that will known phenomenon whereby traffic simply expands to fill the available space, thus returning congestion to the same level. In short, the proposal to remove these bicycle lanes is simply not supported by policy or evidence and they should be left in place.\n"
