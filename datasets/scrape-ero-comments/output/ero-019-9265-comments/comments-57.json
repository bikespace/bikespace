        "comment": "There is substantial, well grounded opposition to the construction of Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass. They will damage sensitive ecological lands that provide critical ecosystem services. Further, there is strong evidence that new highway construction does not reduced congestion, because of the well-attested phenomenon of induced demand. The current legislature's continued prioritization of these projects, including through the proposed legislation which would reduce oversight and process, is not in the overall interest of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is incredibly backwards, especially given this climate crisis and clear data that adding lanes for cars and removing bike lanes is anti-reducing gridlock.\nReducing cycling lanes will not only lead to the reduced physical safety of many road users, it will also result in increased congestion and gridlock. Induced demand, which means travellers from other routes, modes, and times, will use up that additional capacity and the system will return to equilibrium and the same level of service as before. There is simply not enough physical space to have enough lanes for everyone to sit in a 5 x 2 m steel box (aka car), the math doesn't add up. The only way to reduce congestion is to have better transportation demand management, which means getting some portion of people to use transit, bikes, and walk... so that way only the people that need to drive are driving.\nIf you actually want to reduce gridlock, provide users with alternatives: add more bike lanes, add more frequent and reliable transit, and enhance the pedestrian realm. This will not only reduce congestion, it will also enable healthier citizens and more sustainable communities.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"

And no evidence has been provided to support the case that cycling facilities are a significant cause of congestion and that removing them will increase car travel.\nWe are a growing City, and the only way to manage congestion is to provide effective alternatives to driving.  Thriving cities around the world from Montreal to New York to Paris to Vienna (and many more) are expanding their cycling infrastructure and seeing excellent results with respect to congestion, livability, economic activity and many other key indicators.\nWhy is this government so committed to doing the opposite of what is widely known to be best practice?\nIf the government is committed to moving through with this legislation and removing cycling infrastructure, I would strongly encourage the government to limit the removal to the Etobicoke section of Bloor Street.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is not suited for adoption. Its stated goals of reducing gridlock and saving travel time are the opposite of the effects it will cause. Adding more roads (including highways) and preventing the removal of motor vehicle road space for bicycles will both increase gridlock. This isn't an opinion, it's the proven result of these activities around the world over the last century. The proposal will only further dig Ontario deeper into the hole that is car-dependency and increase the cost and time for us to get out of it. If we want Ontario to be a place that is enjoyable for humans to live and thus continuing to attract businesses and skilled immigrants, we need to refocus all efforts on every alternatives to personal vehicle driving. Between the health and environmental effects of cars directly (pollutants and noise, not to mention collisions) and indirectly through mining and car-dependency, reduction and pollution of agricultural lands, there is no reason to make the problems worse, as in this proposal. The exemptions proposed to reduce environmental assessment is a perfect example of why the assessment process exists in the first place: to prevent dangerous ideas like these. Not to mention the disrespect for property owners in limiting their ability to face the threat of expropriation.\nIf that all sounds abstract and impersonal, how about this: my life, the life of my child, other family members, friends, and many others across the province will literally be in greater danger every single day due to the reduced safety from loss of current and proposed safe cycling infrastructure; infrastructure that is only necessary as a result of our car-dependency and prioritization, i.e. what this proposal aims to further entrench.\nThis proposal takes us backwards, while other regions are moving forward.\n"

I strongly urge you to preserve the Midtown Yonge Complete Street as it currently exists.\nAs someone who regularly uses the Yonge Street bike lanes to commute to work, I can attest to their importance for ensuring my safety on the road. Without these bike lanes, I would be forced to share the road with high volumes of vehicle traffic, significantly increasing the risk of being involved in an accident.\nThe Midtown Yonge Complete Street has never been solely about bike lanes. It represents a comprehensive effort to create safer, calmer, and more accessible streets for everyone, regardless of their mode of transportation. The Complete Street promotes walkability, supports local businesses by increasing foot traffic, and enhances the vibrancy of the area with parkettes and streetside cafes.\nRemoving these bike lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also result in increased vehicle congestion and harmful emissions. It would erode the progress made toward creating a safer and more inclusive community space.\nIn February 2023, Toronto City Council made a clear and democratic decision to make the Midtown Yonge Complete Street permanent. This decision followed extensive public consultation and reflects the needs and desires of the community. To see this effort undone without proper consultation would undermine local democracy and disregard the voices of those who call this area home.\nI ask you to stand with residents like myself who depend on the bike lanes for safe and sustainable transportation. Please reject the amendment to Bill 212 and preserve the Midtown Yonge Complete Street in its entirety.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this matter.\n"

It is all too easy to focus jealousy, even anger on them. However, when I began to think about the issues supposedly addressed in this \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\u201d, I realized that it is more political dog-whistle than good traffic management.\nIncreased Toronto traffic congestion accompanied installation of many separated and protected bike lanes in Toronto, but it coincided with a dramatic uptick in vehicle traffic after the covid epidemic.  Those who conclude that the bike lanes caused congestion are discounting this overwhelming post-covid effect.\nI have come to oppose Bill 212 because -\nRemoval of separated and protected bike lanes and failure to install necessary new ones will increase accidents involving cyclists, with consequent death and injury. Cities with robust cycling facilities are proven to be safer for motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians1.\nThe above injuries will increase health care costs and place further pressure on a medical system that is already under huge stress. Cyclists cause less wear-and tear on road systems, with reduced costs. Has anybody assessed the economic costs of negate most of the benefits to motor vehicle drivers. In contrast, traffic congestion was actually ameliorated by installing bike lanes in New York2.\nThe legislation will discourage cycle use in favour of motor vehicle use, with consequent increases in carbon and other emissions\nDiscouraging cycling will result in more car use, and more pressure on parking spots in downtown areas2.\nThe legislation will waste public funds in the unnecessary removal of bike lanes in Toronto, costing taxpayers at least $48million PLUS the loss of $27m of public money for the original installation3.\nThe legislation discriminates against people too poor or too young to operate a car, who are obliged to cycle.\nThe legislation ignores the increasing popularity of cycling infrastructure. The installed facilities in Toronto increased the number of bike trips from 0.6m in 2017 to 4.7m in 2024 (by Sep. 12)4.\nLast, and crucially:\nI want to see more local autonomy. The bill takes away powers of the municipalities and vests them with politicians in the provincial government at Queens Park, furthering the centralization of power there. Bill 212 places arbitrary authority in the hands of a minister, permits retroactive decisions and subjects the rest of our Province to the supposed congestion-cure for Metro Toronto. It ties more red tape round an already complicated system.\nAs a cyclist (Yes, many cyclists are also car drivers!), I use roads with separated and protected bike lanes daily. On very busy streets that lack cycling facilities, I tend to use sidewalks. Yes, that is illegal, but I do it to avoid being injured or killed. This legislation terrifies me!\nWesley E.

Given how many people are interested in cycling, proving access on major roads like Toronto takes more vehicles off the road (as people opt to cycle instead), allows more users per timeframe (bikes less space than cars), reduces maintenance costs (bikes less damaging to roads), and improves city life (people more likely to go to shops/ spend money in city along roadway).

As proposed, it will do little to reduce gridlock, while causing significant damage to the environment, municipal relations, affordable housing and Ontario's reputation as a place to grow (healthily).\nThis Highway 413 has been part of a highway package proposal that has been under consideration for over a decade. The time-frame is not excessive given it reflects the significance of its potential impact both positively and negatively. To accelerate building  such a Highway by pretending these impacts don't exist, risks far wider ramifications to our province than just the building of this Highway 413. I quote from the proposed Bill 212, \"it would also enable other highway projects to be designated in the future\", \"over-ride most municipal bylaws\", \"would create offence and penalty provisions\", \"compel provision of information\", \"block FOI requests\" and \"withhold critical sensitive study reports\". This  Bill is not about approving one highway but approving an over-ride of municipal, corporate and individual rights, especially environmental rights, which is where this ERO comes into play.\nBalanced development is critical to Ontario's growth but that balance must be of risk versus gain and in this case the environmental risk alone outweighs any community gain as shown by independent studies (between thirty seconds and two minutes saved daily by commuters). You'll notice I didn't include developer gain as this Bill seems clearly aimed at maximizing their gain regardless of environmental cost.\nThe balance when considering this Bill 212 clearly requires continuing to prioritize the environment not only for the future but to ensure we have a future. Please reject these changes to environmental protections.\n"

Highway 413 is currently estimated to cost $4 billion, and that's a minimum, which money that would be far better spent on public transportation projects. And all of this would be exacerbated by the urban sprawl that this highway would encourage, engendering a vicious cycle of car dependency which begets more highways, more expansion, more gridlock etc.\nThis is not even mentioning the farmland that would get bulldozed over as a result of construction. Ontario farmland is some of the most productive in Canada, and we can expect to see large increases in the price of produce if this highly arable land were to stop growing food.\nIt's not to late to turn back. We can end our car dependency, and reduce traffic simply by investing the the transit systems we already have.\n"
