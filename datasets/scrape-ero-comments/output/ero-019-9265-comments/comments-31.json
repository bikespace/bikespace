        "comment": "I find this legislation unacceptable on many levels.\nFirst of all, bike lanes are a statistically proven way to reduce congestion in an urban environment. Bicycles take up far less space than single occupant motor-vehicle transport. Bike lanes also allow more efficient use of much more expensive public transportation like trains and buses.\nSecondly, municipalities already engage in a lengthy design and regulation process for implementing bike lanes. These are not processes that are done without thought. Adding provincial level micro-managing of infrastructure at the municipal level adds needless government spending.\nIf the provincial government focused on increasing population density in urban cities, by working toward legislation that allowed developers and families to more easily create multi-unit dwellings, we would be less reliant on expensive modes of transport like highways, and motor-vehicles. In dense urban environments where people live close to where they work, bike lanes are far more practical. People should not default to driving incredibly short distances to work; however, this is often done out of a lack of safe infrastructure available.\nFinally, Highway 413 legislature should not be hidden behind a \"click-bait esque\" hate towards bicycle infrastructure. Removing environmental protections, and streamlining construction of incredibly environmentally damaging motor-vehicle infrastructure, should not be in the same bill as hindering an environmentally beneficial infrastructure (like bike lanes).\nNeedless to say, if this continues, I will not be supporting the Ford government in the coming election.\n"

        "comment": "Removing installed bike lanes from city streets is an incredible waste of resources, an overreach of provincial jurisdiction, and a terrible idea for improving commute times. Bike lanes enable safe and active transportation for many road users in the city of Toronto. Biking is nearly always the fastest way to get around the city. Bike lanes ensure that these commutes are as safe as possible. Bike lanes help to reduce emissions by encouraging those who might otherwise drive to take a more climate friendly option.\nRemoving bike lanes is an exceptionally cynical policy choice. I urge the government to reconsider this bill.\n"

We have future generations to consider and we cannot put short term popularity or saving a few minutes in traffic above the needs of future humans and species. As adults, we have an obligation to care for the land that we are temporarily on. Build green modes of transportation such as high speed electric rail, bike lanes, put in bus lanes, toll highways and invest those funds in public parks, affordable housing (in the form apartments and increased efficient density). Stop urban sprawl and build in the towns already on train lines from hundreds of years ago that were sold to private rail companies.\n"

People can't get a doctor and the government is wasting money on removing bike lanes that reduce congestion and building highways to nowhere that nobody wants. The reason the bill need to override basic rules and due diligence is because the projects are not supported by facts or reason and cannot meet basic requirements that every other government has been able to follow when they build projects.\n"

        "comment": "Can we not have one single place in this province that is not congested with cars. We live here, work here, elect local representatives here and want the bike lanes here. Yes, municipalities are a product of the province, but does that mean you should go against what the people who live here want. Bike lanes are on less then 1 percent of the roads, they are not the cause of any of traffic, the other 99% filled with cars are. Also some of these lanes were put in because people kept dying there. Will the premier or minister be contact their families to tell that they don't care that their loved one died. They will reverse the improvements and more people will die as a result. But the government might get a few extra votes suburban ridings far away from the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is ridiculous. Toronto\u2019s bike share program is only increasing in popularity and removing key bike lanes in the city will only cause more accidents and deaths. Cost of living in the city is so high that bikes are truly one of the best transportation options for so many people. Not to mention the fact that the previous removal of bike lanes on jarvis st to \u201creduce traffic\u201d only increased congestion. It is astonishing to me that we would use tax dollars to REMOVE infrastructure that is already built, being used, and is extremely beneficial to those who use it. In addition, the bike lanes protect other pedestrians from accidents with electric bikes (which are only rising in popularity), so I implore you all to think about the thousands of people who NEED these bike lanes and what an astonishing waste of money removing these lanes would be.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove the University, Bloor, and Yonge bike lanes that downtown Toronto has invested so much and worked so hard to install recently. I use those bike lanes daily and we should support cycling infrastructure especially in the downtown areas. In the downtown core, bike lanes work to reduce traffic, since cycles are a substitute for cars. There is a big difference between the downtown core and the rest of Toronto.\nIn the downtown core, cycling is the preferred means of transport as it is a high density area. It encourages physical activity, is way faster for getting around, is generally more pleasurable and drastically reduces traffic and makes the entire city core more pedestrian friendly, all the while reducing greenhouse emissions and noise pollution. It is such an obvious decision to support cycling infrastructure in the downtown core since most trips are of such short distances.\nThe statistic that \"only 1.2% of Torontonians commute by bike\" has been completely debunked and is misleading. Please refer to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScwcEVzmCU4&t. That statistic comes from a survey done more than a decade ago when we did not have good biking infrastructure and includes people living in the suburbs, away from the downtown core - where obviously cycling is a lot less popular. As I said, there is a big difference between the downtown core and the rest of Toronto.\nInstead, when concentrating on the downtown core, a more accurate figure would be one-third of people in the downtown core use bikes regularly, whether for pleasure, or for commuting, and this figure keeps growing every year. With the Toronto bike share program growing exponentially in popularity, having good bike lanes is an obvious complement for the city. The people in the downtown core have shown immense interest in using cycles for transportation along with public transit and we should do our best to support that and remove car dependency.\nIf we continue to support biking in the city center, more and more people will switch to using cycles as their regular means of transport. Build it and they will come. This is already a growing trend, and if we continue to support it, we can likely reach more than 50% of people cycling in the near future. We should strive for that and reduce our reliance on cars -- especially in the downtown core.\n"
