This will only further cause congestion and cause more gridlock. You need less cars to reduce congestion not more lanes. Please don't make my commute worse, I already hate driving through those streets so don't make them worse.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike lanes on behalf of more car lanes will NOT ease the congestion. However, since the capacity of a single bike lane outcompetes that of a single car lane, the bike lanes have the potential to relieve congestion by effectively reducing the number of cars.\nToronto is seeing a small cycling population due to a very limited cycling infrastructure. Measuring the effectiveness of bicycle lanes when the city has a few disconnected bicycle lanes is a totally unreasonable approach. For cycling to be an attractive alternative to driving, a continuous addition of safer bicycle lanes and a cohesive cycling network is required.\nThe effectiveness of bicycle lanes in easing traffic congestion can be seen in New York City. The city has been implementing bicycle lanes for nearly two decades. According to their report, the addition of the bicycle lanes reduced the vehicle travel time, desmonstrating the positive effects of the bicycle lanes on the traffic management. In addition, the bicycle lanes resulted in a decreased numer of pedestrian/cyclist crashes with injury.\nHence, a wider implementation of the bicycle lanes throughout our cities will ease the traffic congestion and increase pedestrian and cyclist safety.\n"

        "comment": "I'm incredibly disappointed in the decision taken by this bill to invest in demonstrably backwards approaches to transportation.\nEvidence shows that the only viable solution for grid lock is an investment in public mass transit. Providing more options gives everyone a better transit experience - including drivers, who would benefit from less congestion on roads.\nBike lanes are also a vital option for getting around the city. Removing the main arteries for cyclists won't help drivers and will harm those of us who cannot afford to own cars.\nThis bill is a travesty, I hope you will reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "This bill appears to be government meddling in what should be a municipal matter. Not only that, it goes against the current predominant research on urban planning and city infrastructure, which indicates that investing in public transit and non-car transportation infrastructure is a more effective and cost effective means of city growth. Why does this government ignore this information and insist on micromanaging municipal decisions?  The creation of yet more red tape for building infrastructure is at odds with the supposed restrained hand ideology of a conservative government.\nRemoving bike lanes only reduces the options a person has for transportation. It is unsafe for drivers and cyclists to be forced into sharing the same space, and the presence of cyclists on a street can add to the already clogged nature of traffic. As both a driver and a cyclist I would like to see more infrastructure that enables people more options and safety in terms of the transportation they can use, but this bill aims to enable the opposite.\nThis kind of legislation seems personal to the premier and that is unbecoming of the entire party. The infrastructure is already there, what a waste of time and resources to now remove it. Bill 212 appears to be nothing more than more than another symptom of Doug Ford's hyper fixation on Toronto, something that seems to come before the rest of the province which is currently watching the healthcare system buckle. The priorities of this administration are shamefully abysmal.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 as proposed to Reduce Gridlock, Saving You Time, Building Highways Faster- fails to commit to critical environmental protection to natural habitat, species at risk, migratory birds and prime agricultural land in the GreenBelt. Specifically,  MTO's own assessment identified 11 species at risk along the planned route for the 413 Highway.  Bill 212 says goodbye to the Butternut tree, western chorus frog, resided dace, rapids club tail,  bobolink, chimney swift, barn swallow, wood thrush, eastern meadowlark, olive-sided flycatcher.It is not logical to \"expedite\" building bridges and pavement for projects that will take years to complete and will minimally relieve current gridlock in the GTA. Bill 212 seems to be a knee-jerk reaction by  the  Government of Ontario leaders  being overwhelmed by current traffic management  in the GTA- density being complicated by  many major construction projects in downtown Toronto.These projects will be completed. It has been suggested that paying truck tolls now for travel on the 407 highway will relieve current congestion. This proposed bill only inflates property values for select developers, not building more affordable housing communities.\nBill 212 also removes  legal  rights of landowners facing expropriation for government priorized projects.It removes rights of citizens objecting to these  questionable expedited projects and effectively squashes the protective mandates  of the Conservation agencies like the TRCA whose lands will be compromised by the projects.\nUnfortunately, the taxpayers will pay the costs  and the environment will pay the cost with less ability to store carbon and mitigate flooding as we face increasing hazards from climate change. Bill 212 is ill-considered and harmful.\n"

        "comment": "Please please PLEASE do not remove the bike lanes that are already installed. It is a tremendous waste of money, and any traffic expert you ask will tell you that traffic expands like a gas, the more room you give cars, the more space they take up. The bike lanes are NECESSARY for people like me who can't afford a car and can honestly barely afford their life downtown. Biking on city streets with cars is so dangerous for cyclists, I have had so many near misses where cars have almost severely hurt me. This is a safety and a rights issue - cars and bikes need to share the city. Don't take out the bike lanes on bloor or university or yonge until bike lanes are built on side streets. Please, for the love or Pete.\n"

I do not think that the provincial government and the ministry should override municipal by-laws, particularly without public approval or consultation. I worry that this will wreak havoc on existing municipal planning processes and not in fact solve the issues of traffic congestion.\nI am most concerned about the possibility of the provincial government using this bill to remove bike lanes in municipalities where they have no business meddling in local affairs. Every bike on the road means one less car, and cycling infrastructure is an important part of future planning, lessening carbon emissions, and is a deeply affordable way for people to travel during an otherwise crushing affordability crisis.\nMany studies show that bike lanes reduce traffic, they have lower emissions and they support local businesses, look at any thriving contemporary city and you will see a network of cycling infrastructure that encourages a diversity of modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "This comment is in regards to the attempt to expedite the process to build highway 413 and for the unwarranted removal of City of Toronto bike lanes.\nFor highway 413:\n- Southern Ontario does not need another highway! In what would cost us, the taxpayer, billions of dollars, save virtually no time in people, and potentially charge the taxpayer for using their own funded highway - ridiculous\n- building this highway will destroy important ecosystems and at a time when our environment is already in jeopardy\n- WE ALREADY HAVE TWO EAST/WEST HIGHWAYS! Southern Ontario is already home to the 401 and the 407. If the conservative government didn't sell off the 407 in the 90s then we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. If the 407 was just bought back or if the money for building this unnecessary highway was used to pay the tolls for drivers or if trucks were allowed to only use the 407, then we would have far more available space.\n- Doug Ford and his Cabinet want this highway to be built to pad the pockets of friends and for no other reason - we're not stupid so stop acting like we are\nFor removing Toronto bike lanes:\n- Tax payers have paid for bike lanes which are already in place, removing these will cost EVEN MORE tax payer dollars which could be used for better things, like being put toward health care and public transportation!\n- Removing bike lanes will not free up space for drivers, instead it would make roads far, far more dangerous as bikers will continue to bike AND be far more likely to be hit by a car! The safety of Toronto residents is at stake. This will also send more people to hospitals, which the Doug government is also underfunding.\n- Removing bike lanes will not lessen commute times of drivers nor will it free up much space on roads to make spending all of that taxpayer money worth while.\nThe best option in reducing gridlock and saving commuters time is through investing in public transport and not another highway OR the removal of bike lanes. STOP BEING RIDICULOUS AND START DOING WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT THE CITIZENS OF ONTARIO ACTUALLY NEED!\n"

        "comment": "This misguided legislation will not only waste public resources removing well-functioning infrastructure and put cyclists' lives in danger, it will only exacerbate the problem it intends to solve - reducing congestion.\nTens of millions of bike trips occur in Toronto every year; if even a portion of those cyclists were to drive instead, even if an extra lane of traffic were introduced, the space requirements for those vehicles will be greater. Bike lanes are simply efficient in moving people because bikes take up so much less space.\nThose drafting this act will find themselves in even worse traffic, surrounded by even more cars the city can't accommodate.\nAdd to that the increased frequency of disruptions caused by emergency response situations where cyclists, robbed of a safe commute, are injured or killed by being struck by vehicles.\nMoreover, this act will harm local businesses. Each business association that has commented on the proposed removal of bike lanes has expressed dismay, as evidence shows cyclists are more likely to drop in and spend more.\nRaising an additional concern; both the City of Toronto and the Government of Ontario have quantifiable evidence of a reduction in cyclists being struck by vehicles following the installation of bike lanes. Typically, government policy is exempt from legal liability. However, this act is so offside evidence that Ontario is very exposed to a class action lawsuit for willful negligence.\nFor the sake of business, moving people efficiently, and safety, I implore the government to retract this deeply flawed act.\n"

Expediting large-scale projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass risks irreversible harm to ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and local farmland.

Fast-tracking these developments without thorough environmental reviews raises serious concerns about long-term environmental damage. The government must prioritize sustainable development, ensuring that short-term economic gains don\u2019t come at the expense of Ontario's natural heritage and community health.\n"
