Safe cycling infrastructure is vital to Toronto and bike lanes should not be removed both for the safety of people as primary reason and secondarily the cost of such unnecessary removal in terms of lives and finances.

        "comment": "Due process, including environmental assessments, exists for a reason. Not even the government is exempt from following due process. Skipping important steps to give the appearance of urgency for building a new highway, after years of neglecting existing infrastructure like the crumbling Gardiner, is shoddy workmanship at best.\nFurther, building new highways to accommodate more traffic is like putting out more buckets to fix a leaky roof. Neither actually addresses the root cause. In fact, more lanes and more highways consistently lead to *more* traffic and more congestion, rather than easing it. Similarly, requiring the removal of cycling lanes also will not fix traffic congestion - it will probably also make it worse.\nAlbert Einstein said that we can\u2019t solve our problems with the same kind of thinking that created them. We need new solutions, not more of the same.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 40 year resident of Scarborough Ontario who regularly cycles to my job downtown in the City of Toronto. My wife over the past 4 years has had jobs in the downtown area and in the middle of Scarborough, and she cycles every day to work.\nThe bike lanes save my family between $5,000 and $8,000 every single year because we no longer own a truck. I owned a 2003 Honda Pilot, a large 8 seat SUV, but only drove to work when I broke my leg in the middle of winter.  The added stress on the vehicle caused by driving every day downtown and back to Scarborough led to one of the highest maintenance bills over the last ten years, and I believe significantly contributed to the vehicles decline. I broke my leg in 2018, before the pandemic and before bike lanes on Bloor Street East or Danforth Avenue.\nAt the start of the pandemic, before the bike lanes on Danforth Avenue were installed, I was forced to cycle with my wife each morning to the downtown where she worked and then race back to our home to start my day. Even with the reduced volume of cars, cycling in the morning without protected cycling infrastructure was dangerous. I continued to cycle with her after the protected bike lanes were installed to Dawes Road, both for the increased safety in numbers and because we enjoyed the morning commute.  She, a small Asian woman, continued to cycle all winter long. I previously would never cycle to my office from Scarborough during the winter because it was too dangerous to do without the protected bike lanes.  In order to ride safely with the rest of the traffic on an unprotected street, I need to maintain a high rate of speed. If I cannot maintain the high rate of speed, then I risk being hit from behind or sideswiped by a distracted driver. In the winter, maintaining a high rate of speed is dangerous because if I hit a patch of snow, ice, salt; or if a car turns in front of me, I will likely not be able to maintain my balance.  Protected bike lanes which are cleared of snow & ice all winter long have allowed us to cycle to and from our work safely.  Protected bike lanes save my family between $5,000 and $8,000 every single year.\nThis past summer I had an early morning medical appointment in the downtown hospital district. On my bike I noticed something about the riders along my commute:  There were A LOT of women, and A LOT of new cyclists. These people were along Danforth Avenue, Dundas, Shuter Street in sufficient numbers that I would argue the bike lanes were congested for a speedy cyclist like myself.  Protected cycling infrastructure allows all manner of people, rich and poor, to get into biking as a mode of transportation. Ripping out these lanes will either force these people onto dangerous streets or back into their car ... causing more congestion through traffic fatalities or additional cars on the road. Emergency trips by an ambulance to one of the hospitals in the downtown are easier now with the bike lane on University avenue because those lanes are wide enough for an emergency vehicle to drive up or down.  Same for police cars. Maybe same for fire trucks.\nMy wife now works in the west end of Toronto. The route by car avoids all bike lanes across the Scarborough to the 401, across to the west end of Toronto, and south to her work. The estimated google trip in each morning is 55 minutes, without an accident on the 401. It takes her 63 minutes to cycle the 18 kilometers through the traffic and construction. Biking is about the same speed as taking the highway where there are no bike lanes. We are both in favour of keeping the existing bike lanes.\nThe bike lanes in Toronto did not cause the congestion. 20+ years ago when I was a student at the University of Toronto Scarborough College, I saw Ellesmere packed each morning bumper to bumper. After graduating I took a language course downtown at UofT, offering to drive to the hospital district to pick up my classmate once because the congestion was insane and frustrating. This was 20 years ago when there were fewer people in the downtown, fewer condos, and fewer cars.  It is not possible to out-supply demand for the road, more so when that road is free to use.  I strongly advise the panel to use their powers to install more cycling infrastructure in the City of Toronto, all other large important cities and encourage smaller cities to build out protected bike lanes.\nTo summarize:  I live in Scarborough, commuting ~12 KM to an office every days. I save $5,000-$8,000 each year, more than 10% of after tax income, because I don't have a car.  My car died during the pandemic and even though I make decent money I cannot afford a new car.  The protected bike infrastructure should be expanded. Congestion has been an issue for a long time & ripping out the bike infrastructure will not solve congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Opposing Ontario's Bill 212 is crucial, especially when you consider the troubling parallels to the Greenbelt scandal. This bill seems to be another instance where the interests of Doug Ford's friends and donors take precedence over the needs of everyday Ontarians.\nKickbacks and Conflicts of Interest\nJust like the Greenbelt debacle, where developers with close ties to the Ford government stood to gain billions, Bill 212 raises serious concerns about favoritism. The bill is being framed as a solution to congestion, but many see it as a way to benefit a select group of wealthy insiders. It\u2019s hard not to wonder: who really stands to gain from these changes?\nLack of Transparency\nThe Greenbelt scandal revealed a lack of transparency in decision-making, with processes bypassed to favor certain developers. Bill 212 appears to follow the same playbook. When decisions are made behind closed doors, it breeds distrust. Ontarians deserve to know how these policies are crafted and who is influencing them.\nFinancial Implications\nThe financial implications of Bill 212 could mirror those of the Greenbelt land removals, where taxpayers might end up footing the bill for decisions that primarily benefit a few. If this bill leads to costly infrastructure changes or legal battles, it\u2019s the public that will bear the burden, while the well-connected profit.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Bill 212 is not just about traffic\u2014it\u2019s about accountability and fairness. We need to ensure that our government prioritizes the needs of all citizens, not just a privileged few. Let\u2019s learn from the mistakes of the past and demand transparency and integrity in our legislative processes. What do you think? How can we push for better governance?\n"

        "comment": "Opposing Ontario's Bill 212 is essential, especially when we consider the significant role bike lanes play in Toronto's daily life. Here\u2019s why this bill is a step in the wrong direction:\nHigh Use of Bike Lanes\nIn Toronto, bike lanes are not just a luxury; they are a vital part of the transportation network. Many residents rely on biking for their daily activities\u2014commuting to work, running errands, or simply enjoying the city. Removing these lanes would disrupt the routines of countless cyclists who depend on safe routes to navigate the streets. Studies show that bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing traffic congestion.\nIncreased Risk of Deaths\nBill 212 poses a serious threat to safety. By eliminating bike lanes, we risk increasing the number of accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians. In 2024 alone, Toronto has seen multiple cyclist fatalities, highlighting the dangers of inadequate cycling infrastructure. Without dedicated lanes, cyclists are forced to share space with motor vehicles, leading to a higher likelihood of collisions and, tragically, deaths.\nImpact on Small Businesses\nThe removal of bike lanes could also hurt local businesses. Many small shops and cafes benefit from the foot traffic that bike lanes generate. Cyclists often stop to shop or grab a bite, contributing to the local economy. If bike lanes are taken away, we could see a decline in customers, which would be detrimental to these businesses already struggling in a competitive market.\nWorsening Traffic and Gridlock\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about traffic. Bill 212 is touted as a solution to gridlock, but history shows that adding more lanes for cars often leads to more congestion. With fewer bike lanes, more people will revert to driving, exacerbating traffic issues. This creates a vicious cycle: more cars lead to more congestion, which leads to calls for even more road expansions\u2014none of which effectively solve the problem.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Bill 212 threatens the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, jeopardizes small businesses, and will likely worsen traffic congestion. Instead of removing bike lanes, we should be investing in safer, more efficient infrastructure that supports all modes of transportation. Let\u2019s advocate for a city that prioritizes safety, accessibility, and economic vitality for everyone.\n"

Removing bike lanes will only make bikers unsafe and create additional traffic flow problems by forcing bikers and drivers to share limited road space. I vehemently oppose Bill 212.

Please please do not remove the network of bike lanes that have taken us so long to get. They make our city better.\n"

I am in strong opposition of this bill, as written, and urge the government to refrain from putting it into legislation.\nI would be in support of seeing a focus on improving and maintaining higher quality regional public transportation, as it would be in line with addressing traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\nWhere is the focus on safety and the lives of all road users? A focus on just drivers is inherently unequal, unfair, and unjust.\nI believe that the provincial government is overstepping it's jurisdiction by meddling in the municipal affairs of our elected city governments to the detriment of our citizens. I am deeply disturbed by the thought that the province would decide to remove high quality transportation infrastructure, especially in the face of clear evidence of it's benefit economically, environmentally, and socially. I believe removing provided cycling infrastructure also fundamentally impacts the ability to freely (and safely) move around our cities for our young people, those with disabilities, and those who can't drive.\n"

It is not an \"us versus them\" situation.

I consider them to be essential for my daily life, much like sidewalks and roads\n3.\tSafety of cyclists is important, and we can help by adding visual, and physical barricades to ensure cyclist safety.\n4.\tStudents. Highschool, college, and middle school students as well as seniors, often commute by bicycle due to the lower cost opposed to driving. By reducing bike lanes, we are directly putting these groups at risk unnecessarily.\n5.\tAs a driver, I would much rather cyclists be in designated areas so they don\u2019t have to be navigated around the road way. Without bike lanes, cyclist will inevitably end up using roads, and sidewalks (which should be legal when bike lanes are absent), this creates danger for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n6.\tBy having bike lanes connect to transit stations, we can reduce the number of cars on the road. This would reduce gridlock more effectively than adding more lanes.\nIn conclusion, I think bike infrastructure is absolutely essential to any urban landscape to diversify commute options for the community.\n"

        "comment": "In a year that has seen the most cyclist deaths in Toronto in the last five years, the provinces intentions to begin removing bike lanes is completely irresponsible and disrespectful to the families that have lost loved ones. Those deaths were caused by collisions with cars, the same cars this province is choosing to prioritize over the very lives of many who choose to travel by bicycle through the city. The promise that removing bike lanes and adding car lanes is not backed by any evidential research. What is back by evidence, is that bike lanes create a safer environment for people to travel by bike, which not only saves lives, but also reduces vehicular traffic by encouraging people to use alternative forms of movement through the city.\nThe provinces statements are clear - lives and safety do not matter as much as supposed reduced traffic. Where will the cyclists that still use these routes go? On the road with the cars, increasing risks of accidents. Nice choice.\n"

        "comment": "Exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act for Highway 413 should not be granted. The Assessments should not be rushed through as the new highway will be cutting through farmland, the Greenbelt and Nashville Conservation Area in Kleinberg. These areas are vital for wildlife and wild plants that are declining in population due to development. It is short sighted to disrupt these areas without proper understanding of the impacts. The Greenbelt absorbs rainwater preventing flooding, provides food for Ontario's people and provides habitat for wildlife. Without these vital resources and ecosystem services the province will be less equipped to deal with the coming changes in climate and the increases in population. We should be steering away from cars and highways and if transportation issues are arising investments should be made in public transit and making walk-able cities and towns.\nThere is no evidence that the removal of bike lanes will decrease traffic congestion. In the short term removing the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes will cost $48 million according to Toronto City Council and disrupt Toronto traffic for two years. That is an unacceptable cost and that money could be used to do something that actually benefits the people of Ontario. We should be building more bikes lanes not removing them. More safe cycling infrastructure will encourage more people to cycle around the city, this will reduce traffic congestion. This money and time should be put into finishing the transit projects around the city such as the overdue Eglinton Crosstown or investing in the TTC that is woefully underfunded. The solution to traffic congestion is not to remove bike lanes it is to get cars off the road with better public transit and cycling infrastructure. The less cars the better air quality and the lower the CO2 emissions. Cars are also prohibitively expensive and impracticable for many people living and working in Toronto. People like me who cycle everywhere are going to be put in danger if this act goes through.\n"

        "comment": "Highways like Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass and the Garden City Skyway won't be addressing gridlock. There is no immediate need for them and so fast tracking does not make sense.\nRegarding Hwy 413:  400 acres of the Greenbelt and 2000 acres of farmland would be paved over to make way for Highway 413. First of all, the Greenbelt is supposed to be protected - the Ford government already agreed not to touch the Greenbelt. And for farms, already too many farms have been removed surrounding Mississauga. We need this to stop. Ontario doesn't grow enough food to feed itself, but it could and should. With the Canadian dollar weakening, and food insecurity made clear when CoVID hit, we need more farms, not less.\nThese highways come at a huge cost which is not well substantiated. They would allow housing to be built way out in the middle of nowhere, in other words sprawl. That does not help traffic, that puts more cars on the roads. If you want to reduce congestion, highway 407 is sitting there already built and ready to be used. The money allotted for 413 could be used to subsidize 407. I am not opposed to tolls, but the pricing is extremely high and needs to be reduced to about 20% of what it is. Perhaps even make it free for large trucks shipping goods. You could reduce congestion with immediate results by doing so.\n"
