        "comment": "Bill 212 seems to be misguided. It claims to deal with traffic gridlock, but the methods it proposes would maintain or increase gridlock. This is supported by studies discussed in recent publications. For example:\nGlobal studies show bike lanes can ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses\nResearch shows that dedicated bicycle lanes are not behind perceived traffic congestion and can have many benefits.\nCBC  Oct 22 2024\nShoshanna Saxe, Research Chair in Sustainable Infrastructure, said the city\u2019s current problems are the result of a lack of proper investment in public transit combined with significant growth.\nShe said expanding road capacity and accommodating vehicles is not a sustainable solution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decade of unfortunate urban planning coming back to bite us \u2026 the physics of it is not possible. You cannot move millions of people around the city reliably in personal automobiles.\u201d\nEconomists Matthew Turner and Gilles Duranton coined \u201cThe Fundamental Law of Road Congestion,\u201d based on a study that found that increased road capacity did not relieve a city\u2019s traffic burdens \u2026Their study of U.S. cities found that whenever a town expanded road capacity by 10 per cent, the amount of driving also went up by 10 per cent.\nGlobe and Mail  Nov 12 2024\nThe key to solving Ontario\u2019s traffic woes is not about maintaining the status quo of car-dominated roadways. Instead, we need to embrace multi-modal transportation \u2014 an approach that supports different forms of transport that cater to the needs of the people in each community.\nOSPE firmly believes that each municipality should have the ability to design and implement transportation infrastructure that suits its communities\u2019 unique needs. Different neighbourhoods face different challenges, and the solutions must be tailored accordingly.\nOntario Society of Professional Engineers Blog  Nov 19 2024\nThe last quote points to a need for municipalities to have the ability to control their own transportation infrastructure, but Bill 212 counterintuitively opposes that ability. It proposes to add more red tape to municipalities\u2019 ability to fight gridlock with effective deployment of cycling infrastructure. This translates to more years of gridlock while municipalities\u2019 efforts to combat it are hamstrung. If the provincial government truly desired to combat gridlock, it should instead focus its efforts on expanding public transit, and redouble its efforts to open the badly needed Eglinton Crosstown LRT.\nTearing out recently built bike lanes is a reckless waste of taxpayer dollars that will not result in long term improvement of traffic gridlock. As cycling infrastructure has grown into a comprehensive interconnected network, so has demand for safe cycling options. There has been a huge increase in e-bike production in recent years. Municipalities should have the ability to develop a variety of modes of transportation as part of their strategy to combat gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes in Toronto are extremely important. As a resident without a car, by choice, I use my bike as my primary mode of transportation. The city is not built for cars, and the answer to people's complaints about car traffic is not adding more car lanes, it is improving transit and other modes of transportation that are more viable for the city. Bike lanes are not only good for peoples well-being, but also the environment and the functioning of the city. By taking away these bike lanes, the city is welcoming liability for biker's injuries and deaths caused by car traffic. Bikers need options to travel safely as seen in many cities in Europe and Montreal.\nWhile those who are against bike lanes argued that they never saw anyone using the bike lanes, this is because of induced demand. Taking away bike lanes less than a year into building them is a very poor decision.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is Undemocratic. We voted for a mayor and a Councillor who pledged support for safe streets in our city. Ripping out downtown bike lanes will make our streets lethal for cyclists. Why is the Provincial government trying to override municipal jurisdiction over our streets?\n10% of trips downtown are made by bike. it is actually the best way to get around. It\u2019s the quickest, healthiest, the least polluting and contributes the least towards congestion. But it has to be safe for people to do it. If bike lanes are removed and cycling is made unsafe, I will be forced to leave my bike at home and take my car which will add to congestion.\nDowntown condo towers are being designed to be taller and taller in order to meet housing targets. And they are being given exemptions on how many parking spaces they are providing. The assumption is that new downtown residents are going to cycle rather than drive. That only works when there is sufficient, safe cycling infrastructure.\nHere is a quote from Doug Ford when he appeared on TVO in 2017 after riding a bike in Toronto: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city.\u201d So what is it? Do you care about the lives of Ontarians? Or would you rather pander to a few cranky suburban voters who mistakenly think that removing bike lanes will magically make downtown traffic disappear?\nThis is backwards, not forward thinking. I just watched the city spend 6 months building permanent traffic flow infrastructure at the Bloor/Huron intersection. Now it\u2019s going to be ripped out? Waste of our money, waste of our time. And ultimately if it is removed, it will be rebuilt once this provincial government is voted out of office.\nDon\u2019t waste our time, our money, our lives on a fantasy that downtown traffic will disappear. The only way we will be able to commute more efficiently is if more of us cycle, walk and take transit. And that will only happen if we continue to look forward and plan accordingly.\n"

I have almost died riding several times over the years. In all cases, it was cars driving in bike lanes, and/or not allowing space for riders on roads without separate lanes. In all cases, prioritizing car-dominated thoroughfares is an old-fashioned notion of how to move people through a city.

        "comment": "Good evening,\nThis bill is an absurd waste of money. I pass the University bike lanes every day on my way to work, and even as a pedestrian they make me feel safer, as an additional barrier between me and all the cars. The bike lanes took time and money to install. They are popular, and many of the people who use them would continue to bike on these roads even without separate lanes, they would just weave in and out of car traffic. Removing existing bike lanes would make these streets more dangerous and stressful for all road users, and there is no evidence travel times would improve. This bill represents the opposite of fiscal responsibility. Wasting millions of dollars for no real reason is not what taxpayers want from the Progressive Conservative party. Please do not pass Bill 212- Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act 2024 - Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (ERO Number 019-9265). Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford,\nI am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212. Over the past several weeks, there have been many letters and statements from associations and organizations such as the Ontario Traffic Council, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, and the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, which include myriad reasons as to why Bill 212 is short-sighted, regressive and undermines municipalities' efforts in making their communities safer for vulnerable road users.\nThese letters include data and statistics that have been collected and interpreted by engineers, physicians, researchers and professionals who are far more experienced than I am, so I will avoid reiterating their statements and instead focus on a topic that I am more familiar with, which is the consultation process involved in planning and designing bike lanes (I will present my experience from a Toronto perspective).\nDespite popular belief, bike lanes are not installed as a hasty decision by planners or engineers who are \"influenced by advocacy groups.\" There is a detailed and lengthy consultation process that involves project teams meeting with local councillors, stakeholders, institutions, business improvement area staff, police, EMS and fire services, and municipal services staff to refine bike lane designs and ensure they meet the very individual and specific needs of communities; this occurs at least one year prior to installation. Then, the designs are presented to the public for their review and comments before they are further revised and presented to Council for approval.\nThe consultation process can sometimes last years because there are many perspectives and nuances to consider when designing a street for all modes of travel, ages and abilities. Project staff spend time and effort building relationships with stakeholders by holding in-person meetings, conducting site visits, and spending hours responding to emails and calls. Often, the final bike lane design appears very different from the City's original proposal, but it is the result of careful consideration and refinement according to communities' specific needs.\nI am concerned that if Bill 212 is passed, this consultation process will be diminished (as it would be unfair and unrealistic to expect provincial staff to conduct consultation to the same degree as municipal staff), and municipalities will miss opportunities to install cycling infrastructure that would improve their communities, or would be forced to use bike lanes that are not suitable according to the speeds and motor vehicle traffic on their streets.\nPlease keep bike lane planning as the responsibility of the municipalities, who have the resources, expertise, and experience to design infrastructure that addresses the needs of the residents they serve.\n"

As the province tries to implement more transit-oriented development including transit-oriented communities, the philosophy and ethos behind this decision to remove bike lanes is completely antithetical to encourage multi-modal transportation and supporting the safety of all road users and pedestrians. Creating additional lanes of traffic has been proven by research and years of history of autocentric cities across Canada, North America and the world. To decrease vehicular congestion, is not to jeopardize the safety of other road users such as cyclists. Speak to any cyclist and listen to their experiences of cycling alongside cars.

Transportation planning 101 can tell you that adding driving lanes will only momentarily reduce congestion. Induced demand, which means travellers from other routes, modes, and times will use up that additional capacity and the system will return to the same level of service. There is simply not enough physical space to have enough lanes for cars, the math doesn't add up. The only way to reduce congestion is to have better transportation demand management, which means getting some portion of people to use transit, bikes, and walk... so that way only the people that need to drive are driving.\n"

Reducing the bike lanes will not reduce grid lock at all, it will just fill in with more traffic that moves just as slowly as it always has. The approval of bike lanes should be up to municipality not\nThe ministry. The municipality knows more about what the local community needs.\nHowever this bill is mostly about building highway 413 that will be tolled like the 407 and will be underutilized just the same. The build highways faster act will atrociouly be exempted from the environmental assesment act. This will do untold damage to the environment bypassing nessisary environmental assessment. The damage done to the ecosystem will increase the frequency of floods, high winds, fires that will also increase  insurance premiums for those that don't care about the environment as well. Will also allow the province to take land from the landowners with no option to change the possession date under the expropriation act, kicking people out whenever.\nAll this bill will accomplish is lining the pockets of Ford's specifically selected developers, and investors.

I believe this will cause more accidents as too many cyclists don't wear lights or reflective gear already. Being on the actual roads will be even more dangerous.\nThere is also zero proof that it will alleviate gridlock. I commute 7.6kms and on roads without designated bike lanes, where the gridlock is absolutely ludicrous most days. So by adding even more cars to the roads (as I know many cyclists, myself included) who won't go on roads without designated bike lanes for safety reasons. So they'll be driving instead.

        "comment": "This omnibus bill is extremely disappointing and is actively harmful to residents of Ontario.\nThe changes to the Highway Traffic Act that require municipalities to seek Provincial approval before the creation of new bike lanes where the design would reduce the number of marked lanes for motor vehicle is an overreach of the provincial government and will add layers of bureaucracy to the management of local streets. For a government that seeks to 'remove red tape' and 'speed up development', this is adding a lot of red tape and undue government intervention. This is not respecting local democracies and is not respecting municipalities' ability to plan for their communities.\nFurther, requiring the removal of bike lanes along Bloor Street Yonge Street, and University Street in Toronto is ridiculous - a waste of resources (potentially $48 million), will create worse traffic (through construction and induced demand of vehicles), and increase danger to all road users, especially the most vulnerable. Removing bike lanes and preventing future ones from being built is increasing the likelihood that cyclists will be severely harmed, and is reducing a healthy, climate-supportive commuting choice. It is targeting Toronto and is unnecessary.\nWhile the bike lane changes have received the most spotlight - a tactical decision - there is even more harm in the proposed Highway 413 Act. To exempt any of the works and/or planning of the Hwy 413 from an Environmental Assessment and to exempt Hwy 413 from the Environmental Bill of Rights (1993) is deplorable. To suggest that an Environmental Impact Assessment, the contents of which the very same provincial government will determine, is an acceptable alternative is disappointing and misleading by design. The Bill outlines how the EIA will be used and outlines that the provincial government does not have to address any concerns raised - merely try to mitigate identified negative impacts, and 'consider' comments from Indigenous communities and the public at large. There is nothing preventing the provincial government from pushing forward on developing the Highway 413 despite any environmental consequences.\nFurther, the Bill highlights that the Minister shall publish the studies and updates of studies described in the draft EIA \"except where in the opinion of the minister the studies or updates of studies contain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters\". This is extremely broad and should be removed and/or altered to reduce the scope - otherwise this is likely to be used by the province to hide behind should there be any request from the public to view said reports.\nThe contents of this omnibus bill are far reaching and damaging and need to be significantly revised. Listen to the public - we do not want this. We want bike lanes, we do not want Highway 413, we do not want our rights reduced.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI sincerely hope that you will reconsider Bill 212 due to it's inevitable ineffectiveness and unjustifiable cost. If we look at our own history, despite having one of the largest highways in North America (the 401), Toronto still has an extreme amount of traffic congestion even when compared to other cities with larger and denser populations. This result of induced demand means that any actions to widen highways or create new highways will inevitably result in more traffic. Additionally according to research commissioned by Environmental Defence, Highway 413 would cause over 17 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions by 2050. Highway 413 will also damage and disrupt the ecology in the area.\nIf the goal of this bill is to reduce gridlock and save citizens' time, a better idea would be to invest in alternatives to driving. Investing in smart public transit projects could be extremely beneficial to the region. Investing is safe cycling infrastructure would also be beneficial in reducing car traffic and moving people more sustainably and efficiently. For every person who does not need to drive anymore (because it has been made easier and faster for them to take an alternative method) there is one less car on the road, thereby reducing gridlock. If its faster to not drive to work (because of good transit and bike infrastructure) a significant number of people will take this option instead. This method of planning cities has been proven to be effective by plenty of others across the globe and even in some select parts of Toronto. Additionally, this method is beneficial to a much larger portion of citizens, especially those who do not have the privilege of owning a vehicle or the desire and ability to drive.\nI hope that we can learn from other cities around the world while taking notes from our own history in order to create policies that can effectively help all of our citizens. As such, I implore you to reconsider Bill 212 and instead work on a plan that reduces traffic by offering alternative solutions.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"
