        "comment": "Thanks OP! Submitted my comment:\nI am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

It will ultimately make traffic worse, not better.\nReducing the environmently requirements for this project is a backwards thinking mentality. Our wetlands are important for flood mitigation and carbon sequestering.\nThe best cities in the world have phenominal public transportation for all citizens, the young, the old, the tourists, the blind or disabled, the poor, or anyone who cannot drive.\n"

        "comment": "Supporting bike lanes is about investing in a stronger economy with a healthier, faster and more efficient community. Removing bike lanes would waste more time and tax dollars, and create more gridlock.\nIt's understandable that the installation of new bike lanes has caused frustration for some, especially in a city where car culture has been ingrained for decades. Adjusting to changes in road design can be challenging, particularly when it impacts familiar commuting routes and routines. However, it\u2019s worth considering that spending additional public funds to remove these bike lanes and revert back to car lanes would take time and money and would not be the most efficient solution. Removing them could negate potential long-term benefits of a more balanced transportation network, and the costs of doing so would add up without giving the current investment a fair chance to demonstrate its value. Instead, allowing time for adaptation and assessing the impact of the bike lanes more comprehensively might yield a more informed and financially prudent outcome.\nResearch supports that the benefits of dedicated bike lanes\u2014such as safety, reduced congestion, economic growth, health improvements, and environmental gains\u2014often require a sustained period to fully materialize. Giving the bike lanes a fair, extended trial allows the city to see these potential positive outcomes.\nSome key reasons to for keeping the bike lanes include:\n1. Behavioral Change Takes Time: When a city deeply embedded in car culture introduces bike lanes, residents may initially be resistant to change. Studies show that people gradually adapt to new infrastructure like bike lanes, with cycling adoption rates steadily increasing over time as people become more familiar and comfortable with the option. A longer trial period allows time for behavioral shifts and for residents to explore cycling as a viable alternative.\n2. Reduction in Traffic Congestion: Research indicates that, in the long run, bike lanes can reduce car congestion by shifting some commuters to cycling, especially for short trips. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have shown that dedicating space to bikes can eventually lead to fewer cars on the road, easing overall traffic. However, these benefits are often gradual, requiring time for commuter habits to shift.\n3. Economic Benefits to Local Businesses: Studies have found that bike lanes can positively impact local economies, as cyclists tend to shop locally and spend more over time compared to drivers. In New York City, for example, retail sales along a street with a new bike lane increased by up to 49%, compared to 3% in areas without them. Giving bike lanes a longer trial period offers an opportunity to track economic impact and support local businesses.\n4. Safety Improvements Over Time: The presence of dedicated bike lanes has been shown to improve safety for both cyclists and drivers by reducing the likelihood of accidents. According to a study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), crash rates for all road users dropped in cities with bike lanes. However, initial periods may see adjustment challenges as road users become accustomed to new layouts. Keeping the lanes allows enough time for all users to adapt, making the roads safer in the long run.\n5.Environmental and Health Benefits: Long-term reductions in car use due to increased cycling can lead to lower emissions and improved air quality. As more people transition to biking, cities often observe lower carbon emissions and better air quality, which benefits public health. For example, Portland\u2019s long-term investment in bike infrastructure has significantly reduced CO2 emissions. These effects are cumulative, with greater benefits over time.\n6. Reduced Stress Takes Time: Research published in the Journal of Transport and Health found that both drivers and cyclists experience reduced stress over time as they become familiar with bike lanes. Initial anxieties around potential conflicts with cyclists tend to decrease as drivers learn how to navigate around these lanes confidently.\n7. Cost Savings in Infrastructure Maintenance: In the long term, bike lanes cost less to maintain than car lanes, since bicycles cause far less wear and tear on infrastructure. Some cities have found significant budget savings by prioritizing bike lanes. Allowing more time to measure the financial impact of these lanes could reveal cost savings that benefit the city\u2019s budget.\n8. Long-Term Public Health Savings: Increased cycling leads to health benefits, such as reductions in cardiovascular disease, obesity, and respiratory issues. Cities with more established cycling infrastructure tend to see a healthier population, which can reduce public healthcare costs over time. Giving the bike lanes more time allows the city to potentially see these health benefits, which require years of behavior change and consistent cycling habits.\nOverall, supporting bike lanes is about investing in a stronger economy with a healthier, faster and more efficient community.\n"

        "comment": "Huge waste of my taxpayer money. Won\u2019t make a lick of difference to congestion. I use the Bloor bike lanes multiple times every single day - I commute to work, meet up with friends and take my kids for rides to camp in those lanes. They keep us safe and provide us an alternative option to driving everywhere. I own a car too, and I also have to drive on Bloor. With no bike lanes, we will have to drive more often or take more Ubers. We need alternative options to driving so that people like me won\u2019t add to the congestion. I\u2019ve noticed so many more cyclists and Bike Share riders, Uber eats bikers etc, in the past couple years and the numbers keep increasing. You should spend your money on subways and bike lanes to give people better options than driving everywhere.\nI don\u2019t ever comment on these things but this is terrible legislation. Also - isn\u2019t this a municipal issue? Why does the premier of Ontario need to comment on local roads. Use your power and OUR money on something that will actually improve our lives. Not make things more dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes offer a range of positive externalities that enhance urban life, making cities safer, more accessible, and economically sustainable. Contrary to popular belief, bike lanes do not cause traffic congestion, car usage and construction to keep car usage alive does. (just look at the data, no, before you say anything, just look, please look, I am begging you.). By encouraging cycling as a mode of transport, bike lanes help reduce car dependency and alleviate traffic congestion, freeing up road space for those who actually need to drive, such as people with disabilities, those transporting goods, and emergency services.\nThe economic benefits of bike lanes are substantial. Cycling infrastructure is relatively inexpensive to build and maintain compared to the high costs associated with road expansion and car-related infrastructure, saving municipalities significant amounts in construction and upkeep. Additionally, a healthier population results from more active commuting, reducing long-term healthcare costs. Unlike cars, which often require imported parts, a larger proportion of bike parts are domestically produced, supporting Canadian businesses and reducing Canada\u2019s reliance on imports, thereby strengthening our  economy.\nFurthermore, bike lanes increase urban density efficiency. Since bikes require less space, bike parking can be easily integrated into busy downtown areas, freeing up valuable land for new developments like housing or business spaces.\nFrom a safety perspective, bike lanes protect cyclists, including children, from the dangers posed by sharing roads with cars, making cycling a safer, more viable commuting option.\nBike lanes are designed to incentivize cycling over driving, as the former contributes to positive externalities, reduced pollution, lower congestion, and better public health, while the latter poses costs to society in the form of accidents, emissions, and heavy infrastructure demands. Eliminating this mode of transportation limits the city\u2019s options and intensifies the pressures of a growing population and the demands of urban expansion.\n"

        "comment": "I approve of Bill 212 and was pleasantly surprised that Premier Ford was proposing a solution to an ongoing problem that has personally affected me as a Torontonian.\nI have experienced firsthand the impact of the new bike lanes on Bloor St W in the High Park area. These have added delays and extreme stress to my work commute, including much frustration as I look upon empty and underutilized bike lanes that were once motor vehicle lanes while I inch my way to work in standstill traffic. Travelling from Bloor to Symington post-Covid has been a daily struggle; what should be a couple minute drive has turned into a 10 minute crawl (and this is after an already arduous journey on the Gardiner). Additionally, I worry about the negative effects on the environment due to the additional congestion/vehicle idling.\nTo hear there are intentions to forge ahead with bike lanes on Parkside Drive is appalling - the morning and evening commutes along this major route to and from Lakeshore are already congested; the justifications I've heard for this vaguely refer to increasing the safety of pedestrians, but lacks transparent, concrete data to support this. The current mayor of Toronto has made me feel vilified as a motor vehicle driver by pushing this agenda, but I am a safe driver whose only desire is to commute to work without battling additional, unnecessary congestion. Arbitrarily removing driving lanes in favour of cycling lanes is a rash and oversimplified solution to a complex problem.\nThis is a prime example of why the Ontario government needs to assume decision-making powers on the installation of bike lanes. The new bill, as I understand it, will require data collection and analysis to approve and plan the installation and removal of bike lanes. This is the correct approach so that: careful examination, impact analysis, and proper planning are performed; and any bias is eliminated so all taxpaying citizens of Ontario are considered, not simply the subset that will help a mayor get re-elected.\nI am not anti-cycling or anti-bike lanes by any means, I just wish to see the installation of bike lanes done strategically going forward and that's what I am optimistic this bill will achieve.\n"

        "comment": "Bike Lanes and Highway 413\nThe issues in this bill are two fold: (1) the reduction and limitation of bike lanes in favor of additional vehicle infrastructure and (2) expediting the construction of highway 413.\nThese two action, in tandem, will increase congestion from both ends by (1) limiting the desirability of non-vehicular modes of travel (e.g. bikes) and (2) promoting vehicular modes of travel through the construction of high capacity highways. This will not reduce congestion and in fact, it will make it worse due to the simple fact that there will be more cars on the road.\nAdditionally, both of these actions promote the emissions of green house gases and reduce alternative mobility options.\nFinally, removing bike lanes that already exist is a waste of taxpayer dollars and materials from an environmental perspective. In an economy where the costs of labor and materials have been inflated and the Province has an enormous amount of debt, spending money on destroying brand new, well-designed infrastructure is against responsible fiscal spending.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "Here are 10 points on why government overreach in legislating bike lane placement may have negative impacts across various demographics and could detract from public health and mobility goals:\nImpacts on Mobility for Low-Income Communities\nBy limiting bike lanes, governments disproportionately affect low-income communities who rely on affordable transportation options. Bike lanes offer a cost-effective way to commute, and limiting these lanes increases dependency on cars, adding to transportation costs and pollution exposure for those already financially constrained (Pucher & Buehler, 2012).\nAccessibility Barriers for People with Disabilities\nBike lanes can serve as safe passageways for adaptive cycling, a mode of transport for people with physical disabilities. Reducing bike lanes removes opportunities for disabled individuals to move safely through cities on adapted bicycles, trikes, or hand cycles, limiting their independence and mobility (UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities).\nIncreased Health Risks\nStudies show that active transportation, including biking, is linked to lower cancer and cardiovascular disease rates. People who actively commute experience reduced sedentary time, which lowers cancer risk factors like obesity and inflammation. Limiting bike lanes could increase reliance on cars, exacerbating sedentary lifestyles and worsening public health (Celis-Morales et al., 2017).\nEnvironmental Impacts and Climate Goals\nBike lanes reduce vehicular traffic and emissions, helping cities achieve climate goals. By making active transportation less feasible, governments miss out on significant environmental benefits like reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, critical in combating climate change and its health impacts (IPCC, 2021).\nBarriers to Youth and Future Generations\nYounger generations favor environmentally friendly and active commuting methods, like biking, for their lower carbon footprint. Removing or limiting bike lanes reduces safe spaces for these younger people, pushing them to use cars, which goes against their preference for sustainable transportation options (McDonald et al., 2011).\nIncreased Congestion and Stress\nWithout adequate bike lanes, cyclists may need to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and road congestion. This can lead to higher levels of commuter stress, road rage, and accident rates, impacting overall city life and public safety (Jacobsen, 2003).\nSocial Inequity and Inaccessibility\nBike lanes democratize access to transportation. Legislating them away could deepen inequality by giving car users priority over cyclists, who are often from diverse economic backgrounds. This hinders equitable access to safe transport options, going against principles of inclusivity (Litman, 2021).\nNegative Effects on Mental Health\nCycling provides mental health benefits through physical activity and stress reduction. Safe bike lanes encourage cycling, which has been linked to improved mental health outcomes, particularly important in urban environments where stress is high. By limiting bike lanes, government actions may inadvertently harm public mental well-being (Woodcock et al., 2018).\nLoss of Local Economic Benefits\nCities with safe bike infrastructure have shown economic growth as bike-friendly businesses attract more foot and bike traffic. Bike lanes encourage spending in local stores, fostering community engagement and economic resilience. Cutting back bike lanes risks reducing these benefits and hurting local businesses (Garrett-Peltier, 2011).\nReduced Opportunities for Physical Exercise and Health Benefits\nBike lanes promote regular exercise, decreasing chronic disease rates linked to sedentary lifestyles, including obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Without safe bike lanes, individuals lose easy opportunities for exercise, leading to long-term health costs that burden healthcare systems (Andersen et al., 2000).\nThese points highlight how government overreach in dictating bike lane placement could disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, hinder environmental goals, and negatively impact public health and economic resilience.\n"

        "comment": "Re: bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nThis proposal is flawed and should not be enacted:\n1.\tThe proposal states the \u201cImplications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating the proposed new and existing cycling lanes.\u201d  How will this been done there is no framework described?\n2.\tThe proposal lacks evidence based justification for removal of existing bike lanes.

Where is the framework?\n4.\tThe removal of bike lanes without proper consultation will further the unfortunate reputation which the current government has for acting without consultation, ignoring evidence based decision making and overreaching it\u2019s powers.\n5.\t While there are many issues with existing bike lanes and the implementation of new bike lanes. The City of Toronto is working hard to resolve them in a fair and democratic process and inclusive manner. This process will be undermined by Provincial interference.  Specifically the issues regarding the Bloor Street bike a lane is best resolved at the municipal level.  Cities have been building bike lanes for many years they have a process in place for consultation and resolution of issues which best completed at the local level of government.  Some routes where the evidence points to low usage or may be revised or rerouted or removed.\n6.\t Before enacting legislation the province needs to determine what is causing traffic congestion and how to address it.  There no evidence that this has been done. The proposal appears to be based on, at best, anecdotal evidence and arbitrary decision making.\n7.\tThis legislation is massive overreach of the Provincial Government into the municipal jurisdiction, with absolutely no justification.\n8.\tOverturning the work of a local government comes at a tremendous cost. In the case of Toronto, if the province orders the removal of bike lanes, bill 212 must include compensation from the Province for the demolition of the lanes and construction cost to remediate the street, and also include the original construction cost of the lanes and all the associated planning costs.\n9.\tThe Province should concentrate on the many pressing provincial issues but if it insists on entering municipal jurisdictions it should at least work collaboratively with municipalities\n"
