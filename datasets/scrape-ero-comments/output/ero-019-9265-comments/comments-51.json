        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to the addendum to Bill 212, which requires the province to remove the separated bike lanes that have been installed on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street in the City of Toronto. I live in the Trinity Bellwoods neighborhood in the city, and I have used the separated bike lanes since their installation. I use the bike lanes several times each week to commute to work, run errands and attend events in the city center. While I own a car, population growth is making Toronto and its suburbs increasingly congested, and building additional roads and capacity to address long term demand is not feasible in congested urban areas. Cycling on separated bike lanes presents a safe and efficient alternative to driving. Removing the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge will make it harder for me to commute to and from work, reduce my ability to visit and spend money at local businesses, and ride through the city with my young son, all of which I have been able to do more easily since bike lanes made it faster and safer to ride downtown.\nIn addition to the personal reasons that I have for opposing the removal of the bike lanes, I oppose their removal due to the apparent lack of technical justification for removing them. The City of Toronto went through a lengthy (and expensive) planning and design process that justified the installation of the separated bike lanes prior to installing them. Section 195.5 of Bill 212 implies that the Ministry of Transportation should undertake its own review and analysis prior to making a decision to remove any separated bike lanes. However, while the premier and minister of transportation have made various statements about the negative impact of these bike lanes on motor vehicle traffic, the province has not produced any studies or data that demonstrate that the bike lanes are having a negative impact on mobility within the city overall, which should be metric that determines whether the bike lanes stay or go, in my opinion. On the other hand, the City of Toronto has produced studies and data showing significant increases in cycling and use of bike share facilities - including significant increases of bike share facilities along Bloor - since the separated bike lanes were installed, which supports the notion that the bike lanes are improving mobility for many.\nIn the absence of a technical justification for removing the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge, I oppose the the enormous expense to taxpayers that removal of the separated bike lanes will require. An analysis completed by City of Toronto's city manager indicates that removing it will cost tens of millions of dollars to remove the bike lanes - not to mention the tens of millions already spent by the city to design and build the bike lanes in the first place - and I think it would be an enormous waste of money for the province to proceed with this work at this time, without a sound rationale for doing so.\nI hope the province will reconsider its decision to remove the separated bike lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street at this time and at least subject these bike lanes to a thorough and impartial review to determine their value prior to spending millions to remove some or all of what has been installed.\nThanks.\n"

        "comment": "To the Ford Government:\nIt is the belief of countless enviornmental activists and biology professionals that Bill 212 does not take sustainability and environmental protection into account in a productive way, and is therefore reckless and destructive. Highway projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass are not going to fix any problems. In fact, the loss of vital wetland areas and wildlife habitat will be destructive in the long run. Replacign wetland areas, natural water filters and storage areas, and replacing them with concrete and other hard surfaces will make the GTA more susceptible to large flooding events such as those that were experienced this summer. Reparing the damage to infrastructure from frequent flooding will cost the government and the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. Moreover, the traffic gridlock issues that these highway projects are trying to fix could be addressed by increasing access to public transit and encouraging alternate forms of transportation such as biking. Bike lanes should be added to urban areas, not taken away as will be demanded by Bill 212 if it passes. These highway projects are unecessary, and will cause harm to human lives and wildlife habitat.\nFinally, the amount of power given to the Minsiter of Transportation through Bill 212 is frightening. No one person should be able to make all those construction  project decisions without proper environmental impact assessment and consultation with public groups, especially indigenous communities who are the stewards and caretakers of the land. This is a dangerous precedent and will inevitably lead to important details being overlooked in the name of getting the projects done faster.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212, and make human safety and environmental protection higher priorities.\n"

        "comment": "Please keep, and expand the current bike lane system. It has made cycling in the city much safer and helps new cyclists feel more confident on the road. Separated lanes and dedicated bike lanes are also wonderful for drivers, especially new ones, who are navigating our populated city streets, and feel safer with these bike lanes in place.\nBike lanes are used not only by cyclists, but also skateboarders, rollerbladers, scooters, and assist in removing congestion, reducing confusion, and keeping folks safe. So many food delivery folks are able to bypass traffic with these lanes, reducing congestion during rush hours.\nPlease also keep environmental reviews for highway projects. Our beautiful province needs us to care for it, even through expansions and roadwork.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Doug Ford,\nI strongly oppose Bill 212 - this act will NOT save time - bikes alleviate gridlock, and save lives. By removing bike lanes, my life will be at risk.\nBike lanes are an integral part of a healthy city. I can go on and on about all the benefits that we already know about, and all the risks it poses... so let's talk about how this would simply be a very poor use of public funds.\nThere are people in this city who cannot afford to eat, to have shelter, long wait times for hospitals... and we are using public funds to put in bike lanes, only to rip them up less than 5 years later (in some cases, less than 1 year later - see University Ave bike lanes). Our government needs to be fiscally responsible and reasonable. Please let this be a municipal matter.\nPlease consider NOT removing these bike lanes as it will strongly impact my day to day well-being, amongst the other thousands of cyclists in this city.\nSincerely,\nToronto Resident.\n"

        "comment": "The problem with congestion and traffic in the city is always cars. This city needs better public transport, more and better bike lanes. Encourage people to use TTC and bikes, to walk. Make the infrastructure good so people would choose public transport or bike. We need less cars in the city, not less bike lanes\nTaking the numbers of bike riders from the whole GTA does not reflect the number of people in the city of Toronto, specifically Downtown and Midtown, that frequently ride a bike and use those lanes.\n"

Any MPP supporting this clearly does not care about facts and evidence.\nAny MPP supporting this has the blood of dead cyclists on their hands.  I wonder if they will be able to sleep at night once some kid gets run over, but at least they can pretend they did something to help traffic (they did not).\nShame on Ford and Sarkaria for putting this forward.

Highway 413 and the tearing down of the bike lanes just show that the premier of ontario doesnt listen to the people of Ontario and what they want but what pushes his own personal agenda for him and his buddies.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation appears, from what information has been made publicly available, to be myopic and misguided in the extreme. The only proven method to reduce traffic congestion is to reduce the trip share by single-occupancy vehicles. This means increasing modal share of active transportation, transit, and micro-mobility users. How will this bill achieve an increase in non-vehicle travel mode share? What data or reporting was used in formulating this legislation? Please listen to the experts who are significantly concerned that this bill will worsen traffic congestion in the near term due to construction impacts; in the medium term due to induced demand; and in the long term by making it unsafe for non-vehicle users to use the roads and decreasing long-term adoption of non-vehicle modes. Finally, while I am in favour of reducing red tape in order to accomplish projects quicker, the type of red tape being cut matters. Cutting review and input from experts will likely lead to lengthier construction, more disruptions, changes in the field, cost overruns, and poorly planned and implemented projects that ultimately do more harm than benefit considering opportunity costs of how money could be more appropriately allocated.\nIn short, please listen to the experts and their comments on this proposed bill. Legislation should be supported with facts and clear evidence of the expected impacts. This bill does the opposite and should be rescinded or significantly amended until greater thought can be put into achieving the intended outcomes. Thank you.\n"

In some cases this works and I have enjoyed using them. However there are very few side streets that are continuous in this city and that is result of designing them to avoid through traffic from cars.\nAlso many times my destination has been on the major streets. The bike lanes have allowed me to access shops and business that I would not have seen while riding the subway underground.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

Removing bike lanes is only going to decrease the safety for cyclists who comprise 30-40% of road traffic on Toronto's downtown thoroughfares. Bike lanes are used by Torontonians of every age group - even young kids with their families. It's also a sustainable mode of transportation in the city helping to reduce air pollution caused by vehicular traffic. I guarantee the removal of bike lanes will result in more cycling accidents and casualties that could be avoided.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill represents yet another idiotic attempt by the Ford government to avoid actual responsibility for protecting road-users and addressing traffic congestion issues. The Ford government is using bike lanes and bike-users as scapegoats on which to blame gridlock.\nThe Ford government has offered no evidence that bike lanes cause or even exacerbate traffic congestion. That's because there is none. Bikes do not cause traffic, cars cause traffic. If the Ford government actually wanted to address traffic congestion, it would work to make other transportation options attractive for uptown and suburban commuters, namely, transit options including expanded subway and bus networks.\nThe Ford government's attack on bike-users and neglect of public transportation in Toronto is an attack on average Torontonians who want a more livable city. The Ford government has decided to ignore the hundreds of thousands of us who are not capable or who cannot afford to drive. Safe bike routes and well-run transit systems accommodate all of us and create a more welcoming, environmentally-sustainable city. Ironically, because the Ford government's plan won't actually solve gridlock, it won't actually help car-users eithers. No one wins.\nWell, almost no one...\nBill 212 is yet another instance of Doug Ford ignoring actual Ontarians, avoiding his responsibilities for creating and maintaining good, livable communities, and catering to his rich buddies in business, construction and development. The people who will benefit from Bill 212 won't be average Torontonians, they won't even be average car-users in Toronto, they'll be Doug Ford's CEO friends in road construction and the auto industry. That it.\n"
