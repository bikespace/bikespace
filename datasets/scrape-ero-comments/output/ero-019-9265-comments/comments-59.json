        "comment": "I am against the bill for many reasons.\nI live near Bloor and use the bike lane often. Even without biking, having only one lane on Bloor has. Made it a lot more livable, and more enjoyable to spend time in the street. The businesses I have spoken to agree. Foot traffic is better because fewer cars make for a nicer walk.\nEvery bike on that lane is a car off the road.\nFurthermore, the bill introduces a way to circumvent environmental assessments of the ghihway 413, which is disgusting. It should follow assessments like every highway.\nLastly, the bill increases the right of government over my personal property too much by allowing the government to use my property for building without my consent. And without warning!\nThis is clearly another move by the Ford government to abuse power and give his friends favours.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to read my comments. This bill is just downright silly. There is no factual basis for the conclusion that reducing bike lanes will help reduce gridlock.\nIf bike lanes are removed, the cyclists will then simply be riding in traffic, which by any thought process would singularly impede the steady flow of traffic. When there is a bike lane, cyclists are safely removed from the flow of automotive traffic, allowing both cars and bikes to move as freely as traffic enables them to.\nBeyond the total lack of sound reasoning behind this bill, it is both an obvious infringement on the jurisdiction of municipal governments by Doug Ford and their provincial Conservatives; and a clear case of pandering to morons on social media who have misplaced rage towards cyclists for small inconveniences in their daily lives. Doug Ford has once again proven that they are utterly devoid of any reasoned thought, and singularly thinks of ways they can help their 1 percenter developer friends, and pass idiotic laws intended to get right wing internet trolls riled up. Where's my buck a beer Doug? Oh right that never made any sense.\nSincerely,\nAn Ontarian that despises Doug Ford\n"

Every informed expert agrees that this won't help with \"gridlock\".\nThe proven negatives to removing bike lanes:\n* Removing bike lanes can lead to more traffic congestion during construction.\n*  After construction, there may be little to no improvement in travel times.\n* Removing bike lanes can make cycling less safe.\n*  Removing bike lanes is expensive.\nThe clear positives to keeping bike lanes:\n* Bike lanes can help ease congestion.\n* Bike lanes can reduce emissions, which helps fight climate change.\n* Bike lanes can be good for businesses.\n* Bike lanes can make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\nIt's not hyperbole to say that lives are at stake as bike lanes are safer for our residents. The Ford government is comfortable risking and taking Torontonian lives just for political point.\nIn the end, with Doug Ford's Conservative Party, this bill is bald-faced electioneering.  The Ford Government is comfortable punishing Toronto and its residents in return for rural and small town votes.\nPlease reconsider. It's not hyperbole to say that you knowingly endanger people by voting for this bill, and you should be held responsible should someone die due to this choice.\n"

        "comment": "This act would give the minister unchecked permission to build unnecessary projects according to his whims. It reeks of corruption, and only serves to make ministry-approved construction companies a nice, juicy profit without addressing any of the actual causes of traffic and congestion on our roadways (like lack of public transit!!!) Such projects, like the building of highways, should be subject to thorough environmental assessment and community input, all of which this act would bypass. I absolutely disagree with all aspects of the proposed act. Stop building highways, and instead increase trains, bike lanes, and access to public transit. Regarding the new bike lanes on Bloor Street - these are an absolutely necessary piece of infrastructure for cyclist safety along a major access route, and a much needed alternative to car and ttc transit. The bikes lanes ARE the solution to traffic and roadway congestion. Before they were installed, I personally have experienced many close calls as a cyclist, with reckless drivers putting me in danger. Since the bike lanes were added, I have been able to commute safely along Bloor Street. Removing the bike lanes would not only be devastating and an absolute waste of taxpayer money, but it would be putting my life in danger,\nas well as the lives of the many other cyclists (and taxpayers) who use this route daily. Removing the bike lanes would communicate to me that the current ministry of transportation values a slightly shorter commute more than it values my life and the lives of other cyclists (the people who are actually helping reduce roadway congestion). I firmly disagree with the proposed removal of the bike lanes along Bloor, as well as all other parts of the proposed highway construction act, as they do not reflect my values.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 proposes to destroy existing bike lanes, smother local democracy and dismiss environmental protections in the beautiful province of Ontario.  As an older adult who commutes by bicycle, I rely on bike lanes for a safe route to my workplace.  I regularly travel on the Bloor bike lane to do shopping as well as travelling to and from work.  In fact, I frequent businesses along this route because the Bloor bike lane provides an easy and safe way to get there.  At this time of year, it is dark on my way home from work.  Visibility is poorer for any vehicle on the road.  It is even more crucial to have dedicated cycle infrastructure for cyclists who are even more vulnerable in the evening.  Not to mention the safety concerns for vulnerable road users with the increased availability of alcohol.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University have already been built.  The money has been spent.  There are so many other ways that the estimated $48 million can spent that could benefit so many Ontarians who are struggling with food security, access to health care and education.\nI ask that Bill 212 be withdrawn and I ask that my hard earned taxes not be spent on ripping up existing bike land infrastructure and that local democracy be respected.\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen of Toronto, I completely oppose Bill 212. This is an absurd direction to try to take the city of Toronto in 2025. We are facing a dire climate crisis, and gridlock will not be solved by allowing more cars into our city. Invest in public transportation and we will see improvement in traffic. More public transportation and more bike lanes will increase safety and commuter flow, not more cars. Athens and Florence are both examples of cities that have placed restrictions on driving within the city and are both top destinations for tourists and are good pedestrian cities. Athens has an incredible public transportation system that allows tourists to easily move around the city and get to all the monuments and they built this system even with the insane amount of archaeological material they had to sift through (1993-200). Yet somehow, because our municipal government continues to devalue and defund and privatize our public transportation, we can't even get the Eglinton CrossTown Light Rail built within a twenty year period.\nProhibiting the building of and removing bike lanes will lead to more deaths from bike accidents. The reason Toronto started building bike lanes was to reduce the number of accidents and deaths caused by cars hitting bikers. This is public health and safety issue as well as an environmental one.\nI am also deeply concerned about the act about Highway 413. Removing the Environmental Assessment requirements is ridiculous in the climate crisis. The environmental impact of a highway is also a health and safety issue, since highways increase air pollution for residents as well as damaging the ecosystem they are built in, which has knock-on effects for people. If you can't bring yourselves to care for the environment and the ecosystems in the area, at least try to find some empathy for the voters living in this area. Deregulation always leads to disastrous results. The environmental assessment is not the only regulation that the Ford government has sought to bypass during his time in office and it won't be the last. Last year in Greece there was a horrifying train crash that killed at least 30 people. This train crash was a direct result of the deregulation of safety checks enacted by the prime minister, Mitsotakis. Deregulating environmental impact leads to unhealthy living environments and irreparable damage to the ecosystem, which both lead to a decrease in quality of life.\nFord has made it his mission it seems to mess with the few things Canada really has going for it: our beautiful natural landscape and our free healthcare. Now he proposes to \"reduce the gridlock\", by enacting laws that will only increase the number of cars contributing to Toronto traffic and bike accidents, as well as going against the worldwide movement towards environmental protections, while simultaneously decreasing funding for public healthcare and public transportation all in a desperate bid to decrease the quality of life of everyone living in Canada.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction for the province. Instead, the Province should be investing in better investment in public transportation rather than more highway lanes. The goal for the province should be to encourage more active and public transportation, by increasing the infrastructure for public transit (buses, trains, subways) and increasing the number of bike lanes in cities to support alternative and safe modes of transportation. Significant research has shown that when the number of car lanes increases, so too does traffic, so increasing the number of highways and car lanes does not mitigate the problem. Instead, offering effective public transit and safe, especially separated, bike lanes provide alternative modes of travel, and increase commercial success in the areas with this infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 is a massive overstep on the part of the Province of Ontario, as bike lanes are a municipal concern. Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be costly and also counterproductive for the city and for the province. The Province would be wise to repeal this proposed action.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"

It continues the track record of this government's override of local planning and policy decisions when those decisions don't align with conservative ideology. It is part of a systematic approach to reduce or eliminate environmental protections and to criminalize actions that, in the view of this government, would \"impede progress\".\nThe impetus behind the removal of existing bike lanes and the delay and discouragement of building new ones, ignores the imperative of providing safe infrastructure for vulnerable road users and the necessity to reallocate valuable road space so that people are encouraged to make sustainable transportation choices.\nFast-tracking highways that perpetuate automotive dominance and encourage urban sprawl development is both economically and environmentally unsustainable. So too is the removal of on-street bicycle infrastructure that reduces transportation choice, leading to more dangerous roads, higher carbon emissions, poorer community health outcomes and negative economic impact for local businesses.\n129 cyclists died in the Province of Ontario between 01/01/2006 and 31/12/2010. These deaths prompted the government of the day to ask the Ontario Office of the Chief Coroner to provide a Death Review report. This report provided 14 recommendations including, \"Adoption of a 'complete streets' approach - focused on the safety of all road users - to guide the redevelopment of existing communities and the design of new communities throughout Ontario\". It took the better part of a decade for those recommendations to become guidelines and policy and then be implemented by communities across the Province. Bill 212 effectively takes the Province back to before the report was submitted. Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\n"

        "comment": "I'm opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several key reasons. The proposal to eliminate bike lanes to reduce traffic congestion is flawed and lacks evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes won't decrease traffic; studies and historical data show the opposite. This action is likely to lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately increasing costs in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto illustrates this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city's own data showed that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the goal of reducing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists and discourages sustainable transportation options, increasing reliance on cars and worsening gridlock.\nInstead of enacting policies that jeopardize lives and degrade urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as improving healthcare and education. This approach would better serve the long-term interests of Ontarians than dismantling bike lanes to appease drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government should aim to create a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just those who drive into the city for work.\n"
