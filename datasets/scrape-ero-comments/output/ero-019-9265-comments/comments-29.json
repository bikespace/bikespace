        "comment": "I own a greeting card and gift store called TOWN. We are located on Bloor Street West, near the corner of Brock Avenue. The proposal in Bill 212, The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, to remove bikes lanes on major thoroughfares, especially Bloor Street, is very concerning to me. Minister Sarkaria\u2019s statements that bike lanes are bad for small businesses are especially disheartening. The Bloor bike lane has been great for my business. Please leave it where it is.\nAt least a third of my customers use the Bloor bike lane, probably more. Many of these customers use the bike lane year-round. In fact, the bike lane attracts people to my business. Since the Bloor bike lane was installed, more people spontaneously visit the store during their daily commute. Customers have mentioned that they noticed the store from the bike lane, and it was easy for them to pull over and run in and grab a card or whatever else they need. If bike traffic is diverted away from Bloor Street, my business will suffer.\nWe now have a Bike Share depot directly in front of the store, which I am thrilled about. It allows a whole other section of the population to see and become aware of our store. This includes many tourists who use Bike Share to get around the city. The Bloor bike lane makes it easier, not harder, for more people to come to my store in more different ways.\nThe Bloor bike lanes sometimes cause small inconveniences, but they are worth it. Deliveries to the store can be more difficult, and couriers might have to walk an extra block or two, but they figure it out. Some customers complain about a lack of parking, but this has always been true. I had two retail stores on Danforth Avenue, between Broadview Avenue and Chester Avenue, from 1987 to 2006, before the bike lanes were installed, and parking was an issue then too. More lanes of traffic will bring more cars, and parking will only get worse. The only way to free up parking is to enable fewer people to drive.\nAs a lifelong resident of downtown Toronto, I believe in livable cities that don\u2019t rely solely on cars to move from one place to the other. It is so much easier and safer to drive when bikes (and now e-bikes and scooters) have their own lane. The feedback I have received when TOWN has publicly supported bike lanes in the past has been nothing but positive. It actually brought people into the store once they heard of our support. Real support for small businesses like mine means supporting the Bloor bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "Please, do not remove the bike lanes. Bike lanes are what the city needs, if you fully complete a bike lane people will use them. There are many places where cyclists can either face the risk of  biking beside cars or to be cursed out by pedestrians on the sidewalks. There are few places for us and we really appreciate what we do have.\n"

        "comment": "I am a transportation professional and I have experience in this domain.\nAs if the initial arbitrary rule to prevent bike lanes from being built under all circumstances without any consideration of the area's transportation context wasn't bad enough, now they are proposing to remove key bike lanes that are heavily used, functional, and safe?\nI understand bike lanes are not always appropriate - it depends on the transportation context of the area. Maybe some municipalities took bike lanes too far but this not the case in downtown Toronto.\nIt is totally against best transportation practices to think that adding an additional vehicular lane of traffic will drastically improve congestion on urban roads.\nIn most cases one additional vehicle lane could be added and that will not improve vehicular traffic and will induce more vehicular demand and increase congestion. It will also create less safe conditions where high volumes of cyclists mix with vehicular traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes on urban streets that are suited for them (like Bloor) would undo years of progress.\nThe costs:\n- undoing years of planning and construction time/$\n- new construction for the removal bike lanes and addition of vehicle lanes that will rip up major downtown roads for years\n- lost productivity because this will increase congestion on urban roads\n- the cost of injury (or worse) to cyclists because removing bike lanes is much less safe.\nBike lanes on urban roads can be hugely beneficial because there is never enough capacity to expand vehicular traffic lanes to solve traffic congestion.\nDedicating portions of the road for cyclists/pedestrians/transit provides more benefit because this moves more people in less physical space.\nCost-benefit analysis: what is the cost of adding another vehicular traffic lane and what is the benefit? The short answer: the cost is high and the benefit is low, the benefit pails in comparison to adding bike lanes or pedestrian or transit facilities.\nThe province fails to see this as a complex issue and instead treats it as black-and-white, illustrated by their all or nothing approached to bike lanes. This is a shame.\nStrongly oppose.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure that improve safety, support public transit, and simplify the roads for drivers. Local governments should have the autonomy to develop and expand these bike lanes without provincial interference, ensuring streamlined decision-making free from red tape and bureaucracy. Proposals to remove highly used bike lanes overlook the critical role these lanes play in providing safe, accessible transportation for thousands of cyclists daily. By offering a basic standard of safety, bike lanes reduce accidents and create safer streets for everyone. Separating bike lanes from car traffic also simplifies the road environment, easing the experience for drivers and promoting a more efficient, sustainable transportation system that benefits all.\n"

        "comment": "To pass this bill is to destroy nature and distance ourselves from it in the most direct way possible. For some reason North America has gone with one of the least efficient, most expensive, and worst for the environment methods of transportation as the main way to get around. This bill being passed would not only push this absurd agenda, but also would be even worse then normal for the environment and people by bypassing one of the few things done to try to mitigate its negative effects; the provincial environmental assessment. This assessment needs to be done in order to asses the cultural, biological, environmental, and economic effects of the project. Without the assessment, endangered species will be killed, important habitat will be damaged, indigenous land will be destroyed, large amounts of pollution will occur, and it will cost the tax payer even more money. Passing this bill will only bring good things to the greedy developers and politicians that are pushing it.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with the ability of Bill 212 to disallow the need for environmental assessments on new highway projects.  It is well documented that the planned Highway 413 poses a threat to birds and fish.  The Highway will be disruptive to creeks and other waterways that it will cross and it will have negative impacts on parts of the Greenbelt.  The fact that it will increase traffic and sprawl means that there will be more greenhouse gas emissions.  An environmental assessment would clearly show how the plan for this highway disregards the future health and well being of all life in the area and beyond.  It is irresponsible not to allow environmental assessments  that would consider the future impacts of projects such as the Highway 413.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation fails to address the key issue behind congestion being the overwhelming reliance on automobiles for travel. Modal shift via public transit, cycling, and other modes of active transportation are effective and proven modes of addressing congestion but Ontario lacks appropriate support and investment in these initiatives to actively support and encourage this necessary modal shift (along with unequal access to such services and opportunities). Public transit needs guaranteed supportive funding to ensure appropriate service levels and quality for users as seen by the TTC and other such agencies. Removing bike lanes will actually make congestion worse in areas with high cycling traffic as now both modes will have to actively share the same space and will increase the potential for conflicts and accidents. Building a new highway tunnel under the 401 along with Highway 413 will only endure further autocentric development and travel in the GTHA and undermine the necessary modal shifts (even car centric Los Angeles has been actively working to invest in transit which should be a sign that multi-modal transportation is important to addressing congestion). Fast-tracking such projects also means more room for environmental degradation not just from construction but from overall infrastructure implementation as well. Other more effective and less costly alternatives to the 413 were already provided in 2018 when the project was originally cancelled yet these are being ignored for what was designed to be an element of the Greenbelt land grab scandal.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a clear overreach of provincial powers into municipal matters and is very clearly drafted to create outrage over a non-urgent issue so that the province can skip over any environmental assessment that is REQUIRED to build Highway 413 because the OPC putting this forward knows that Highway 413 would be an ecological disaster in Ontario and couldn't care less.\nIf this Government cared to alleviate congestion they would Nationalize or provide subsidies for Commercial users of Highway 407 and prioritize that as a relief to Highway 401 being congested instead of posing far-fetched ideas like a tunnel underneath the 401. I've linked a study below outlining my points.\n"

        "comment": "I am providing a comment to say it is worrying that Bill 212 seems to be punitive towards bike lanes, without addressing issues of bike safety. Bike lanes are not Provincial jurisdiction. I respectfully suggest the Province should work to incentivize good planning, not simply provide municipal restrictions imposed by Bill 212's Section 195.2.\n195.2(4-7) exempts certain roads from having bike lanes. This by itself is not a faulty notion. The fault lies in that it mainly allows the Province to determine when bike lanes may be built. Make a provision that forces cities to instead analyze the statistical usage of bike lanes. If it is inadequate, then allow the city's citizens to democratically decide.\nSecondly, preventing major roads from having bike lanes will mean the most busiest streets in Ontario- such as downtown Toronto- will become more dangerous. This surely will apply to other municipalities, such as Waterloo or Hamilton, too. Bikes will have no choice but to either risk being hit in traffic, or intermingling with pedestrian traffic which further endangers pedestrians around them. 195.2(7) seems poised to prevent major roads from having bike lanes. I respectfully encourage the Province to rethink this process as it endangers not just cyclists, but the millions of pedestrians in Ontario city centers.\nIn city centres like Toronto, cars are not the best mode of travel. It is faulty to pretend that city centres should encourage car traffic everywhere. Bikes, walking, and transit should be prioritized, to allow a multi-modal split which reduces demands on overburdened downtown roads. The busiest places in downtown are sidewalks, bikes weaving within them only make them more dangerous.\nThank you in advance for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply disturbed by this proposed legislation that would make road safety for drivers and cyclists even worse than it currently is by removing bike lanes.\nThe City and surrounding region have grown by thousands of people and traffic is not going away. There was terrible traffic on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue before you were ever in power and before bike lanes were installed, and that is not going to change. The only thing your proposed legislation will do is endanger people's lives.\nCars cause congestion. End of story.You need to encourage people out of their cars  and instead onto GO Transit, TTC, car pooling, cycling, and walking. Someone who lives two cities away, say in Brampton, like Minister Sarkaria, cannot reasonably expect to be able to drive to the downtown core without encountering traffic.\nPlease use logic and evidence-based decision making instead of dangerous proposals like this legislation you have tabled.\n"

More streets and highways may momentarily ease traffic, but they ultimately lead to more cars, more emissions, and more gridlock. In contrast, public transit and bike infrastructure encourage efficient land use, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and support equitable access to transportation for all citizens. Now is the time to invest in sustainable mobility\u2014it\u2019s an investment in a cleaner, healthier, and more connected future. I do not support this bill.\n"
