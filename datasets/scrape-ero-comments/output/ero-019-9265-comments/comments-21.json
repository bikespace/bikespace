        "comment": "As someone who cannot afford a car and uses bloor west to commute to work daily twice this is a disgrace to Toronto. Why would you want to remove bike lanes that are busiest and most used in the city. Have you even seen the bike traffic in the mornings and afternoons? I see parents take their children and the elderly use it in the morning. Toronto already has had fatalties, the removal of the bike lanes will not stop bikers from commuting. If I get injured or killed it will be on the people who approved the bike lanes. Let that live in your conscience\n"

        "comment": "Do you not realize that removing bike infrastructure means that people who used to bike will now be using cars, even further increasing traffic? The whole idea of bike infrastructure is that it will reduce gridlock in the long run because it incentivizes usage of alternative means of transportation. Not to mention the fact that evidence shows that it makes streets so much safer, for drivers, pedestrians, and bikers alike - lives are literally being saved here. The government here is planning to waste millions of dollars and restrict infrastructure projects that will make Toronto and other municipalities a better place to live in the long run, all so that they can get away with cheap short term shots saying \u201cwe helped to reduce traffic\u201d. It is completely counterintuitive that the government has invested so much in public transit initiatives through the Ontario Line and other works, but refuses to acknowledge anything that isn\u2019t grandiose in nature. City planning is not a game that you can play to boost your ego and satiate your compulsive need for people to like you.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly cannot support this proposal. The removal of safe cycling infrastructure will do a disservice to each community impacted - moreso that of downtown Toronto where safe cycle networks are an asset, relied on and appreciated by all including motorists, cyclist and pedestrians. I am all three of these, and can speak on behalf of each of these demographics, as can countless others. First - as a motorist, cycle networks that are clearly demarcated (and those that are fully separated) make me a more comfortable driver as cyclists are provided a degree of separation and are therefore more predictable and visible to motorists. We can co-exist safely on the roadway with safe cycling infrastructure which is the ultimate goal. Also, in all of my decades as a driver I have never ONCE looked to bike lanes as the reason for congestion and placed my blame on them. The removal of bike lanes will not magically ease traffic congestion. You need to find another scapegoat because bike lanes are not the cause. If anything, the removal of on street parking on busy roadways would be a more appropriate place to start.\nSecond - as a cyclist, I am appreciative of the safe cycling networks that exist. I feel safer in protected bike lanes and can get to my destination faster. The benefits of cycling are boundless, and my commute by bike has relieved so much stress and saved me so much time as compared to driving or taking transit. I feel that I am doing better for myself and for the environment, and I wish that these benefits were more highly discussed to encourage more cycling. This mode of transportation only has net benefits and I don't think that demonizing bike lanes is effective. The removal of cycling infrastructure is only doing a disservice and I think will be a grave mistake. As more people explore cycling as a legitimate mode of transportation, we ease the woes of car congestion as that is one more vehicle off the road. Is this not one of the very things you are hoping to achieve? Encouraging safe cycling and expanding safe networks will only pay dividends to easing traffic congestion.\nAs a pedestrian, we have dedicated sidewalks for foot traffic. How are sidewalks any different than bike lanes? Each method of transport should and deserves to have a dedicated space to move about safely. Full stop. Cars have roads, bikes have cycle networks, and pedestrians have sidewalks.\nThe provincial overreach into municipal matters will not benefit the province of Ontario whatsoever. I am saddened to watch what is happening to the province, and embarrassed to be a resident. We are making backwards trajectory fast, and that is alarming.\n"

        "comment": "This is a poor proposal and clear provincial overreach. The GTA will hamstring itself if it continues to pursue short-sighted commuter car infrastructure at the expense of a modern, multi-faceted transit network which includes cars, bikes, and public transportation.\nThe GTA is growing by hundreds of thousands of people each year. Many new developments are providing little if any vehicle parking. The 401, DVP, Gardiner, and other major motorways are already unworkable nightmares. All of these pressing issues make commuter car infrastructure less and less feasible and yet this provincial government is focused on removing some bike lanes on a few municipal streets? This minister is squandering his mandate.\nWhat is the point of removing the bike lanes on University when it already has dedicated parking? What is the point of adding a few dozen parking spots if they're immediately occupied by all of the bikers now forced to drive? This will increase car congestion not reduce it.\nThe province needs to focus on provincial infrastructure, like our woefully outdated highway network or the fact we still have private toll roads cutting through the heart of the GTA. Leave the municipal planning to the respective municipal governments and do your job.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to voice, in the strongest possible terms, my opposition to this bill.\nFirstly, this bill adds unnecessary bureaucracy and \u201cred tape\u201d to a job that is, ultimately, up to municipalities. Cities know their transportation networks and needs best; not the province. Adding a higher-tier of decision making to this process undermines my faith in a government that\u2019s stated values are austerity and \u201csmall government.\u201d\nSecondly, bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks and roads. They guarantee a basic standard of traffic flow, safety, and navigation for road users outside of a car. This point is twofold: when I drive, especially on main roads, I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes wherein I do not have to worry about passing or yielding to them. Getting rid of lanes on streets like Yonge, University, and Bloor will not stop cyclists from biking on them; it will only make their cycle commute (and just as well a drivers\u2019 commute) more treacherous.\nThirdly, bike lanes on main roads support the massive transit investments that our province has been making recently. From the TTC, GO Transit, the ION LRT and the O-Train, rail expansions are already underway. Cycling infrastructure on main roads makes stations more accessible, boosting farebox revenues and increasing ridership; supporting and making back the province\u2019s worthy investments into these systems.\nFinally, myself and a growing number of people across this province cycle on a daily basis. Historically and statistically, bike lanes on main roads which take away a lane of vehicle traffic do not increase car congestion but in fact help to alleviate it. Detouring cyclists down winding side roads, put simply, is not enough to promote cycling as a viable commute option. Having the bike lanes on main roads cuts cycle commutes and puts the lanes where people want and need to go; therefore making cycling a compelling option. More cyclists means less drivers; less drivers means easing car congestion. The opposite is also true: if another vehicle lane of traffic is introduced, it ultimately creates more space for cars which will inevitably be filled due to inducing traffic demand (Rand Europe, CIVITAS, Le Parisien). The Premier and Transportation Minister\u2019s comments that this plan will reduce gridlock, which were made without credible sources, feel anecdotal at best and like misinformation at worst.\nIn conclusion, I strongly oppose this bill due to its adding of increased bureaucracy to municipal processes, its taking away of an essential road safety measure, its counter-productive nature with regard to current provincial transit investments, and finally, because it, in fact, does not \"reduce gridlock\" and \"save time;\" it very much serves to do the opposite.\n"

        "comment": "Why is the provincial government creating more red tape and bureaucracy for a municipal matter? The bicycle network in Toronto is only beginning to develop downtown and this attack on vital infrastructure is dangerous, irresponsible and pointless other than to conjure up sentiment from suburban voters in the lead up to election season.\nMy life will be at risk each time I bicycle downtown to my workplace as an essential worker. This legislation will encourage road users to drop their bicycles and further clog up Toronto roads with cars. Peer reviewed literature indisputably indicates that protected bike lanes make roads safer for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and have negligible influence on commute times.\nI gravely caution the MPs reviewing this bill to consider the potential erosion of Toronto\u2019s urban fabric with passing this bill. It is a promise to make cycling again mortally dangerous for road users by removing critical safety infrastructure to encourage faster driving, pollution, and a sedentary lifestyle for Toronto\u2019s population. Stop the overreach and stay in your lane. Every other metropolis is embracing cycling as part of their urbanist development. Toronto will be considered a backwards destination\u2026 a city for cars, not for people. Simply say no to road deaths.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\n"

It's astonishing that years of proven planning solutions are being put aside for this short minded bill. The most efficient cities in the world are those that prioritize pedestrian and bike traffic, not vehicles. Walkability and bike lanes are also critical infrastructure in our cities for both physical health and pedestrian safety. A bill to reduce and remove bike lanes tells me our Premier doesn't care about our health and safety. How about focusing your efforts on our transit system, an effective way to reduce traffic in our cities. This bill is outdated and a disgrace to the hard working, forward thinking city planners across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "The approval of Bill 212 would reverse essential progress in building safer urban environments and increasing sustainable transportation options. Ontario has witnessed an alarming rise in cyclist deaths, highlighting the critical need for protected bike lanes that safeguard both cyclists and pedestrians. Instead, this bill would enable the removal of key cycling infrastructure on major urban arteries like Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue in Toronto, pushing cyclists back into traffic, increasing congestion, and jeopardizing their safety.\nPremier Doug Ford has previously acknowledged the importance of bike lanes for reducing congestion and supporting healthy, sustainable commuting. Bill 212, however, contradicts this vision by prioritizing vehicle traffic at the expense of cyclist safety and equitable access to public spaces. Rather than removing bike lanes, Ontario should focus on expanding them to create safer, multimodal cities that reflect the diverse needs of all residents. Blocking this bill will help protect vulnerable road users and uphold our commitment to safer, more inclusive streets.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I live near London, ON but I used to live in Mississauga, ON for 20 years and I am deeply upset with this proposal. This shows a clear lack of understanding of how traffic works and is out of touch with what the province I have lived in for my whole life needs. Ontario does NOT need more highways, lanes and cars. If you add more lanes or roads, you increase traffic, it's known as induced demand, it's common sense everywhere in the world except for North America. What makes you think that if you remove alternatives to driving, like Bike lanes and transit, that you'll reduce car traffic? If you give people alternatives to driving, they will drive less and you will have less cars on the road, speeding up traffic for those who need to be on the road like emergency services, delivery drivers (But even they can use E-bikes for within-neighborhood deliveries) and those who need the roads for work like tradesmen. Every time I look at the Ford Government wanting to spend an extra billion here and there for a wider 401 or a new 413, it just makes me think of what that money could have gone to, like healthcare funding, better GO Transit service, new transit programs across the province, new Ontario Northland train services or subsidized VIA Rail services to Sault Ste Marie who desperately needs rail connections to the rest of the province. The international community is admiring Toronto's efforts to increase it's transit network and it's cycling network, and it pisses me off to no end that you would want to stop that, cause guess what, the international community looks at you as a pillar of car-centric, car-dependent policies that have been plaguing North American since WWII. You wanting to rip out bike lanes and force those cycling onto \"Side streets\" shows that you have literally never cycled in Toronto or any city before and are therefore unfit to ever speak on bike lanes again, also, leave it up to the cities those streets and lanes belong to. Conservatives are supposed to be about smaller government, well here you are, trying to control what cities can and can't do with their own streets. I will NEVER vote for you and I want you out of office because you are running my province into the ground with your childish and ill-advised transportation ideals, Mr. Ford\n"
