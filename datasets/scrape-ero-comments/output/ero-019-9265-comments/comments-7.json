        "comment": "Hi Ontario Government,\nI'm a registered nurse in Downtown, Toronto. I come from a car centric city of Houston, Tx. I would like to comment that eliminating bike infrastructure will not reduce your traffic in the city of Toronto. I come from a city that is equal in population to Toronto with more than 14 gardener/DVP style expressways and many large boulevards that bifurcates the city of Houston. Houston has horrendous traffic that is getting worse, but the powers to be keeps pouring money to widen the roads and build more freeways. We know, with lots of research, that for each lane built in a city like Houston, we are saving 5 minutes to only need to do it again because of population growth. Toronto is incredible to be able to move the number of people it does with GO transit, TTC, BIKE LANES, pedestrian walking, etc AND not have the 14+ freeways that Houston has.\nI fear your half hazard approach to reducing infrastructure will only aggravate the problem while increasing the very real risk of pedestrian and bike fatalities due to not enough infrastructure for the most efficient mode of transportation. As a nurse, I have seen what lack of bike lanes can do to the physical body. I also see in real time that the bike lanes provide accessible transportation for people with varying physical mobilities. I strongly urge you to be a partner in keeping Toronto accessible and safe by expanding bike infrastructure and other public transit forms.\nSincerely,\nToronto RN\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to comment on the proposed Bill 212. The province has not presented any evidence that supports this bill. To the contrary, it has been widely shown that increasing the number of lanes actually makes traffic and congestion worse: https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7358319. Removing bike lanes will also force bikes to occupy the main driving lanes, which will further increase congestion.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are beneficial to the environment by promoting non-motor-vehicle transportation, and the lanes in Toronto have resulted in thousands of people every day using bikes instead of cars. It should be obvious that more trips by bike and fewer trips by car is beneficial for the environment. Cars also wear down roads hundreds of times faster than bikes because of how heavy they are. More wear means the roads need to be repaired more frequently, which is bad for the environment.\nFurther still, bike lanes are important for both cyclist and pedestrian safety. Anyone who thinks that saving people 2 minutes on their commute in exchange for the lives of Canadians should not have any political power.\nEven further still, this bill is a gross overstep of provincial power into municipal responsibilities. Ontario has many issues that need urgent funding such as housing and healthcare, and projects that need pressure to finish such as the Eglinton LRT. Spending money reviewing and ripping up bike lanes is completely fiscally irresponsible. The premier and Conservative party need to do their jobs, not roleplay as mayor of Toronto.\nStop pandering to people who cheer when cyclists are killed by cars. If this bill goes through, then I hope everyone involved understands that blood is on their hands the next time a cyclist or pedestrian is killed on Bloor/Yonge/University. I don't know how you could sleep at night.\n"

        "comment": "As a disabled person who relies on a bicycle for accessible transportation, I strongly oppose Bill 212. This bill oversteps municipal authority and undermines local decision-making on bike lane infrastructure. Local governments, not the provincial legislature, are best suited to determine the transportation needs of their residents. Bill 212 is a dangerous step backward. Municipalities like Toronto need the flexibility to design safe, inclusive streets, on the basis of expert opinion, staff reports, and resident input. This bill politicizes road safety for short-term political gain.\nBike lanes are crucial for safe, sustainable urban travel, and the province should support\u2014not restrict\u2014them. They reduce traffic by giving residents safe alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes will actually increase congestion and car dependency, which will harm all road users. Forcing cyclists into car lanes will only worsen traffic and result in more injuries and cyclist deaths. Our public streets are for all road users, not just drivers.\nThis bill disregards the evidence that bike lanes improve road safety and reduce congestion. It is a clear example of provincial overreach and a step back for sustainable urban development. Bill 212 is unnecessary and wasteful. Municipalities already consult the public on transportation matters, and this bill only serves to centralize control, undermining local democracy.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this set of amendments will act to reduce due process and the ability of affected parties - individual property owners and businesses - to negotiate effectively for fair compensation when construction of highway infrastructure requires appropriation of private property. I submit that the government should pay above market value in such cases. I also believe the requirement for municipalities to provide \"notice\" to the province of intention to build new bike lanes that require closure of a traffic lane is simply a way to throttle the development of bike infrastructure within the City of Toronto.  There is significant evidence in favour of creating more bike lanes and reducing car traffic lanes. Reversing course at this point on the City's excellent plan, duly approved by Council, would be a grave mistake and would both reduce safety of cyclists and add to gridlock.  The plan is attached below, with plenty of additional evidence as to its benefits, including outcomes and how those will be monitored.\nThis is just a populist ploy, similar to selling beer and wine in corner stores  - the tax revenue from more alcohol sales is going to be eaten by the costs of additional anti-addiction programs and increased health care, and the assumed improvements in car traffic will never materialize while pollution will grow and cyclists will be less safe. But hey, if you can get re-elected for another four years, why worry about anything long-term?\n"

Trying to stop local municipalities from installing bike lanes, much less removing existing ones, only helps MPPs who don\u2019t actually support local businesses and just want to drive their cars faster through our communities.\nEven worse is exempting the proposed hwy 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. If the government cannot make good proposals, they should not change laws to make up for their shortcomings. The proposed hwy will increase air and water pollution that will harm our children and future generations to come.\nThe bill is shortsighted and wrong. There is no excuse for such bad proposals.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in urgent opposition of Bill 212. As a driver and bicyclist who commutes to work on bicycle, I am in favour of building out a safe bike lane network. Evidence shows that bike lanes invite more people to get out of their cars and commute in a safe and healthy way, while reducing emissions and creating safe space on the road for those who must drive. (Look at the massive increase in Toronto BikeShare ridership in the past few years.) The bike lanes in Toronto have kept me safe, including visits to hospitals using the University Avenue bike lanes. The number one cause of congestion is more cars. We must continue to build bike lanes, accelerate the development of an expanded and electrified GO transit system, and improve the bike/train connection like many Asian and European countries have done, to improve traffic flow, enhance quality of life, and tackle climate change. Bill 212 takes Ontario in the exact opposite direction of what attracts business and talent to high-performing jurisdictions. Please withdraw this Bill for the good of the province and its citizens.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario voter, I am opposed to Bill 212 for the following reasons:\n1. I am opposed to the building of Highway 413.  Highway 413 is an unnecessary project as we already have a Highway 407 that goes through the same areas as the proposed Hwy 413.  Removing the tolls on highway 407 would help alleviate the congestion on the other existing highways.\n2.  I am opposed to the building of Highway 413 as it would be an environmentally harmful project to our Greenbelt and surrounding watersheds. The proposed route will cut through critical natural areas throughout three GTA watersheds: The Humber River, Etobicoke Creek and the Credit River watersheds. These watersheds are facing threats of urbanization and can\u2019t afford to lose their remaining natural areas that provide critical services for surrounding communities and wildlife.  We do not need more highways, we need better urban planning like building more affordable multi-dwelling housing and expanding our public transit systems like GO Transit.\n3. I am opposed to the provincial government meddling in our city's decisions for bike lanes.  It would be another waste of taxpayers' money to remove any existing bike lanes.  Also, it would waste more taxpayers' money to have another level of government involved in this particular decision-making process.  Please stop this gravy train!\nI hope the Ontario government will kill this bill.\nThank you for this opportunity to comment.\n"

A drive taking a few minutes longer is less important to most Ontarians than clean drinking water, beautiful natural spaces and clean air. Please don\u2019t destroy the beautiful and important watershed that includes the amazing Humber River in order to save a few minutes on the road! I can\u2019t even imagine what the road salt and the other runoff from the highway would do to the water There will be nowhere to rush to if you ruin the natural world along the way!

They impact me for much longer than the parliamentarians who make the decisions about the environment.  In the province of Ontario, we are seriously lacking in environmental protection and sustainability. It is so important that environmental assessments are done when big highways, like Highway 413, are being built so that the government does as much as they possibly can to stop the Climate Crisis. The Government cannot be exempted from environmental assessments; they are there for a reason, to protect the world we live. Serious climate action immediately is critical so this bill is a big step in the wrong direction.\n"

In this era of climate catastrophes, we do not need more cars on the road. We need investments in transit, including town to town and city to city transit options.\nAnother reason I oppose this bill is that the propsed highway is on environmentally sensitive land and will harm the environment.\nYes, Ontario is growing, but please invest in inter-city and inter-town transit options such as buses and trains.

        "comment": "This bill not only does the opposite of what it claims, but it does so at the cost of our environment, safety, and health. Both expediting Highway 413 and creating blockages to creating bike lanes suffer from the same issue around induced demand, a topic that has been modelled by traffic scientists and engineers for decades. Building out the highway and minimizing bike lanes only encourages greater car usage which, in turn increases gridlock. This is particularly given that of all of the transportation mechanisms available to us, cars have the highest cost in terms of space taken up per person. Investing in rapidly completing the provincial transit projects via Metrolinx would go a much longer way in helping to reduce gridlock. Also, by bypassing the environmental assessment required for Highway 413, we are risking a part of our land that we cannot get back. This is short-sighted and sets a dangerous precedent for other protected land, which all becomes more and more valuable to our ability to exist and stay healthy as climate change advances. I think this entire bill should be scrapped and that a new one, back by actual scientific evidence for reducing traffic congestion, should be proposed in its place.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is extremely short sighted and deceitful, like many of other proposals by this administration. It is so problematic on so many levels, as I'm sure the provincial staff are aware:\n1. PROVINCIAL OVERREACH\n1a) In the example of Toronto, Premier Ford was quoted saying the major bike lanes, like the ones on Bloor, Yonge, and University, will be targeted for removal, based on no real criteria. Perhaps the criteria will be based on Mr.Ford's feelings? Since when does the premier get to decide what gets removed on city roads??\n1b) Do motorists need both major and minor roads? So do cyclists. The three he mentioned are major thoroughfares for cyclists, too. Putting bike lanes only on secondary streets doesn't solve gridlock.\n1c) Bike lanes are only installed after YEARS of study, planning, piloting, AND community input. The municipalities have already done this. It is a gross overreach of the province to suddenly butt in and announce they will rip out any that \"fails\" according to this non-existent criteria. The province should do their actual job, like completing higher order transit. Metrolinx, a PROVINCIAL entity, has been struggling to complete several LRT lines on time. I don't see the premier and the Transportation Minister Sarkaria doing much about that.\n2. WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND RESOURCES - all the bike lanes are already put in. It took years of time from various departments at municipalities, consultants, and construction crews. The carbon footprint to rip out all the materials and re-install asphalt is a huge waste of resources and means more construction, which DOES contribute to gridlock. It also took A LOT of money to build the networks we currently have in Ontario, TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS. The province announced that it will pay for any bike lanes that it wants removed. BUT WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM? If you have all that money lying around, why hasn't it been used for public transit or hospitals?? Stop wasting our money.\n3. UNSCIENTIFIC - congestion is a big issue in many places around the world, and lots of studies have been done. No study has ever shown that putting more cars on the road reduces congestion, also none has ever demonstrated that bike lanes cause gridlock. In fact, it is the opposite: see article attached. It is also worth to point out that cars are not IN traffic, they ARE the traffic. We need to promote less cars on the road, not more, by promoting alternate modes of transit (i.e. LRT, subway, BIKE LANES, etc).\n4. BACKWARDS - this proposal is not only based on feelings and no real evidence, it is backwards. The world is facing a climate crisis. We, collectively as human species, need to be moving towards more sustainable modes of transit, not promoting carbon inducing single passenger vehicles.\n5. CYCLIST SAFETY - just like motorists, cyclists want to stay alive and unharmed! Removing bike lanes not only puts cyclists at danger, but motorist as well. With bike lanes, everybody knows where to be and there is less confusion and/or mixing of the two road users. Perhaps this administration is forgetting that cyclists are also Ontarians, and their safety matters just much as motorists. And in case you didn't know, bike helmets don't save you from dying when you get crushed by a car.\n6. DECEITFUL - buried in this proposal is a clause that will allow bypassing of the environmental assessment required for the proposed Highway 413 (also, do we really need another highway?). It seems like this administration has complete disregard for safeguarding or protecting natural and environmental resources of Ontario, as was already demonstrated by the greenbelt scandal. Highway 413 will be an enormous piece of infrastructure if built, and it is paramount that we are fully understand the environmental impacts. We are facing a climate crisis and having to deal with extreme climates more and more. We need to more equipped with knowledge, not less. Such an infrastructure will last many decades, we owe the future generations of Ontario a better than this.\nThis proposal is an insult to the people of Ontario. There are so many other problems in our province, like the housing crisis or the buckling healthcare system. Yet here is the premier with a bogus proposal with a bogus name, wasting taxpayers' time and money that he claims he wants to save.\nAs a resident and cyclist of Toronto, I'd urge Mr.Ford and Mr.Sarkaria to try riding around those Toronto streets without bike lanes at peak rush hour and see if they can propose a bogus bill like this after that. Oh, wait, Mr.Ford already did: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders,\" he said on TVO back in 2017. I guess he conveniently hasn't heard about the deaths of multiple cyclists in this year alone. Mr.Sarkaria lives in Brampton and commutes to Queen's Park by car. He is part of the gridlock problem, yet he has the audacity to question the validity of municipal bike lane studies that exclude bad weather months. Cyclists bike less in the winter partly because the lanes are never cleared of snow or ice, therefore unsafe. But how would he know that? He does not ride a bike in my city to know.\n"
