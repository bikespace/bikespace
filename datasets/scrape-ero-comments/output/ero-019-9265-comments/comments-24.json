        "comment": "Please leave decisions about bike lanes in the hands of municipal governments. We shouldn't have to seek approval from the province to add bike lanes to our neighbourhoods.\nI understand that there have been some unpopular decisions made in the 905 regarding bike lanes however, they are essential to Toronto's downtown core. My family are Toronto residents, many of us are families who own just a single car or have no car at all. Often these constraints are due to financial requirements - cars are expensive. Sometimes they can be as simple an issue as parking. Most of the homes in my neighbourhood - except for the wealthiest residents - only have parking for a single car. Cycling is my primary mode of transportation, which is also true of my neighbours and about 25% of my colleagues. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure for us. My neighbours, colleagues, and I are excited about expanding bike lanes on major streets to alleviate the congestion along Toronto's East-West axis.\nThis government can show its support of autonomy for Ontario residents by allowing local communities and cities to determine their transportation concerns.\nI suggest the government focus on improving regional and inter-city transit to improve the gridlock situation and give commuters more options to travel to work. 15-minute GO Trains would be pretty incredible, but extended service to further places like Barrie would also help. i.e. 30-minute Trains running to Barrie departing from Union until 8pm.\n"

        "comment": "Building wider roads will not alleviate congestion. Reducing the number of cars on the roads and highways will reduce congestion. Options to do this would be to increase support for public transportation, creating practical infrastructure to reduce the need for people to use their automobiles. Creating safe infrastructure so that people can walk, ride bikes, or use other modes of active transportation for trips shorter than 5km, and public bus/train systems for longer trips. In fact, a high-speed rail system linking major cities in southern Ontario would allow people to use the train instead of driving from all over to get to busier areas.\nThis proposal lacks the logic needed to make lasting social change. It focuses on single occupancy vehicles complaining about other single-occupancy vehicles and their drivers who cumulatively cause the issue that this act proposes to fix. The \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" is a misguided and naive solution to a problem that is caused by those creating it. Provide others with alternatives to driving their single-occupancy vehicles will reduce congestion and save time.\n"

        "comment": "This bill represents a significant step backward in our efforts to invest in public transit and to build cities that prioritize sustainable and inclusive transportation options over car-centric infrastructure.\nWhile the Government of Ontario recognizes the need to build priority highways faster to alleviate gridlock and improve the movement of people and goods, this approach is shortsighted. Investing heavily in highway expansion projects like Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and the Garden City Skyway perpetuates our reliance on automobiles and ignores the proven benefits of enhancing public transit systems.\nThe proposal to override most municipal by-laws that might prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to priority highway projects is particularly concerning. This move undermines local governance and disregards community-specific needs and environmental considerations. Moreover, granting the Minister of Transportation new powers to accelerate utility relocations and property access infringes on the rights of property owners and sets a troubling precedent.\nThe emphasis on speeding up broadband projects is commendable; however, it should not come at the expense of sustainable urban planning. Building more highways will only lead to increased traffic congestion in the long term, as induced demand encourages more people to drive. This contradicts the goal of reducing gridlock and improving the quality of life for Ontarians.\nFurthermore, the proposed legislation includes creating offence and penalty provisions for individuals and corporations that obstruct MTO officials. This heavy-handed approach discourages public participation and undermines democratic processes that allow citizens to voice their concerns about significant infrastructure projects affecting their communities.\nOne of the most alarming aspects of Bill 212 is the potential impact on cycling infrastructure. The removal of bike lanes makes no sense from a safety, environmental, or public health perspective. Bike lanes are essential for providing safe, alternative modes of transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Eliminating them will discourage cycling, which will then force bikers to use car more and increase traffic, and make our roads more dangerous for everyone.\nWhile the government claims to be committed to balancing environmental protection with infrastructure development, the proposed measures fall short of this commitment. The bill suggests that construction activities will be undertaken to minimize noise levels and reduce community impacts, yet overriding local by-laws and fast-tracking projects without thorough environmental assessments contradicts this assurance.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 focuses excessively on expanding highway infrastructure at the expense of sustainable transportation alternatives like public transit and cycling. This approach is outdated and does not align with global best practices for building resilient, livable cities. I urge the government to reconsider this bill and instead invest in enhancing public transit systems, expanding cycling infrastructure, and fostering communities that are less dependent on cars.\n"

        "comment": "As a life-long Toronto resident who is approaching 70 years old, as a frequent driver in a\n3-car household, and as an avid cyclist, I would like to register my strong opposition to the\nproposed destruction of cycling infrastructure within the city of Toronto.\nAs a taxpayer, to waste my provincial tax dollars for such a retrogressive move as paying\nfor the removal of existing infrastructure, as well as waste my City of Toronto tax dollars\nby reversing years of city infrastructure development is highly misguided.\nPaying for the elimination of the cycling infrastructure is a waste of provincial tax\nrevenue, but failure to pay the City of Toronto for the present value of those improvements\nwhich will be destroyed is an economic burden on all taxpayers in Toronto.\nHaving grown up in Rexdale, and cycled, while risking my life, on Kipling Avenue, on\nMartin Grove Road, on Rexdale Boulevard and occasionally on Islington Avenue to\ncommute to work at summer jobs in my late teens and early twenties, I can attest to the\nincompatibility of cycling and car tra\ufb03c on multi-lane arterial roads.\nMore recently, cycling along Bloor from Parkdale, where I now live, to close to Islington,\nwhere my dentist is located, was highly dangerous until the introduction of the dedicated\nbike lanes.\nLast Wednesday I cycled on Bloor in the bike lanes to and from Parkdale to Broadview.\nThe safety of that route is greatly enhanced by the bike lanes. During my cycling both late\nmorning heading east and in rush hour returning to Parkdale that day, the primary\nimpediments to automobile tra\ufb03c flow appeared to stem from road repair work, and\nconstruction on new buildings. Illegal turns by vehicles, and illegal stopping and blocking\nthe road by ride-share vehicles seemed to also contribute to congestion. Not so prevalent\non that route was the frequent blocking of intersections by cars causing gridlock during\nrush hour which I regularly encounter on my normal route to work.\nThe presence of frequent signalled intersections, which is a feature of any built-up urban\narea with or without bike lanes, makes speedy vehicular travel unlikely even without bike\nlane infrastructure, nor is high speed vehicular travel safe in an urban context on vitally\nactive streets used by pedestrians and shoppers, and which feature car parking on the\nsides of the road.\nFor decades I have cycled from Parkdale to and from work in downtown Toronto. Over\nthose years, I have seen enhanced infrastructure greatly increase the number of bike\nriders regularly using bikes as an alternative to car travel. More recently, the growth of e-\nbikes used for commerce by couriers and food delivery has exploded, further reducing\nvehicular travel, and contributing to the lessening of road congestion. Furthermore,\ngrowth in use of bike-share riders has been spectacular.\nThis past spring my wife and I visited Montreal by train, and were blown away by the\nvastly superior cycling infrastructure that city possesses. We took advantage of the BIXI\nbike-share system to use both conventional and e-bikes for our travels around the city,\nfeeling completely safe due to the separated bike lanes that city provides to allow year-\nround cycling in a city with much more challenging winter weather than Toronto has.\nThere are a wide variety of measures that can be implemented to reduce vehicular\ncongestion in the city, which are well documented by case studies and figures to\nsubstantiate their impact around the world.\n\u2022 One of those measures includes making transit free, which would instantly reduce\nvehicular travel volumes, particularly by commuters whose free use of roads and\nsupporting infrastructure which is paid for both by car drivers and those who do not\ndrive cars.\n\u2022 Introducing fee-for-use on major roads, such as was used on Highway 407, would\nalso help level the imbalance of subsidy of car use over other modes of travel.\n\u2022 Congestion pricing on travel within the downtown core during certain hours has\nbeen highly e\ufb00ective in reducing congestion in places like London, England.\n\u2022 Increased levies on parking lots also act as an incentive to reduce vehicular tra\ufb03c,\nbut unless accompanied by transit fee reductions, unfairly penalizes those with\neconomic challenges.\n\u2022 Closing of parts of the downtown core to vehicular tra\ufb03c is a mainstay in many\nmajor cities to manage and reduce tra\ufb03c volume. Partial road closings such as has\nbeen successfully on King Street, limiting tra\ufb03c to transit only, are also a tool.\n\u2022 Targeting gridlock by use of cameras to ticket those who block intersections on red\nlights would significantly improve tra\ufb03c flow at a modest cost.\n\u2022 Provision of additional separated bike lanes would further reduce vehicle use and\nreduce congestion, as part of a well-considered policy of allowing for a wide variety\nof travel alternatives, including transit improvements. The Metrolinx/Intrastructure\nOntario boondoggle in implementing transit improvements continues to negatively\nimpact vehicular, transit and cycling travel in the city.\nThe current Bill 212 is interventionist and seems antithetical to the deregulatory mode the\npresent provincial government would normally take.\nIt adds red tape & bureaucracy to the provision of transportation options while reducing\nsafety for cyclists and car drivers, who will now need to deal with road lanes shared with\ncyclists, adding to congestion.\nI urge the government to implement enabling legislation to allow many of the alternate\nmeasures mentioned above rather than foolishly waste taxpayers\u2019 resources on the\nwrong-headed direction demonstrated in Bill 212.\n"

Please stop wasting taxpayer money on this nonsense and focus on the solutions we really need: public healthcare, education, and transit.\nThe only real long-term solution to the traffic problem (in Toronto, Ottawa, and beyond) is effective transit and improved infrastructure for active transportation.\nReview active transportation plans in the Netherlands and make note of the low prevalence of lifestyle related illnesses (e.g., heart disease, type 2 diabetes) and mental illness (e.g., depression) in their population as compared to Canada and the United States. As our population continues age, we need long term solutions to reduce the burden on our health care system.\nThe best bang for our buck is active transportation.\nThe following excerpts are taken from Fishman et al., 2015 (see attached):\n\u201cThe Netherlands is widely regarded as a world leader in active transport, particularly cycling with 16% of the total road network dedicated to cycle paths. A third of all trips under 7.5 km are cycled.\u201d\n\u201cPhysical activity is increasingly regarded as the \u2018best buy\u2019 in preventative health measures and walking and cycling represent one of most effective methods of building physical activity into daily life, whilst at the same time reducing CO2 emissions, air pollution and congestion caused by motorized forms of transport\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n"

The legislation as part of Bill 212 that will allow the province to dictate where and if a bike lane can be installed or removed in any Ontario municipality should be immediately removed from this bill.  I find it highly offensive that this Government values mere seconds of time saved by motorists over my life and safety and the tens of thousands of cyclists and delivery workers that use these lanes every day. Cycling is far more efficient in terms of time, money and overall health and enjoyment over driving in the city.  It is the poorly planned construction / hoarding and selfish moves of drivers blocking intersections, parking and stopping in bike lanes which is causing delays and gridlock, not bike lanes.  The reason you don't see bikes backed up in congestion is because they can get around traffic and move far more quickly and efficiently.  If all those cyclists were to be driving, congestion will be far worse.  Bike lanes are part of the solution to unlocking congestion, not the problem.\nIt is highly insulting that this government would waste my tax payer money removing infrastructure that my local representatives and council through democratic processes approved and built through evidence-backed data.  How will you also justify causing even more construction and delays if the lanes are removed when they just reopened these routes recently built?\nI cycle Bloor St, University Ave and Yonge street weekly and I DO NOT SEE GRIDLOCK on any of those roads at any time of day, only local back-ups due to the Ontario line or other construction closures.  University Ave has the width to accommodate the bike lanes and still maintain at least 2-3 active lanes of traffic.  Also, on Bloor and Yong streets, even if the traffic lanes were to be reinstalled, you would have parking in the curb lanes during the day and only one lane of traffic in each direction - same as the case is now with the bike lanes.  The bike lanes on all these routes are not causing gridlock, they are helping to streamline traffic and ensure that everyone knows where they should be on the road.  Bill 212 would reinstate chaos and carnage on the roads, and we have seen enough people killed by drivers to know better.\nI urge this Government to immediately stop this insulting bike lane legislation and municipal over-reach and stay out of the issue that municipalities are far more equipped to manage.
