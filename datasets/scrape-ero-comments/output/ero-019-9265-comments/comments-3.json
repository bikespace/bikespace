It makes no sense economically, practically, or politically.\n"

        "comment": "Environmental Impact: Building highways, especially projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, poses significant risks to Ontario's natural environment. These projects threaten green spaces, farmlands, wetlands, and habitats that are essential for biodiversity and climate resilience. Highway 413, for example, could pave over 2,000 acres of farmland and cross 85 waterways, causing irreparable environmental damage. At a time when the government should be focused on reducing carbon emissions and protecting natural spaces, building more highways runs counter to these goals. Expedited construction could also lead to insufficient environmental assessments, which are critical for understanding the long-term impact of these projects.\nErosion of Municipal Authority: The BHFA would override most municipal by-laws that may prevent or restrict highway construction, undermining local governance. Municipalities have bylaws in place to reflect the unique needs of their communities, such as noise control, construction limits, and environmental protection. The proposed bill diminishes the authority of local governments, stripping away their ability to regulate key aspects of construction that directly affect their residents. Furthermore, local communities may find themselves powerless in opposing projects that are detrimental to their quality of life, especially in terms of noise, traffic disturbances, and environmental harm.\nLack of Public Consultation: By allowing the Minister of Transportation to expedite timelines, including for property expropriation, the legislation curtails meaningful public input and democratic processes. The public, particularly those whose properties are being expropriated or impacted, may not have adequate time or recourse to challenge decisions. Moving to an expedited appeals process or removing the ability for property owners to apply for later possession of their property under the Expropriations Act, undermines the rights of individuals and communities to defend their interests. This fast-tracking of projects prioritizes development over the fair treatment of citizens.\nQuestionable Effectiveness of Highway Expansion: The core assumption that building more highways will reduce gridlock is debatable. Expanding highway capacity often leads to induced demand\u2014a phenomenon where new roads initially reduce congestion but eventually lead to more traffic as they encourage more people to drive. In the long run, this means the government may spend billions on projects that do not achieve their intended goal. Instead, investments in public transit, carpooling, and active transportation infrastructure (cycling, walking) may offer more sustainable solutions to traffic congestion while also reducing carbon emissions and improving public health.\nFocus on Car-Centric Infrastructure: This bill reflects a continued focus on car-centric infrastructure, which conflicts with global trends toward more sustainable urban development. Many cities and regions are focusing on reducing car dependency by investing in public transit systems, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly urban spaces. Prioritizing highway projects reinforces the use of private vehicles, which increases greenhouse gas emissions and road congestion in the long term. Ontario should be looking toward modern, sustainable transportation solutions, not doubling down on outdated infrastructure paradigms.\nIn conclusion, while the proposed bill aims to address traffic congestion and improve infrastructure delivery, its environmental, social, and long-term economic implications raise significant concerns. It prioritizes rapid development over sustainable planning, weakens local governance, and may not provide the intended relief from gridlock. Ontario\u2019s infrastructure policy should focus on sustainable, inclusive, and forward-thinking approaches that align with environmental goals and community needs.\n"

        "comment": "Doing as much possible to get traffic moving effectively is important but more important to the long-term health of the city is doing as much as possible to get individual people out of their individual cars. Transit and bike lanes should be prioritized over motor vehicles. You can never build enough highways and roads and lanes to accommodate everyone in their own car. You can make Yonge 10 lanes wide in both directions and it will still be completely full of cars stuck in traffic because you encouraged them to be there in the first place.\n"

We should take Montreal as an example and offer safe and accessible bike lanes. Having more bikers and safe bike lanes for them to use will in return reduce the number of cars on the road, congestion, road rage, emissions and pollution. Having more bikers and bike lanes will also increase the availability of parking downtown, driver safety, and the mental and physical health of citizens in Ontario.\nAs a citizen myself, born and raised, please take my comment into consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Study after study has proven that the best and most sensible way to reduce traffic is to increase the ways by which people can travel without using a car. It is cars that cause traffic problems. Allowing people to travel by bike takes cars off the road. Disallowing bike travel will achieve two things:\n1. Ensuring more cars on the road, and\n2. Ensuring traffic moves even slower, since cyclists will simply take the lane. This will contribute to dangerous conditions for all road users.\nPlease refer to Premier Ford's own cycling experience, as was recorded years ago during a cycling trip he took using bike lanes, and to his comments that he made on that video. Bike lanes keep bicycles separated from cars and they keep cars off the road. Leave the bike lanes alone and do not prevent the installation of new ones for such a misguided reason.\n"

By moving the authority for such management to the province, we're increasing provincial legislative workload but removing management authority from legislators who live and work far closer to the problem at hand.\nThe province has no business regulating the by-law governed spaces of municipal roadways, which are better directed by the mayoralty or local urban representatives.\nIn addition to this, the current provincial government seems dedicated to ignoring research on the benefits of removing automobiles from the core of urban spaces. Paris, New York, and the Netherlands are excellent examples we in Ontario could learn from as to the benefits of pedestrianizing our cityscapes. Cyclists require protected lanes to travel safely, and every cyclist is a car not on the streets, reducing gridlock by removing the geometric problems associated with the present oversupply of automobiles in urban space.\nWe should allow our municipalities and their local elected officials to govern their own traffic.\n"
