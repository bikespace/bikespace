        "comment": "They want to skip the environmental assesment and plow through the greenbelt (once again), they want to tear up bikes lanes, they want to make this proposed highway a toll road like the 407 which will ensure that no one uses it, it'll cost each taxpayer roughly an extra $1000 per year while likely only reducing average travel times by 30-60 seconds. Opposition parties and environmental defence estimate that the construction will cost roughly 10 billion. I feel that it is likely Ford will attempt to appropriate the federal contingency funds that he has been hoarding since the pandemic for the highway instead of putting it to use in his rapidly failing healthcare system which was their intended purpose.\nThis cost to the taxpayers would be ridiculous and frankly unconscionable when there are many cheaper options such as directing logistics/transport trips to the 407 and subsidizing the tolls which would cost ~4 billion per year. If the premier was truly interested in reducing gridlock in a significant way then he would invest in infrastructure that gets people out of cars and off the road, improving our commuter train system by upgrading the fleet to electric engines, expanding the GO train network, subsidizing the TTC to allow them to improve their service quality, and obviously building MORE bike lanes! It would even make more sense to initiate a buy back of the minority stake of the 407 which I believe is something the Ford government has already considered. These options I mentioned have the added benefit of a much sooner possible start time as the construction of hwy 413 wouldn't be complete for at least a decade and we all know those proposal timelines are never accurate.\nOutside of that, it is a blatant publicity stunt by Ford to further secure the rural vote and it specifically contradicts his own words where he said in 2017 that \"we have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" If they force the removal of bike lanes in the province traffic deaths will rise undeniably. It is also just another way for him to put money in the pockets of his cronies that were involved with the greenbelt scandal.\nI think it's clear how terrible this decision will be if it goes through and how widespread the ramifications are. It will significantly impact the environment and do irreparable harm that we absolutely cannot afford to let happen. When it comes to the environment we are already fighting a losing battle and with the recent US election results and the inevitable damage they will wreak, it only becomes more clear that we cannot afford to give up any ground in this fight.\nOntarians say no to bill 212!\n"

        "comment": "The proposed act will do nothing to address the problems it seeks to solve.  The only way to reduce gridlock is to divert as many journeys as practical from private cars that are largely single occupancy to public and active transportation.  Removing cycle lanes from main roads detracts from this as it discourages individuals from taking a bike instead of driving if the only \"safe route\" is a circulatorous route that doesn't take them near where they are going or being forced to break the law and endanger pedestrians by riding on the sidewalk.  the argument that no one uses bikes in the winter is nonsense because toronto just set an new record for days above 7 Celsius disproving the notion that our winters are too harsh by people who are clearly only used to thinking of cycling as a recreational activity instead of a viable method of transport year round.  Premier Ford would be served better by dealing with broken promises he made in healthcare and allowing the midscale development that is needed to solve the housing crisis properly or getting the Finch and Eglington lines open instead of pocket mayoring with new impossible to fulfil promises.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is not only going to cause danger to cyclists and all road users, it will also waste taxpayer dollars by not achieving its intended purpose of reducing traffic congestion. Nobody likes sitting in traffic - we can all agree on that. And cars are a necessary part of our modern life. However, if the government truly wanted to lessen driving times, the only proven way to do that is to get more people out of their cars. The proven way to do this is to make it more convenient and safer to ride a bike, walk, or take transit. There will always be some people who need to drive to get around, whether because of disabilities or their line of work, or multitudes of other reasons. But how nice would it be for those people if they didn't have to share the road with cars filled with every single other person in Ontario, who might rather get around another way, if it were safe to do so? Please let us remain having the freedom of choice to safely bike to our destinations, making the commute faster for drivers.\nIf you don't care that this bill will result in more people being killed while riding bikes, you can at least care that it will actually do the opposite of it's intended purpose, and actually increase traffic. Studies show time and time again that adding car lanes leads to an increase in car traffic, and an increase in commute time.\nBut if you do care about people's lives, the evidence is clear that this will increase the number of road deaths. This is not only devastating for the people who will be killed and their families and friends, but also for the people who will accidentally kill them (drivers) due to poor road safety design. If you hit someone while driving, that would weigh on most people's conscience for the rest of their lives. The loss of life is always devastating, and impacts everyone who uses the roads. However, accidents happen. And they will happen more because of this bill, which does not consider the safety of everyone who uses the roads.\n"

        "comment": "My comments below refer to Schedule 4 Part XII - Municipal By-laws and Bicycle Lanes.\nTwo years ago, my city installed new infrastructure on my main route to my child's daycare. Originally four lanes of car traffic, the new configuration allows for completely separated pedestrian sidewalks, protected bike lanes on each side, and three lanes of car traffic (a center turning lane and two one-way lanes for each direction).\nThese protected bike lanes have enabled me to safely and conveniently take my child on the four kilometre trip to our daycare using my bicycle year round. I have also been able to use my bike along this route to easily access shops, get groceries, and run errands. Moreover, driving on this route is now far more convenient as if I'm required to turn left I can use a dedicated left turn lane. It's also easier to avoid conflict with vulnerable road users as now everybody has properly allocated space.\nIn addition to the quality of life improvements, these bike lanes have saved our family money. We used to be a two car household, but now we only need one. This saves on gas, maintenance, insurance, monthly car payments, interest, and all of the other costs associated with car ownership. The annual savings is likely in the $6000-$12000 range, which is massive for us as we're just starting our family. We would not have been able to do go down to one car if our city had not installed this protected cycling infrastructure.\nThough bike lane connectivity is improving in our city, there is still much work to be done. There are many places that are currently don't have safe cycling infrastructure. Earlier this year, somebody was struck cycling and killed. There was no bike lane, but there were four lanes of car traffic. The person killed was legally riding on the right side of the road, and the person who hit her was at fault. This incident would not have occurred if there was proper cycling lanes in this area.\nI'm deeply concerned about the legislation being proposed that would greatly hinder progress being made in our city and throughout Ontario. I don't believe this will help people in Ontario, but will likely make things worse. It will make commuting more difficult and life more expensive for everybody. More people will be maimed or die on our streets by motorists. The proposed legislation risks reinforcing a car-centric approach to urban planning, prioritizing private vehicles over all other modes of transport.\nThe threat of removing existing cycling lanes is also very worrying. There really are not any practical side street options for our my commute without the current infrastructure. We would likely be forced into buying another car (which we really cannot afford as we're barely making ends-meet).\nI hope this government will take into careful consideration these comments and the comments of everybody else who will be affected by this legislation.\n"

There is significant evidence that car lane expansion in both cities and highways result in more congestion due to induced demand. The expansion of highways and the resulting increase of private motor vehicle ownership will inevitably speed up climate change, worsen traffic and  increase Ontario's dependence on fossil fuels. By expanding car infrastructure, the government fails to solve the main problem of transporting goods and people efficiently and discriminates against those who cannot afford or chose not to own a private motor vehicle. The act fundamentally worsens the issues it proposes to fix.\nThere are certain proposals that are concerning from a democratic point of view. It proposes power to bypass the Environmental Assessment Act as well as the Environmental Bill of Rights. It also restricts land owner's ability to propose a later land appropriation date if they would require it for the completion of the highway 413 and similar projects.

As Architects working in the sustainability sector we are in a highly competitive field for skilled talent.\nWe recently looked for a new office and our choice was based in large part on the ease of getting to work for our staff, who being predominately under 40 years old and living in the GTA tend not to drive private cars. We chose our new office because it IS on a major street (Danforth AVe) with dedicated bike lanes, public transit - the subway - and also decent parking options nearby.\nCongestion on the roads impacts our business everyday as we conduct a lot of site visits during construction as well as off-site meetings. Whenever possible, I and much of my staff choose to ride bikes because they are faster and more predictable than driving, and as a bonus healthier too.\nI have found that contrary t0 the premise of this act that roads like Danforth Ave with dedicated bike lanes are actually faster to drive on than QUeen ST or Eastern Ave, neither of which has bike lanes.\nIf the province wishes to get serious about reducing congestion in the GTA, lest get the Eglinton crosstown, Finch LRT and Ontario lines built.

As the province assumes responsibility for deciding how such infrastructure is to be built, why are they being shielded from liability?

        "comment": "As a concerned citizen, one who drives and commutes to my office using the TTC, i respect those who choose to cycle and i am very concerned about their safety.\nWe are bringing more people into the city, they have to commute, our transportation system is not adequate, there are not room for more cars, bikes are necessary, we need to accommodate them and keep the cyclists and drivers safe - bike lanes is the best way to do so.  - Their impact on traffic is overstated. What is actually causing our congestion is too many people driving relative to our road capacity. We need more alternatives to driving. The more we encourage people to drive, the worse our congestion is going to get. The congestion on the 401, the Gardiner, on Kingston Road in Scarborough, Hurontario Street in Mississauga, or Queen Street in Brampton, are not because of bike lanes. This is a regional issue that is far more complex than three bike lanes.\n- Removing these lanes will not improve traffic. This is because of induced demand which shows us that as road capacity is increased for cars, more people drive, eating up that added capacity. This is something that has been proven all over the world, including here in Toronto.\n- One of the oft-repeated reasons against these bike lanes is that they negatively impact emergency response times. This is false. The deputy fire chief has said so himself. The hospitals on University Avenue are very supportive of the bike lanes given the high number of hospital workers who cycle to work. If emergency response times were being impacted, these institutions would not be so supportive. Why would this government ignore what these hospitals and medical professionals have said about these bike lanes?\n- Bike lanes are great for local businesses! This has been noted all over the world, including in Toronto where the Bloor Annex BIA recently came out in support of the lanes noting that it has increased their customer base and revenues. I would think that this would be something important to the current government. While I understand that some businesses have come out against the lanes in the areas where they are relatively new, this is a typical response when these lanes get built - initial response is negative with fear that they will hurt businesses, but once the lane has become established after a few years these businesses generally see their benefit.\n- There has been some talk of moving these bike lanes to 'secondary streets' as a compromise. I believe they need to be on main streets because that is where people's destinations are! Main corridors are where people work, shop, dine, and live. There are also few streets that run parallel to major corridors for long distances. Moving them to other streets will either lead to zig-zagging routes or will put them on corridors that do not have destinations that people need to get to. Either way, cyclists will still use the main corridors. This means that drivers will have to share a lane with the cyclist rather than being separated from them. This is frustrating from a driver's perspective, and it also increases the chances for conflicts or collisions.\n- Cycling is in its infancy in Toronto but is increasingly becoming a popular transportation option, particularly in central locations. By the end of 2024, the number of Bike Share trips will surpass 6 million rides if it hasn't already, almost 10x the number in 2015! And Bike Share only accounts for 12% of bike trips in Toronto - we're talking well over 100,000 bike trips per day on average in Toronto and potentially 50,000,000+ per year at this point. As the Downtown and areas like Midtown Toronto continue to intensify, the number of cyclists is only going to increase - these new buildings often have very few car parking spaces, but do have a significant number of bike parking spaces, often at a ratio of more than 1 per unit. We need to expand our bike infrastructure, not contract it - cycling is going to keep growing in Toronto.\n- The data that has been quoted by the Premier, Minister Sarkaria and others in this government is incredibly misleading. Using a Toronto CMA commute mode data point from 2011 is not a serious approach to data analysis. Regional data and commute patterns in other municipalities should not impact how streets are planned in Downtown Toronto. Instead, decision-making should consider local modal splits. Commuting data for areas served by bike lanes show many locations with 10%+ bike commuters. But even then, the number of cyclists is far higher than this. The commuting data only captures primary mode of commute - so someone who bikes 2 days a week and drives 3 days is captured as a driver not a cyclist, someone who commutes by bike to school is not captured in the data, someone who cycles for reasons other than commuting like going to the grocery store or visiting friends and family is not captured. To boil this down to the fact that 1.2% of people in the Toronto CMA cycled as their primary mode of commuting in 2011 is incredibly misleading.\n- Cycling can be the fastest and cheapest way to travel in central areas. While I totally understand that cycling from Etobicoke or Brampton to Queen's Park may not be feasible, there are thousands of people for which it does potentially make sense. For myself personally, it takes me 25 minutes to bike to work and costs me about $100-$200 per year. If I chose to take transit it would take me 45-75 minutes and cost me about $1,000 annually. If I drive, it would take me 25 to 45 minutes depending on traffic, and cost me $4,000 or $5,000 annually. Which of these options provides me with the most time with my family? Which one is best for my cost of living? If you remove safe cycling infrastructure though, I am far more likely to get in my car given the unreliability of my transit options. That will give me less time with my family, less money in my pocket, and only add to our congestion challenges.\n- Lastly, bike lanes make our roads safer - for all road users, including drivers. This is something that has been proven to be true. You, This change will make my lives less safe.  Is that worth it in the hopes that a small number of drivers on these routes MIGHT save what, 2 minutes?\nThis decision about bike lanes does a number of things - it adds red tape, it reduces choice, it hurts small businesses, it reduces public safety, ignores evidence, prioritizes inefficiency, and wastes money. My understanding is that this government is against all of these things, however, this move seems to show otherwise.\nIf the government has evidence that these bike lanes are harmful to the community or that the above is false, I would strongly encourage you to release this data to be scrutinized. If it is strong evidence, it will hold up to that scrutiny.\nThe solution to our congestion problems is to get more people out of cars by giving them reliable and convenient alternatives to driving. We need to move away from the idea that we should be able to drive quickly anywhere anytime, particularly in central areas. We also need to stop thinking of bicycles as a niche recreational activity and start recognizing that they are an important part of urban transportation systems. Designing cities with more choice in how to get around works better for everyone, including drivers. Car dependency has always been the biggest single contributor to car congestion.\nPlease remove the bike lane portion of Bill 212. There is no evidence that removing bike lanes will ease congestion in Toronto - but removing them will negatively impact a lot of people's lives and safety.\n"

Bike lanes and other such municipal infrastructure are often already evaluated as part of a Municipal Class Environmental Assessment and go through years of study prior to detailed design. Requiring municipalities to seek ministerial approval adds an additional layer of study and arbitrary approvals prior the installation of crucial infrastructure. I also find this change to be contrary to the strong mayors initiative that seeks to empower municipalities. Is the intent of this administration to empower municipalities to build more and faster or to add additional red tape that entrenched the idea that Ontario is a car dominant place? Finally, as a person who cannot drive for health reasons, having a reliable network of bike lanes across Toronto and Southern Ontario has broadened my exploration of the region. I use my bike daily in Toronto as it is my primary mode of transportation, and wished that I could have this freedom when I was much younger. My younger siblings no longer have to rely on our parents to drive them around. The expansion of the bike lane system has given me, and other similarly abled people, a level of autonomy and mobility I could not have imagined years ago.
