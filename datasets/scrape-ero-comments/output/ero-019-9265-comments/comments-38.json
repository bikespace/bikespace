        "comment": "I bike every single day. I know many people who in the last year have started biking as their means of getting around Toronto. This number will only grow with better infrastructure for biking. It is the most convenient option for more people and with better bike infrastructure it is safer and accessible for more people. Getting rid of bike lanes that already exist would frankly be a foolish idea, a waste of city time and money, and an unravelling of all the good work done. Bike lanes are making the city a better place, improving the quality of life for many. They take me to work. They take me to my friends, to restaurants, to my family. They allow me to get to my destination so much faster than a car or public transit. Look at cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam \u2013 world class cities rely on good bike infrastructure. Please, for the sake of our quality of life and the future of Toronto, do not get rid of these bike lanes and please continue to make Toronto a better connected, bike networked city.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the Bill 212 - it will cause more issues than it is trying to resolve, the bike lanes are necessary within the city - they help in reducing traffic, congestion and are an eco friendly way of transportation and I say this by experience - I try to use public transit as much as I can when I travel to the city and use the shared bikes to connect from one mode of transport to another. Even though I own a car, I don't want to harm the environment and cycling within the city has helped me a lot in exploring new neighbourhoods, make new friends and find new spots to eat/hang out. If not for the bike lanes, I would just be speeding away in my car and skipping all these places.\nThe deaths caused by vehicular collisions will increase if this bill is passed as there will be less security for cyclists on the road. The cyclists and pedestrians should be preferred on all the roads - using cars for shorter distances cause more fuel usage/wastage and cause more weariness in the cars  and in some cases, it takes more time to travel by car for shorter distances or within the narrow streets of the cities.\nIt is my humble request to the authorities that more awareness is provided to the public and cycling should be encouraged and not discouraged by taking resources away from it.\nWe need to look at the statistics of cities in other countries which promoted cycling as primary mode of private transportations and without giving specific numbers, they resulted in betterment of the lives of the residents - they became more active and healthy and more social.\nMany cities allow cycles to be carried in the subways/trams and trains/buses which results in people relying less on motor vehicles which would reduce the needs to highways and will reduce gridlocks and protected bike lanes will promote better flow of traffic - all of which this bill is trying to achieve.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are safer and attract more cyclists on the road. That means less cars on the road - the exact OPPOSITE of what Ford is suggesting.\nPeople will choose to bike in the city more frequently when lanes are an option. This is more environmentally friendly and important from a public health standpoint (higher cardiovascular, and general fitness).\nThese bike lanes were implemented for a reason and should be utilized. Removing them is a massive waste of public funds - especially since one was JUST finished.\nDo the research on how adding lanes for cars increases congestion!\n"

        "comment": "Every major city in the world is investing in bike lanes, not reducing. It will cost millions of tax payer dollars to remove lanes, and then to put them again somewhere else. Yes, we have a traffic problem, but bike lanes can help that. Please, for the province\u2019s sake, take a data based approach. Look at ridership, how it\u2019s changed over time, and how adding bike lanes has significantly increased the number of bikers. People don\u2019t bike when there\u2019s no safe route.\n"

        "comment": "The province's desire to remove bike lanes in the municipality of Toronto is an over reach. The urban planning for flow of motorist, cyclist and pedestrian traffic should be determined solely by the constituents of Toronto and elected officials of Toronto.\nThis policy is also largely based in conjecture as opposed to statistics or urban planning theory.\nTime and time again it has been proven on a global scale that gridlock is reduced not by creating more lanes and motorways but by incentivizing people to simply NOT DRIVE. This is the exact purpose of the bike lanes in the proposed routes for their removal.\nLikewise, should the Ontario government set a precedent for this, they will gain the audacity to pull further bike lanes into review. And conversely, should another party gain power, they may take it upon themselves to unilaterally ADD bike routes in municipalities around the province, which I also disagree with.\nAttached to my comment you will find four documents - three are images of Bloor Street prior to the bike lane installation, and one is a 2022 election map of Toronto screenshot from https://results.elections.on.ca/en/graphics-charts\nThe election map is to demonstrate that the regions in which the bike routes are under review are ridings in which Doug Ford's PC Party did not even win the seat.\nThe images of Bloor make it clear - prior to the bike lane installation there were primarily two lanes of traffic on Bloor and two lanes of parking. Now, there are two lanes of traffic, two lanes of parking AND two lanes of cycling. While I understand the current layout of street parking and the bike lanes prohibits the oscillation of parking (ie, no parking between 7am-10am and 3pm-7pm to ensure four lanes of traffic), any congestion on Bloor Street will actually remain largely the same.\nLikewise, the routes described (Bloor, Yonge, University) are largely traversed by cyclists commuting to businesses and employment, and subsidized by another form of transportation that is highly efficient and helps reduce vehicular congestion as well - it's called the subway.\nThe fact that the government wants to increase vehicular traffic SPECIFICALLY along routes that are already highly serviced by public transit is beyond me.\nLastly, the Bloor Street Pilot study in 2016 after the installation of the bike lane from Shaw to Avenue on Bloor determined the following data:\nTRAFFIC DATA\n- The average total traffic volumes on Bloor Street West decreased from approximately 24,300 per day prior to the bike lane to 20,000 per day (-16 per cent).\n- There was modest diversion of traffic volumes, with an increase of seven per cent to Dupont Street (+1470) and four per cent to Harbord Street (+580). Overall traffic volumes across all three corridors were down three per cent (-1840).\n- Six weeks after installation, travel times between Bay Street and Ossington Avenue initially increased by approximately four minutes eastbound in the morning peak period and approximately eight and a half minutes westbound in the afternoon peak period.\n- Signal timing adjustments reduced the increases by half \u2013 the eastbound direction in the morning peak period was reduced to approximately two minutes and the increase in the westbound direction in the afternoon peak period was reduced to just over four minutes.\nCYCLING DATA\n- more people are cycling with a 56% increase after install\n- safety improved for all users with a 44% decrease in all conflicts\nECONOMIC BENEFITS\nFollowing the implementation of the Bloor Street Pilot Project in 2016, two separate studies of the corridor found positive economic impacts associated with the bikeway.\nKey findings include:\nincrease in average number of customers\nincrease in customer spending\npeople who biked or walked spent more per month than those who drove or took transit\n(Source: https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation\u2026)\nIn other words, the positive impacts included that cyclists were safer, spent more money on Bloor Street at the businesses than motorists, and despite seeing an increase by A FEW MINUTES during peak hours for driving on Bloor Street, and a slight increase in traffic on Harbord and Dupont, the overall amount of traffic on the road went down because more people were cycling.\nThank you for taking the time to review my comment.\nYours truly - a deeply concerned constituent of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a heavy user of bike lanes all year around in Toronto and this is because of the safety that they offer. I feel that it is highly important to keep these lanes in place and in fact build out more as people will use them if they are there. With growing travel times by car biking is becoming more and more of a better option. I made the switch to biking a year and a half ago and I have not driven to work since even in the dead of winter it makes sense as long as these lanes are in place.\nAside from all this it just doesn\u2019t make sense financially to remove something that was just installed and costs millions.\nThanks\n"

        "comment": "I strongly support the maintenance and expansion of bike lanes in Toronto. First, I think that policy decisions should be made with data and in consultation with municipal leaders. I generally support the current government, but its conduct around this particular law seems cynical and poorly structured to me, which sows greater doubts about the competence of my elected officials. Second, I would like to see better recognition and study of the issues affecting gridlock, which in my experience relate to ongoing, poorly-managed construction projects much more than bike lanes. Third, as a cyclist and a driver, I think the safety of all road users needs to be weighed much more heavily than I have seen from the government.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 is Bad Public Policy\nMy comments are restricted to the Bill 212 provisions to require provincial approval for bike lanes that remove a lane for car traffic, and the apparent (though yet to be published) regulation to remove bike lanes from specific Toronto roads, including Bloor, University, and Yonge. I also oppose Highway 413, which will simply add to Ontario's negative climate impacts, promote sprawl, and encourage more driving leading to more road traffic congestion.\nBill 212 --- and the regulation proposed by the Premier in his public comments --- is bad public policy. The bill, which is not based on any evidence or research (despite the resources accessible to the government from the Ministry of Transportation)  is clearly designed to scapegoat one road user group and to create a wedge issue for the benefit of the Conservative Party in the upcoming provincial election. This type of bill diminishes respect for our elected leaders and democratic institutions.\nI add the following comments:\n1. The province should not micromanage or meddle in decisions that municipalities are best equipped to make. This bill imposes a new level of government in local decision-making, or what might be called more red tape. Premier Doug Ford promises less government, but is imposing more government on the residents of Ontario.\n2. The bill does nothing to address the causes of traffic congestion, namely:\n- urban sprawl;\n- the subsidized cost of driving, including recent government actions to reduce gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees; and\n- the lack of good alternatives, including mass transit and active transportation.\n3. The bill provides no meaningful solutions, such as:\n- slowing and addressing urban sprawl;\n- increasing investment in mass transit;\n- promoting car pooling; and\n- providing residents with safe, active transportation alternatives.\n4. The bill is not based on any evidence. It is beyond curious that there is no research or study to back up this bill -- including the proposed (yet to be published) regulation to remove bike lanes from Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street.\n5. By removing bike lanes from dangerous arterial roads --- as the Premier has proposed in his public statements, thereby contradicting his own Minister of Transportation --- this bill will lead to preventable deaths and serious injuries not only for cyclists but for pedestrians who have benefited from the extra safety buffer that a bike lane offers as part of a Complete Streets project.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the bill. I trust that these comments will be given serious consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is an essential mode of transportation in Toronto. Bike lanes are essential for cyclists', motorists' and pedestrians' safety. If bike lanes are removed, cylcists will be forced to share the road with motorists, who are often not aware of cyclists and/or drive in a manner that puts their safety at risk. Toronto's congestion problem is the result of poor city planning and the influx of new Torontonians. While some bike lanes have reduced the number of vehicle lanes, Torontonians relying on cylcing as a mode of transport actually reduces traffic congestion. If the province is serious about reducing gridlock, it should invest in our public transit and in better bike infrastructure.\n"
