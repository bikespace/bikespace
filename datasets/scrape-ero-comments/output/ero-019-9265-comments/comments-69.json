By spending millions of dollars to tear up bicycle lanes, the Minister of Transportation will make a liar of the Premier.  This waste of our money would be akin to flushing it down the toilet. Millions of our dollars wasted.  A terrible mistake and disrespectful of taxpayers.\nInstead, the Minister needs to show leadership by taking one of his other responsibilities, GO Transit, from Brampton to Union Station and then the TTC (or walk) to Queen's Park, as thousand of responsible Brampton and area citizens do every work day.\nHis misguided view that creating more lanes for traffic will reduce gridlock is simply not accurate.  I suggest he view the photos circa 1960 of the then recently-created Gardiner Expressway already jammed with traffic as people abandoned transit for the \"ease\" of driving themselves from suburbs to downtown.\nThe same goes for poor ideas like Highway 413, which will only increase traffic.  The Minister said this highway will help people to get into the city, in fact its proposed route would angle traffic around the city.  His statement is not logical.  It does not stand up to scrutiny when viewed on a map.\nA far better idea is to increase use of the existing Hwy 407 which many, many people have proposed.  Now that is a smart idea, which this Minister and Premier need to embrace.  Not the poor ideas proposed in this legislation which will set Ontario on a downward spiral.\nMunicipalities have rightly denounced the overreach of the province in trying to force their poor planning ideas on municipalities.  Municipalities know their communities much better than the province can.  It's okay for you to admit this and stop meddling.  Instead focus on provincial responsibilities like improving our health care, housing and education systems which are priorities.  This legislation is a poor deflection from the province carrying out its urgent responsibilities.\n"

Providing more opportunities for car travel will only encourage car travel - more cars purchased and more cars on the road. If there\u2019s more highways, people will certainly take them, but it\u2019s not going to even out the road travellers and ease traffic.  The traffic will just continue, adding another backed up highway to the ones we already have. Ford Government is leading us into perpetually clogged system of travel. Is this Fords weird scheme to increase car purchasing and production in Canada? Perhaps to support a buddy of his in the automobile industry?\nIf you really wanted to reduce traffic in the city, the obvious choice would be limiting the amount of vehicles entering its roadways. Why don\u2019t we look at making non-residents of Toronto getting a permit to drive in the city? This would entourage folks to explore the amazing go train and ttc system and reduce cards on the road. I\u2019m sure \u2018Rick\u2019 from Oshawa doesn\u2019t really need to drive his Chevrolet Silverado into Toronto every Leaf Game.\nThe environment impact of added highways and car travel is obvious. Why does Ford want a smellier polluted world? All this money we could save in highways could go towards more advanced sustainable travel options. We have a great thing started with GO, why not invest in that?\nUnfortunately, I cannot support this bill because I have lost faith in the Ford Government to make the just decisions. Municipalities have been doing a fantastic job modernizing their roadways and Fords ideas are out of touch with reality. Stay in your lane Ford, for awhile you had be satisfied at dollar beers in my 20s but now that I\u2019m building a family, like many other folks, I\u2019m trying to secure a positive, meaningful, and sustainable future for the next generation.\n"

Drivers are the most privileged of all road users and continue to be given the most leeway and accommodations. That is not equality.\nCars are not the way of the future and although we have a long way to go still, the bike lanes have actually forced drivers to pay attention, yield and accept that cyclists are a legitimate part of their commute.

        "comment": "As a resident of Etobicoke, Ontario, I wish to express my opposition to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. As a motorist, I oppose the inadequacy of the proposed actions as a solution to municipal gridlock. As a cyclist, I oppose the inadequacy of this Bill in ensuring safe and equitable access for all vehicles. Furthermore, as a concerned citizen, I oppose the proposed construction of roadways, specifically Highway 413 without comprehensive planning. Altogether, I strongly believe that these measures represent, at best, a short-term, band-aid solution to gridlock that will only push greater problems onto Ontarians in the future.\nI live with my husband and small children in Etobicoke, less than 500m north of Bloor Street, and work in the downtown core, near Union Station. I am a frequent motorist, cyclist and pedestrian, and therefore have a great deal of personal experience with the infrastructure affected by Bill 212.\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is a complex and long-standing issue which significantly predates the installation of bicycle lanes on arterial roadways into the city centre. With continuing population growth within the city and surrounding area, particularly in light of imminent development in the Kipling-Bloor area, simply reallocating an additional pre-existing lane of car traffic on these roads is woefully inadequate and shortsighted. Rather, this issue calls for innovative solutions that enable and encourage alternate modes of transport, including transit use, walking and cycling.\nThis is particularly true on mixed-use main streets such Bloor Street and Yonge Street, which support a large number of local residential, commercial and institutional destinations. The greatest benefit to both residents and local businesses requires access by a multitude of users, including motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, mobility device users, transit users, delivery services and emergency services. Unlike roadways such as the Gardiner Expressway, the primary function of these mixed-use roads is not to funnel the greatest possible number of vehicles to and from the city centre. As long as such local functions exist on these streets, they will be poorly suited to serve as the quickest and most reliable access to downtown by car.\nThe Bloor Street cycling lanes have particular personal relevance to me, I have used them to cycle downtown to work and to take my daughter to and from nursery school about 3km away along Bloor St. Without the stretch of bicycle lanes from Kipling Ave. to Islington Ave., in particular, there are no viable alternative routes that avoid major roads. I also cycle my son to daycare further north on Kipling Ave. I do not feel safe cycling alongside high-speed traffic on Kipling Ave., especially with a toddler in tow, and therefore I use side roads and trails. This increases my travel time by at least 60%, and also requires me to cross four major roads at uncontrolled intersections. Not only is this slow and dangerous, but it also frequently delays motorists behind me as I wait for a gap in 2-4 lanes of traffic. Despite this, cycling remains the most practical method to reach these destinations. Purchasing and operating a second vehicle simply to get our children to school is financially absurd.\nWhile the Ministry of Transportation defines bicycles as vehicles and has broad responsibility for ensuring their safe and appropriate use, it has traditionally been left to local municipalities to decide on the most appropriate way to ensure equitable access by motor vehicles and bicycles. To adequately perform this function, municipalities have developed a great deal of resources, knowledge and infrastructure, including local consultation with residents and businesses, urban planning experts, computer modelling, and traffic studies. As such, these municipalities are currently best placed to decide if and where cycling infrastructure should be installed. The use of side roads or trails for cycling is not objectionable in and of itself, provided these side roads provide a similarly efficient route to destinations across the city, including appropriate measures to allow timely and safe crossings at any major roads. Until such time as the MTO builds out the appropriate capacity to provision the alternate routes, it is evident that it does not have sufficient capability and expertise to ensure safe and equitable access to local roads, especially as the scope of this bill does not include the responsibility to ensure the suitability and adequacy of alternate cycling infrastructure. Local mixed-use roads are funded by taxes paid by residents and businesses within the municipality, and municipal governments are most familiar with local needs and most answerable to local taxpayers. Oversight over the particulars of these local roads must therefore continue to rest with local governments.\nFinally, I must also oppose Bill 212 with respect to accelerated construction on the proposed Highway 413. In addition to significant impacts on local residents and the environment, expressways constitute a significant component of provincial transportation. As such, it is absolutely vital that these projects are thoughtfully and thoroughly considered to ensure that they serve their intended function while minimizing negative consequences. Poor planning will only increase the likelihood of greater costs to taxpayers in the future.\nI was born in Ontario, and I am greatly appreciative of my home province and have deep roots here. I grew up mainly in small towns in the Golden Horseshoe. Some of my happiest childhood memories were at my grandparents' orchard in Niagara-on-the-Lake and my other grandparents' home and cottage near Georgian Bay. As an adult, I still visit relatives and travel around the province with my own family, whenever I can. As a resident of Etobicoke, I love my local neighborhood and neighbours. I appreciate the thriving, bustling city of Toronto that provides vital employment and cultural opportunities. I take pride in the bounty of produce that comes from highly fertile Ontario agricultural land and the beauty and inherent environmental value of our pristine wilderness. It is clear to me that if Ontario is to remain \"A Place to Grow\" for existing and future residents, thoughtful, thorough planning and good faith integration of all road users must be maintained and encouraged.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is an unnecessarily harmful proposal to the wellbeing people living in Ontario, as well as being especially harmful to people who live in Toronto, and should be opposed. I am concerned that this bill will have the effect of chilling bike lane development across Ontario. On top of that, this bill proposes to remove existing bike lanes! What should be supported is the current status quo where municipalities have the opportunity to decide for themselves where bike lanes should be located within their jurisdiction, and the bike lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Avenue should be allowed to remain as they currently are in the city of Toronto.\nBill 212 undermines Vision Zero and will contribute to increased car-cyclist conflicts, cyclist-pedestrian conflicts, and cyclist injuries and deaths.\nThis bill is also based on the untrue premise that bike lanes are unnecessary because there is little demand for them. Data shows that demand for cycling infrastructure can be induced through the construction of bike lanes. People cycle more when they know their route will be safe from potential collisions with cars. This effect is amplified when there is a broad network of bike lanes; every bike lane is thus crucial since it contributes to this network. Deliberately offering infrastructure that induces biking trips supports the City of Toronto's goal that \"75% of school/work trips under 5km are walked, biked, or by transit.\" However, Bill 212 would create an unnecessary obstacle to that policy target by reducing biking demand.\nHaving bike lanes also benefits car drivers. When more people are using bike lanes and thus out of cars, it decreases the amount of downtown car traffic, making travelling easier for car drivers as well. This is especially true in densely developed areas like downtown Toronto, but is a pattern that exists in all urban areas within Ontario.\nInducing cycling demand also helps the province meet its climate target. Over a third of Toronto's emissions come from burning gasoline in cars. Not enough people own EV's to make that a viable solution to the climate crisis, but facilitating the use of carbon-zero trips on a bicycle is. Bill 212 is likely to result in stalling development of cycling infrastructure. This will reduce cycling demand and increase demand for personal cars. This accelerates the climate crisis, resulting in harmful environmental conditions for Ontarians.\nBill 212 is damaging because it is an overreach by the provincial government into municipal affairs. Municipalities are the government most close to the issues that their taxpayers are concerned with. Thus, they should continue to be able to develop the infrastructure projects that they believe will benefit their constituency. The province is too far removed from these incredibly local issues to be able to make accurate, informed decisions about the trade offs of a particular bike lane proposal.\nBill 212 also unnecessarily wastes public money, and unnecessarily damages public trust in provincial and municipal government. The City of Toronto spent taxpayer dollars creating bike lanes on its streets. And, the majority of public opinion in the city is in favor of their continuation and timely expansion. Tearing them out will waste these taxpayers' money, undoing a project that they believe benefits them. Proposing to tear out these bike lanes so soon after their creation also damages public trust in municipal and provincial government. It makes it appear that the province goes one step forwards and one step back with respect to providing necessary services for its constituency. Also, like mentioned earlier, it makes it seem like the Government of Ontario is not concerned with the wellbeing of people who live in the province.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I absolutely do not support the proposals of Bill 212 such as the removal of EA requirements for major highway projects, and the removal of bike lanes in particular. The city of Toronto has done a wonderful job in expanding and connecting it's cycling infrastructure downtown, as any world class city that cares about sustainability and public health would. I personally use the University and Bloor bike lanes, a truly wonderful and commendable addition to the urban fabric and transportation options in the city. Bike lanes are not the reason why this city is experiencing gridlock, and are actually part of the solution to the problem. The fewer safe, reliable alternative mode options there are, is the more people will drive and the worse gridlock will be. These are simple principles which are well documented and proven, and that I can attest to as a Registered Professional Planner in Ontario. It's evident that the wealthy and privileged MPPs and Premier (who have never made choices to be more sustainable or had choose the cheaper transportation mode) should not be the ones telling the City of Toronto what to do with its transportation network. Municipalities must not be required to get provincial approval for bike infrastructure. Do not remove the bike lanes, do not move the city backwards, and do not waste money that should be spent on improving the transit and transportation network in other ways.\n"

I try to use my ebike as my primary source for transport and errands.\nIt is crucial that that the bike lanes on Bloor St., University Ave., & Yonge St. stay open.\nI use those lanes daily all throughout the year. Even in winter.\nI don\u2019t want my tax dollars to fund such a wasteful project to remove those important bike lanes.\nPlease reconsider the bill 212.\n"
