        "comment": "As a driver, cyclist, pedestrian and taxpayer  in this city I want to register my opinion that this bill is wrongheaded.  It puts cars before people.  Torontonians need safe spaces to move around.   Our sidewalks and bike lanes are. woefully inadequate.   Bikes and pedestrians bring vitality and quality of life to a community.  They support small businesses. And let's face it, most personal vehicles now are SUVs and pick up trucks. They bring pollution and make a city unliveable.  They take up an inordinate amount of space.   It will result in more deaths.\nThis bill is clearly ideological and tramples over municipal rights.   Under this current government a community can refuse a wind or solar farm in their area - but they have no say about how their residents get to school  or work.  This bill ignores local interests, and once again represents the current governments complete disdain for solutions that make cities liveable and resilient.\nSo next time I get sideswiped by a car or a car tries to force their way through a pedestrian crosswalk, I'll remind myself that this government empowered drivers to believe they own public spaces in this city.   I am sick of subsidizing automobiles to use up an innordinate amount of resources in this city and leave nothing but noise, pollution and damage.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI fully support the removal of the bike lanes between Keele St. And Islington Ave.\nI\u2019ve lived in Bloor West Village for 30 years, 800 metres from the Runnymede Subway Station.  I walk or drive along Bloor St daily.   Since the bike lanes were installed, I have not seen an increase in cycling.  I would use the word \u201crarely\u201d to describe the frequency of seeing a single bike on either side of the road.\nThere are alternate routes that the rarely seen cyclist could take between Keele and Islington that does not involve Bloor St.  One short block north on Keele enables travelling West through pretty tree lined neighbourhoods.  Bike lanes wouldn\u2019t be required on these side streets because there aren\u2019t enough cyclists to warrant it.\nI am not opposed to bike lanes when they are used by many, instead of a few.  For example, they make sense in areas of the City where many people are commuting to their jobs via bike.  That isn\u2019t the case in Bloor West as it\u2019s too far to commute downtown via bike, especially in our often inclement weather.   I believe there are better ways to have spent the money that was spent on installing these, for example, putting it towards making it free to ride the TTC to encourage more use of that.  I don\u2019t agree that the \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d theory is appropriate for every neighbourhood and shame on the City for saying there was appropriate consultation before installing them.\n"

I can understand the necessity to move quickly, in the context of building highways, but bike lanes within dense urban cities are a proven strategy to alleviate congestion. The province should not be making this decision on behalf of the municipality, especially after they\u2019ve already been constructed. It\u2019s simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n"

This is clearly an attempt to exempt lands slated for Highway 413 from the appropriate (and necessary) environmental assessments, regardless of the claim that the \"...MTO will continue to maintain existing environmental processes to mitigate environmental impacts...\".\nThe area where Highway 413 is planned to be built is environmentally sensitive land, and paving over it will have disastrous outcomes for the environment and for our future here in Ontario. Running a highway through it means this land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever.\nThe proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and is not serious about eliminating gridlock.\nThe way forward is not to build yet another highway on environmentally sensitive - and necessary - lands, but to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nThis bill should not move forward.\n"

In fact, numerous studies and mathematical models show that induced demand only makes traffic worse. I urge the provincial government not to waste tax dollars removing bike lanes that thousands of people use daily, and instead demonstrate an ounce of accountability to finishing the transit projects (Eglinton Crosstown) that have face repeated delays.\nPassing this bill is a step backward for Toronto, undermining the vibrant, world-class city it is known to be.\nExempting Highway 413 from an environmental assessment is not only shortsighted but also shows a disregard for environmental protection. I question the technical expertise of the planners, engineers, and policymakers involved in this decision and request the release of any analysis or studies that support these line items.\nThis bill is exactly why I look forward to voting the Doug Ford government out of office in the next election cycle.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will not reduce gridlock. It will make the roads less safe for bikers, forcing more people to take cars everywhere due to the complete lack of viable transit options in the city of Toronto, thus introducing more gridlock in the city.\nThe correct way to reduce gridlock is not to limit travel options (especially carbon emission conscious travel options) for people. You must consider that the sheer number of cars on the road is what is causing gridlock. How can we reduce the number of required cars for people to be able to get where they need to go? Provide other travel options that are not cars. Improve transit. Make it easy for people to bike, carpool, or take a train instead of driving.\nYou can improve the flow of traffic without reducing the number of bike lanes in Toronto and this proposal is very far off base from what the residents of the city want.\n"

        "comment": "Decisions about adding bike lanes in a community shouldn\u2019t be made at the provincial level; it\u2019s too broad a scope to understand the unique needs of each municipality. Bike lanes are a local issue, and it doesn\u2019t make sense for provincial authorities to be overruling or directing these kinds of projects. Bill 212 is a serious overreach.\nAs someone who works and lives in the city core while also bikes year-round, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how valuable bike lanes are. There\u2019s so much evidence showing they improve the health, safety, and well-being of communities. Bike lanes encourage people to stay active, reduce dependence on cars, and help make neighborhoods cleaner and more pedestrian-friendly. Removing them would just push more people into cars, adding to road congestion and forcing cyclists to use driving lanes, which slows traffic even more. This year alone, six cyclists have already died on Toronto streets. Cutting back on bike lanes would be a huge step backward\u2014we actually need more bike lanes, not fewer.\nHaving strong cycling infrastructure, along with other alternative transportation options, makes our cities fairer and safer for everyone. I really hope the Ministry will look at the overwhelming data backing these benefits and make a decision based on evidence.\nAnother part of Bill 212 is that it would allow projects like Highway 413 to skip the Environmental Assessment Act, which sets standards to protect our environment. Skipping these assessments just to speed up projects is reckless and short-sighted. We need these measures to hold everyone accountable and make sure developments are sustainable. I urge the Ministry to stick to its commitment to a healthy, sustainable future for all of us.\n"

As an avid cyclist, taxpayer, and concerned citizen, I want to emphasize that bikes are not the cause of traffic congestion; rather, they offer a sustainable solution to it.\nRemoving bike lanes will not solve our traffic issues\u2014instead, it will likely worsen them. When cyclists are forced onto the road without dedicated lanes, it creates a more dangerous environment for everyone, ultimately leading to more frustration and congestion. Studies have shown that cities with well-planned cycling infrastructure experience less traffic, as more people opt to ride rather than drive. Instead of viewing cycling as a contributor to traffic, we should recognize it as a vital component of a holistic transportation strategy that promotes public health, reduces pollution, and enhances our city\u2019s livability.\nMoreover, dismantling existing bike lanes would be a significant waste of public resources. The investment made in creating and maintaining these lanes is designed to promote safer cycling and to encourage a shift toward greener modes of transportation. Rather than dismantling what we have, we should be enhancing and expanding our cycling infrastructure, which has proven benefits for public health, the environment, and the economy.\nIn a city facing urgent challenges related to traffic, pollution, and public health, we cannot afford to take steps backward. Let\u2019s focus on developing solutions that benefit everyone, not just drivers, and support a more sustainable future.\nI urge you all to reconsider this bill and advocate for policies that prioritize safe cycling as an integral part of our transportation network.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this proposal. As a cyclist who rides on a daily basis, I feel like this proposal is a direct attack on me and my safety. The government claims that bike lanes the cause of gridlock, and removing them will 'get driver where they need to go faster'. However, this opinion is misinformed for multiple reasons:\n1. New bike lanes have not been shown to cause longer travel times. There are many other factors increasing travel times, including: more cars on the road post-pandemic, increased construction projects. Bike lanes actually can help reduce travel times by taking cars off the road. If there is better cycling infrastructure, commuters are more likely to take their bike to work, instead of their car. This removes a car from the traffic, which will reduce congestion.\n2. New bike lanes have not been shown to increase emergency response times. Emergency services of Toronto have not reported increased response times for calls.\n3. Adding more lanes of traffic will just encourage more people to drive, and will increase congestion.\nBike lanes have other benefits as well, regardless of traffic and congestion:\n- safety for cyclists and drivers. With separated bike lanes, collisions between cyclists and cars decrease. Cyclists have been seriously injured and have died previously, due to collisions with cars. Everyone should have a right to get to work, and move around the city safely. Many use a bike because they cannot afford a car and it's associated costs (parking, gas etc.). By removing bike lanes, it is showing the province that the government cares more about drivers than they do cyclists. Cyclist fatalities and serious injuries will increase with the removal of bike lanes.\n- reduced environmental impact. With better cycling infrastructure, more people are likely to ride their bike, instead of taking a car. This lowers emissions, which is beneficial for the environment.\n- health - cycling is better for the health of Ontarians. The government should be encouraging more people to cycle, which could have downstream affects on health and health care costs.\nRipping up already existing bike lanes has the following negative impacts:\n- Cost: there has already been a cost to install these bike lanes - the cost to remove them will be even higher. We are already in a deficit.\n- Construction congestion: while these bike lanes are being removed, there will be extra lanes of traffic closed for construction. This will actually increase congestion.\nTelling cyclists to use side streets on their commute is not a practical solution. Many of the sidestreets end after a few blocks, and cyclists are forced to zig zag through the neighbourhoods. This increases their travel time. Why is it more important for a driver to decrease their travel time, while a cyclist is forced to increase theirs? This proposal is not equitable and is putting driver's priority above the rest of the population.\nThe use of bikes has increased significantly over the last 5 years, which is when the majority of these bike lanes have been installed. Why do we want to move backwards?\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Provincial Government's proposal to require municipalities to get provincial approval for bike lanes that remove a traffic lane is misguided and directly against public interest. Major Ontario cities, especially Toronto, face severe gridlock due to decades of inadequate investment in modern, safe, and effective transit options by several provincial and federal governments. Urban road networks cannot sustainably accommodate more cars without sacrificing livability, sustainability, travel times, and safety.\nPromoting cycling and other alternative transportation methods is essential to reducing gridlock, increasing livability, and dealing with emissions caused by car traffic. The City of Toronto, funded by its own budget, is responsible for its transportation infrastructure, and the provincial government neither funds these roads nor should it have authority over local bike lane decisions.\nThis proposal is not a genuine attempt to address gridlock but a politically motivated move based on misguided assumptions. It undermines public safety, urban sustainability, and quality of life. The regulation should be dismissed to protect the interests of Toronto and its residents.\n"

Instead of worrying about bike lanes, why not look at removing on-street parking from major arteries, like every other city in the world?
