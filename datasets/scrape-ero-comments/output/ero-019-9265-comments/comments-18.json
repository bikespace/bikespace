        "comment": "As a supporter of the Ford government, I appreciate its commitment to improving Ontario\u2019s infrastructure and addressing congestion challenges. However, as an ICU healthcare worker who, along with my partner, relies on Toronto\u2019s bike lanes for our daily commute to Mount Sinai Hospital, I am concerned that Bill 212 may not achieve these goals as effectively as intended. Without a car, we depend on bike lanes as an efficient and safe way to reach our essential roles at work.\nRemoving key bike lanes on main routes like Bloor, Yonge, and University will push cyclists into shared lanes with cars, which could inadvertently create more congestion and risk for everyone on the road. Imagine the frustration of driving behind a cyclist on a backed up University Ave, forced to slow down or navigate around them\u2014this situation increases delays and the risk of accidents. Mixing bike and car traffic, rather than separating them, could ultimately work against efforts to reduce congestion by removing a proven, efficient alternative for thousands of city commuters.\nEnsuring that bike lanes are available for those who depend on them allows roads to operate more smoothly, with safer, separated routes that keep everyone moving. A balanced transportation policy that incorporates well-planned bike infrastructure supports personal freedom, public safety, and efficient commuting\u2014all key elements of a strong urban economy.\nI respectfully urge decision-makers to reconsider the restrictive measures in Bill 212 and instead support a balanced approach to urban infrastructure that keeps Ontario\u2019s roads both efficient and safe for all residents.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

More highways causes more gridlock because it just produces more places for cars to go to instead of doing transportation that is space efficient. Like trains and bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Nobody wants a tunnel under the Highway 401. We don't want our bike network removed in Toronto. We want safe, easy to use infrastructure that reduces the number of car trips and makes it less likely that I am KILLED while traveling to work, school, or recreation. I am both a driver and a cyclist. I do not want to have to share lanes with cyclists when I'm driving, and I do not want to share the road with drivers when I'm cycling. This proposal is profoundly misguided and lacks any basis in any form of research or scientific analysis. This is clearly a cynical election ploy from a government that is trying to avoid public pressure for its brazen corruption regarding the Ontario Science Centre, Ontario Place, the Greenbelt, and more. This proposal MUST be rescinded.\n"

        "comment": "i can't believe i have to say this but BIKE LANES ARE GOOD FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING DRIVERS\nThey make it safer and easy for not only people on bikes to get around, but also people who walk or people on scooters or who have mobility devices and literally everyone outside of a car.\nBut that doesn't mean they are harmful for drivers, in fact the opposite. More people biking or walking or taking transit = less cars on the road = less traffic = makes driving BETTER for people who have to drive or want to drive.\nBy giving people options of how to get around, everyone will pick whatever option is best for them and everything is better for EVERYONE.\nRemoving bike lanes and forcing streets to be wider than they need to for the sake of what drivers want will just cause more people to not bother with anything other than driving, causing more traffic.\nThis is how we got in this mess after the past 50+ years.\nDoug Ford and his government is actively ignoring the data and what people want and cherry picking data they want or flat out making stuff up in order to destroy Toronto's bike lanes and in turn ruin other cities from having a chance of improving their own transportation networks.\nThis bill is a giant step in the wrong direction and will ruin transportation in, not just Toronto but the province just because the conservative government and the vocal minority of drivers hate cyclists.\nWe're better than this. This should not pass. It defies logic and is a factually evil bill.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is the dumbest thing I have ever read. The first paragraph of information just says we are going to allow the theft of land from anyone. Forcing utilities to move just makes life for everyone more complicated due to disruptions in services. It introduces more bureaucracy to infrastructure that would actually help with grid lock. like making it hard to implement bike lanes. If the government truly wanted to deal with grid lock they would make it a lot hard to get a drivers license, build out rail infrastructure and update all forms of public transit and to promote it making it more affordable for every one. adding more highways just makes more people think they can add another car to the road having the opposite effect to the intent of the bill.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed bill and the province overstepping its jurisdiction to muddle in municipal affairs. Money and time should be spent improving infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists and those using public transit, rather than upholding outdated, environmentally unfriendly, unsustainable car-centric infrastructure. Look to any developed metropolitan area outside of North America and it is abundantly clear that in order to build livable, sustainable communities, a focus needs to be placed on moving away from car-centric infrastructure.\nI reside in the tri-city area (Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge) where there has been a concerted effort to improve walkability and bikability of the cities. People will choose alternative forms of transit when it is safe, affordable and accessible. And people are using these new bike lanes not only for recreation but also to commute. Why is the Ford government trying to take this away from cities? This bill is so shortsighted and will have profoundly detrimental impacts on the growth and economic development of Ontario communities.\nStay in your own lane and out of municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill. This bill does not even distinguish between main roads and side streets and doesn\u2019t take cyclists into consideration. Why would we reverse the progress we made and waste tax payer dollars ripping out bike lanes that we just spent money on to build how is this an effective use of our time and resources? Why does this bill only focus on saving a couple minutes of commute time for drivers but not for cyclists? Cyclists pay taxes just like motorists do should they not have bike infrastructure like cars do? Does the safety and convenience of cyclists and/or students and kids who would like to be able to safely bike to school or work not matter? I think that it is unfair that this governments sole focus is on drivers over everybody else especially at a time when things are so expensive and not everyone can afford to drive everywhere. I would also argue that reversing progress made on our bike lanes network only hurts congestion. More bike lanes and transportation options means more people cycling and taking public transit means less people in cars and on the road. The city of Toronto\u2019s population is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years and those people will need bike infrastructure in order to get from a to b because we can\u2019t have a growing population of only drivers it\u2019s unsustainable. Our roads can only move so many people and the more people who choose to drive because they can\u2019t feasibly bike to where they need to go the more traffic we will have. We need to show people there are other options and encourage them to use them, this is done successfully all over Europe where plenty of people bike daily year-round sun or snow. There is a reason why so many European cities are where people want to live and travel to and if they can do it we can do it. To summarize this long rant, this city needs to be more livable, and bike lanes help to make that happen. Cycling is cheaper, better for the environment, quieter, and make people safer, happier, and healthier leave our bike lanes alone if anything we should be expanding them across the city in areas where people don\u2019t have access to them.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill. As a non-cyclist, I find the current infrastructure unsafe, particularly due to the absence of a continuous bike network that is fully separated from vehicle lanes. For many years, I relied on the TTC for my daily commute, but I recently transitioned to driving because the streetcar service became increasingly unreliable, often taking 1 to 1.5 hours to travel from The Beaches to work on the west side of downtown.\nWhile I support the creation of more bike lanes, I strongly oppose the idea of sharing the road with bicycles. This setup jeopardizes the safety of both cyclists and drivers. I believe it\u2019s crucial to have designated lanes for vehicles and a separate lane for bikes. This would create a safer environment for everyone involved, rather than forcing us to navigate in a shared lane, which is inherently risky.\nI do not consider bicycles as the primary source of traffic congestion in this city. Instead, I attribute much of the congestion to poor scheduling and management of construction projects, along with insufficient funding for reliable public transportation. Taking weeks to months to install infrastructure on our roads to then dismantle the same infrastructure that aids in reducing traffic delays only exacerbates these problems, leading to greater frustration and complications for all road users.\nI maintain a neutral political stance and have voted for all three major political parties throughout my life. However, I want to be clear: if this bill is passed, I will not support the Conservative Party in future elections. This issue affects us all, and we deserve a transportation solution that prioritizes safety and efficiency.\n"

And not just the one about at Islington, but near Queens Park too, it seems. Those lanes getting further east are very highly-used and have had a positive impact on the local economy. An example: the Annex BIA wants them to stay. Some of these bike lanes are good for business. Do you hear that, Mr. Ford? Good for Business. I thought Ontario was supposed to be \"open for business\". This legislation makes it clear that Ontario is open to government micromanagement.\n"

        "comment": "There is so much I feel is a step backwards with how the government is approaching this bill so I am going to have to approach it in bullet points working my way through the proposal.\nNew highways aren't the answer to getting people and goods out of gridlock. Especially when there is an almost entirely empty highway sitting there that could be better utilized today.\nAccidents won't be relieved with more highways. They actually just add to more places accidents could happen, and more, faster traffic to cause more accidents.\nBroadband projects is a plus, we do need more reliable internet. Accessing more communities with reliable internet can also open up more work from home options, which will help reduce congestion.\nHighway 413 is not needed as the 407 is already available. It will only open up more valuable green land to be paved over.\nExpediting these projects is wrong, especially when it goes against legislature that has been previously enacted for a reason. Safety is one factor here that is going to be overlooked. The environment is another and arguably one of the most important. Once these environmental lands are gone, we can not go back and return them to how they were if we realize we were wrong. Proper consultation needs to be done and accepted if it says these projects should not go forward or should be modified. If the government just bulldozes ahead with these pet projects without a care for the environment they are sending a message that they don't care about the future of Ontarians. The fact that the proposed bill only really mentions environmental protection at the end comes across like a footnote. The fact it mainly seems to mention environmental impacts in regards to disturbances to local residents with noise is especially concerning.\nThe rights of the people of Ontario must also be retained. There is a reason the laws allow for appeals to judges regarding expropriation of land. Those laws must remain intact. The highways will not be built over night. Landowners must be allowed the time to have their voices heard if their land is going to be taken.\nThe federal government has just announced plans for a highspeed train to run essentially through most of this gridlock. The provincial government can do so much more to ease gridlock, while paving over far less land by expanding upon this. Put in more train lines, expand the usage of public transit, encourage more work from home options. These are all better ways to reduce gridlock while also preserving our future.\n"

It's unfair to me and my fellow cyclists that we must wonder whether or not I will return safely to my family. If you want to fix congestion, fix the way that we conduct construction and the people who actually congest the roads. And the CafeTO program that still takes up an entire chunk of all the real estate on a lot of streets. Pape and Danforth, for example, has construction dump trucks parked on every street. Not just danforth, but residential side streets as well and the CafeTO program takes up the entire area where people used to park. If you think congestion is bad now, wait until all of the buildings start going up at the same time, which is what we're looking at doing due to the lack of housing that we have in the city when it's worse then and there's no bike lanes What will you blame? I hope and pray that 1 day there are politicians who actually stand up for the people instead of selling Green Belt land to their friends and looking after their own best interest, instead of the people who hired them to look after their best interest.\n"

I was one of the people who just recently started biking along the Yonge Street just because I felt safe enough because of the infrastructure and left my car at home. With the careless attitudes of drivers, I wouldn't want to risk my life to bike on an unprotected lane. I can't even fathom the short-sighted approach of this government and lack of empathy for people living in the city versus providing convenience for the suburbanites who most drive to the city and show the worst care for people not on cars.\nI would ask the government to review the approach and get real sensible data from all people and not just drivers and make decisions that are good for people who are actually living in the city versus for the people who just commute to the city.\n"

The traffic will simply worsen without separated bike lanes, as more people get into their cars. As I'm sure the city's studies will find, the bike lanes significantly improve the safety and overall traffic flow for ALL ROAD USERS, which not only benefits drivers, but everyone in the city.

It's well-known that more car lanes do not reduce traffic but the opposite, more car infrastructure just bring more cars into the road and creates more congestion. It's also well-known that having safe bike and transit infrastructure takes people out of cars, and THAT actually reduces congestion. Besides that, overriding municipal by-laws completely undermines local autonomy and community voices. The local government knows best what is happening within their boundaries.

I firmly believe that it is impossible to build enough roads to accommodate our growing population. However, it is possible to build enough, biking, infrastructure, and public transit.\nI\u2019m also quite annoyed, that bike lanes are constantly associated with the left wing. I have been a conservative voter my entire life. But these policies, lack common sense and are forcing me to reconsider where I stand on the political spectrum.\nIf you truly want to reduce congestion, build more bike lines, and public transit lines.

The proposed 413 will serve a small fraction of computers whereas improving access to the 407 will reach far more Ontarians.\n"
