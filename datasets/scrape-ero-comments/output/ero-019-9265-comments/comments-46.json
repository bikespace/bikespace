        "comment": "ERO 019-9265      Response to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act (specifically, sections regarding the restriction of bike lanes)\nI do not support the above legislation for the following reasons: it does not respect local democracy and municipal planning decisions; it will make it much more difficult or even impossible for Toronto to meet its climate emissions goals, specifically the city\u2019s target to become carbon neutral by 2040; and the 48 million dollar price tag will put more cyclists in danger without achieving the professed goal of reducing traffic congestion.\n1. Lack of Respect for Local Democracy\nThe City of Toronto (and other Ontario municipalities) is better able to make planning decisions based on local needs and local priorities than the provincial government. In the document \u201cImpact of Bill 212: Bike Lanes Framework\u201d, the Toronto city manager summarizes the impact of this legislation in a detailed, meticulously researched report. Among its conclusions, it states that \u201cthe absence of bikeways has a disproportionately negative impact on low-income communities and Indigenous, Black and other communities of colour.\u201d It notes that Toronto is the busiest city in North America due to construction and that \u201cthe reduced network capacity due to construction-related road closures is a primary factor contributing to congestion across the city.\u201d\nMunicipalities, like Toronto, know what their residents need and have local knowledge about the challenges they face, including gridlock. In fact, it is their responsibility as locally elected municipal governments to make these decisions.\n2. Climate Goals\nTo achieve Toronto city council\u2019s goal to become carbon neutral by 2040, it will have to reduce emissions from passenger vehicles which account for almost a quarter of its GHG emissions. The city has increased funding and capacity to expand and improve its cycling network, \u201cspending $30 million on bikeways in 2023, the most it has ever invested in a single year\u201d (Toronto Star, \u2018A truly poisonous intervention\u2019, September 26, 2024). In the same article, authors Kate Allen and Mahdis Habibinia state, \u201cstaff reports have consistently found that adding and improving [bike] lanes results in vastly more cyclists on these roads. At Adelaide and Richmond Streets at Spadina Avenue, for example, cyclist counts jumped from 562 in 2013 to 3,763 in 2022, an increase of 570 per cent, and the number of people using the city\u2019s Bike Share system spiked from about 665,000 trips in 2015 to more than 4.5 million in 2022.\u201d\nThe Transportation Tomorrow Survey, done in partnership with the province and Golden Horseshoe municipalities to support planning for transportation infrastructure, shows that in 2022, 5.8% of city commuters took bikes or other forms of \u201cmicromobility\u201d to work. The number of daily cycling trips has more than tripled in two decades (55,000 in 2001 to 172,000+ in 2022).  People are choosing to use bikes, scooters, etc. to get around. That means fewer cars on the road, and more people able to get to where they\u2019re going without getting into a car.\nEven so, Toronto has a long way to go to meet its climate targets and needs to take many more gas-powered cars off the road. Patricia Wood, a professor in York University\u2019s Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, sums it up: \u201cSo to have the province even float the idea of reducing the possibility to create space for active transportation by prioritizing private automobiles over bike lanes is a truly poisonous intervention \u2026 even debating this only drags us backwards and wastes our time.\u201d\n3. Bike Lanes Save Lives\nAccording to a Toronto Star editorial (September 25, 2024), research from around the world has shown that bike lanes separated from cars improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists: \u201cAn American study published last November in the Journal of Transport and Health \u2026 found that protected bike lanes make roads significantly safer for cyclists and other users. Cities with dedicated bike lanes had 44 per cent fewer deaths and 50 per cent fewer serious accidents than other American cities\u201d.  The city manager\u2019s Bike Impact report reveals that, \u201cresearch and experience from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating congestion in a growing city, while improving safety and mobility\u2026.Independent peer-reviewed research has shown that the introduction of separated bikeways reduces the risk of cycling injury (about 9 times lower than a major street with parked cars and no cycling infrastructure). It also increases the feeling of comfort and safety for all road users.\nMy husband and I cycled in Germany in 2019 and can attest to that feeling of comfort and safety when we were able to cycle for long distances in separated bike lanes. They were an accepted part of the transportation infrastructure.\n4. Blaming Bike Lanes for Congestion is Not Supported by Research\nBoth the Toronto Star editorial and the city manager\u2019s report reiterate that \u201cit isn\u2019t cyclists and bike lanes that are the main culprits in creating gridlock. It is construction, road closures and traffic returning to pre-pandemic levels\u2026. [I]n Paris, London and other metropolises, these lanes have often had the opposite effect [to gridlock], leading to more cyclists and fewer cars on the road.\u201d Even \u201csmall reductions in the number of vehicles on the road can produce large improvements in traffic flow\u201d.\n5. $48 Million Dollars\nTaxpayers will be on the hook for $48 million dollars (plus other costs the city of Toronto and other municipalities will face) to tear out bike lanes that will make the roads more dangerous, and won\u2019t solve the problem of gridlock. This is a very expensive, ill-considered gambit.\nI would suggest a better name for this bill would be \u201cFailing to Reduce Gridlock, Endangering Lives For No Good Reason Act\u201d.\n"

        "comment": "I'm appalled at this proposal. Myself and my family (including two children under age 10) regularly use the bike lanes to traverse the City of Toronto, including those that are immediately targeted for removal (without any sense of if/when alternatives would be provided). The Ministry staff who are working on this proposal must know full well how counter-productive it is, how politically motivated it is, and how unsafe the results will be. It is shameful to see politicians selfishly ignore the abundant evidence. This move will not ease traffic congestion, it detracts from the viability of the cycling network in Toronto that is only just coming together, and only serves to make vulnerable road users more exposed to risk. It is a cynical move that tramples municipal democratic decision-making in order to create a political wedge issue at the expense of the safety and well-being of families like mine. These lanes are vital infrastructure and they must be maintained. Their removal would be a wasteful step backwards that will make using the public roads worse for both people who choose to cycle and people who choose to drive motor vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is unwarranted regulation and bureaucracy that will cost tax payers more than any supposed benefit could justify. The province need not create any new regulations on cities lest it boat the bureaucracy, duplicate checks and impede local development.\nThe province is better off using those funds on health care, the economy and regional transportation and leave local transportation to the cities.\nBike lanes are clearly a local issue that does not warrant a discussion at the provincial level as it's the cities who tax and spend on them and other local transportation projects making input from MPPs from 'out-off-town' an overreach and renders the money and time that councils spend a waste of they allow the provincial government's bureaucracy the power to overrule and over review their decisions. I don't live in Toronto not does it make sense for me to tell them what to do and for my tax dollars to pay for removing or adding any of their infrastructure at such a minute level without their consent.\nWhen and if a local decision is made, the people if that city or town will work with their local councils to make the best decision for themselves based on evidence. The province has not the resources and research to demonstrate an empirical need to up load bike lanes specifically.\nPeople at the local level know what's best to protect themselves and deal with their transportation needs. Bike lanes can and do help with reducing cars on the road and increase the safety of everyone using publicly funded infrastructure.\nOn the environment, it's without saying but to say it, evidence is needed in order to protect it. If the government keeps bypassing any review then it will suffer to everyone's detriment. Being ignorant on purpose is to proceed with arrogance. Any infrastructure project at a large scale should go through a review process to allow the public to know the impacts and decide if they still wish to spend their tax dollars on it.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist who frequently uses bike lanes in Ontario, especially in Toronto, I have to express my disagreement with the proposed \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" and \"Building Highways Faster Act, 2024.\" While I understand the need to improve traffic flow and reduce gridlock, the emphasis on expanding highways like Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and the Garden City Skyway seems to overlook the growing need for more sustainable transportation options.\nOntario's cities, particularly Toronto, have seen a significant increase in the number of cyclists on the road, and I feel safe riding on bike lanes that are often placed alongside highways and major roads. The proposal to expedite highway construction and expropriate properties to make room for these projects raises concerns about potential impacts on local communities and, importantly, on cyclists' safety.\nExpanding highways could lead to increased traffic and pollution, ultimately undermining efforts to encourage greener modes of transportation, like cycling. Moreover, if infrastructure planning continues to prioritize cars over alternative transportation methods, it could make our cities less bike-friendly, thus negatively impacting the safety and well-being of cyclists.\nI believe that while highway construction projects are important, they should not come at the expense of alternative transport solutions that are better for the environment and public health. A more balanced approach that includes investments in cycling infrastructure, alongside improvements to highways, would be more beneficial to all Ontarians in the long term.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an overstep and gross mishandling of tax dollars.\nFirstly I will cover what the media has covered:\nThe handling of bike lanes by adding more bureaucracy on a provincial level not only makes it even more expensive and tedious to build. It also brings the representation and autonomy of municipalities into further question. What is the point of a mayor and a municipality if they can't even build bike lanes?\nNot only does it affect that, it also is a safety hazard. Bloor St's bike lane was built because people died biking on it. There was an elderly lady who was dragged under a truck biking on the road. Bike lanes, protected bike lanes, protect people.\nBike lanes also reduce traffic. As people are given the option to bike, they won't take the car. Each car on the road increases traffic exponentially. (please refer to link1). So by removing bike lanes, congestion will only increase as it leaves more space for cars, which will be filled up by cars quickly.\nThe financial cost of this is also something to question. These bike lanes are young. And cost a few million to install already. Then to remove them, it will cost even more millions of dollars. It is a waste of money to sate the feelings of a few people who see cyclists pass them in traffic.\nMind you, the cyclist being faster than the car, despite cars having more lanes than bikes, should be a suggestion to think that perhaps cars are not an ideal mode of transportation.\nNow onto the meat of the bill:\nThis bill pushes forth Highway 413. A highway that bypasses the 401 and the 407 by bypassing Brampton while going from Vaughan to the edge of Mississauga.\nFirstly this highway does not seem to be helpful in any regard. It is a large detour for most motorists. To add to this, if highway 413 was a toll road, it would reduce its impact even more as people would not use it.\nOnce again referring to the study (among others that exist), more vehicles means more traffic. Meaning more space for cars and trucks means more cars and trucks, means more traffic. Highway 413, if used effectively by the people, will only cause more traffic in the area and would not reduce congestion in the long term. Your own documents show this.\nThe financial cost of highway 413 is also quite high, and it would be a long construction project with not only a large environmental impact, but also a large cost. $4 billion is a conservative estimate of the cost. This cost could be used elsewhere to actually provide alternatives to cars, thus relieving congestion.\nWe could be building rails to increase service on the GO. Not just on the lakeshore lines, but also in other areas. What if we connected the rails between Bramela and Lisgar to allow freight to bypass more of the GTA. This would allow GO trains greater access to the rail network that exists in the GTA, providing much greater connection than any highway could provide. An example of this can be found in Link3.\nYou might ask \"how much better can a train be?\" The daily average ridership of GO Transit in 2024 was 275,900 people.\nThat rivals parts of the 401 in people moved. And that is with a considerably smaller footprint, and a fairly cheaper operation (especially if you include the cost of a each individual vehicle). If we expanded the service of the GO, not only in frequency on existing lines, but also opening new lines on previous freight lines, this would provide a much greater relief to traffic by providing the alternative to driving that many people need and want.\nThis car-based obsession is a ridiculous notion that must be left behind. I myself enjoy a good drive now and then, but I do not enjoy traffic, and I do not enjoy the stress of driving on a busy highway. I like many others, would rather and do take the train when possible and convenient. We should strive to provide alternatives to driving, not because we don't want people to drive, but because we want people to have the CHOICE to choose to drive or not to. At the moment the design of the GTA is very car-oriented, to the chagrin of many residents who for various reasons either suffer financially by having to maintain a car, or cannot drive due to disability, or are otherwise stressed and infuriated by the inability to access amenities because it is only reasonably accessible by car.\nI implore you to scrap the majority of this bill. All it will do is cost the province money and increase traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I do not understand how Bill 212 is at all compatible with a fiscally conservative government. This bill not only extends government overreach, it proposes wasting tax dollars in order to do so. I paid $170,000 (rounded down) in income tax last year. Why is a conservative government wasting my tax money and taking away property rights?\nThis bill proposes that the government be allowed to expropriate people\u2019s property with no chance to even adjust the timeline. This feels like such a violation of my property rights.\nToronto is a growing city. Even ignoring induced demand, there is absolutely nowhere to expand roads in most areas of Toronto without expropriating private property (which you seem a little too eager to do). The only way to make traffic better for the people who have to drive is to give everybody other options, like the already existing bike lanes that my tax money has already been spent on.\nCyclists in Toronto are dying because it is unsafe for them to move around the city. The Bloor-Annex BIA believes that removing the bike lanes would be disastrous. Why are we not listening to the business owners and people who actually use the bike lanes?\nI am sick and tired of all the construction downtown. I am sick and tired of seeing my money wasted on digging up roads again and again. I am sick and tired of the government taking infrastructure away from me. Leave the bike lanes alone. The people of Toronto need them.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is shortsighted and will not solve the problems it claims to solve. Regarding giving the province more powers over bike lanes, it very much appears to be a personal vendetta of Doug Ford against the City of Toronto in wanting to remove existing bicycle lanes along Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Bicycle usage is rapidly increasing in cities across Canada as a viable alternative to driving a motor vehicle for commuting to work, running errands, and generally getting around town. Usage has dramatically increased in Toronto in particular - consider the fact the the number of bike share trips has increased roughly tenfold in the last 10 years from 600k annual trips to 6 million (and I myself ride almost every day!). Bike lanes are necessary to separate bicycles from motor vehicles, as they are really a separate class of vehicles that should not mix with motor vehicles. Without bike lanes, people riding bicycles will have no choice but to ride on the road in front of cars and trucks, which is not only more dangerous, but will increase gridlock as more users clog the streets (since there would not longer be a bike lane for the bicycles to ride in). Doug Ford himself rode a bicycle in Toronto along with Jagmeet Singh, and stated that he felt safer riding in the bike lanes than on the road, and that it was important to reduce cyclist deaths in the province.\nFurthermore, the proposal to accelerate the development of highway 413 is also shortsighted and will have negative impacts. Numerous studies have been conducted multiple times that this new megahighway will, in the long term, not save drivers a meaningful amount of time in their commutes. A better solution would involve opening up the highway 407 ETR (which is in debt to the government of Ontario) to transport trucks. This would actually help reduce congestion on the 401 as larger vehicles could use a completely separate highway to travel east/west in the GTA while passenger vehicles can continue using the 401. Additionally, it is also known that simply creating more highways will create induced demand, encouraging more people to drive rather than take other forms of transportation. The only effective way of reducing traffic is to offer viable alternatives to driving to get more drivers off of the road. Which means to invest in higher quality, more frequent, and more options for public transportation. Finally, the ecological impacts of building the megahighway are also severe. The proposed route takes highway 413 through some of Ontario and Canada's best and most productive farmland. Canada as a whole has less than 5% of its territory as arable land. Why are we destroying some of out most productive farmland for a false promise of more convenience for drivers? With the climate crisis in full swing, we need to invest in resiliency, and this includes investing in local, sustainable agriculture - not reducing it.\n"

        "comment": "I live in downtown Toronto, and bike lanes are one of the best things to happen to this city in a very long time. I take my bike all the time because it is significantly faster than driving and public transport. I deserve just as much as a driver to have a safe way to get around and get to work. It is not my fault that drivers are stuck in traffic - it is the province's fault for not providing other, more varied transit options. Owning a car has become so incredibly expensive, that I moved downtown Toronto so that I didn't have to have one. I struggle with the cost of living just like everybody else these days, and it's unfair for the province to make owning a car an essential feature of getting around. It is unfair and undemocratic. The City knows this and worked with the community to make these lanes happen after years of consultation and planning. The province does not know better than the communities who live here and travel around the city every day. If the province wants to get involved, it should be working with city hall instead of discounting its legislature. Democracy is not the Ontario Premier losing every riding in downtown Toronto and then coming in and demanding his policy to rip up the bike lanes built through community-led initiatives, which he didn't even run on, goes through.\nThe province claims these lanes cause congestion, but cites no evidence. Studies all over the world prove bike lanes help with traffic congestion, the environment, and the economy, and make people safer & healthier. There are no legitimate studies that show bike lanes cause congestion, but there are plenty that show adding another lane of traffic does. There is no positive to getting rid of these bike lanes because study after study shows the short-term gains from removal end up making traffic worse. It is called induced demand. If we build the proper infrastructure, people (like myself!) will choose to bike instead of drive and this will in turn take more cars off the road. They do it in cities all over the world, like Montreal, New York, or Paris, and it works. Toronto has the opportunity to become a major global city and this careless, political decision is jeopardizing Toronto's attractiveness to talent in the future. Adding bike lanes to only side streets would make travelling by bike take significantly longer. This will not make anyone more safe or improve traffic. Arterial roads have bike lanes for a good reason: It's where people are trying to go. Cars transport way fewer people for the amount of space they take up and I don't hear anyone complaining about that. They are terrible for the environment. Why should private cars get better access to public spaces than public transit, or active transit? it makes no sense.\nThe premier is using this as a wedge issue and as a way to package the other terrible things in Bill 212, like skirting environmental regulations for the newly planned highway I disagree with these but nothing impacts me more than these bike lanes. I take the Bloor bike lane almost every day. There isn't congestion in the bike lanes because they get people where they want to go fast. I am a young person in this province, and I believe in Toronto and Ontario's potential for future success. We won't get there by implementing an emotion-based infrastructure policy because the premier wants to base major urban planning decisions on archaic 20th-century urban planning ideas around cars. We need innovative, forward-thinking people who are involved in their communities directly. Doug Ford lost the 2014 mayoral election. Olivia Chow was elected with the promise of implementing bike lanes. The province needs to get out of our local jurisdiction and do the things they were elected to do, like finish the Crosstown LRT and fix congestion on the highways. There are no bike lanes on the 401, and yet it is the busiest highway in North America. The province should be looking at facts, long-term impacts, and comprehensive studies from around the world to base its decision.\nI implore the province to at least listen to reason and the data, and plan WITH the city to improve traffic. They want to get rid of the bike lanes? At least consult with the community. It is unfair to the hardworking people of this city to have our infrastructure in tatters because of a hasty political decision.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.\nMoreover, many of Toronto's worst traffic problem spots, such as Lakeshore and Jarvis, are in no way related to the presence of bike lanes.\nBike lanes create induced demand, which means that over time, more people will choose to bike over take their car. They are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are scientifically proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions. There is no supporting scientific evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I have significant concerns about Bill 212 and the included Building Highways Faster Act and the Highway 413 Act, as well as the amendments to other Acts with respect to highways. Nearly every municipal and regional council from along Highway 413\u2019s proposed route has voted to either oppose the highway altogether, or to request a full environmental assessment from the federal government. I believe the provincial government is intentionally putting emphasis on the polarizing discussion of bike lanes and tapping into collective frustration with traffic (caused by a lack of alternative transit options, not bike lanes) by targeting bike infrastructure, particularly in Toronto, to draw attention away from other sections of the bill. Bike lanes account for a small portion of this bill, yet it is the \u201chot button issue\u201d that dominates the discussion and presentation of the bill to the public. While I could support a just and fair expropriation process that seeks to address individualistic or greedy opposition to important, viable, and sustainable infrastructure projects (especially that address affordability and accessibility for low-income citizens such as high-speed commuter rail), this should not be tied to bypassing environmental assessments, supporting expensive car-dependent sprawl, and ripping up much-needed alternative transportation infrastructure.\nBill 212 is unprecedented jurisdictional overreach that will impact the safety of all road users. This will not reduce gridlock, save money, or improve the quality of life of Ontarians. Highway 413 will not reduce congestion, and internal documents from the ministry of transportation indicate that even if it is built, significant gridlock will persist. You should not build another highway when the 407 is already underutilized, and expected to remain underutilized according to your own government documents. The government has not stated that the 413 will not be tolled or sold to private interest, telling since this bill also contains amendments to the Building Broadband Faster Act, allowing for expropriation along highways for broadband projects that would support the infrastructure needed to toll highways. If that is the government\u2019s plan, they should be clear about their intentions in the bill.\nThe province\u2019s auditor general found that it would likely cost more than $4 billion, with the opposition saying it is closer to $10 billion of taxpayer money! I have significant doubts that Highway 413 would save any significant time and the government has not sufficiently proven any estimates; in fact, many experts believe it will save drivers less than 1 minute\u2026 I do not want to spend billions to save 30-60 seconds! Highway 413 and other such projects are merely another way for the government to put developers ahead of its constituents, opening up the land around the highway to car-dependent development that will generate more traffic and congestion, increasing our environmental impact and continuing to put financial pressure on us as we are reliant on having a car to get anywhere (gas, insurance, maintenance costs are continuing to go up!) If you want to connect the province, increase accessibility, ease the financial burden on individuals, and reduce gridlock, invest in non-commercial railways and high-speed commuter rail today. We need viable transportation alternatives, not more of the same!\nThe government must get serious about reducing gridlock; we need massive public transit infrastructure with dedicated transit lanes that use priority signalling, municipal streets with alternative means of mobility (like separated protected bike infrastructure), and more secure pedestrian pathways to prevent deadly accidents within our cities and make them economic centres full of vibrant destinations. Instead of more highways that induce more car traffic and are a taxpayer money sink, you must build out our local trains and a high-speed rail corridor, which would be more efficient at transporting more people (and money) into cities at more reasonable maintenance costs.\n"

        "comment": "This is a flawed bill that should not be passed as written.\nPremier Ford and the government have had 6 years of a majority government to reduce gridlock yet have failed to deliver any of their promised transit projects. Gridlock is a serious issue, but this government is using bike lanes as a scapegoat for its dismal track record on transit.\nThe Premier is not letting municipalities decide what is best for them with this proposed legislation. He is adding more red tape and forcing cities to get provincial approval for bike lanes. I believe that municipalities are quite capable of making decisions about bike lanes on their own. Removing bike lanes puts cyclists in more danger, leading to more accidents, injuries and deaths while causing further delays on our roads.\nThis bill claims that the government is committed to balancing environmental protection with the need to support crucial infrastructure development that will benefit the economy. But I don\u2019t see balance here. Instead, this bill does away with environmental protections in favour of creating projects that favour developer friends of Premier Ford. He is not putting the people of Ontario at the centre of his decisions, but rather, the profit to be made by interested stakeholders who have contributed to Ford\u2019s campaigns. This is corruption and is unacceptable.\nThis bill paves the way to build Highway 413 without a proper environmental study, even though it is known that the highway would specifically impact 85 waterways, 220 wetlands, put at risk at least 10 different species and hundreds of acres of vulnerable wildlife habitat. The building of Highway 413will encourage urban sprawl through induced demand, as research shows that building new highways tends to attract more drivers and fails to improve congestion levels on other roads. It would increase car dependency in surrounding areas and ultimately only save commuters around 30 to 60 seconds of travel time.\nInstead of building more highways and more urban sprawl, we should be building affordable and reliable public transit including investing in GO Transit Regional Express Rail. Let people get to work faster while getting work done and spending less money instead of sitting in traffic and increasing carbon emissions. So many better ways of easing gridlock have been suggested, such as working with the owners of Highway 407 to increase capacity on that highway, or subsidizing truck drivers to use Highway 407.\nDo better by the people of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will not actually reduce gridlock by any means based on several studies done by urban planners. It\u2019s purely a political move for Ford\u2019s personal benefit.\nAs a resident of Toronto who visits family frequently across the GTA, what my family and. I want most is more regular and interconnected public transit and bike lanes, not more highways.\nMost of our highway commutes to and from Toronto would be entirely avoided if we knew we could access a GO Train that would come more frequently and into longer  periods in the night.\nI would also Iove to bike more to get around in Toronto and to / from suburban go train stations. My main barrier to doing so more often is a fear that I will not be able to get to my destination via safe lanes. I have biked far more in other cities I\u2019ve lived in such as Vancouver and Montreal as it is much safer to do so there. Our cities do not need yet another barrier to getting these lanes in fast / a waste of money, resources, and traffic-including construction to rip them out. We need more  safe bike paths throughout.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2019s claim that \u201cnot everybody can use a bike to get around\u201d ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario\u2019s transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \u201ca better place, an easier place to get around,\u201d as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver\u2019s investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city\u2019s transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario\u2019s cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"
