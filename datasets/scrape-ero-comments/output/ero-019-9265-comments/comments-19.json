        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding Mr. Doug Ford\u2019s new proposed bill 212. As an Ontario resident, I worry that this bill blatantly counteracts the goal of making Ontario cities safer, more vibrant and more liveable for residents. The evidence is clear, removing cycling infrastructure will not only increase car traffic but render our roads much less safe for bike commuters, families, and cyclists alike.\nOn a personal note, a family member of mine was recently hit by a car in tragic accident in Ontario. The incident took place at very unsafe juncture in the road and could have been avoided if safer cycling infrastructure was in place. My family member, at a young age, has been undergoing intensive hospital care. She now faces the prospect of serious health impairments for the rest of her life, or devastatingly, her life might end in the prime of her youth. We need safe cycling options in our province. Removing cycling infrastructure will not remove cyclist from our roads, instead it will lead to more tragic deaths and injuries. Ontario cyclists are taxpayers, we are voters, and we deserve access to safe cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your consideration regarding this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike infrastructure along University, Bloor, and Yonge in Toronto seems to be an illogical one. University in particular is still able to have 2-3 lanes of car traffic despite the bike lanes that Ford deems as intrusive to cars. I struggle to understand the desire to remove a secondary transportation option along a major street, especially when the infrastructure for it is improving and cars still have room to operate along it. The city should seek to promote options for transportation, not funnel everyone into cars.\nAdditionally Ford's proposal suggests that because there are a lower number of cyclists than drivers, we should remove cycling infrastructure and seek to halt further development. I find this reasoning to be circular. It doesn't necessarily follow that because we have low ridership comparative to cars there is no demand for better cycling infrastructure. In fact I believe that the opposite is true. The reason cycling ridership is lower than cars is because car infrastructure vastly outnumbers bike infrastructure. The city has been designed specifically to funnel as many cars as possible through it. The bike infrastructure we do have is unreliable and sparse, often ending abruptly and shooting cyclists out onto a busy street full of cars with no protective barrier to separate them. This leads to a feeling of uncertainty when cycling in the city. I would be much more inclined to ride a bike downtown if I knew that the routes I was taking were grade separated from car traffic, and would get me to my destination without hurling me into multiple lanes of car traffic. No one wants to cycle along the shoulder of a busy street. Take the new development in the port lands for example. I usually use the subway or walk downtown, but the cycling infrastructure near the port lands engenders a feeling of safety and ease of navigation that has led to me cycling through the area on a number of occasions. If more places in the city were properly outfitted with safe cycling infrastructure I believe the ridership would increase dramatically. Low ridership does not equal low demand, it is indicative of the inadequacies present in the current infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I hope Toronto MPPs step up here to challenge the Premier. How does ripping out bike lanes reduce congestion on the provincial 400 series highways, the real problem? Lane hopping and jockeying on those highways is both dangerous, disruptive and part of that congestion problem, so perhaps you need to stay in your lane too Dougie, and focus on provincial roads, not municipal. Those bike lanes were installed after years of democratic process and general consensus building, not to be unilaterally overturned. The train has left the station Dougie, maybe you should try to catch the next one and consider taking public transit. Do not waste my money trying to rip bike lanes out, the car no longer rules.\n"

        "comment": "This act is a waste of taxpayer money and time.  As a driver, I want bike lanes because I feel that cyclists on the street are far more likely to contribute to gridlock than cyclistss in bike lanes.  Removing existing infrastructure, as proposed, is a waste of taxpayer money.  Finally, even though I'm a driver, with better bike infrastructure, cycling can become a viable option for me for better health, more connected communities, saving money, etc.  I lean right because I do not believe in government wasteful spending, but I still support good infrastructure for communities. I do not understand why this is being painted into a partisan issue.  Is having good infrastructure, saving money, good health, and strong community a LEFT LEANING VALUE?  I do not think so, and I do not wish for this party to take this preposterous stance.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this proposal.\nWhen I a kid in the 80s and 90s when bloor street was forbidden to bike traffic, I stayed off the avenue only because I was obeying the law, even though it was highly inconvenient since it was a major east-west corridor.  In university, I used bike lanes frequently and often because it was inconvenient to drive in the city, it was more environmentally conscious, and it was affordable.  Removing bike lanes is the opposite of giving citizens more affordable transit options.\nIt also does not make sense to spend more money to rip up infrastructure that was already built.\nIt also does not make sense to say 2% of residents only use bike lanes when the infrastructure is spotty at best.  Bikesharing in Toronto is also hitting records every year.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out bike infrastructure in favour of cars is arbitrary and backward. It is unbelievable that people believe that a 2-3 meter wide bike lane used by thousands of people every single day is useless and causes congestion. This infrastructure has just been established and bike usage has been skyrocketing in Toronto these last couple years. For example, Bike Share Toronto is expected to have millions of rides this year! What reasonable civil servant would rip out infrastructure that has great utility and will be used by millions of people? For a conservative individual, you would think Doug Ford would be a proponent of small government and letting the city do its job, but I suppose not. Furthermore, by getting rid of these bike lanes you will just ensure that these bikes will be riding alongside cars slowing them down and making streets more deadly.\n"

Just because the people who make, signs, and enact bills in Ontario doesn\u2019t use them does not mean that they are not crucial for the function of Toronto. The government says that they want to improve traffic yet is doing the opposite by removing ways for people to a safe alternative to driving. Time and time again have we seen different countries (European ones) find a better and more effective way to reduce automobile traffic, yet Ontario cannot do it because the people in power find it inconvenient for themselves. For a government who is no discriminatory and accepting of all people doesn\u2019t seem very accepting of those who choose not to drive and choose alternative methods of getting around the city. Attached are some helpful resources and concerned people who explains why this is a terrible idea and how NOT CARS AND EXPANDING THE ROAD can reduce traffic.\n"

Transportation Engineers know that adding more road lanes for cars will just worsen traffic due to lack of different means of transit. The system needs to be diverse enough to carry a large quantity of people in a relative amount of space in the shortest amount of time. For the average commuter on these streets, a bike is much more space efficient AND environmentally friendly, plus a healthier alternative to driving all around. This is 100% a bad idea and should not be approved!\n"

Your short shortsightedness may alleviate some problems short term, but you have no long term plan.\nYou don't have any criteria for bike lanes other than  if it hinders cars in any way. You have listed no data to support your theory that bike lanes are the problem and you don't seem to be interested in the data that is available that supports the current bike lanes. Nothing in your proposal suggests that you will create safe alternative bike lanes before ripping out the current ones.\nI would suggest that you work WITH the municipalities to strengthen the bike lane criteria and obtain relevant data on the effect of bike lanes on all vehicular traffic including delivery and emergency services as well as the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.  There will always be room for improvements and adjustments and, yes, perhaps even removal of bike lanes.\nThere will be a huge cost, borne by the taxpayer, to remove these bike lanes that we, the taxpayer, have paid to have them installed.  Then, one day, when your government is replaced, we will end up paying again to have them reinstalled.  Do us the courtesy of working with the municipalities on bike lanes and do not simply force bad legislation on us.\n"

How does forcing me to buy a car and put on the road reduce gridlock?\nYes, not that many people bike, because it is not supported, there are poor networks, and it is dangerous as heck. The problem with the transportation network is that it barely allows alternatives like bikes at all. Put bikes on an equal footing with cars and see how many people bike then.\nThe proposed bill is regressive beyond belief and should be dropped immediately.\n"

It is unacceptable that it should over-ride any rights of individuals. This is egregious over stepping of the government.\nSecond; I have worked near university and bloor since 2011, and can tell you first hand about half my colleagues have started taking bikes and whether I drive or take public transit that area has become safer for pedestrians and easier traffic flow SINCE the bike lanes. Where\u2019s your evidence and data? All the facts point to disagreeing with this bill!\nThird: I disagree with the highway 413 exemption for environmental impact assessment. It should be held to the same environmental impact standard of everything else. If the review finds the tradeoffs worth it then that will come out. But exempt is unacceptable for government to try and pass off. I fully disagree.\nFourth: disagree with addition tow trucks access. To actual reduce gridlock the evidence is clear: needed alternatives to driving. make extra bike lanes a priority including maintenance for winter on them that a truly connect in a city network (see Netherlands, snowy country AND bike forward mentality) and added public transit routes and mandate tax incentives for companies to have their staff work from remote as much as possible.  extra tow trucks cause additional bottlenecks. Again stick to the facts!\n"

Bicycle infrastructure connecting to existing and future public transit expansion projects is an irreplaceable aspect of Toronto as it transforms into a modern and progressive city. Removal and more red tape to intentionally bring bicycle infrastructure to a standstill is not only ethically wrong but also contrary to public health and safety and should be treated as a legitimate threat to the public. The provincial government has overstepped it's authority and should be challenged in a court of law if needed to protect the public from its dangerous trajectory.\n"

At the moment as the bill stands it is will waste taxpayer dollars on a project that the people who live in the city do not want. The removal of the bike lanes on Bloor specifically will not prevent cyclists from using it as it the only east-west thru street in the city, and it will not reduce the traffic on the road as whatever width the road is, will fill up with cars either way \u2014 this is proven through a number of studies, not just opinion.\n"
