        "comment": "I have a few concerns regarding Bill 212, especially the Oct 31st update that proposes the removal of bike lanes.\n1.)\tFord frequently mentions wanting to save the tax payers money. So, why is he wasting my money and the money of others to remove much-needed bike lanes? As statements like \"getting drivers where they need to go faster\" suggest, Bill 212 favours drivers. However, drivers are not the only tax payers in this province. I am tax payer who does not drive and this bill does not address my needs. The Ford government\u2019s limited car-centric vision signals a larger issue: The issue is not cars needing more lanes, but rather the lack of government funding for public mass transportation like trains and buses. As a tax payer, I also need ask: What are the projected costs for road maintenance on highways and city streets with increased traffic?\n2.)\tThe Ford government's proposal is not guided by data or research. Studies show that bike lanes reduce congestion and generate more business for local business (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026). There is no clear and evidenced backed connection between reducing bike lanes and increasing traffic flow in cities and on highways. However, as the linked source shows, there are some very good reasons (including road safety AND INCREASED TRAFFIC FLOW) to keep bike lanes.  Ford\u2019s government has either read this research and decided to disregard it because it doesn\u2019t suit their plan or his government doesn\u2019t care enough to read it. Both are unacceptable for elected officials who are meant to represent all peoples of Ontario. This brings me to point 3.\n3.)\tIt cannot be overlooked that adding the removal of bike lanes to Bill 212 is Ford pandering to his base and this decision targets and discriminates against those who live in Toronto; specifically, Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. This discrimination is further amplified by the punitive measure of requiring the City of Toronto to bear the cost of removing these lanes. The removal of bike lanes is not only poor urban management and costly, it is also the peak of pettiness. However, this is not surprising. Let\u2019s not forget that Premier Ford and his government have a history of making decisions out of self-interest rather than integrity. Part of this history was Premier Ford\u2019s unilateral decision to sell off the Greenbelt to property developers with whom he seems to have had personal ties (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-greenbelt-timeline-1.6974715). Bearing this in mind, further inquiries need to be made into Premier Ford\u2019s ties with those who will undertake construction work if Bill 212 is passed. Is Premier Ford\u2019s goal to also create potential avenues of income for himself by taking honorary board seats with any of these companies in retirement? As sign of good faith, would Premier Ford sign a legally binding document that he will take no such seats and will in no way financially benefit from the proposed changes of Bill 212?\nBill 212 is myopic. It is populist pandering. It is not good, long-term planning. It will prove to be both a waste of time and money for all.\n"

        "comment": "Below are Peel Region Staff comments on Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act 2024 (ERO 019-9265).\nPeel Region thanks the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) for the opportunity to comment on the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 in Schedule 2 of Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\nWhile Peel Region staff appreciate and understand the Ontario government\u2019s goal to build highways faster to accommodate growth and tackle traffic gridlock, there is the need to prioritize housing-enabling infrastructure along with components of these highways in order for Peel Region to successfully support local housing pledges from Bill 23 \u2013 More Homes Built Faster Act, 2023.  Peel Region staff have comments and questions regarding various aspects of the legislation.  These include:\n\u2022\tPriority highway projects potential impacts on the environment\n\u2022\tPriority highway project potential impacts on Peel Region infrastructure\n\u2022\tUtility relocations\n\u2022\tExpropriation related provisions\n\u2022\tMiscellaneous\nOf primary importance to Peel Region is the protection of its water, wastewater and stormwater assets, Regional roads and Public Sector Network (fibre optic communications) in relation to priority highway projects.  Peel Region staff\u2019s specific comments and questions on the Building Highways Faster Act (BHFA) are outlined below. Please note that the following comments are provided by Peel Region staff and may be considered by Regional Council for endorsement at a later date.  If additional or differing comments are provided through a Council resolution, they will be forwarded to the Ministry for consideration.\nExpedited Construction for Priority Highway Projects Potential Environmental Impacts\nWhile Peel Region appreciates the need to build and expand highways in a timely fashion to accommodate current and future growth in Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Greater Toronto Area, designated priority highway projects are significant undertakings that could have impacts on the health and the environment of the surrounding community and environment as well as affect Peel Region\u2019s ability to plan, design and build future public works utilities and infrastructure.\nAny highway project designated as a priority could be exempt from the Environmental Assessment (EA) process and subject to an expedited assessment process. This is the case for Highway 413 under the proposed Highway 413 Act, which is also part of Bill 212. As a result, expedited EAs may not allow for a solid understanding of the environmental impacts and mitigation strategies (i.e. air quality study) and community concerns regarding the impact on air quality and health, especially for those living or working near highway construction sites, may go unaddressed due to the fast-tracking of these projects.\nPeel Region values MTO\u2019s commitment to mitigate environmental impacts and address local concerns on a project-by-project basis and that construction activities will be undertaken in a manner to minimize noise levels and reduce impacts to the community. Should 24 hour, construction be permitted for priority highway projects, the Ministry should produce and publish a mitigation plan to address the negative health impacts from construction such as noise pollution and poor air quality that can be aggravated by increased traffic and congestion in the project area. Moreover, construction activities should be undertaken in a manner to minimize and reduce impacts to the Region\u2019s infrastructure and budget.\nPriority Highway project impacts on Peel Region infrastructure\nAllowing expedited construction for priority highway projects, like Highway 413, may also impact Peel Region\u2019s ability to plan, design and build future public works utilities and infrastructure.  If passed, the BHFA would allow the Minister to accelerate receipt of infrastructure information, such as the location of underground utilities, as well as utility relocation and property access and acquisition. Accelerated utility relocations would impact the Region\u2019s ability to appropriately design any changes to our utility systems and to secure necessary and appropriate lands or easements required for relocations. Peel Region staff comments specifically regarding utility relocations are outlined in the next section.\nPeel Region staff request that MTO consult Peel Region at the very onset of design for all early works projects to coordinate all roads, stormwater and existing water and wastewater assets. The proposed early works may have a major impact to Peel Region\u2019s underground assets that may require relocation or rehabilitation of pipelines prior to the proposed early works occurring.\nAccelerated property access and acquisition could impact Peel Region\u2019s typical real estate policies, procedures and best practices, impacting our ability to appropriately circulate any dispositions to other utilities, municipalities, and entities such as the school boards prior to those lands being taken by the Province.\nPriority Highway projects could also impact the delivery of infrastructure construction projects that are already in the pipeline. Peel Region has identified the following questions/comments:\n\u2022\tWhat will happen to those infrastructure construction projects that have already been awarded and will be commencing and designated as a priority?\n\u2022\tWill priority be given to finalize those projects that have already been awarded?\n\u2022\tSome utility projects have seen significant expenditures throughout the different planning/design/implementation phases. What would happen with that initial design/planning time/funding invested into those utility projects already underway?\nUtility Relocations and Rehabilitation Stemming from Priority Highway Projects\nThe Minister may require a utility company to take up, remove or change the location of utility infrastructure if, in the opinion of the Minister, the taking up, removing or changing in location is for the purposes of a priority highway project.  As Peel Region is a utility provider of water and wastewater services, it is impacted by the provision.\nPeel Region staff have comments, concerns and questions regarding the utility relocation provisions in the BHFA, as outlined below:\n\u2022\tThe BHFA, if passed, would move from a court-driven appeal process to an expedited appeal process through the Minister of Transportation for disputes on MTO notices for utility relocations on priority highway projects.\n\u2022\tThe change to the appeal process would potentially impact on Peel Region if the Ministry were to expropriate lands owned by the Region to building future infrastructure. The expedited appeal process would limit Peel Region\u2019s ability to protect Region-owned properties as the property requirements are substantial for highway infrastructure and this could have negative impacts on existing facilities on Region-owned properties and could impact the ability to develop vacant Region-owned lands for future facilities.\nIt could also create a situation where Peel Region would not have the appropriate lands to relocate its water and wastewater infrastructure and MTO relocating Peel\u2019s infrastructure to another location without the knowledge and expertise for the relocation and installation of water and wastewater utilities, which are critical to Peel residents.\n\u2022\tThe proposed amendments also provide authority for the Minister to cause work to be done if the utility company fails to undertake the relocation.  Peel Region staff request clarification around the Ministry\u2019s interpretation of failure to relocate infrastructure, as the current language in BHFA is broad and general. It would be helpful to understand how much notice will be given to the utility owner and how many attempts will be made for challenging relocations, as well as who is responsible for the cost of the relocation. All infrastructure relocations are unique, where large feeder watermains and sewer forcemains are more challenging to relocate than small local mains. Accordingly, Peel Region would like to understand what concessions the Ministry of Transportation would make for these challenging relocations.\n\u2022\tThe ability to complete utility relocation work could be impacted by the availability of lands and easements to work and install utility infrastructure within, which would be beyond Peel Region\u2019s control. If lands are provided by others to Peel Region for such a purpose, then those lands may not meet our standards, increasing construction costs and complicating future maintenance activities. This could be problematic, namely for our water system, as we are governed by the requirements of our Municipal Drinking Water Licence.\n\u2022\tPeel Region staff further request that the topics of technical design standards and cost sharing principles, as discussed in its letter to the Ministry of Transportation dated June 3, 2024 (attached), would apply for all Peel assets that require relocation/rehabilitation as part of the proposed early works.\n\u2022\tSome utility relocations may result in significant impacts for vulnerable communities (such as health care, child and youth care, and social care facilities) and relocation may require extra planning efforts for impact mitigation. Will the Ministry of Transportation consider time extensions for such scenarios?\n\u2022\tFinally, Peel Region staff have several questions regarding impacts of utility relocates on water and wastewater utility assets in particular:\no\tWhat is the current process for receipt of infrastructure information, and how will this new proposed process change the onus on the utility owner?\no\tWill the owner of the assets be granted the same powers to accelerate the process for utility relocation? For example, if the utility relocation requires an Environmental Assessment, does the utility owner have the right to follow the Highway 413 Act process if said infrastructure is in support of the Highway 413 construction?\nExpropriation Related Provisions\nPeel Region staff would like clarification on the following expropriation related provisions in the BHFA:\n\u2022\tWhere MTO has determined that property expropriation is necessary to support a priority highway project, the proposed legislation would, if passed, remove a property owner's ability to apply to a judge for a later date of possession under 39(3) of the Expropriations Act. This would help to ensure that the construction schedule for designated projects is not impacted, while the Ministry of Transportation would continue to work with property owners to determine appropriate expropriation and possession timelines. Staff request that the Ministry clarify whether this expropriation right extends to infrastructure owners carrying out infrastructure projects to support the BHFA.\n\u2022\tThe BHFA proposes to add offences and penalties provisions for individuals and corporations that obstruct Ministry of Transportation officials from accessing property to carry out field studies or refuse to relocate from expropriated property by the date of possession for designated priority highway projects. Penalties, in the form of fines, would mirror those in the Building Transit Faster Act for obstructing inspections. It would be helpful to understand if this right will extend to infrastructure owners for carrying out infrastructure projects to support the BHFA.\nMiscellaneous Provisions\nSection 9 (1) of the BHFA allows the Minister to authorize a person to enter a property to conduct a site inspection to the purposes of constructing a priority highway project.  Under 11(8) of the BHFA, the Minister may but is not required to compensate municipal property owners for any damages resulting from a Ministerial authorized site inspection of a property and can provide only partial compensation. Generally, the Minister is not required to compensate property owners for any activities done as part of the site inspection.\nIf the Minister is not required to compensate for damages, Peel Region may be at financial risk. In these circumstances, Peel Region recommends that the BHFA include a compensation framework for impacts of site inspections on existing municipal infrastructure (e.g., culverts, road intersections etc.) for highway priority projects.\nThe BHFA indicates it may override municipal by-laws that prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to the priority highway project, with certain exceptions continuing to apply (including weight restrictions on bridges, speed limits, and the closures of municipal roads for maintenance, construction, and special events) only where the Minister designates a part or whole of such a project in regulation. Provided that these provisions only pertain to portions of Regional roads being absorbed into MTO permit control areas related to new facilities only, Peel Region is not likely to be affected by this so long as it is still afforded the ability to regulate roadways under its jurisdiction outside of MTO permit control areas. It would be appreciated if the Ministry could confirm that the BHFA would only apply to their Controlled Access Highway limits, noting Peel\u2019s preference that work be staged such that Peel\u2019s Strategic Goods Movement Network provides options for goods movement across the Highway 413 corridor during construction.\nConclusion\nPeel Region staff once again appreciate the opportunity to comment on Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 with the intent of improving the legislation so that Peel Region can continue to provide housing-related infrastructure while facilitating the building of priority highway projects to meet future growth.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212 in its entirety, for the following reasons. I am opposed to any fast-tracking of the proposed highway 413 or hwy 427, hwy 410 extensions through exemptions from a full Environmental Assessment process. I am speaking today through the lens of a young farmer who farms in the proposed path of the highway, and as a Rural Planning and Development graduate student. Environmental Assessments are an important part of the planning process that allows officials to make a proper cost-benefit analysis, plan the route and construction by mitigating impacts, and ultimately allow for an informed decision on whether the project is acceptable or whether alternatives are better. Without this, the project may be more costly and far more impactful upon Ontarians in the long run. There is no acceptable reason in this day and age why any project, especially a government led one, should be exempt from proper process. If the project has merit, it should pass through the proper channels without problem. If it does not have merit, it will not. It should be judged as all other projects should be judged. Environmental assessments are in place to safeguard the public from poor planning and decision making. To exempt any project from the law amounts to injustice against our communities.\nThe justification behind Hwy 413 is also suspect to begin with, and has not been backed by sufficient evidence for choosing a new highway over cheaper and less environmentally impactful alternatives, such as regional rail investment and other transit investments.\nFurther, I am also opposed to any measures that expedite the expropriation act. People should have as much time as is fit to seek appropriate legal counsel, and have the right to protest expropriation within their own home.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and urge the province to withdraw the proposed amendments.\nThe bill undermines the principles of local governance and decentralized decision-making, which are foundational to a healthy democracy and the effective management of cities. This legislation imposes top-down control, removing decision-making power from local governments and communities, and prioritizing motor vehicle traffic over public safety, economic well-being, and environmental sustainability.\n1. Local Business Impacts\nLocal businesses thrive when their communities are accessible. Bike lanes bring customers and employees to businesses along key corridors, such as Yonge and Bloor, where bike access is critical. Bill 212 would reduce bike access, which in turn harms local economies by limiting consumer and employee mobility. For example:\nBusinesses on Yonge Street would lose, on average, half of their potential customers arriving by bike.\nBusinesses on Bloor West would lose, on average, 56% of their potential bike customers.\nThis bill disregards the importance of local decision-making in fostering a thriving local economy. By restricting access for over 600,000 people who rely on bikes to reach essential services and destinations, the province would make it harder for people to support businesses and access jobs, healthcare, schools, and entertainment. The long-term economic consequences of this bill on small businesses and neighborhoods would be severe, limiting their growth and vitality.\n2. Undermining Local Decision-Making\nBill 212 centralizes control over infrastructure decisions, taking power away from municipalities and imposing unnecessary bureaucracy. This contradicts the core conservative principle of decentralization, which holds that decisions should be made as close to the people as possible. Local governments, guided by their unique knowledge of community needs and priorities, are better equipped to determine what infrastructure best serves their citizens.\nThe financial burden of removing bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, University, and Yonge is estimated at $48 million, a direct cost to provincial taxpayers. Rather than empowering municipalities to make informed decisions, the bill forces cities to reverse investments in sustainable transportation that have already been made, creating unnecessary costs and logistical challenges.\n3. Safety of Vulnerable Road Users\nThe bill\u2019s failure to prioritize safety for cyclists represents a clear disregard for the responsibility that local governments have in protecting their citizens. Municipalities, like Toronto, are best positioned to address the unique needs of their communities, including ensuring safe and accessible transportation options for all. By stripping cities of their ability to manage bike lanes, Bill 212 effectively ignores the importance of local context, where bike infrastructure plays a vital role in promoting road safety and public health.\nEvidence from local health experts, including 120 physicians and researchers, shows the crucial role of bike lanes in reducing accidents and promoting active transportation. Removing these lanes not only puts cyclists at risk but also undermines the very local strategies that aim to improve safety for all road users.\n4. Impacts to Farmland and Natural Habitats\nBill 212 also includes provisions to fast-track Highway 413, which would directly impact Ontario\u2019s Greenbelt and undermine local environmental protections. This approach disregards the decentralized decision-making process that has enabled communities to protect their natural resources and limit urban sprawl. The construction of Highway 413 would harm vital ecosystems, destroy agricultural land, and increase carbon emissions, further complicating efforts to address climate change and maintain a sustainable environment for future generations.\nInstead of prioritizing highways over transit and active transportation infrastructure, the province should work collaboratively with municipalities to develop solutions that reduce congestion, protect the environment, and promote sustainable growth.\nConclusion\nBill 212 represents a troubling shift away from local decision-making and decentralized governance. Rather than stripping municipalities of their ability to make informed decisions based on local needs, the province should empower them to implement transportation, environmental, and economic policies that reflect the values and priorities of their communities. Local governments, not provincial mandates, are best suited to address the diverse needs of Ontario\u2019s cities and ensure safe, sustainable, and thriving communities.\n"
