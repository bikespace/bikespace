        "comment": "I live close to my work in Guelph, so I ride my bike to work in the Spring, Summer and Fall and walk in the winter. The bike lanes make me feel safe on the main roads. I am in my fifties and riding to and from work is great exercise.\nI use my car for errands and travel to the cottage or to visit friends and family. I appreciate bike lanes on the main roads when I am driving because it allows for safe distance from a cyclist without me having to change lanes.\nMore people on bikes in the cities reduces the number of people in cars and congestion and increases the level of health in the population which reduces the pressure on healthcare and reduces the emissions/ pollution in the air.\nI think people should be encouraged to ride bikes and a safe cycling lane network is part of that.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontarian, I am appalled that the province is even considering removing infrastructure that literally saves lives. Every single day there are collisions involving cyclists and drivers who are fully protected in their vehicles. Cyclists are your neighbours, family and friends. The bike lanes provide a minimal amount of protection and without them fatality rates will certainly increase.\nThis is a gross overreach by the provincial government and extremely wasteful to remove already paid for and installed critical safety infrastructure.\nAdditionally the 413 is a dreadful project. Our province needs to go further in funding transit, reducing single person car trips and increasing density on existing developed land. The solution to traffic is not creating more lanes! The solution is not paving more of the Ontario and sensitive Greenbelt lands.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree that this bill will reduce gridlock. It is well documented that measures which add more lanes do not reduce traffic, they make traffic worse through induced demand because they lead to more cars on the road. In addition, the worst area of gridlock in Ontario is downtown Toronto, and adding more car-routes outside the city could simply funnel more cars into the city onto streets that cannot take any more car volume.\nAs the population grows instead of taking up more and more land with car infrastructure, we should instead focus on space efficient solutions, such as bike lanes, buses and trains. These have greater density, allowing a larger volume of people to travel while taking up less area. This is particularly important in downtown Toronto, where space is at a premium - why is the government catering to the least space-efficient option? The money spent on highways would be better used to develop our public transport network, as this would have a greater impact on reducing congestion.\nI am also dismayed at the proposal to ignore environmental impact assessments. This is an extremely shortsighted plan which could have serious consequences further down the line.\n"

        "comment": "I stand firmly against Bill 212.\nAs someone who cycles in Toronto \u2013 to commute to work, run errands, and to explore the city with friends \u2013 I am grateful for the safety bike lanes provide. I am urging you to reject Bill 212 and to:\n1. Ensure bikes lanes are not obstructed as a matter of ongoing public safety, not just periodic blitzes, and accelerate implementing automated enforcement parking programs and explore other reporting processes with an equity focused lens\n2. Prioritize construction zone safety, including maintaining dedicated cycling facilities, eliminating road hazards, tougher penalties for failing to comply, and a creating a \u201cmobility squad\u201d to ensure obstacle-free travel on the city\u2019s streets\n3. Accelerate and expand our cycling network of connected bikeways to enable more people to feel safe to choose to ride a bike\nOur safety depends on it.\nRecently, a 24-year-old woman was killed by the driver of a large truck while she was trying to maneuver around a blocked bike lane. Her death is a tragic reminder that even along one of our busiest bikeways that sees thousands of cyclists a day, and in which one can travel almost exclusively on protected bike lanes, one unsafe segment can quickly turn one cyclist\u2019s commute into a tragedy. I regularly encounter bike lanes blocked by parked cars or from construction chaos, and too often I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s no big deal and to \u201cjust go around\u201d. My own safety often seems like an inconvenience.\nI was also heartbroken to hear Alex Amaro\u2019s parents share the loss of their daughter, who was tragically killed while riding her bike on a busy road without bike lanes. Their message was clear: \"Bike lanes could have saved our daughter.\"\nAlex\u2019s parents recounted how Alex was struck by three cars while riding home on Dufferin Street in December 2020, after a quick trip to the mall. Their courage in reliving this tragedy is inspiring, and their story highlights the human cost of inadequate cycling infrastructure.\nAs grieving parents, George Amaro and Karen Orme cannot understand how your government can consider legislation that would remove or block new bike lanes on streets like Bloor, University, and Yonge. George Amaro said, \"It\u2019s about safety. Politics should not be involved when it comes to somebody\u2019s life.\"\nSix people riding bikes have been killed on Toronto\u2019s streets in 2024 alone\u2014more than in the previous three years combined. Every death is a family\u2019s unbearable loss, and each new tragedy reopens old wounds for those who have already suffered. As Karen Orme expressed: \"For the rest of our life, having to deal with the grief that we know personally, that all of these families and their friends are going through. And we don\u2019t wish that on anyone. It is horrific.\"\nPlease reconsider Bill 212. Our roads should be safe for everyone, not just people driving. Please work with municipalities to implement data-driven solutions that can address both traffic safety and congestion. As George Amaro poignantly stated: \"We don\u2019t want just motorists to get home to their families faster, we want everybody to get home to their families... we never had that with our daughter. She never got home to us.\"\n"

        "comment": "Once again this government is using a red herring issue, bike lanes, to mask the real intent of the bill which is to fast track Hwy 413. I would remind the government that despite having a majority in the house, the majority did not vote for them.\nApparently, the fast tracking is because there is a full agenda for the legislature. Why did you take such a long summer break? Perhaps the intention is to muzzle democracy.\nThe premier suggests that there is no need for further environmental studies because they have been going on for 30 years. A lot has happened in 30 years. We know a lot more about the fragility of our ecosystem. We have the Greenbelt and the Oak Ridges Moraine for a reason.\nAlso, a lot more is understood about traffic. The more roads, the more cars. Hwy 413 will not end gridlock. It will encourage more. It will encourage sprawl which benefits developers but doesn't help people looking for affordable housing close to where they work. All those people will be in their cars going to work. Never mind the increased carbon footprint.\nAs for the bike lanes making gridlock worse has the  government considered parked cars as impediments to traffic flow?\n"

The process exists to ensure that the best sound decision has been made before proceeding with a project that would have irreversible consequences.

        "comment": "Like many Torontonians I ride a bike around the city. It is the fastest way to get around, not to mention the healthiest and most environmentally friendly form of transportation. But biking does come at some personal risk. I was thrilled when the bike lanes were added to the major streets in the city. It made me safer and it encouraged me to use a bike rather than take my car.\nRemoving bike lanes will, of course, have the opposite effect\u2014 it will discourage me from taking a bike and it will put me at more risk.\nWhy is this happening?  It sounds like it is an attempt to reduce gridlock in the city. But is that really going to solve the problem? Isn\u2019t the real issue that the population of Toronto has expanded to a point that it is straining the infrastructure of the city?\nThis quote from the Globe and Mail article (linked below) says it all:\n\u201cTo say giving more space to cars can solve congestion, that just does not work. That is world-is-flat stuff,\u201d said Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor at the University of Toronto in the department of civil and mineral engineering, who studies sustainable infrastructure. \u201cThe consensus is that bike lanes are a critical tool for reducing congestion and increasing mobility. So, no, they don\u2019t cause congestion. Cars cause congestion.\u201d\nSo, by removing bike lanes, the city is actually increasing congestion. This seems like a foolish, not to mention costly, proposal.\nNow, to vent my frustration for a moment: this is another example of the Ford government making an ill-informed choice for purely political reasons. This is not a seriously considered proposal. It is not a real attempt to fix the problem of congestion in the city. It\u2019s just more populist showmanship, which unfortunately is an effective political tool, but really solves nothing for the people who live here.\n"

We\u2019re lucky that we can bike for majority of the year in Toronto unlike my hometown of Edmonton where I could see bike lanes being viewed as inefficient. Biking as transportation in Toronto is one of my favourite things about living here and to know it will be less safe to do so will only create more of a headache for the rest of the city. Please please please keep the bike lanes as there are already to few to have them gone completely will be a danger to all!!!\n"
