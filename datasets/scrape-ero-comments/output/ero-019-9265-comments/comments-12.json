        "comment": "I am writing in opposition to this proposed anti-bike lane legislation.. This policy would not only compromise road safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers but would also infringe upon municipalities\u2019 authority to make decisions that directly impact their communities.\nThis legislation directly contradicts Ottawa\u2019s long-term vision to expand its cycling network, aiming to increase bike routes by 50% by 2046. Interference from provincial authorities disrupts these carefully planned, community-backed projects, which are crucial for Ottawa\u2019s sustainable future.\nLocal experts and planners have worked closely with residents to develop active transportation projects, and these should be supported, not undermined.\nThis legislation could also place an undue financial burden on taxpayers, leading to costly removal of existing bike lanes and adding unnecessary bureaucracy and delays to projects already approved. Residents want an efficient, connected transportation system with diverse options\u2014not a rollback that would limit safety and accessibility.\nOntarians are asking for practical solutions to ease traffic congestion and promote safety for all road users. Increased transportation options contribute to a more connected, eco-friendly future where not every trip requires a car.\nStudies, including a recent CBC report, have shown that widening roads and adding car lanes do little to reduce gridlock. On the contrary, cities that invest in bike lanes experience reduced congestion, cleaner air, and safer streets for everyone. Bike lanes are not just beneficial\u2014they are essential to public health, environmental progress, and local business.\nOttawa residents value our bike lanes and the benefits they bring. This misguided legislation does not reflect the needs or wishes of most Ontarians. I ask that you listen to your constituents and support local decision-making that prioritizes our communities\u2019 health and safety.\n"

        "comment": "As a frequent driver and biker in the City of Toronto, I think that some of the priorities of this Bill are misled and will not benefit drivers in Ontario. Municipalities should retain their ability to build bike lanes where they believe they are best-suited. The province, while it has jurisdiction over traffic and highways, should trust in the experts in each municipality to make informed and data-driven decisions on their own bike lanes. I frequently have to drive downtown to get to and from work, or to visit family in other municipalities, and having safe bike lanes has been a crucial part of reducing traffic and gridlock. When bikes are forced to share the lane with drivers, and especially when it is inconsistent due to construction, it greatly increases drivers' stress and risk of accidents. Bike lanes disappearing, reappearing, and merging with car lanes constantly doesn't help anyone's safety or efficiently on the road. Even if only 2% of the population uses bikes to commute to and from work, the impact that poor bike lane management and excessive construction has can be huge - from delaying so many drivers in their commute, to causing more emissions from all the stalled vehicles, and worstly it's far more dangerous for the lives and safety of Ontarian cyclists. While building the new highway is a great initiative and sure to help the province, this should not come at the cost of making things worse for bike lanes, local drivers, and the environment.\n"

They will negatively impact Ontarians if they are not addressed.\n- Removing environmental assessments is incredibly shortsighted and irresponsible. It is critical we protect our ecosystems now more than ever. We have already seen the direct effects of climate change this summer in Toronto, where flooding caused costly damage. Hammering through construction without evaluating the environmental costs will lead to more issues in the near future.\n- Removing installed bike lanes from municipal roads is a waste of tax payer money, a waste of our time as we deal with more construction, will make commute times longer as those bike riders will now become car traffic (or will take up space in the car lanes), will make multi-vehicle roads less safe, and will take away green transportation options.\nThis will not speed up commute times; it will do the opposite of what this bill proposes.\n"

        "comment": "I am very concerned about this bill. The way to reduce gridlock is not to build more extremely expensive roads and remove bike lanes. This just increases traffic. When has it ever worked before? The way forward is to build good public transportation and more bike lanes. One bus can take the place of 50 cars! Bike lanes are being used as a scapegoat for the gridlock problems. Also, requiring municipalities to get permission from the province to add bike lanes will increase red-tape. The municipalities  know much better what works best for their communities. Removing bike lanes will result in more cyclist injuries and fatalities. Good, safe bike lanes encourage people to leave their cars at home and cycle instead. Cities around the world who do not suffer from gridlock are those which have excellent public transportation and a good bike lane system, not those who just add roads. As well, more cars mean higher CO2 emissions increasing our dire problems with climate change. We can do better than this!\n"

        "comment": "There can't be a good reason or data backing the proposal to remove bike lanes.  It's counterintuitive.  My son who lives in Toronto was seriously hurt when he was forced to take the main road instead of the bike lane that was under construction. Once the new bike lane was in place he was able to resume safely riding to work. More roads, more vehicle lanes are not going to solve this problem.  Invest in better transit systems and keep cycling safe.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to you as a resident of Ontario, in the City of Ottawa and a professional transportation planner. I am dismayed as I read the news release from the Province of Ontario dated October 21, 2024 for the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. There is little to no information about the act and no resources citing research or informed policy information for many of the changes proposed in the act. The omnibus nature of this act is opaque and undemocratic. Why are all these disparate policies being compiled into a single act? That does not provide sufficient opportunity for discussion and each policy to be examined and judged on their own merit. Each of these new policies and actions need to be discussed on their own. With that said, I applaud your interest and attempt to speed up the process for government action. There are numerous crises in Ontario today being most keenly felt by those experiencing poverty, unstable housing and broader unaffordability, not to mention addictions and mental health, and they need our governments at all levels to take swift, bold actions to work towards sustainable decisions.\nThere are many issues I take with ranging proposals within the proposed legislation, but I want to focus my attention on this email regarding the proposed new approval process for the installation of new cycling infrastructure. With this issue I speak from a place of expertise and close experience, having worked in the profession for over 8 years, and having worked on transportation projects ranging from master plans, feasibility studies, and projects through the design process that have then been implemented. The idea that municipalities who need to receive approval from MTO before implementing a project is deeply concerning, as it is directly disentitling municipalities to their jurisdiction and creating new layers of red tape that will lead to slowing down an already lengthy, arduous process for a municipality to implement an infrastructure project. At what point in the process would a municipality need to get approval from the province? So often infrastructure projects that include bike lanes are part of initiatives stemming from the municipality's core policy and planning documents including their Official Plan, Transportation Master Plan, a Road Safety Plan, or Climate Action Plan. All these plans are developed through intensive, thoughtful processes that most often include public engagement, and build upon research and best practices. These documents are wide ranging, and broadly setting directions for a community, and responding to the needs of the community, helping it grow and prosper. These documents reflect the community and direct staff towards actions to respond to their needs towards realizing the community's vision and goals. Your proposed policy directly denies for these communities to direct themselves and respond to the desires of their residents and their needs. Would it be here that a municipality would need to seek prospective approval even though a lane removal is just a potential option that could be to help more affordably or rapidly enact infrastructure changes that stem from their policies? If not, then would it be at some point as the municipality takes a project through preliminary design, functional, or detailed design? What moment do they need to pause a project that they have likely engaged a consultant to complete, and put it on pause until it receives approval from MTO? This would add an additional step, and introduce friction into a business engagement and remove predictability, very likely leading towards increased costs for already cash-strapped municipalities due to requiring more project time and an unclear path forward for the consultant.\nI could also comment on the vagueness of the proposed legislation that projects will have to \"demonstrate that the proposed bike lane will not have a negative impact on vehicle traffic\". This is an incredibly single-minded proposal that maintains the status quo in which we are experiencing increasing congestion. It doesn't consider the potential multitudes of benefits of bike lanes which have been rigorously researched in Ontario, Canada, and internationally, and instead decides negative impacts for motor vehicle traffic are the only perspective that matters. This neglects the experience, safety, and needs of the senior getting exercise, the parent cycling with child, the student, the commuter, the person without a drivers license because they can't afford to own or maintain a car or physically not be able to drive. And what is a negative impact? How do we quantify it? Is it any increase in travel time along a corridor? What if there are benefits for people driving motor vehicles from the project like a decrease in the number and severity of collisions? Do those override the negative impacts? What if the project means that a parent driving doesn't need to pick up their young teen after school, because now they have a safe way to bike home, which would provide the parent with real time and money savings. Now that's a benefit!\nA single segment of bike lane in isolation may seem unnecessary, that it doesn't provide or get adequate use. I'd like to challenge that notion, and put it in a network perspective. When we travel by car through our cities we are able to travel on numerous routes of our choosing to access any destination, door to door. People who are cycling can use roads, but many - particularly arterial roads have high vehicle speeds and volumes that make cycling very uncomfortable and unsafe, so much so that while the majority of the population wants to cycle, they won't, because they don't feel comfortable and safe to do so. Bike lanes, especially ones with physical separation, create conditions on these arterial roads for people to feel comfortable using them. Very often everyday destinations such as schools, grocery stores and services are along these arterial roads, so people will only choose to access them if they feel comfortable cycling on that arterial road.Other times, that arterial road will be the only direct route through a community to connect between different neighbourhoods. We weigh directness, feasibility of cycling infrastructure, and latent demand when we develop proposed cycling networks for communities. The proposed legislation would set back hard work completed by the municipalities on developing networks. We know that if there's even one weak link in a network, like a stressful road, people will choose not to cycle for that trip.\nI hope that you have read and reflected on this email and consider how it aligns not only with provincial policy including past and current Provincial Planning Statements but also your own rhetoric about removing red tape, responding to the needs of Ontarians in this moment, and for a better, healthier, and more affordable future.\n"

Bike lanes increase the overall capacity of a corridor, especially when separated and dedicated turning lanes are provided at intersections. Cycling corridors cannot be relegated to side streets, as cyclists are also looking to access the same destinations as motorists. In the case of Bloor specifically, there is no viable parallel route that doesn\u2019t involve significant detours. It is time to stop playing blatant politics and let transportation network decisions be informed by actual data and analysis engaged in by subject matter experts. This is significant overreach into a municipal matter and has no business being legislated by the provincial government.\n"
