        "comment": "This bill is antithetical to so many of its supposed goals that it boggles the mind that it could possibly be considered even remotely reasonable.\nFor every single one of those bikers you take out of the bike lane (a number that, mind you, is immensely understated by the proponents of this bill), another massive car is added to the road; a car that is much more ingestion-inducing than a bike lane is.\nFor every car lane that you add to a road, as it is eminently well understood by civil engineers the world round, you do not get a linear amount of increased car throughput. Induced demand from increasing road area means that ingestion will rise to its limit no matter what, making such a small impact on traffic that it is barely distinguishable from the throughput before expansion.\nThese car lanes are actively harmful to the small businesses that improve Toronto's culture and economy. Cars are expressly NOT vehicles of urban exploration. Bikes are, public transit is, and foot traffic is. A car user will not pull over to investigate a thrift shop or a florist or a new restaurant on a whim. Cars are also an incredibly expensive mode of transportation, leaving less spending money for people who are already stretched so thin. Overall, cars are toxic to small businesses.\nCars are also toxic in a very literal sense. Air pollution is, by-and-large, the single most damaging forms of pollution from a health perspective. An estimated 15,000 Canadians die every year from the effects of air pollution and expanding car infrastructure also expands that number.\nAnother dubious increasing statistic from putting more cars on the road is car deaths. Car deaths are one of the most dangerous forms of transportation accessible in cities. Unfortunately, the danger is mostly to pedestrian and, indeed, cyclists. That danger is minimized significantly with bike lanes, separating the two forms of transportation and providing a buffer zone to pedestrians. In 2022, nearly 20% of the 1931 vehicle fatalities in Canada were pedestrians and cyclists; a sobering number considering the share of commuting that this bill purports them to have.\nLastly, for many, we will not go away if you tear out these bike lanes. For many of us we have no alternative. You are putting bikes back in car lanes. You are putting bikers into early graves. You are putting pollution in the air. You are putting businesses into bankruptcy. Speaking frankly, I fail to see even a single solitary redeeming quality in the entirety of this bill.\n"

        "comment": "The stated objective of this Act is to reduce \"gridlock,\" yet it proposes measures likely to harm public health and safety, limit mobility and access to Ontario communities, damage environmental protections, and exacerbate the climate crisis.\nAlthough the Municipal Act grants municipalities authority over local affairs, this Act requires provincial approval for new bike lanes if they replace a traffic lane. This requirement represents an overreach by the provincial government, undermining local autonomy. It implies a lack of trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs and disregard for local democracy. Bike lanes are built only after an extensive planning process, including research and community engagement, so this intervention appears unnecessary and intrusive.\nAdditionally, adding car lanes has been proven ineffective for reducing traffic congestion. The principle of Induced Demand demonstrates that increasing road capacity only attracts more cars, worsening traffic over time. If the government were truly focused on easing gridlock, it would prioritize substantial investments in public transit infrastructure and develop extensive cycling networks. Cycling reduces road congestion, as each bike replaces a car, making more room for necessary vehicle use.\nPremier Ford\u2019s pledge to remove three bike lanes in Toronto disregards the thousands of people using these lanes daily, effectively taking thousands of cars off the road. Studies, such as the Bloor Bike Lane reports by Toronto city staff, show that bike lanes support local businesses, which are likely to suffer from their removal. Numerous Toronto Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) have already voiced their support for bike lanes, recognizing their value for local commerce.\nCycling is also a healthier choice, promoting better health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The presence of bike lanes makes streets safer for all users\u2014cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians alike. This year alone, six cyclists have died on Toronto streets, a tragic reminder of the need for safer cycling infrastructure.\nFurthermore, bike lanes expand mobility options for those who cannot afford car ownership, enabling more residents to travel for work, leisure, and commerce, supporting a more inclusive local economy. A car-centric approach, on the other hand, marginalizes people without access to a private vehicle.\nRegarding the exemption of Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments, this policy is shortsighted and environmentally damaging. The proposed highway route passes through sensitive land that serves as a carbon sink, habitat for native species, and natural floodplain. Paving over this area would permanently degrade its environmental value. Additionally, without proper environmental assessments, this project poses risks of increased traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. As with the gridlock issue, meaningful solutions lie in robust public transit infrastructure and support for alternative mobility options, like bike lanes.\nOne must question whether credentialed experts, such as planners, environmentalists, or engineers, were consulted during the drafting of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 takes a misguided approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock, likely achieving the opposite result. It risks worsening congestion, endangering public safety, harming local economies, causing irreversible environmental damage, and negatively impacting public health. This bill should not proceed.\n"

        "comment": "This will not reduce gridlock nor save time. To reduce gridlock we need fewer cars on the road. These proposed changes make it more dangerous and inconvenient for people to choose alternatives to driving and will incentivize people to drive. This creates more traffic in the long run.\nOn top of this, these would remove measures that make it safer for everyone who gets to work to do so. My city has had numerous cyclist deaths this year. I want safe alternatives to driving to get to work, and my neighbours who drive don\u2019t want the stress of having to navigate around cyclists: a well connected network of bike lanes helps everyone get around the city safely.\nThis government campaigned on lowering costs and yet they want to spend government money on making red tape and undoing work that cities have already done? Bike lanes go through tons of review by cities before they are put in. This legislation does not make sense from the perspectives of planning or economics.\nWe all want to get around safely and efficiently. This proposal is actively counterproductive to that. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my dismay over significant portions of Bill 212. The overall content of the bill is founded on hypotheses that are erroneous in fact (as readily shown by the significant majority of current urban congestion research) and the measures specified cannot be expected to efficiently address the issue that they purport to address. Worse, the specified measures can be reasonably expected to adversely affect the environment, and make the problem worse over the long term. In particular, the actions specifically added in the October 31 addendum to the Act - namely the removal of existing bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge in Toronto - are highly likely to induce demand for automobile traffic that will exacerbate the problem over the medium and long term future.\nThe preamble to the bill states that:\n\"The Government of Ontario:\nRecognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\nThis statement identifies that the challenge the government intends to address is gridlock, and that the objective is to save drivers and businesses time and money. While gridlock is a problem that is definitely worth solving, the implicit assumption that building priority highways is an effective solution is demonstrably false, except in the shortest of future terms. Additionally, the focus on drivers and businesses belies an unbalanced view of the problem at hand, neglecting all other stakeholders and magnifying the likelihood of a flawed proposal. This becomes evident when the proposed measures are viewed against both their likely efficacy in solving the problem at hand, and the undesirable effects they are likely to cause.\nIt is well understood in the current research that additional traffic lanes for cars create short-term relief followed by induced demand that magnifies the problem in the medium and long term. Conversely, a 2021 comprehensive study of congestion in 100 American cities by Mokhlesur Rahman and Jean-Claude Thill which also amalgamated and summarized the results of 30 other studies found:\n\"Of all the considerations tested...non-car mode share behaviors have the greatest\nimpacts on reducing all three aspects of congestion, travel time, congested lane miles, and the\nduration of peak periods. Non-car mode share reduces congestion significantly by reducing car\nuse and increasing public transport and walking. While a number of authors (e.g., Bhattacharjee\nand Goetz, 2012; Anderson, 2014; Beaudoin et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015) have\nunderscored the relief that public transportation brings on congestion, the magnitude of the\neffect uncovered here is quite striking. It literally dwarfs the overall effect of highway\ninfrastructure development on congestion (0.390 versus 0.086, Table 10). While more highway\nand freeways reduce congestion by providing alternative routes to people (direct effect of -\n0.92), they also invite more cars on the streets due to induced demand for travel (indirect effect\nof 0.833), hence the melting of the positively contributive effect of highway infrastructure\ndown to -0.086.\"\nIf the Government of the Province of Ontario wishes to reduce congestion in Toronto, they would do well to heed the results of this massive study. These results clearly state that not only do \"non-car mode share behaviours\" (i.e., active and public transportation) \"have the greatest impact on reducing all three aspects of congestion\"  but also that \"more highway and freeways...invite more cars on the streets due to induced demand...melting...the positively contributive effect...to [a negative number].\"\nBy proposing this bill, the Government is choosing to act counter to the interests of the majority of the people they serve, and leading in a direction that irresponsibly supports populist and vitriolic anti-cycling sentiment. The Bloor, University, and Yonge cycling lanes are routes that form the core of what has begun to be an interconnected network of cycling infrastructure. Research also shows clearly that cycling infrastructure is only effective once an interconnected network is formed. Removing these lanes in particular will not only cripple the type of activity that has a chance of dealing effectively with the congestion problem, but it will also magnify the problem in the long run by inducing increased demand for vehicular traffic in downtown Toronto.\nIt is worth noting, however, that this Act is not problematic only in Toronto. I have had the opportunity to both cycle and drive in a number of southern Ontario cities as well as in cities in other countries around the world. I cycle daily. I also drive very regularly. It's clear to me that improved cycling infrastructure (and especially physically segregated infrastructure) has the potential to create the kind of environment that is conducive not only to desirable cycling conditions, but desirable driving conditions as well. I would much rather drive down a Yonge Street with less cars and a 30 or 40 km/h speed limit, and countless bicycles utilizing the bike lanes. This approach would not only move a great deal more people a great deal more quickly than simply adding another vehicle lane and removing the bike lanes, but it would also be substantially more pleasant for everyone. And, as we have already found out, adding the cycle lanes have improved revenues for businesses on Yonge. The choice to remove these lanes is frankly baffling in light of the stated goals.\nFinally, with respect to this Act, the requirement for municipalities to receive provincial ministry approval prior to the creation of cycling infrastructure is blatant overreach in almost any circumstance. And the pretense that this has to do with improving gridlock, already shown above as false, is also blatant overreach on the part of the provincial government and indicative of the worst form of authoritarian and baseless ideological political maneuvering. This kind of legislation exacerbates not only the very problems it purports to solve, but also the divisive politics that mire our society in ill feeling and blinkered ignorance.\nThe final comment that I would like to make is with respect to the Highway 413 act, Section 2 of which \"provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nOnce again, this is an example of poor reasoning in the face of mountainous quantities of thorough research. As a result, the optics of the situation appear as willful opposition to meaningful, valuable protections against the results of that very type of activity. First, the very belief that this highway is essential is still questionable in the face of the same evidence I have provided above (and will attach to this commentary). And second, the point of the Environmental Assessment Act is to ensure that environmentally impactful projects (like highways, and particularly large 400-series highways) are undertaken only with an amount of environmental impact mitigation that is sufficient to address the challenges they create. Nothing should be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act. The environmental assessment of the project is next to meaningless if the project is a priori exempt.\nTo sum up, the challenge we face is real. Congestion is undesirable. However, the hypothesis that we have more cars moving faster is a desirable alternate reality is flawed. It's not the cars that need to move faster or with less congestion. It's the *people* that need to move with less friction. There are many ways to address that problem, but more lanes for cars is demonstrably ineffective, as shown in cities all around the world and studied by many reliable scholars. There are effective techniques, and they generally include public transportation, active transportation, walkable infrastructure, and tele-work (i.e., reducing the frequency of intra-city travel), among others. From a taxpayer perspective, all of these are more cost-effective than highways, and everything is more cost-effective than dismantling steps taken by cities to move in the direction of effective congestion mitigation (i.e., first-class cycling infrastructure).\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are crucial, especially in a congested city like Toronto, where traffic and car expenses, such as parking, make commuting challenging. Bikes offer an affordable, time-efficient alternative, particularly for students and entry-level workers.

Toronto should follow the example of advanced cities like Amsterdam by prioritizing cycling, as it\u2019s an ideal transportation option in a compact urban environment.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto\u2019s west end and a commuter of all forms (biking, public transit, and driving), I am adamantly against the removal of biking infrastructure and the unnecessary interference by the provincial government in the ability of cities to construct new lanes. It is a completely irresponsible use of taxpayer money to remove well-used infrastructure like this, and the pitting of cars vs. bikes to create a culture war is an extremely reckless and bad-faith initiative from the provincial government.\nTraffic is caused by many factors - construction, population growth, and poor driving skills (paired with a lack of enforcement) to name a few. So this is not a matter of cars vs. bikes, and to frame bike lanes as the primary culprit of traffic congestion is ridiculous. Instead, this is a matter of all transportation options vs. gridlock. The way to reduce gridlock in the city is NOT by reducing existing transit infrastructure (bike lanes), but by:\n(i) Investing in all forms of transportation (particularly systems like the subway and GO trains, which are a far more efficient way of moving people to, from, and around the city than cars, especially during rush hour commute traffic),\n(ii) Addressing the delays that have become more of a norm than an exception in construction projects, and\n(iii) Confronting the seriously deteriorating driving culture in the GTA. Whether due to poor skills or lack of consideration for others, the aggression, obliviousness, and arrogance on GTA roads is bad for gridlock, and, more importantly, for safety. Drivers need to be properly trained and rules need to be properly enforced.\nResearch suggesting that replacing bike lanes with an additional lane of traffic reduces congestion is very inconsistent. In fact, research into the phenomenon of induced demand - whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in cost (i.e. traffic delays in this case) and thus an increase in consumption (driving) resulting in just as much traffic as before - is much more extensive and well-founded. Simply, cars are an incredibly inefficient use of space on our roads, and adding more lanes will only exacerbate that inefficiency. Instead, the focus of transportation infrastructure and investment should be on making alternative commuting options more appealing to get people off the roads, thereby freeing up space for vehicles that actually need to be there, such as buses, those with mobility issues, or shipping vehicles (because the reality is that many people who choose to drive do not need to drive and this culture of car-supremacy shows clear favouritism for constituents who do not rely biking or public transit to get around).\nLastly - and most importantly - removing bike lanes will put cyclists in danger, and the adamance over their removal shows blatant disregard for public safety. While putting new lanes on side streets may be practical in some cases, it is often not feasible in Toronto due to the broken grid system and would often make bike travel tedious and less efficient.\nThis Bill represents a complete overreach by the province into municipal affairs, and a distraction from the fact that the province has completely failed to deliver the public transit projects in Toronto that it actually does have the mandate to oversee (see Metrolinx), resulting in years of delays and ballooning costs (and likely contributing to the gridlock that the province claims to be trying to address).\n"

        "comment": "Decades of prioritizing the motor vehicle has caused the congestion we see in the cities of Ontario today. If we continue to prioritize motor vehicles, congestion will only get  worse. There needs to be safe alternatives for people. Removing bike lanes puts lives at risk. We cannot place a higher priority on motor vehicle travel times over lives.\nPeople not only ride bikes for leisure, they ride bikes to commute to work, to run errands, to grocery shop, to take their kids to school. It makes sense for bike lanes to be on main arterial roads as these roads are usually the most direct route. These roads also can be extremely dangerous and having a protected bike lane makes travelling along them much safer for EVERYONE (yes even people travelling in their motor vehicles).\nBike lanes are not anti-car, they are pro-city. Removing them is a step backwards and will be detrimental for cyclists and other vulnerable road users across this Province.\nPlease respect local governments and leave this issue for municipalities to tackle.\n"

I believe that local governments should have the autonomy to implement these initiatives without interference from the provincial government, especially when it comes to managing urban traffic. Restricting bike lanes could make commuting more dangerous, forcing cyclists like me to share busy roads with cars, increasing the risk of accidents.\nBeyond safety, promoting cycling supports affordable, green transportation options that have no carbon footprint and save money compared to car ownership. Bike lanes also encourage fitness and active lifestyles, contributing to the health of Ontarians. Requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an example of overreach, and it undermines efforts to build more sustainable cities for everyday Canadians.\n"
