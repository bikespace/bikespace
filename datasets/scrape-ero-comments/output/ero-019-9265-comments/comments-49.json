        "comment": "I am a car driver, a bicyclist, a husband and a father of three children.  It upsets me that bicycle lanes have become a political wedge issue in this province when the focus should be about the right for people to be able to choose a mode of transportation and get to where they want to go safely.\nAs a health care worker working in one of the hospitals on University Avenue in Toronto, biking to and from work using the Danforth, Bloor Street, and University Avenue bike lanes has been essential for me.\nI used to take the TTC, but due to consistently poor service (ie overcrowding of trains, frequent delays due to various medical emergencies) it was not a dependable mode of transportation.\nDriving to work was not an option either as parking expenses and gasoline costs significantly cut into our family budget.\nBiking has not only been an effective way to help me and my family live within our means, it has also improved my physical and mental health, both of which were severely tested as I helped to treat patients during the Covid pandemic.\nIt has been a joy for me to see my wife and children bike safely along Danforth Avenue and observe how the bike lanes have increased foot traffic at local businesses and livened up the neighbourhood in which we live.\nRemoving bike lanes for more car lanes is not a long-term solution to relieving traffic congestion.  More car lanes will only result in induced demand (ie more cars on the road) and endanger the lives of people like me who will be forced to share the road with faster, heavier moving vehicles.  Continuing to build bicycle infrastructure in this city and expanding public transit are the only long-term solutions to the congestion issue we currently face.\nIt is for these reasons that I urge you to reconsider Bill 212.\n"

We have collected thousands of signatures against the Bloor Street Integration Project however, all of our efforts have been repeatedly ignored by councilor Chris Fonseca.\nCurrently, travel on the Bloor Street from Royal York towards downtown where lane reduction has already been implemented and bike lanes created is an absolute nightmare and dangerous, not to mention it created increased traffic jams and pollution.

That space can be used for bike lanes, or widen the sidewalks to support both bike and pedestrian traffic with painted lines. The same applies to the main streets in Toronto- sacrifice some sidewalk width for bike lanes and put the vehicle traffic lanes back - please.\n"

        "comment": "Resident from Mississauga:  Thank you for addressing and with proposed Bill 212 putting a stop to municipalities wanting to reduce lanes on major roadways in order to allow for bike lanes.  After travelling in Toronto and experiencing the ridiculous and aggravating delays on Bloor Street, St. Clair and University - what an awful reality for drivers.  I now avoid any major roadway that has been lane reduced and has bike lanes because I can no longer allow myself to experience such stress.  So much so that I avoid driving to Toronto now. And, here in Mississauga the city wants to do the same on Bloor Street where so many homes directly front onto Bloor.  How is this safe for the residents/ property owners who need to back out of and drive into their homes onto a reduced major roadway?  How is this safe for cyclists?  How is this safe for drivers? Bike lanes belong on secondary road ways where there is far less vehicle traffic and more safety.  Taking this step in Bill 212 is the a step in the right direction for everyone's safety.  Thank you.  You have our full support from me and my family.  For this Bill and for the next election.\n"

        "comment": "The addition of bike lanes needs to be carefully considered and designed so it does not create further traffic challenges and gridlock.\nOn Bloor the current bike lanes and the proposed bike lanes to Bloor in Mississauga are problematic. Traffic is at all time high. Emergency vehicles can\u2019t get by and TtC buses are also stuck in the one lane of traffic. On Bloor in Mississauga public transit is buses not a subway so reducing to one lane creates problems for public transit. Lastly the bike lanes are under utilized. Bikes may be a great option but ways to include lanes should not create reduction in vehicle lanes.\n"

Without the bloor bike lines there will be more accidents and more traffic congestion. Not to mention, when cars pull into the bike lanes and park in them, this causes bikers to go around and risk being doored by the drivers and getting into accidents. This has happened to me before, and so many other cyclists I know in the city. Our safety should be prioritized over car culture, capitalism, and bad urban planning.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, specifically the provisions allowing the removal of bike lanes on major roads such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto.\nBike lanes play a crucial role in promoting sustainable transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Removing these lanes will discourage cycling, make roads less safe for cyclists, and contradict Ontario\u2019s environmental and public health goals. These bike lanes are heavily used and provide essential options for commuters who cannot or prefer not to rely on cars.\nAdditionally, prioritizing motor vehicle traffic at the expense of bike lanes risks undermining efforts to create a balanced and modern transportation system. Removing these lanes is a step backward for a city like Toronto, which is striving to become more accessible and environmentally friendly.\nI urge the government to reconsider this portion of Bill 212 and instead focus on enhancing infrastructure for all modes of transportation, including cycling, to ensure a sustainable future for Ontario.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"

        "comment": "The province and Premier are rightly prioritizing building new housing for the people of Ontario. New houses and new residents create new travel needs. People will use the transit systems that the province builds and it is therefore very important that Ontario builds the transit systems that make sense in each region. In a busy city like Toronto or Hamilton the roads are already congested and new cars on the roads will make it worse unless we use public space smartly.\nSmart usage of our streets includes bike lanes to absorb the large demand for short-trips to local businesses or events that surrounding neighbourhoods create. Absorption of this demand frees up our roadways for longer trips that need to be made by car. The residents of Ontario can all appreciate a pleasant walk or short bike ride to a local store. The province removing bike lanes unilaterally means that the space freed is taken up again by locals who don't feel safe enough to walk or bike a short trip. Instead, good faith negotiating between municipalities and the province should be used to address both provincial and local demands for our streets. This bill does not balance the different demands in a healthy way.\nIf this bill passes, the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for a large number of very local decisions across the province. The Ministry's resources, and that of the government of Ontario more broadly, should not be directed to reviewing and fighting cities on traffic hotspots. It is my concern that the Ministry of Transportation's resources are not adequate to give each local decision the due consideration and time it deserves. Especially so in the context of cities implementing more bike lanes to help reduce carbon emmissions. The end result will be rubber-stamping every bike lane or denying every bike lane. Niether situation is desirable. Both scenarios work at cross purposes with the municipalities of Ontario which share the provinces goal to make our roads more pleasant and reduce congestion.\nFurther, the public comments made by the Minister and the Premier do not appear consistent with an intent to negotiate in good faith. The comments are instead aimed at unilaterally changing small spaces of cities without consideration of the whole city as a system. There is nothing in this bill binding the Minister's decision making to any metric or plan consistent with the data or projections provided by municipalities.\nFinally, this bill lacks language binding the Minister to safety considerations for those people who bike, or must bike, regardless of the existence of bicycle infrastructure. The province's goal to save people time is a good goal that should be pursued. However, it should not be pursued at the cost of injuries to people using our roads. Bicycle lanes, whether they remove a lane of traffic or not, help to naturally slow drivers and keep them alert. Alert drivers improve safety for themselves, people crossing traffic, and people biking. These safety outcomes are important and should be part of any provincial bill touching road safety.\nI urge lawmakes to amend this bill or vote it down as written.\nThank you for consideration of my comment.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act , 2024\nI would like to put forth my concerns regarding Building Highways Faster Act , 2024.  To be clear, I am a motorhead, and rely on driving as my main means of transportation.\nDespite this, I am putting forth my concerns with this Act as it has been criticized as something that does not address the issue of reducing gridlock.  On an intuitive level, it would appear that building more expressways would help alleviate gridlock.  However, this intuitive approach ignores a phenomenon called induced demand where the increase in road space dedicated for car traffic has a strong tendency to attract more people in choosing to drive.  Often creating a vicious cycle where more lanes leads to more cars which leads to more lanes built to accommodate the additional cars which only further fuels the demand.  Los Angels, California, USA is a prime example of such where despite being famous for its multi lane expressways, is also infamous for its traffic jams.\nInstead of contributing to this vicious cycle, we should instead look into ways to encourage the use efficient forms of transportation (e.g. walking, cycling, and public transportation).  This goes beyond gridlock.  Effective transportation is what keeps the economic engine going and it is not possible to add more road space to allow everyone to drive.  Reducing car dependency also means opening up the door to having apartment buildings with fewer parking spaces.  This in turn reduces the costs of construction.  The entire nation is facing housing crisis and one of the means of speeding up construction is to make it easier to have viable housing project.  The last thing we need to make projects more expensive having to put in more parking as the residents will not have other options.\nFurthermore, making alternatives to driving less attractive does a great disservice to people who have to drive.  Increasing the number of cars on the roads simply adds to the congestion making the transportation network less efficient.  It also means car enthusiasts do not get the chance to enjoy their prized cars like they are meant to be enjoy and instead every drive will be one through gridlock.\nThe bottom line is that favouring the use of the car at the expense of alternatives like active transport is a losing proposition for everyone regardless their preferred method of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am very appreciative that finally decisions are being made to consider both automobiles and bicycles needs. It is irresponsible to choose and build bicycle lanes specifically along Bloor St. in Etobicoke without considering the impact to traffic.\nI travel from Mississauga along Bloor St whenever l need to see my Doctor located in the area of Bloor West Village.  A car drive  prior to the installation of bike lanes  from  Mississauga  (Bloor St and Dixie Rd. ) along Bloor St. to Etobicoke (Bloor St and Jane St.) would take me on average 20 to 30 minutes. After the bike lanes were installed in Etobicoke the drive now taken anywhere from 45 to 75 minutes depending on the time of day.\nThe frustrating part of the situation is as l have had to sit in traffic l have observed a maximum range of between 4 to 6 bicycles traveling between Islington Ave  and Jane St. along Bloor St. especially in the fall and winter months.\nUnfortunately l too have seen other results of this poorly conceived plan to have bike lanes along Bloor St. in Etobicoke. Along with gridlock l have observed side streets with vehicles speeding trying to avoid the traffic.\nSimiliarly, I have seen drivers not being able to enter onto Bloor St. from side streets since only one lane is available. I have also observed elderly people as well as people requiring mobility devices needing to be let our at an intersection so that they can try and get to the sidewalk and access the businesses along Bloor St. while avoiding speeding bicyclists.\nI can only imagine how impossible it would be for an emergency vehicle to try and pass the traffic congestion along Bloor St.\nAs l mentioned, l live in Mississauga where the City is trying to put in bike lanes along Bloor St. I am not against bike lanes but l am against an engineering design where both the needs of automobiles and bicyclist are not considered. If bike lanes can be added safely to existing lanes of traffic without the removal of existing car lanes then this would be a \"win- win\" scenario.\nUnfortunately, when l have attended meetings in Mississauga regarding the bike lanes citizens have asked for the studies and data to support bike lanes and none have been provided.\nAnswers from Mississauga politicians  have been \" the public wants them ( bike lanes)\". Since to the best of my understanding there has been no data ( bicycle traffic report ) made available to support bike lanes l suspect that either the data does not exist, was poorly collected or does not support having bike lanes.\nIn addition, different designs for the Mississauga Bloor St bike lanes where presented by the City where lanes of traffic where not reduced but bike lanes were added. This option was rejected in favor of reduced lanes. I suspect that the design option to  reduce lanes in order to construct bike lanes was the easiest and therefore most economical option not the best option.\nIn addition, there has been a big push for densification in order to provide much needed housing in Ontario however when you want to add thousands of new housing units  ( as being considered in the area of Bloor St. In Mississauga) the infrastructure needs of the City have to be considered. Housing densification and development approvals cannot be an afterthought after the road traffic lanes have been reduced.\nHow does one make smart decisions that support both automobile and bicycle needs when there is a lack of data, lack of transparency and a lack of understanding by local politicians.\nPolitical decisions and engineering traffic design  decisions should not be made to favour bicycle riders needs at the expense of automobile traffic needs.  Emergency vehicle access needs also have to be considered.\nFuture housing development / densification decisions also need to consider the transportation needs of various stakeholders.\nExisting bike lanes along major (primary) roads should be removed in areas where they are not supported by data and when there will be additional traffic congestion and/ or safety concerns.\nSimilarly, new bike lanes should not be created along major(primary) roads.\nSmart political and engineering decisions should be made to incorporate bike lanes along secondary roads where traffic congestion would be minimal.\nI thank Doug Ford and the Provincial government for having the fortitude to stand up and listen to the people of Ontario.\nPLEASE  FIX THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION PROBLEM!\nLET'S FIND A \" WIN- WIN\"\nSOLUTION TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION!\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against Schedule 4, Part XII of this bill. This is an egregious case of additional red-tape and over-reach. I am displeased by this government's lack of fiscal responsibility. Our focus should stop being on motor vehicle traffic and consider traffic as a whole. The goal should be to move people, not machines. Focusing on cars moving faster will only make our city streets more unsafe.\nSince we seem to be operating on anecdotes instead of data-driven studies, I have a couple to share. I have several friends who moved out of the municipality (due to lack of affordable housing). They moved to satellite cities near GO train stations with the desire to use that mode of transport to continue visiting the city. Ever since, they\u2019ve had to drive into the city because of line construction or infrequent / no service. I have friends within the city who live close to GO train stations who still choose to drive for the same reasons, who would gladly switch to transit if it were a truly feasible mode of transportation.\nDue to underfunding and lack of proper accountability, people are pushed to congest. And removal of the option of safe alternatives to driving will only encourage it more. We\u2019d be building a city of roads, not of destinations. Several studies have shown that a majority of customers to business on Bloor/Danforth are frequented by those who walk, take transit, or cycle. Several experts and studies show that cities encouraging modes of active transport are healthier and happier.\nAs a driver, cyclist, and public transit user, the biggest reason I would drive is due to overcrowding on transit (even during off-peak hours) due to lack of frequent service or unreliability and a patchwork of safe bike routes that would take me twice as long compared to a direct path to my destination.\nIf you want to reduce gridlock and save people time, without going back in time, fund transit operations and finish rail projects. Give people options. That\u2019s the solution to congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Hey I've got some concerns about the newly proposed infrastructure bill -- the one that includes provisions for expanding highways and creating additional lanes in Ontario.\nI get that the goal is to reduce traffic congestion but adding new lanes is like eating dairy to reduce bodily congestion when what you really need is chicken noodle soup.\nI'm sure you're already aware of all the studies that prove adding highways + lanes don't reduce congestion.\nAnd that investing in better public transit + cycling infrastructure will actually reduce congestion and improve health outcomes. My much more educated on this topic friend, also suggests to replace street parking in major streets to free up lane space as well as introduce a congestion tax to help fund public transit infrastructure.\nBuilding cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas, increasing pollution and it affects everybody equally, rich or poor.\nI'd imagine that if you've got money, you value your time a lot more than the average person and the last thing you want is be stuck in traffic instead of growing your business or enjoying social time with friends and family.\n\u00a0\nConcerns Over Property Rights:\nThe amendments proposed under the Building Broadband Faster Act raise significant concerns regarding property rights. The ability to expropriate land for broadband projects without adequate safeguards undermines the rights of property owners and could lead to unjust outcomes. It is essential that any infrastructure development respects and protects the rights of individuals and communities.\n\u00a0\nEnvironmental Protections:\nI am particularly troubled by the proposed exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act included in the Highways Act. Protecting our natural environment and biodiversity must be a priority in any infrastructure development. We cannot afford to prioritize concrete over the preservation of our ecosystems. Comprehensive environmental assessments are vital to ensure that we understand the potential impacts of our actions on the environment and take necessary steps to mitigate them.\n\u00a0\nIn conclusion, play dirty for the right team instead of letting the corrupt boys ruin our city.\n\u00a0\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\nP.S. check out the YouTube Channel \"Not Just Bikes\" -- he breaks these issues down eloquently.\n"

When it came to the Federal government of allowing fourplexes provincewide, Ford refused saying \"It's not up to the province to dictate where every single building is going to go\" and \"I believe in letting municipalities determine what is good for their communities and what is not good for their communities.\" While upsetting, I do believe in giving the cities their say before the province, even if I disagree.\nYet when it comes to bike lanes, he's allowed to sidestep us and tell us how to design our roadways? Get out of Toronto and actually work on provincial matters like our Healthcare and Education (There's a lot to fix fyi). If this bill goes through I demand Federal Government intervention and I better not hear a peep from Ford about over-reaching.\nOUR property taxes paid for those roads. WE determine how the roads are designed. Unless Ford is willing to cough up money for expansions and work with OUR elected mayor to give more room, stop this nonsense.\nThis bill doesn't even solve gridlock! Too many cars will cause gridlock, that's it. Traffic was already a thing before the bike lanes, and as our population grows, more and more drivers will jam OUR roads. Congestion is not a new science, listen to the experts and real-world examples from other cities trying to solve this.\nWe want a commute for drivers, bikers, public transit, and pedestrians. We are all tax payers and deserve a fair share of the pathway. Disregarding everyone but drivers is how you make traffic worse.\n"
