        "comment": "I was born and raised in rural Ontario, where cars are a necessity of life because of long distances and a lack of alternatives. I've since lived in Switzerland, where you can travel the entire country (even to far-flung mountain villages) by transit and bike. I've traveled throughout Europe and Asia, where people have incredible choices and flexibility in how they move around. I now live and work in Toronto - the best place in the province for mobility choice and affordability. I have thus seen how poor policy has made cars the only option, while good policy has improved the quality of life of me and my community.\nThis bill will be disastrous to consumer choice, climate goals, safety, efficiency, and the province's reputation. I and most of my community in Toronto do not own cars, nor should we need to. They are expensive too own, maintain, fuel, and find parking for. The city is growing rapidly, and there simply is not enough room for everyone to drive. We use transit often, but it can only accomplish so much - the TTC goes down because of a lack of funding, routes are not comprehensive, and it can be slow for a variety of reasons. Cycling is consistently the fastest, healthiest, and cheapest way to get around the city. Just look at BikeShare Toronto's incredible growth. People enjoy and want to cycle, full stop. And we need to be safe. In this bill, the province will be publicly saying that the lives of cyclists matter less, that we are disposable. I am a Registered Nurse working in health policy and administration. The health harms to encouraging driving (stress, sitting, pollution) and increasing risks to cyclists (concussions, fractures) will be felt in our health system. Communities that cycle are simply safer and healthier. The arguments citing bike lanes worsening driving times, harming local business, and being underutilized are not grounded in evidence. I and many of my loved ones cycle for the vast majority of our trips - for work, errands, leisure. The adage goes, 'if you build it, they will come', i.e., induced demand. Cycling is growing rapidly in Toronto. Removing established bike lanes and limiting future development will not get rid of existing cyclists. We will now be weaving in and out of traffic, getting into altercations, slowing down actual driving lanes. An actual solution to improving driving times? Properly funding transit and removing on-street parking. Why is a bike lane that moves thousands of people a day worth less than an entire lane blocked my parked cars?\nFor our collective benefit, please rip up this bill and partner with us on actual solutions. Implementing this bill would make Ontario a laughing stock in the developed world, a place people don't want to visit or enjoy. We can do so much better than this silly culture war. Choose choice, safety, and efficiency. Please, for the sake of me and my loved ones.\n"

        "comment": "I am an avid cyclist who owns properties both in and outside of the city. My recommendation is based on both driving and cycling throughout Toronto.\nWhile I see the need for cycling infrastructure I do believe it can be approached differently to better accommodate both drivers and cyclists by implementing the following.\n-reduce sidewalk width and minimize lane width in order to allow a 3ft space with a simple painted line to act as designated bike lane while not compromising the flow of traffic\n-reduce implementation cost by not installing cycling specific traffic lights as these also make it more confusing for drivers, slowing down traffic and potentially contributing to more accidents\nThe addition of cycling infrastructure to a densely populated city is critical to provide options for people to commute to school and work as well as day to day interactions with businesses. (Groceries, health appointments, etc.)\nIt is possible to have cycling and vehicle infrastructure coexist. We as Torontonians need to agree on solutions that fit our city\u2019s unique needs. We may not be able to mirror other existing infrastructures in other countries but I believe a functional bike lane can be achieved with a minimum requirement of 3ft with a painted line.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a biker, walker, driver, and public transportation user in the GTA.\nThe provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to provide meaningful transportation options. Removing bike lanes that are safe, and (in some cases) newly constructed, along some of these arterial roads is a monumental waste of money, time, and human power.\nI use bike lanes, sidewalks, streets, and public transportation options every single day, and consider them absolutely essential transportation options. Most of the time, if it is a viable option for me, I walk, bike, or take public transport in the city; these are faster, healthier, cheaper, and make it much easier to get around. Because of meaningful infrastructure, these are options for me; the removal of bike lanes will make these decisions much harder, more complicated, more expensive, and less efficient.\nWe need to think about safety and providing options for all users of the road; being a biker on city streets, I fear for my safety especially when I am riding without bike infrastructure.\nWhen I drive or walk, I would much rather that cyclists have their own bike lane. At present, when traveling around Toronto, I often see cyclists (especially delivery drivers) who choose to ride on the sidewalks rather than risk their own safety on the road with no designated lanes. This is a rational choice for them, and I would probably do the same if I were in their position. Additionally, many cyclists do not know how to \"take the lane\" and end up squeezing to the far right on unprotected streets, risking their own safety. Maintaining meaningful bike infrastructure along key arterial routes solves this problem at many levels. For an analysis of the factors that influence route calculations made by real bikers in the city of Toronto, see Li (2017): \"Cycling in Toronto: Route Choice Behavior and Implications to Infrastructure Planning.\"\nBike lanes support transit options by providing meaningful links to and between stations. This will further help reduce car traffic and gridlock. Taking these out will result in more of the same -- many people who have been in Toronto for years have noted that bumper to bumper traffic has always been a problem in the city, even before bike lanes. By keeping the bike lanes, I, and thousands of other Torontonians, will choose to bike over to drive. Study after study demonstrate that bike lanes not only functionally reduce traffic, but are also good for business. It is a simple calculation: fewer cars on the road, less congestion; the easier it is to pop into a store or restaurant because of being on foot or bike, the better it is for local businesses.\nI support safe infrastructure around the city, and safe bike infrastructure is part of this. These proposals will make it worse for everyone, and less safe for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.\nFor these reasons, and many others, is my sincere hope that Bill 212 is not successful.\nThank you.\n"

With the bike lanes, I can safely travel down an important street and then reach destinations. I also encourage my girlfriend to bike with me but she doesn't feel comfortable to bike on any streets without bike lanes, so it is integral to our ability to get around that more bike lanes are built.\nI am not wealthy enough to own a car and therefore these bike lanes provide a lot of useful connections for me that are cheaper and faster than transit because of the odd directions and layout of the transit network.\nAlso, please stop wasting my taxpayer money on another layer of bureaucracy and red tape to complete projecting in our city. Another thing is bike lanes are a lot cheaper to maintain and provide than car lanes, so please stop spending our city's money because they really cannot afford it right now.\nThank you for reading my comment!\n"

        "comment": "I am both a cyclist and a driver when I commute to work.\nThis law is going to set Ontario backwards. It introduces more red-tape and more government and strips powers away from our cities, who are best placed to make decisions about their own streets. Evidently, the party of small government is not very much for small governments when it suits some agenda of theirs.\nTo decrease traffic at a point of saturation we need to offer alternatives to cars, and making biking less accessible will increase the amount of cars. I have not seen any evidence that the bike lanes cause traffic or where their removal has decreased traffic. In fact, roads will become even more multi-use as well and bikes will directly slow down cars instead of having their own dedicated paths.\nGrade separated bike paths also improves safety. No one is saying that biking is safe, but this law will make it even less safe to bike in our streets. Why do cyclists safety not matter to the government?\nThis law is setting Ontario back decades. We need to foster a variety of safe commuting and transit options and not take them away due to the vanity of our politicians. Ontario is failing its citizens with this law.\n"

        "comment": "I find this bill a rediculous waste of time and government resources. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governance trying increase transportation options. I use bike lanes every day as my primary means of transportaion and are essential to my daily life. I have watched the bike lanes on bloor be build up and improved over the last 6 years of my living on the Danforth and have felt the improvement in my quality of life. The city has invested millions of dollars to improve Toronto's transportation network and this bill would have it torn up, spending even more tax payer dollars to undo the progress we've made. We need to think about guaranteeing safety for vulnerable road users instead of just maximizing the number of cars you can fit on a road. Removing bike lanes to add more space for cars will not reduce congestion as seen in this research paper by Rand Europe which I have attatched below.\nIf you build bike lanes, more people will bike. If you build car lanes, more people will drive and congestion will remain the same. Toronto is a big city and is growing bigger. Cars are simply not an effective or efficient way to move around such large numbers of people in an city of this size. We need to invest more money in public transportation and bicycle lanes, not rip them up. The municipal government knows this and the provincial government needs to stop abusing it's power to inhibit progress.\n"

Using our roads, be it drivers, public transit users, cyclists or pedestrians.  Unfortunately priority has generally been given to drivers, the least efficient and most dangerous of all road users.  Bicycle lanes provide an important safety measure allowing more people to use the roads in an efficient manner.  I have bicycled in Toronto since I was a teenager and have appreciated the modern improvements to bike safety.

Bicycles also use less space than cars, creating less traffic.  I am very concerned that the government is ignoring these benefits, while scapegoating cyclists as the cause of traffic.  The true cause of increased traffic is increased cars, and a responsible government would do everything to create options to encourage people to use alternatives to cars.\nI am concerned by bill 212 as a former Toronto resident, first of all, because it is clearly provincial over reach on what couldn't be a more municipal issue.  I'm also concerned because removing bike lanes will decrease safety and cause more cyclist injuries and deaths.\nI am also concerned for my new city.  The recent city of Stratford master transportation plan calls for new bike lanes, including across our waterfront.  We have very little traffic in Stratford and could easily a very bike friendly city.  Unfortunately we are also in a rural area where not all drivers are used to cyclists.  As a very tourist friendly city, with poor public transit, it would be a huge benefit for us to have more alternatives to cars, as proposed in the new transportation plan.  Unfortunately bill 212 would make it very difficult for the city to implement this plan, as it would require the removal of existing traffic lanes.  This decision should be left in the hands of our local government without the unnecessary obstruction of the provincial government.\nTo recap my concerns:\n- This bill is provincial government over reach.\n- This bill ignores the rights of cyclists to safety (possible charter violation).\n- This bill ignores the economic value of having complete streets where pedestrians and cyclists can easily support local businesses.\n- This bill is specifically designed to scapegoat cyclists, while doing nothing to address the true cause of traffic (too many cars).\nPlease do not move forward with bill 212.\nStratford, ON\nRiding: Perth-Wellington\n"

        "comment": "As a suburban resident of Ottawa, and as someone who's lived both urban and rurally in Ottawa, and other cities in Canada and internationally; I have an in-depth understanding of what it means to navigate throughout the city (and the frustrations of lengthy and/or inefficient commutes). I have used and had to rely on many forms of transportation to make my way around the city; including, by car, car-share, bus, LRT, bike, and on foot \u2013 or some sort of combination of them.\nI think often about making transportation better, not only for myself, but for everyone in the city. This requires that we prioritize safety, accessibility, efficiency/timeliness of travel, and the environment. There is also a need to recognize the limitations \u2013 primarily being that an infinite number of roads and/or addition of lanes on any highway, simply does not exist.\nI have read about this subject quite a lot, and have talked about it with friends/family/community/etc. The thing that comes up the most is an emphasis on multi-modal transportation, and maximizing the use of each of these modes. This means investing in walking and biking infrastructure (i.e. bike lanes, shared use paths, bike parking, etc), that allows people traveling in this way to get where they need to go safely and efficiently. It also means leveraging/investing in public transit, like buses/subways/light rail/para-transpo/etc., to move large numbers of people across the city. Driving by car should become something used for absolutely necessary trips only (i.e. deliveries to businesses), or used in the absence of other options (i.e. rural-to-rural).\nIt really saddens me to see the province talk about the removal and disinvestment of bike lanes and other forms of active transportation. Not only will this not address concerns of timeliness and safety of commutes, but it will worsen them. Because, there will be the people who will still bike with or without any sort of bike lanes, either because they can't afford alternatives or they simply enjoy to bike \u2013 either way, they will experience higher risk to their safety as a result of a change of this nature. And the people who currently bike, but decide to change their mode of transportation (likely to driving), means there's increased volume and pressure on an already inefficient system. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not reduce bike lanes, or destroy existing ones \u2013 it will be costly to the province, cost people their safety, and provide no relief to car drivers.\nI would also really like to see greater investment and respect be paid to the importance of public transportation. I think it is easy (or convenient) to view it as simply an \"option\" for people to commute to work this way \u2013 but public transit is so much more than this. It is an essential mode of transportation, that provides anyone access to the city for various kinds of trips. For example, anyone who's unable to drive themselves (i.e. youth, elderly, disabled, etc) can independently get around this way. Or for folks who are technically able to drive, but do not have access to a car (i.e. for financial reasons, or maybe they don't have access to parking etc.), they rely on public transit for all trips. And anyone who's had to take public transit in Ontario is familiar with the frustrations and the struggle of it lacking prioritization and funding from the province. Please invest in public transportation. Please view it as a serious and viable solution for cities across the province. Please do not limit the access of citizens to their city!\nI am very confused and exhausted that solutions for road congestion and traffic (etc.) is always more roads/road-widening. I have found that it never goes further than this. Why not have more paid parking (see book \"High Cost of Free Parking\") to disincentivize driving, or get people to consider carpooling? Why not build nicer and more convenient carpooling/park and ride infrastructure to increase the efficiency of one car driving on the road (have multiple people in the car vs just one). Why not encourage people and businesses to allow people to work from home, and decrease reliance on long commutes into the city for work \u2013 while increasing their investment and participation in their community. If you're going to make us prove to the province why active transportation or public transit are worthy and worthwhile modes again and again, why is it that driving is just accepted as is?\nI need a result from this that is not an approach of just \"build more roads\". Where, once implemented, the province can show that they've tried, but in reality, we just keep doing the same thing repeatedly...hoping for a different result. Where is the gusto for experimentation? I often wonder, what is the end goal of more and more and more roads \u2013 where does it end, and where are people left? Are we just going to start building multi-level roads \u2013 is Google maps going to say \"the fastest route is  the 5th floor of the 401\"? This is a bit extreme, but maybe it's not.\n(tone: sincere)\nLastly, a note for the dearest Ontario public servant(s) reviewing these consultation comments: thank you for your work and dedication to this review. I hope the voices of Ontarians will be heard, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide input.\n"
