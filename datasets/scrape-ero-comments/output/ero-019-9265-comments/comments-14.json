        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a downtown Toronto resident, driver, motorcyclist, and bicyclist I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed bill (ERO 019-9265) that aims to diminish the cities control over bike lanes in Toronto.\nMultiple recent studies have shown that bike lanes are not only beneficial for the health and safety of cyclists but also:\n1) Reduced Traffic Congestion\n2) Improved Road Safety\n3) Enhanced Public Health\n4) Economic Benefits for small and local businesses\n5) Decrease the environmental impact\nSources can be found through this CBC Science article: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nAs a city we should focus on reducing our car resilience, and provide safe alternative means of transport like bicycling or improved public transit routes.\nIt is clear that making it easier to remove bike lanes would not only hinder progress towards a safe and sustainable transportation system but could also exacerbate traffic congestion and safety issues on our roads.\nI urge you to reconsider the implications of this bill and to prioritize the health, safety, and well-being of all Toronto residents by maintaining and looking to expand our bicycle infrastructure.\nSincerely,\nA concerned citizen\n"

If someone owns a home they should be able to say yes or no to keep it even if the government wants to buy it to build. And if the government wants the home owners property they should be offering atleast triple what the house is worth. Taking people's homes is not okay. And doing it in a sneaky way is not right. Leave existing homes alone if they are owned and occupied. This government likes to take too much from its tax payers and not support it's residences. We should be allowed to keep our homes.

        "comment": "I have been excited for years to see the growing network of bike lanes, and even happier as they were made safer by physical barriers. Ten years ago I visited Berlin where everyone rides bikes. They have bike lanes on a marked path on the sidewalk, much like the Martin Goodman trail by the waterfront. Ever since that trip, those sorts of safe bike lanes have been my vision for Toronto. I want so much to see that kind of infrastructure in my city. And Toronto has been moving in that direction, slowly but steadily. Even Scarborough has seen some protected bike lanes, although there are not enough.\nPlease stop Bill 212. We need bike lanes, and more of them, to have cleaner and safer cities. The way to reduce traffic downtown is to invest in our public transit, which I use on a weekly basis to get downtown.   Preventing Ontario cities from building them, and even worse tearing down what already exists, is absolutely the wrong direction.\n"

This would immediately alleviate congestion.\nExempting Hwy 413 from a full environmental assessment and keeping certain information secret from the public is anti-democratic and an abuse of power.\n"

        "comment": "Similarly to probably the hundreds of comments received already, this immediately seems like such a waste of already in-progress and recent developments of bike lanes in and around the city of Toronto. Like that of the \"Ontario Line\" being built for transit expansion, there seems to be a trend of approving, removing, and revisiting projects that were originally in place. Again, only wasting all of the time and effort spent originally to just do something that was meant to be there in the first place.\nWhen it comes to relieving the congestion of traffic in the city, the removal of bike lanes would have a much smaller impact than to say, improving the quality and reach of public transit. As a resident of Scarborough, I eagerly await the completion of the Line 2 expansion, as I can already anticipate how much an improvement it will make for traversing larger sections of the city (like having to commute downtown to and from work everyday as I do now). Perhaps a better question to ask yourselves before making decisions on these bike lanes would be to determine who exactly is constantly driving into the city and causing this congestion in the first place.\nWith a currently extremely limited transit system, it's obvious that those living in the surrounding areas of the Toronto core would opt to drive in and out of the city, but the removal of these lanes really does little good. More open lanes more often than not invite more traffic, which doesn't relieve anyone of anything. Your 30 min drive is still a 30 min drive, except a large population of the city that rely on bicycles as their means of transportation are more susceptible to risk of fatal injury.\n"

        "comment": "As a physician who works in the emergency room, this idea is unconscionable. We will have many more injuries and deaths as a result. Additionally, myself and many other physicians, nurses, and patients use this bike lane to commute to the hospitals. We need a way to get to work and cycling is often well is safest and works best. This is not wished for by the residents downtown. If traffic is an issue, there is much that can be done in terms of adding subway and Transit.\nAs someone who owns a home close to Bloor and pay his taxes, this was not done with the consultation of myself and other homeowners. In any case, it goes against all data and evidence about city planning and will cause much death and injury, in addition to legally worsening traffic. The province has many other issues to work on in healthcare and the money should be going there.\n"

Various studies, conducted in various locations around the globe have shown that providing dedicated cycling lanes that efficiently (read - directly and not winding through secondary streets) effectively  lower congestion, not raise it.  Furthermore, City of Toronto emergency services have repeatedly stated that the installed cycling lanes have not had a negative impact on response times.  In fact, contrary to the message being broadscast to the public, they have improved in some locations.\nPlease, for the sake of creating a livable province for now and for our children, stop this counterproductive piece of legislation.\n"

Your refusal to respect the work done by many engaged, volunteer organizations who spend millions of donor dollars to protect the environment and wildlife, is short\nsighted. Your administration is waging a war on wildlife. Removing more habitat is just the most recent.\nThousands of Ontarians have already expressed their opposition to the spa at Ontario Place, moving the Science Centre out of its beautifully treed location, removing environmental protections for cities to build without respecting the environment, proposing building in the green space and the OMNR's war on wildlife Rehabilitators, penning wildlife and wildlife in this case, by indiscriminately removing habitat.\nYou might want to consider changing the transportation system to mirror other countries who successfully build public transportation, rapid trains on existing tracks, buses between cities at short intervals so they're usable daily for the work force, expanding existing highways ie #6 between KW and Guelph. Open up the 407 to trucking companies at a cheap rate and take the pressure off the 401. There are so many options that your government could take.\nYou lost my vote a very long time ago, but you are losing more as you proceed in opposition to what Ontarians stand for.

Traffic congestion in Toronto is terrible due to our transit failing to keep up with demand, construction and a multitude of other factors. Bike lanes seem to have no impact at all on traffic. I ride my bike everyday in Toronto and the bike lanes are always full, allowing people to get to their jobs, appointments and other commitments in a healthy, environmentally friendly way. Why is the province hellbent on undoing progress at the expense of people who rely on bike lanes? If you want to improve congestion in Toronto, redirect your energy and focus onto improving transit, finishing the Eglinton LRT and trying to find compelling reasons for people to not drive cars in the city. Like, I don't know, riding a bicycle in a protected bike lane!!! That actually removes a car from the road and legitimately impacts traffic congestion.\nI can't wait until Doug Ford is out of office.\n"

Transport trucks will thereby remove themselves from Highway 401, making that highway significantly less congested for cars.\nSteaming ahead with Highway 413 is a bad move for Ontario. It will result in not only further enriching Doug Ford's developer friends, but it will result in rampant urban sprawl, erasure of valuable farmlands, and, worst of all, erase habitat for thousands of species of wildlife. Endangered species such as the Red-sided Dace, will become even more imperilled.\nPlease stop this ill-considered rush to develop. It puts all of Southern Ontario's valuable farmland at risk. Mr. Ford, if you pave all the farmland, where will our food come from? Prime agricultural land in Ontario is a finite resource. Do not squander it. If you go ahead with this plan, you will be on the wrong side of history.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes offer numerous benefits, including promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing healthcare costs by encouraging physical activity. They boost local economies as cyclists shop more frequently at local businesses. Bike lanes reduce traffic congestion, lower infrastructure expenses, and minimize carbon emissions, supporting environmental sustainability. Improved air quality and reduced noise pollution make cities more livable. Dedicated lanes enhance road safety for cyclists and pedestrians and increase accessibility for people of all income levels. Case studies, such as those from Copenhagen and New York City, show tangible safety and economic benefits. Public support for cycling infrastructure is high, even among non-cyclists. Maintaining bike lanes is an investment in sustainable, equitable, and economically vibrant urban areas. Governments should prioritize bike lanes to ensure healthier and safer communities.\n"

These bike lanes save lives, improve business, and facilitate better traffic flow. We can feel the positive change in our communities along Bloor.\nPrior to the bike lanes being introduced, that right hand lane was almost always filled with parked cars. Removing the bike lanes on Bloor will not reduce gridlock. Bloor will just go back to looking like Dupont does now.\nThis is a bad plan that wastes millions of tax dollars. Our communities have worked together for nearly a decade to implement these lanes. Thousands of people use these lanes every single day. It makes no sense that we are going backwards on this.\nAlso, who is paying for the removal? How can the province possibly justify the construction expenses for removal? The University lanes were just put in! We often hear the Conservative Government advocating for saving money. Removing these lanes IS NOT SAVING MONEY! You are losing votes over this.\n"

These bike lanes are the spine to Toronto\u2019s cycling network, and more and more people are using them to move around. They provide a more efficient, environmentally friendly way to get around the city, REDUCING the number of cars on the road. The Ontario government\u2019s decision to rip up these lanes puts so many Ontarian\u2019s lives at risk who rely on these bike lanes to get around, all for the possibility of a couple minutes shorter commute for folks who drive. It\u2019s clear the Ford government values votes over lives, judging by how they\u2019ve admitted they\u2019re making this decision based on internal data that it\u2019s popular. How about using the money wasted to destroy critical infrastructure on fixing our broken healthcare system? Or Toronto\u2019s outdated public transit (something that would markedly help commute times throughout the city). This is a short-sighted decision that will take Toronto back DECADES, while other cities around the world embrace alternatives to driving in dense cities.\n"
