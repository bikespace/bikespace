        "comment": "It's hard to believe that anyone, let alone responsible government officials in Ontario, would consider introducing, let along implementing, such a policy when all evidence from multiple jurisdictions around the world points in the totally opposite direction.\nNamely, bike lanes increase safety for everyone: pedestrians, cyclists, and even motorists. This has been demonstrated over and over again. Yet this piece of legislation proposes to REMOVE bike lanes, or make them harder to implement. This can only lead to a decrease in safety for everyone. In other words, more injuries and more deaths because of more collisions. Is that really what this government wants?\nFurthermore, bike lanes contribute to a reduction in traffic congestion. Before I leave my house, whether to go to work, to a medical appointment, to go shopping, or to visit a friend, I consider what is the best way to get there and back. I drive, but increasingly I use my bicycle because it's convenient, good for my health, cheaper, often faster, good for the climate, and ... it reduces the total number of cars on the road, thereby reducing congestion. It is incomprehensible that anyone would want to force me to replace all of my current bike trips with car trips.\nFinally, this proposal is not based on credible data or evidence. It is based only on the complaints of a minority of people (contributors to election campaigns) who have the ear of the Premier. It is impossible to believe that any serious person or other professional in the Ministry of Transportation would ever come up with such a proposal as an effective, sustainable way to reduce traffic congestion. They must be hanging their heads in shame at having to defend this whole piece of legislation.\nI urge you to retract this proposal and replace it with data-driven, evidence-based policy that ensures safety for ALL road users and actually accomplishes something to reduce motor vehicle congestion on the streets and roads of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to oppose the removal of bike lanes from major city roads as proposed in Ontario Bill 212. The removal of bike lanes would be a step backward in creating safer, greener, and more efficient cities. Bike lanes benefit all road users, contributing to reduced traffic congestion, improved road safety, and a lower environmental footprint.\n**1. Traffic Reduction**\nStudies show that bike lanes help alleviate traffic congestion by providing a safe and efficient alternative mode of transportation. For example, cities like New York and Portland have observed reductions in car traffic with the introduction of bike lanes. According to a study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), bike lanes can carry up to five times more people per meter of road width than car lanes during peak hours. Increasing the cycling infrastructure, therefore, reduces vehicle congestion by making it feasible for more people to switch from cars to bikes.\n**2. Safety Benefits**\nBike lanes are critical for improving safety on roads, not just for cyclists but also for drivers and pedestrians. A study published by the American Journal of Public Health showed that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions and injuries. Additionally, bike lanes create predictable paths for cyclists, which improves flow and minimizes conflicts with vehicles. And when cyclists feel like they have a safe route to travel on a bike, they are more likely to use a bike vs. drive, thus reducing traffic congestion.\n**3. Environmental Impact**\nEncouraging cycling through dedicated bike lanes directly benefits the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A study by the European Cyclists' Federation estimates that cycling saves approximately 16 million tons of CO\u2082 emissions each year in Europe alone. Expanding cycling infrastructure is an important step in Ontario\u2019s goal of reducing urban carbon emissions and improving air quality.\nFor these reasons, I urge you to reject any measure that would remove bike lanes from our cities or impede the addition of new bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes in Toronto will be absolutely detrimental for traffic, cyclist safety, and public health overall. We have data to show that bike lanes reduce traffic by reducing the number of cars on the road. Reducing bike lanes will force more people to choose to drive and thus increase traffic. Reducing bike lanes will also make it much more dangerous for cyclists. The inevitable consequence of both of these things is a public health crisis due to decreased physical activity from more individuals being forced to drive, and increased number of cyclist injuries.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, which includes provisions for expanding highways and creating additional lanes in Ontario. While I understand the intention behind these measures is to alleviate congestion, I believe that such approaches are fundamentally flawed and will not provide the long-term solutions we need.\n1. Ineffectiveness of Highway Expansion:\nHistory has shown that simply adding more highways and lanes does not effectively reduce traffic congestion in the medium to long term. Instead, it often leads to induced demand, where the increased capacity encourages more vehicles on the road, ultimately resulting in the same or even worse congestion levels. To truly address the issues of vehicle congestion, Ontario must prioritize investment in public transportation systems that offer reliable, efficient, and accessible alternatives to driving.\n2. Importance of Cycling Infrastructure:\nThe inclusion of cycle lanes in urban areas like Toronto is crucial for enhancing public safety and promoting healthier lifestyles. Expanding cycling infrastructure not only protects cyclists but also encourages more residents to choose biking as a viable mode of transportation. This shift can lead to reduced vehicle traffic, lower emissions, and improved public health outcomes related to fitness. Instead, the City should prohibit street parking on major streets to free above lanes. Further, there should be congestion charges to enter Toronto which would again reduce congestion and generate revenue for the city/Province to build better public infrastructure. The City of London (UK) is a great example of this. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution.\n3. Concerns Over Property Rights:\nThe amendments proposed under the Building Broadband Faster Act raise significant concerns regarding property rights. The ability to expropriate land for broadband projects without adequate safeguards undermines the rights of property owners and could lead to unjust outcomes. It is essential that any infrastructure development respects and protects the rights of individuals and communities.\n4. Environmental Protections:\nI am particularly troubled by the proposed exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act included in the Highways Act. Protecting our natural environment and biodiversity must be a priority in any infrastructure development. We cannot afford to prioritize concrete over the preservation of our ecosystems. Comprehensive environmental assessments are vital to ensure that we understand the potential impacts of our actions on the environment and take necessary steps to mitigate them.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the direction of this bill. Instead of focusing on expanding highways, we should invest in sustainable public transportation solutions and prioritize the safety and health of our communities. This is where every major city in the world is heading. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution. Additionally, we must uphold property rights and environmental protections to ensure a balanced approach to infrastructure development in Ontario.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\n"

We do not need a faster system for getting highways built in this province, we need an environmentally accountable system to ensure highways are built in the correct locations to serve the greater good. We do not need a bill to ban or limit bike lanes. WE need a Premier and cabinet that understands their roles. You are not experts in urban transportation and traffic flow. You are not specialists in public health or climate change. At this point in time you are only proving to have expertise in destroying publicly accountable systems to serve your own wants and needs. Stay in your lane and leave these things in the hands of the experts, those who act in the greater good for society. Clearly, as you have proven, acting in the greater good, is not a mission of the Ford Govt. Not unless the greater good meant more money in your pockets and for your developer friends. C-O-R-R-U-P-T.

        "comment": "The provincial government should try to move us faster by giving us more transportation options. Our only options are the traffic filled highways we currently have or the slow GO transit and public transit system that is the laughing stock of the entire developed world. These acts are designed to move cars faster, but the provincial government forgets about developing other modes of transportation. While other nations have high speed rail, we have the slow GO train. If the provincial government wants to add more highways, then they should be also willing to improve the GO transit to be competitive against cars. We are struggling to live in this province with the housing costs alone, but the exorbitant need for a car will only make affordability in the province even worse. Buying and maintaining a car is very expensive, so please think of those who cannot afford a car but still need to travel long distances for employment. Please stop supporting infrastructure for expensive cars and support infrastructure for affordable means of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I have read the proposed Bill 212 and I strongly disagree with multiple aspects of it. I believe that the Premier of Ontario should not be able to jump through hoops and undo environmental protections that have been developed over many years just so that we can build a highway.\nFirst off the environmental protections and surveying have been designed to find out if land that is to be developed is a significant habitat that needs to be protected or not. These laws have already been stripped of most of their significance due to Doug Ford in favor of developing what were once significant wetlands for species at risk. Protecting This Endangered fish is important to me because we have already extirpated a long list of species in Ontario and I would love for the next generation to know that we did something to save one.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bicycle lanes is a terrible idea and will contribute to greater cyclist death, air pollution, and CONTRIBUTE TO GRIDLOCK as more people would have to use cars because they do not feel confident cycling on multi-use paths.\nCycling is the fastest way to move around the City of Toronto, and if there were more bike lanes and more speed controlled streets, a higher percentage of people would bike regularly. There is a false statistic being used that about only 1% of Torontonians bike, this is from a study in the 90s. Currently (as of 2019), 71% of people regularly use a bicycle. The majority of people use a bike and also have a car; why would anyone want these bike lanes to be removed? It doesn't make sense. Which leads to the next point:\nOf even greater concern is that the Ford Government is using this cycle lane controversy to make sure that no one reads the other parts of the bill, which removes environmental restrictions on highway construction and also will remove landowner rights for delaying the date of expropriation of their property. No one wants another highway. We don't want Highway 413. It won't make anyone's commute faster. But you know what would? Better transit options. However, the Ford Government isn't interested in doing anything that would actually help people.\nAllowing for the expedited highway construction will ruin environmental areas, ones that could be protected with mitigation strategies, even if a highway was eventually put through there. If this bill goes through, it will allow Ford to shirk his environmental duties and push through a terrible project that he's set on doing for some reason.\nBad government, bad. Stop interfering in Toronto municipal politics, you aren't the mayor of Toronto. If you are so dead set on building highways, why not find ones that actually need to be built to provide easier connections for remote northern communities. Just do something useful for once and leave the city alone.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 isn't just about removing bike lanes\u2014it\u2019s also about adding more cars to the road and with that, more pollution. Taking out bike lanes in Toronto\u2019s busiest areas would mean more people using cars for short trips that could easily be done by bike. This adds up to more traffic, more emissions, and worse air quality for everyone.\nToronto already has issues with air pollution, and bike lanes have been one step in the right direction to reduce that. Fewer bike lanes means that people who want to bike might feel unsafe and end up driving instead. All those extra cars on the road mean more greenhouse gases and more traffic jams, which doesn\u2019t just waste time but also pumps out even more pollution as cars sit idle.\nFor a city like Toronto, which is aiming to be more sustainable, removing bike lanes seems to contradict what we need right now. It\u2019s frustrating because keeping these lanes would help cut emissions and create a more breathable, walkable city for everyone, not just those who drive. Bill 212 feels like it\u2019s missing the bigger picture when it comes to making our cities healthier and more livable.\n"

The possibilities under this bill that would allow government workers to barge into people\u2019s residences and properties, with police if necessary, and to give owners of properties only 3 months to relocate under penalties of ridiculous amounts of money, is extremely disturbing.\nWhy does this government think it needs to be so aggressive and hostile to its residents?  This sounds like a military operation rather than building a road.    We may need more roads but goodness, we can give people a decent amount of time to move out in peace.  The 413 has been in planning for years and years so is the implementation of it being done in such a slip shod manner that no plans are in place for expropriation at least a year in advance?\nAlso, why would an environmental study not be published?  Why would a Minister have the power to determine what the public could and could not read?  What is the purpose of an environmental assessment if it is not to be followed?\nI really hate having to write letters to my government to remind them that they were elected to work for us, not to bully and blindside us.\nPlease have someone with a heart revisit this bill and make it into something with some compassion for those who live here.\n"
