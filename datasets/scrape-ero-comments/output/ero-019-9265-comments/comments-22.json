        "comment": "I have never commented officially on a bill ever proposed by the Government of Ontario but the provisions in Bill 212 around bicycle infrastructure requiring provincial approval is absolutely absurd and anti-Ontarian.  It is the responsibility of the Government of Ontario to ensure a safe, reliable, and reasonably accessible means to get around the entire province but through the removal of existing bike lanes and requiring approval for new ones Ontario will now have to deal with the following:\n1. Government would need a new approval body or add to an existing one to actually review proposed changes - costing taxpayer time and money\n2. Government will need to shut down the roads AGAIN to remove the infrastructure to replace it back to being only for cars - costing taxpayer time and money\n3. Government will need to secure funds to provide healthcare for the inevitable injuries that will be suffered by having cyclists share the same lanes as fast moving cars - costing the time of already overworked and highly paid medical professionals\nAs a final comment - there is no such thing as a cyclist, as it is simply an Ontarian who happens to be riding a bike at that time.  The same Ontarian that also drives, walks, buses, takes the streetcar, flies, etc.  Ripping out or preventing a safe mode of travel accessible to all Canadians is a huge step back.\n"

Or, the money could be used instead to improve public transportation. Not everyone wants to drive a car and would be glad to use up-to-date, fast efficient public transportation.\n"

If I stop riding my bicycle, I will have to drive my car, hence contributing to gridlock. The more people getting out of their cars and using other forms of transportation the less gridlock there will be.\n2) I am opposed to removing the requirement for environmental assessments for highways. I am very concerned that lowering the environmental bar is very likely to cause harm (e.g., polluting streams and rivers, destroying habitat of endangered species, taking agricultural land out of production, removing trees and other vegetation which absorb CO2). In this time when we see the ravages resulting from climate change, we must protect our natural systems intact and even enhance them. They are our best bulwark against climate change.\n"

By removing local input on planning, this bill allows developers to bypass critical infrastructure concerns, including safe biking routes.\nI bike regularly to get around the city, and the removal of bike lanes directly puts my safety at risk. With more unchecked developments and increased traffic, cycling will become more dangerous, endangering not only my life but the lives of other cyclists in Toronto.\nBill 212 sacrifices public safety, transparency, and smart planning for the sake of rapid development.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern regarding Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, particularly its framework that could lead to the removal of crucial bike lanes on municipal roads. I rely on bike lanes on major streets like Bloor and University to commute to work. The prospect of losing these bike lanes is deeply concerning for me and many others who depend on them for safe and efficient transportation.\nBike lanes play a critical role in this effort by providing safe and equitable transportation options for all residents, including those who cannot afford cars or prefer cycling for health and environmental reasons. Removing these lanes, especially on essential routes, would limit mobility options and undermine the progress we\u2019ve made toward creating a more sustainable and bike-friendly city.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure that supports active transportation as well as contributes to reducing congestion and emissions. By prioritizing cycling, we can improve public health, enhance air quality, and create vibrant streets that encourage community interaction. Bill 212\u2019s focus on preserving car lanes at the expense of bike lanes overlooks these significant benefits and threatens to reverse the strides we\u2019ve made in promoting cycling as a viable transportation option.\nFurthermore, the top-down approach requiring provincial approval for local transportation decisions undermines municipalities' ability to address the unique needs of their communities. Local governments are best positioned to assess and adapt their infrastructure to meet the demands of residents, ensuring a balance between various transportation modes.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 that could lead to the removal of bike lanes. Protecting our bike lanes is essential not only for my daily commute but also for the health, sustainability, and inclusivity of our city as a whole.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I appreciate your commitment to our community and hope to see policies that support the preservation of safe and accessible bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in the GTA my whole life.  Since the year 2000 I have seen that traffic was becoming a growing issue and that we are the fastest growing major region in North America.  As a result I have studied traffic solutions from around the world.  Premier Ford's plan to rip out bike lanes is misguided.\nCreating alternatives for residents to move around the region using modes other than cars is especially important in the central city.  We are currently experiencing grid lock during rush our and even on weekends.  Ontario is investing in public transportation more than any other region with exceptional projects such as GO expansion and Ontario Line.  Creating a network for bikers is an important piece of providing transit riders with last mile transportation options that don't rely on cars within the central city.  Bike tracks on main corridors such as Bloor, Yonge, Eglinton (once complete) and University are the backbone of the bike network, which compliments existing high order transit such as Line 2 and Line 1 of the TTC's subway network.\nI can understand the traffic concerns of those in the inner suburbs, when a lane of bike lanes is under used and their traffic times have increased, such as those in Etobicoke along Bloor west.  However, from High Park through to Greektown (if not further east), this bike track has growing ridership and more importantly takes cars off the road.\nThe removal of bike tracks does not plan for a future that involves more people in the region than there already are.  Any city the size of ours has substantially more public transit and in many cases a complete and separate from traffic bike network.  The numbers in Toronto of cyclists are growing, especially along the corridor's that have bike tracks.  Many of the neighbourhoods around Bloor have 10% of residents biking as their primary commuting mode.  This number is increasing.\nHow are you going to improve gridlock if you do not provide alternatives.  A real alternative is a complete network of separated bike lanes, of which Yonge and Bloor form a back bone.  Furthermore, this keeps bikers safe without forcing them into sharing the road with traffic.\nPlease don't spend millions to make the city worse, from a Toronto resident who drives to work every day.\n"

Bike lanes are an essential piece of transportation infrastructure for me, and help me get around cheaply and effectively in relation to driving or walking. It also supports vulnerable road users and simpler for car drivers since bikes have their own lane. Additionally, ripping out brand new bike lanes such as those on Toronto's University Avenue is simply astounding. These lanes are among the best in this city, let alone country, being fully separated from car traffic, comfortable for bikers to pass each other, and not to mention the cost to build such unique bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is misguided and will not have the outcome that the premier is hoping for. The only way to reduce traffic congestion is to give people alternative options to get around. That means adding more bike lanes, not taking away the few that we have. The expansion in bike lanes in the city since 2016 has directly correlated with a sharp increase in bicycle use. This bill will undo all of that progress and limit further progress, pushing people back towards car travel. It will also greatly increase the risk of cycling within the city, and will result in more accidents and preventable deaths due to traffic collisions between cars and cyclists. This bill fails to understand even the most basic tenets of transportation planning, which is that adding lanes to roads just causes more congestion due to induced demand. I strongly reject this bill and hope that the premier will reconsider. Only investments in transit and active transportation will make our roads less congested.\n"

        "comment": "We are a family of 5 living in the City of Toronto. We own 5 bikes and 1 car. The Bloor and University bike lanes are a critical piece of infrastructure for us to move around the city safely. Already 6 bicyclists were killed on the roads in 2024 thus far. Bike lanes significantly improve our safety. Moreover, by riding our bikes we are lessening the load on the roads, lessening the danger that cars pose to pedestrians, lessening the climate change impact of transportation and, by staying physically active, lessening the burden on our publicly funded health care system. Building bike lanes costs a fraction of other modes of transportation such as roads, railways, subways and so forth. In my experience as a driver and the CEO of a company that owns a fleet of 20 delivery vans, bike lanes usually have a negligible impact on journey time in the short run and are beneficial in the long run. Quite simply -- to move more people, more quickly in Toronto, we need to move them out of vehicles and onto bike lanes, sidewalks, subways, streetcars, buses and trains. To achieve higher rates of bicycle usage, we need a sustained commitment to (a) expanding the network and (b) ensuring proper maintenance and enforcement. With those two elements in place, bike usage will continue to rise, yes, even in the winter as we see in places ranging from Montreal to Copenhagen.\n"

Fords government is out of touch with the people of downtown Toronto who actively support these fantastic bike lane projects. Bike share ridership is at an all time high in the city of Toronto and polls for bike commuting in the province are currently flawed (too many exemptions when deciding what counts as a commute). Studies have also found that despite what the Ford government says, bike lanes actually have a positive economic effect on businesses along Toronto bike routes. The Ford government should not be hindering municipalities from developing in ways that benefit their citizens by using bureaucracy and red tape to reverse transit projects.\n"

Why is the province even involved in city level decisions? Ripping out existing cycle infrastructure and adding a bunch of red tape is extremely stupid. Why does Ontario insist on assuming that it is somehow different from the rest of the world when it comes to the most basic matters? Do bikes somehow take up more space here? Or is it perhaps because there are far more cars, and they're far larger?\nIt would be an epic act of stupidity to rip out what are the backbone of a fledgling network of cycling lane just as it gets off the ground.

This bill, which proposes to use constitutional laws to override municipal law, addresses an issue that is fundamentally not a provincial matter. Removing bike lanes will not reduce congestion; in fact, it will likely exacerbate it by forcing more people into cars.\nToronto's historical data clearly illustrates this issue. In 2011, when bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street, the city's own data showed that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the goal of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists and discourages sustainable transportation options, leading to greater car dependence and worsening gridlock.\nThis proposal jeopardizes cyclist safety and sets the province back decades in our progress towards creating liveable and sustainable cities. We need to prioritize safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation options, not eliminate them. Let's work towards a future where all road users can coexist safely and efficiently.\n"
