        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the section of this proposal that relates to bike lanes. I do not support anything that would slow or limit the rollout of a safe and comprehensive transportation network for bikes and PEVs.  The buildout of bike lanes in my region, Kitchener-Waterloo, has allowed me to cut my car usage almost in half. Every day the weather is nice, I can bike or take an EUC to work or on other errands. This gets my car off of the road, and improves my physical and mental health. It also would not have been possible where I live 10 years ago.\nThe buildout of bike lanes in our region has made it a better place to live, but it is not yet sufficient. So long as we have multiple stories a year of people commuting dying on our local roads, uptake of this form of transportation will be limited. For those counting, this means more cars on the road and slower traffic. We need more bike lanes, and more support for slow, unprotected forms of locomotion.\nI strongly suspect any extra roadblocks to better infrastructure will reduce the speed at which the network is built out, which will reduce uptake of personal transportation, making our roads busier; non-drivers less mobile; our residents less happy and healthy; our province worse.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider requiring provincial consent for any new bike lanes.\n"

This Bill is not financially sound - undoing capital works like bike lanes and costing almost 2-3 times MORE than it did to put them in. In the midst of a housing and climate crisis, this work would effectively go against all these larger local, provincial, and global challenges.\nI do not bike, but I have family and friends that do and I am concerned for their safety when they still have to use a bike to get around (commute, get groceries, pick up kids from childcare) in the midst of car traffic.\nOur dollars could be used wisely in other capacities that support the day-to-day lives of all Canadians in a much larger magnitude.\nAs a professional planner, there is also no evidence in the claims made about reducing gridlock through these plans - the statements made are baseless and do not consider the economics and design implications that many researchers, academics, scientists, and engineers have been reporting on for decades.\nPlease reconsider the implications of this bill and the attention other areas of investment that deserve.\n"

Now that they are finally finished, I feel safer riding my daily routes. Six cyclists have died in my area this year, 3 of whom would be alive if there had been bike lanes on their rout.\nI vehemently oppose the removal of these bike lanes by Doug Ford. In yet another of his bullying power-grabs, he is ignoring years of careful planning and discussion by experts and indeed he is ignoring the will of the People of Toronto, who have voted in their city councillors to represent them in making decisions on just such matters as these. Yet again, the height of insecurity, Doug Ford is obsessed with Toronto and how he can micromanage it and sell it off by the pound, as he is doing with his shady deals at Ontario Place and the Science Centre.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, more people will die, at Doug Ford\u2019s hand.\nI will continue to use Bloor Street and University Avenue as my main cycling routes, as is my right, even though with bike lanes removed, it will jeopardize my safety. And I vow that if bike lanes are removed, I will occupy an entire lane of traffic to ensure my safety, regardless of the effect on \u201cgridlock.\u201d\nShame on the province and on Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "The following is the City of Waterloo\u2019s feedback regarding Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\nOver numerous years, the City of Waterloo, at the request of our residents, has invested in the creation of a safe, active transportation networks across the City and Region of Waterloo.  Currently, there are over 230 km of multi-use trails, protected bike lanes and signed bike routes. These connect to a larger regional network of bike lanes and multi-use paths.\nAs you are no doubt aware, numerous studies clearly indicate that drivers are also concerned about potential collisions with people cycling on the road and do not feel that the current infrastructure is safe for walking, cycling and driving.\nAs requested, Waterloo staff have reviewed and analyzed the numerous road reconstruction and rehabilitation projects which reduced vehicular lanes and added safe cycling infrastructure.  Staff compared a total of 21 years of collision data before road re-construction to 21 years of collision data after project construction/completion.\nWe are very pleased that this analysis clearly showed that the reduction of the vehicular lanes and addition of the safe cycling infrastructure resulted in an improvement in road safety.\nSpecifically, the addition of safe cycling infrastructure resulted in a 42% reduction in overall crashes.\nAs I\u2019m sure you will agree, safety for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and people who use mobility devices \u2013 from the youngest to the oldest in our community \u2013 is of paramount importance.\nAffordability is another key reason why the City of Waterloo invests in safe cycling infrastructure. Waterloo\u2019s 230 km of networked, safe cycling infrastructure provides people with affordable mobility choices particularly for short and medium length trips.\nAs you know, vehicular ownership, insurance and operation costs are rising. Numerous residents have shared that the safe cycling infrastructure across Waterloo and our neighbouring municipalities has given people choice for how they move around our community. These options are helping people reduce household expenses and, for some, has enabled them to become a one-vehicle rather than a two-vehicle household.\nDespite the introduction of Bill 212, Waterloo is pleased to work in collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation Working Group comprised of engineering experts to co-design standards to facilitate the timely approval and installation of safe, secure active transportation corridors over Ministry controlled roadways and interchanges. Establishing standardized designs will greatly reduce the length of time for construction while \u2013 most importantly \u2013 significantly improving the safety of drivers and active transportation users.\nWe were also pleased to learn that you have extended the e-scooter pilot program until 2029. The City of Waterloo appreciates this decision and the opportunity to work in collaboration.\nFinally, given the important relationship between the provincial government and Ontario municipalities, we are particularly concerned about the jurisdictional interference embedded within Bill 212.\nAs proposed, Bill 212 will significantly impact the City\u2019s ability to represent our community\u2019s needs. Local councils are best positioned to make decisions on bike lanes and local transportation planning. The City\u2019s Transportation Master Plan and Active Transportation Committee work in tandem to create a safe, more affordable and connected transportation system.\nOur plans are created based on local knowledge and community input. We develop these plans to balance traffic flow with planning priorities like active transportation, multimodal transportation and environmental and health protection.\nBill 212 however proposes serious overreach into municipal jurisdiction. I hope that you will work with your municipal partners to reconsider these aspects of Bill 212 in order to find a better way forward.\nThe City of Waterloo\u2019s goal is to provide safe and reliable transportation options for all. I know you and the provincial government shares this goal. I look forward to continuing to work together to ensure our residents have affordable and safe mobility choices.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n"

        "comment": "Building new highways faster does not seem to be an effective solution to gridlock. It may exacerbate the problem. New highways can lead to more cars trying to access these routes, which ultimately results in even worse congestion. Take the 407 toll highway as an example: when it was first built, it was free to use, but after being sold to private investors, tolls were introduced, making it less affordable for drivers and pushing more traffic onto nearby highways like the 401. The 407, intended to reduce congestion, has instead contributed to gridlock. Similarly, building new highways like the proposed Highway 413 will likely not alleviate car congestion in the long run. More highways will simply invite more cars, as cars remain the fastest, most affordable, and reliable mode of transportation for many people.\nTo reduce gridlock, we need to shift away from designing cities around cars. As shown in this video, which illustrates how much space cars take up when everyone drives alone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_oWmY_mkCA), we can move people more efficiently by investing in alternative forms of transportation like buses, trains, and bikes.\nLooking at examples from other countries can help us see how we might do better. For instance, Tokyo, Japan, has a population of over 37 million people, yet the city does not suffer from constant gridlock. This is because their transportation system was designed to prioritize trains and buses. In 2023, Japan's railways transported 21 billion passengers (https://www.statista.com/statistics/627136/japan-number-railway-passeng\u2026), and that number is only growing. If Japan had 37 million cars on the road, the traffic would be unimaginable. Toronto, and Ontario in general, could be headed down a similar path if we don\u2019t make changes now.\nWe can also learn from Japan\u2019s success by improving our public transportation. Currently, trains only transport about 4% of people in Toronto compared to Tokyo (https://www.ttc.ca/transparency-and-accountability/Operating-Statistics\u2026). If we invested more in making trains faster, more affordable, and reliable, we would see a reduction in car usage, as those who rely on cars for speed and convenience would have better options for commuting.\nMoreover, cities like Copenhagen have proven that alternatives like cycling can work without relying on trains. In 2018, 1.44 million km were cycled per weekday in Copenhagen, and Dronning Louise\u2019s Bridge, the most heavily trafficked cycling stretch in Denmark, saw more than 40,000 cyclists daily (https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/activities/copenhagens-bike-\u2026). This shows how far and how many people can be moved by cycling. Instead of making it harder to build bike lanes, we should prioritize creating more pathways for cyclists. Building bike highways and innovative bridges for cyclists can also improve health, reduce noise, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaking it easier to build more highways is not the solution to reducing gridlock. The real solution lies in reducing the number of cars on the road by offering more transportation options, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. If we design our cities with these alternatives in mind, we can follow the example of successful cities worldwide that have found ways to transport people quickly and safely without relying on cars.\n"

This includes bike lanes, bike share and rapid public transit on bus, streetcar and metro. The automobile is too expensive to maintain as a primary mode of transport in an affordability crisis.\nBill 212 is misguided and outdated thinking. Any possible gains will merely be temporary due to phenomenon like \"induced demand\" and even temporary gains will offset by the disturbance of construction.\nDoug Ford is applying rural thinking to a city he doesn't understand and thus he should have no say over. He should consider stepping down due to his blatant corruption and failure to listen to his people failing that he should at least make a sincere attempt at solving our most pressing issues and prepare the world for the future instead of keeping us in the post-war past.\n"

This is a gross overstep of power and will not solve any interim issues of traffic, and will actually cause more traffic. The move by Doug Ford to remove bike lanes is part of a political campaign to try win suburban support in his next election cycle. The infrastructure that has been put in place is saving the lives of many Ontarian's that chose active transportation in urban centres. Doug Ford is willing to put people\u2019s lives at risk to win a few more votes, rather than presenting real ideas that will solve any of the many issues he and his government could be solving. Further this short sighted move is a huge waste of money as inevitably the infrastructure will be rebuilt as this kind of work that is happening around the world as many leaders see the benefits of active transportation and how it helps solve congestion. The small minded and short sighted move will cost the tax payers of this province the money that was already spent to put in that infrastructure, the more money it will cost to take out the infrastructure and the money that it will cost to put in the infrastructure in again when we have leaders in power that are actually serious about solving issues, not playing culture war politics because after nearly two terms in power they have no real issues that they have championed.\n"

I've been a cyclist the whole time, using bike lanes to get to work, do groceries, see friends and family, attend events, and generally get around. The bike lanes on Bloor, College, Sherbourne, and Shaw streets have enabled me to travel more safely to and from all the places I need to go as a citizen of Toronto. Traversing Spadina and University avenues while travelling east or west can either be a treacherous, chaotic, and scary endeavor (on Dundas with no bike lanes) vs. efficient, safe, and non-intimidating (on College St, with bike lanes). They make a huge difference in the way traffic flows for cyclists and drivers, who are able to better know what to expect and act accordingly where bike lanes exist. Removing them will be a detriment to cyclists and drivers alike, putting peoples lives at risk. There are other solutions to explore in order to improve congestion in the city which would be less harmful and avoid endangering the lives of cyclists. Improving access to bike lanes, rather than removing them, will get more people on bikes and relieve some of the car traffic. It takes time and going back on all the improvements on bike access we've made so far is a step back in the wrong direction in terms of dealing with congestion and safety.\n"

The addition of separated lanes has provide a safe zone for myself and my family. They have provided peace of mind when my son cycles to school and parks along east-west routes\n2.\tI also drive. Separated bike lanes provide predictability, safety and keep traffic moving by incentivizing another option to get around.\n3.\tBike lanes provide much needed safety outside of rush hour and at night.\n4.\tAs many studies show, removing them will have a minimal impact on reducing congestion. Congestion is impacted by many other factors including construction, drivers stopping or parking in live traffic lane, capacity at intersections and ultimately too many single occupancy cars.\n5.\tWhile some people may choose to stop cycling and drive instead, cyclists will not disappear but will become part of vehicular traffic. By using this as a wedge issue, hostility between drivers and cyclists will increase. Adults, teens and children will be injured and die as a result.\n6.

        "comment": "I am concerned with this bill for two main reasons. The first is the removal of the need for environmental assessments for the proposed Highway 413 development. There was a study by the Federal Highway Administration in the US that details all of the potential impacts of the extensive highway network within the US (Ref 1) This report clearly shows that there is significant wildlife disruption caused by these highways and underpins the complex nature of the interaction between roadways and surrounding wildlife. I therefore think it is imperative that an extensive study be conducted to better understand any potential impacts that could be caused by the new highway to allow for plans to be implemented to mitigate them prior to the highway's construction. To circumvent this process with a piece of legislation is an egregious misuse of power.\nMy second concern is to do with the proposed removal of existing bike infrastructure, alongside the need for the province to grant permission to install new complete streets. Putting to one side that this is an overstep by the provincial government into municipal affairs; it represents a huge step backwards in the development of Toronto's (and any other instances where the removal of bike lanes is being proposed) development. The MPPs keep referring to common sense policy but I am not sure of their definition of common sense. It doesn't feel like it would be common sense to spend, what is estimated to be in the realm of $48 million dollars of public money to contravene expert testimony, including recent comments from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (Ref 2) on measures that will fail to reduce congestion in the city. If the 'common sense' is that there are currently too many vehicles using the roadways of concern to warrant them being a single lane, then with the expanding population of the city, what is going to happen when there are too many vehicles using a roadway for two lanes to be enough? Multi-modal transport solutions represent the best opportunity to combat vehicle dependency. My final comment on this is that complete streets initiatives also act as traffic calming and make streets safer for everyone. This can be seen in the average speed reductions on Bloor Street over the Humber River bridge which were in excess of 70km/h (unacceptable for an inner city residential street) prior to the lanes being installed to around 56km/h after the installation. After 6 cyclist deaths so far this year in the city of Toronto, it feels irresponsible to revert back to our original unsafe road designs and put the cyclists who have completed over 360,000 trips on the Bloor Street bike lanes (based on the counter by High Park) back into harms way.\n"

I do not have a car, and will occasionally use a car-share for groceries, commutes, or other needs. I do not support Bill 212.\nThis proposed legislation directly affects me as a resident, as a cyclist and as a driver. It concerns me that my government, instead of making evidence-based, data-driven decisions about urban design and the environment is instead taking regressive action and wasting taxpayer dollars on removing NEW bike lane infrastructure in downtown Toronto.\nThe Bill does not provide any evidence that bike lanes increase congestion. I understand it's a catchy idea that no doubt plays well with car commuters, but where is the study/research/numbers to back up this assertion? The government has failed to provide any or point to any actual evidence that congestion in Toronto is made worse by bike lane infrastructure.\nThere is however, ample evidence on the positive impact of bike lanes for Cyclist, Driver and Pedestrian safety (SOURCE 1), environmental benefit (SOURCE 2), physical and mental health benefits (SOURCE 3), economic benefit (SOURCE 4) and in fact for reducing congestion (SOURCE 5). There is also plenty of evidence showing that creating cycling infrastructure will will promote more cycling and therefore reduce the number of cars on the road (induced demand, SOURCE 5). Given this abundance of evidence, it is shocking to me that my provincial government isn't doing more to promote cycling in urban environments but is actually impeding public works that would encourage this healthy behaviour.\nIs congestion as in issue? Of course. It creates pollution and stalls movement in the city. However, there are many factors contributing to congestion, including increase in population, and shortfalls in our public transit systems. It seems this bill is designed to make people think the government is taking action on a issue in a visible way (wasting taxpayer dollars on destroying current infrastructure), while avoiding actually working on sustainable solutions to congestion (removing on-street parking in high traffic areas, congestion charges in the downtown core, improving public transit, addressing the housing crisis that is driving people out of the downtown Toronto and creating more commuters in the first place).\nAlso, people WANT to bike!! Use of BikeShare TO has literally skyrocketed and will continue to. Why not invest in a mode of transport that is good for the environment and for our health?\nI think the premier needs to stop trying to by Mayor of Toronto and starting being a leader for the whole province. Where is evidence informed, progressive leadership? It is certainly not reflected in Bill 212, and that is why I am firmly opposed to it passing into law.\n"
