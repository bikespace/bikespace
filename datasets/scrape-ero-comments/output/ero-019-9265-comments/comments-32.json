        "comment": "This bill is a fiscal, environmental, and health disaster for the province. Cars are the least efficient mode of transportation available - for over 90% of their lifetime a personal vehicle does nothing but take up space, space that could be used for more housing or more businesses that the province desperately needs. For the 4-8% of the time a personal vehicle is actually in motion if they are within a city they are barely faster than a bicycle but take up 4x more space on the roads than a bicycle this slowness isn't due to congestion but because of stop signs, traffic lights, and intersections that are necessary inside any densely inhabited area. For example, traveling from the ROM to the Waterfront in Toronto takes 15 minutes by car vs 20 minutes by bicycle, or traveling from Leslieville to Kensington Market takes 20 minutes by car vs 25 minute by bicycle. This inefficiency causes millions of dollars of financial waste by both city authorities and the provincial government, as valuable land is taken up by parking lots that pay next to nothing in terms of property taxes compared to what could be built there, and maintaining road infrastructure costs billions of dollars a year. Note that a personal vehicle not only requires 4x bigger roads than a bicycle it also does 1000x more damage to that road each time it drives over it than a bicycle. Even just the 2% of trips where bicycles replace personal vehicles in Toronto represent millions of dollars in savings to the city and province. SAVE OUR PROVINCE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL!\nCars are also a health disaster for the province, they are already the greatest source of death, disability, or serious injury for working-age people in this province. But beyond the two biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the province are old age and physical inactivity. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, kidney disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer among others. No amount of PR campaigns have managed to make any significant dent in the rising rates of physical inactivity or these various diseases, because joining a gym costs people time and money that they do not have. But as I pointed out above using active transport like cycling or scootering instead of driving costs only a few minutes and it actually saves individual people money so people are much much more likely to do it than go out and get a gym membership and get healthy that way. And this is without even considering the healthcare costs associated with air pollution caused by particulates generated by car tires and car brakes, or from the tail pipe of gas-powered vehicles which similarly cost the province billions of dollars every year. STOP WASTING MY TAX DOLLARS ON PREVENTABLE HEALTHCARE COSTS!\nEnvironmentally 28% of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada are released by transportation, the vast majority of which are from personal vehicles. Personal vehicle emissions also contribute to acid rain, the asthma epidemic, metal particulates from the wear on mechanical components of vehicles contribute to heavy metal pollution (which the province/city then has to pay to remove from drinking water), and various lubricants and coolants contribute to chemical pollution. Beyond that the heat generated by pavement and internal combustion engines causes the city of Toronto to be 1-2 degrees hotter than the rest of the province which contributes to the strain on the province's electrical grid which already is having economic impacts with utilities asking large companies and institutions to reduce their energy use at least 3 times last summer. But beyond that personal vehicles are also the largest source of noise pollution in urban and suburban areas. Noise pollution contributes to mental health issues, sleep deprivation, stress, and cardiovascular disease all of which are already costing the healthcare system of Ontario billions in treatment and costing the economy billions in lost productivity.\nLastly, personal vehicles are also a huge financial burden to everyday Ontarians. The cost of buying a new car is skyrocketing, and ownership of a car costs an individual typically $2,000 per year in depreciation (closer to $5,000/year if a new car not including interest), plus $2000-$3000 per year in maintenance and fuel costs. The necessity of driveways, garages, and off-street parking adds ~$300 dollars/month to the average rent of a one-bedroom apartment and adds $20,000 of dollars to the cost of a house. When added up across all the residents of the province this represents ~$25 billion dollars disappearing from the Ontario economy every year due to asset depreciation from the ownership of personal vehicles without considering all the other costs I listed above.\nPLEASE END THE DRAIN ON THE ECONOMY, PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL FINANCES, AND THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ONTARIANS AND VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL!\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible plan; numerous studies show that adding a lane of traffic increases cars on the road and further reduces safety for cyclists and pedestrians. Bike lanes provide a safe and enjoyable way for cyclists to move throughout the city; removing lanes just encourages those to cycle on the road (which drivers say this is annoying) or resorting to driving, adding even more cars on the road. This is a move in the wrong direction for the city and will cause a lot of frustration for cyclists as well as drivers.\n"

Many more people are choosing to cycle than 20 years ago.  I was in row of 12 bikes this morning on Bloor and imagined if all of us were in cars instead, how much worse the air would be for everyone.   Please reconsider this decision and keep our bike lanes on Bloor Street.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Harbord Village neighbourhood with my family. I ride along the Bloor street bike lane between Bathurst and University multiple times a week as I drop my kids off at school. After safely dropping my kids off, I ride south on University either stopping at the University of Toronto for classes or passing by Queens Park as I continue to Adelaide St where my office is located. On the weekends, we use the Bloor bike lane to explore nature near the DVP in the east end or at High Park in the west end of the city.\nMy family uses the bike lanes that are under threat by Bill 212 almost daily, all year round.\nMy eldest daughter recently learned to ride a bike and is now also a regular user of this critical piece of Toronto infrastructure. The bike lanes provide peace of mind that my kids and I can navigate the city safely and effectively.\nThis summer, the upgrade of the University bike lanes made my commute from Bloor to Adelaide smoother and safer. In contrast to traveling the same distance along Bay where there is no dedicated bike lane, on University there is now no need to dodge delivery trucks, weave around parked cars, or deal with dangerously large potholes. The bike lanes provide me with the comfort that I will be able to commute to work and make it safely home to my kids in the evening. Removing the bike lanes around Queens Park will make it significantly more dangerous for myself and the many other bike commuters who rely on this corridor. Removal of these bike lanes will inevitably result in cyclist injury and fatality.\nI do not have the luxury of using a car to transport my kids to school or myself to work on a daily basis. My family relies heavily on our bicycles to live and work in the centre of Toronto. Removal of the proposed bike lanes puts the safety of my entire family at risk.\n"

        "comment": "I have significant concerns regarding Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024). The proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to reduce traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and lacks empirical support. Evidence consistently shows that removing bike lanes does not alleviate traffic congestion; in fact, it often exacerbates it.\nFor instance, when bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data revealed that travel times increased and traffic flow worsened. This measure not only failed to reduce congestion but also compromised safety, leading to more accidents and fatalities. These incidents result in higher costs for healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses, ultimately burdening taxpayers.\nInvesting in bike lanes and other sustainable transportation options is a more effective approach. It promotes safety, reduces reliance on cars, and supports a healthier, more active population. This, in turn, can lead to long-term savings in healthcare and infrastructure maintenance.\nInstead of dismantling bike lanes, the province should focus on initiatives that directly benefit residents, such as improving healthcare and education. These investments will serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than short-sighted measures aimed at placating a specific group of commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 represents a step backward for Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad law and regulation, for several reasons, and I oppose it. Bundling removing and banning bike lanes with exempting a freeway from environmental assessment is a blatant attempt at politicking and creating a wedge issue to shift the conversation and hide the real goal of the law. Discouraging bike lanes disregards existing data and disregards best practices in urban design from around the world, and it considers the time, wellbeing, safety, and health of anyone not in an automobile to be worth nothing.\nHere's only a few of the considerations from provincial point of view:\nOn a practical level:\n- This adds provincial red tape to matters that the province has delegated to municipalities.\n- This mixes governmental responsibilities. If the Ministry of Transportation wants a say in how streets operate, an obvious answer would be to assume the streets as provincial property and responsibility. Yet, this act does not provide for the Ministry to pay for increased road maintenance that will be required due to increased automobile volumes.\n- This sets up a game of cat and mouse with municipal governments. We've seen that municipal governments are very good at putting up creative barriers to provincial policies, for example on the housing file. Municipalities will be able to take other actions, not proscribed here, to reduce vehicle throughput. Now instead of converting car lanes to bike lanes, they'll convert car lanes to parking lanes, or set a really low speed limit, or put a stop sign or traffic light on every block, or set up modal filters to remove through traffic from streets. Is the Ministry of Transportation prepared to check every change to every street in Ontario?\n- This might have an unintended consequence of municipalities avoiding widening any streets or roads, fearing they won't be able to adjust them ever again.\nOn an ideological level:\n- What is the purpose of the Environmental Assessment Act if we exempt projects from assessment? Is it only for projects the government doesn't like?\n- Some of the worst congested highways in Ontario are provincial highways like the QEW and the 401. Congestion on the 401 is legendary. The QEW is newly clogged through Hamilton and Burlington due to failures of provincial transportation policy and planning. Having failed to keep provincial highways free of congestion, the province now wants to use our main streets as highways.\n- Outside of 400-series highways, some of the worst congestion in the GTA is on streets that have no bike lanes and no road safety changes. These are areas such as around Square One in Mississauga or around Yorkdale in Toronto. Why are these not a focus for the province, rather than three specific streets in central Toronto?\n- It is unclear why the Ministry of Transportation is taking on more responsibilities considering their failures on the freeway file, and their current problems delivering projects like the Crosstown LRT (now at least half a decade late with no opening date set). Why does it need more responsibilities?\n- Why is this a priority for the government during the week that province announced that it is not meeting its own housing starts goal? Which do we need more, homes or cars?\n- If the province wants to see municipal data before making a decision, how come a decision has been made already for Bloor, Yonge, and University? Which data has the province seen there to make this decision?\n50 years ago, the Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis stated about a proposed expressway: \"If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\"\nIs Ontario interested in building transportation to serve people, or to serve the automobile?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to share my concerns regarding potential provincial interference in municipal decisions about bike lane placement. As a young professional and parent, I rely on bike infrastructure daily to get around my city with my children and on my own. These lanes are essential for ensuring our safety, promoting health, and offering a cost-effective and efficient transportation option.\nBike lanes are not only crucial for cyclists but also for drivers. When I am driving, I would much rather have cyclists in a separated bike lane than sharing the roadway. This creates safer conditions for everyone and helps reduce conflicts between different modes of transportation.\nAdditionally, as a cyclist, I often need to use major routes to reach my destinations. Secondary streets alone are not always a practical option. Relying solely on secondary streets for bike lanes creates unnecessarily long and inefficient routes, and results in gaps in bike infrastructure. This forces cyclists to ride on roadways without bike lanes, which increases safety risks and discourages cycling as a viable transportation choice.\nMunicipalities are best positioned to plan bike lane networks that integrate seamlessly with their cities\u2019 needs. Adding red tape to these decisions undermines the development of safe, continuous, and accessible bike infrastructure. Without these essential networks, residents like me may be forced to reconsider living in communities that do not prioritize diverse transportation options.\nI urge the Ontario government to respect municipal autonomy in this matter and support the development of transportation systems that benefit everyone, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I am deeply concerned about the ramifications of this bill and I urge this government to reject it.\n1. This bill kills:\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is a very frustrating issue that needs urgent attention. However, in a climate where cyclist deaths are up 500% from last year (see link 1), a conversation about removing vital infrastructure safeguards in favour of shaving a few minutes off of motorists' commute is absolutely absurd.\nWe all deserve to move around this city without fearing for our lives and there are ways we can reduce traffic without forcing already vulnerable commuters into dangerous and life-threatening/altering situations. Moreover, there is an abundance of literature and data indicating that people drive faster resulting in more fatal accidents where there are more and wider streets and lanes, and without bike lanes (see link 2).\nPlease shut down this bill and protect the lives of Canadians.\n2. This bill is ineffective:\nToronto has reached a point of critical mass with vehicles. If the solution to traffic congestion is building more lanes and highways, we simply have no more space.\nAfter we've removed the bikes lanes will we also take out street cars and busses so that drivers have more space? We all understand how ludacris that sounds; how ignorant can Mr.Doug Ford be to not understand the same is true for bikes. Investments in infrastructure that promote modes of transit besides driving reduces congestion.\nThe October 31st update states that the bill would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes. These are critical connections to a broader cycling network. Cyclists need to get to the same destinations as drivers so these people may then choose to drive, making traffic worse. The space of 1 vehicle can trasnport 4-6 cyclists.\nInduced demand: if you build it they will come. If we build more lanes for traffic, more people will choose to drive and if we build a robust network of protected bike lanes, more people will cycle. There are numerous studies from all over the world that clearly indicate this, but we do not even need to search that far. In 2011, a bike lane was removed on Jarvis Street to allow more space for cars and congestion got worse in the years that followed, (see link 3).\nThis bill will actually have the opposite affect of it's intended purpose - please shut it down.\n3. This bill is unfair government overeach:\nAlthough I appreciate the sentiment of a push to unilaterally address gridlock as a whole in this province, I believe this to be unfair to the unique needs of municipalities. The transit issues of Hamilton are different than Toronto, and Toronto different than Barrie. Municipalities should not be be restricted, but empowered to make transit choices that best fit their communities.\nI am proud of the equitable, inclusive, data-driven and community oriented approach Toronto has taken for its decisions of the cycling network, (see link 4). This is a comprehensive plan that is based in science and commentary from residents. Mr. Doug Ford's comments about how bike lanes should be on side streets shows how little he understands this plan. There is no efficient side street route that will move cyclists East to West - Urban planners have already determined that Bloor St is the most efficient route and the community has been advocating for this for decades, (see link 5).\nLet Toronto make the transit choices that are best for Torontonians.\n4. This bill is needlessly divisive:\nThere is absolutely no need of rhetoric coming from our politicians that pits drivers against cyclists. It is very common in Toronto that people who drive also bike, walk or take public transit depending on where they're going or what they're doing, and infact, this is exactly the kind of transit behaviour our municipalities need and our leaders should be encouraging. Mr. Doug Ford speaks about this issue with language such as \"a war on cars\" as if our government has some sort of allegiance to vehicles. Perhaps he does personally, but the job of government is to efficiently move and protect people, regardless of how they choose to travel. I am very disheartended to see leadership that not only promotes one mode of transport above others, but encourages divisive social behaviour, making one group out to be the problem that is making others lives worse.\nCanadians deserve better.\n"
