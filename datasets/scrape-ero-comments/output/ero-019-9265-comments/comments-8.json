        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who has lived here for over 10 years, I am vehemently oppose this act. Once again, the Ford government is proposing legislation that is not based on any robust researched evidence or what\u2019s best for his constituents but rather on his own personal business interest.\nIncreasing car lanes and impeding the development of bike lanes will make our cities more danger, not less. And it will make traffic worse, not better.\nThis will be a disaster and an urban planning embarrassment.\n"

        "comment": "This makes ZERO sense. Studies show that creating more bike infrastructure eases congestion overtime, and it makes communities and cities more pedestrian friendly and bike friendly. It also encourages more activity, community interaction, healthier air - the benefits are so strong. Also, cyclists won\u2019t stop cycling. Instead, there will be more risk of accident and chaos when cars and bike have to share the same lanes. Stop trying to make Ontario one massive, ugly, smoggy highway. Give us TRANSIT OPTIONS and GREEN SPACE and bike lanes and nice sidewalks. Otherwise, no one will want to live here.\n"

        "comment": "As a recreational cyclist, and motorist, and pedestrian, I strongly oppose the framework for the bike lanes and the highway 413 in its current form.\nMany residents in the city requires more options for transportation - mopeds, scooters, mobility scooter, and bikes will experience faster speed for most bicycle lanes than having them without in places where they are already are well studied. We have been taught that driving is a privilege. This regulation proposal falls counter to that.\nHowever, this does make me wonder if there will be bicycle lanes parallel with the limited access expressway systems?\nHighway 413  - multiple sources show that this only benefits a few, and time savings are not yet significant. This will also cross through known indigenous artifacts, which would be better as a interpretative site or community hub, instead of another highway.\nSee a small excerpt of what the media is saying about the provinces' plans: Narwhal. https://thenarwhal.ca/ontario-highway-413-bill-explainer/\nThe Globe & mail. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-to-exempt-planne\u2026\nProceeding with most of these plans in its current form as a resident in a midsized city who also visit small towns is not beneficial with my vision and plans except those who are already privileged to begin with.\n"

        "comment": "This is a poorly thought out, haphazard piece of legislation that ignores decades of actual transportation planning research. Bike use is the fast growing form of mobility in the region, owing mostly to new bike infrastructure. Forcing people into space inefficient cars will make traffic WORSE, not better. Drop this bill and let the province focus on building better transit cheaper and faster.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lane infrastructure is so important to the health and safety of a community. We should be encouraging the growth of bike lanes and safe biking as part of the solution to reducing gridlock traffic. The more people who feel safe biking, the more who will. Reducing or limiting bike lanes in anyway is short sighted to the growth of towns and cities and will only lead to more deaths and injuries of bikers.\n"

        "comment": "This act is counter to the data. More lanes of traffic don't reduce traffic. Bike lanes, trains, and public transit reduce traffic and congestion. Please focus on those things. Please do not make it harder and more burdensome to increase bike lanes and transit -- the things the data shows actually make the difference this act claims to be aiming for. Please do not let this pass as is. This act, as written, would mean more cars, more traffic, and more inequality.\n"

        "comment": "First on bike lanes, we can't reduce our carbon footprint unless we increase the percentage of trips we take using carbon efficient transportation, such as bikes, transit and electric vehicles. Creating a safer means of travel for bikes will have the positive effect of increasing bicycle use. In Toronto, the Bloor West of Humber bike lane was rolled out with the concurrent expansion of Bikeshare stations, allowing me to ride out to the end of the line for coffee earlier this year.\nI also note that bike lanes tend to make it safer for pedestrians and drivers alike. One of the ways this happens is by providing dedicated left turns lanes. As a driver, this also makes the trip time more predictable - which to me, is the crucial part of dealing with the stress of traffic.\nSecond, on exempting highway 413 and the Brantford bypass from environmental assessment, this is clearly a violation of the spirit and intent of the environmental law. The current government has been in office long enough that the assessment could and should have been done. As above, it is clear that promoting more automobile and truck traffic will negatively impact our climate (and, therefore, environmental) goals. In addition, there are numerous likely adverse nature effects, which have taken on greater prominence since the COP 16 conference on nature held in Montreal. Building the highway will certainly make it harder to protect 30% of nature by 2030 (the 30 by 30 pledge).\n"
