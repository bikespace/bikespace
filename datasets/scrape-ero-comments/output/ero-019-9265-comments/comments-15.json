People use bikes not only for commuting but for daily errands and many who cannot or do not like to drive would benefit.  If your government truly is for the people then you need to be for ALL the people and not just drivers who falsely believe having bikes share live lanes of traffic with them will be better than having bikers safely ride in their own segregated lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As an individual that both bikes, drives, and commutes via transit (subway, train, bus) I am highly disappointed that our premiere and colleagues choose to support a bill that has no evidence surrounded by data in expediting commute times to work. Our province has the ability to build world class infrastructure that can make our province a joy to live in, yet we're moving back to the medieval ages in an urban area that thrives with density.\nThis bill will reduce the safety I have while biking, and make transit less equitable to those who are less fortunate and cannot afford a car.\nConduct a study on commute times so you have an evidence based approach before eating and wasting millions of taxpayer dollars for infrastructure that has already been built.\nI am ashamed to have this issue politicized when it should be common sense that these lanes and building highway 413 does not make sense.\n"

        "comment": "This bill appears to remove the ability of municipalities to make their own decisions regarding installation of bicycle lanes. This is contrary to the provincial government's stated goal of reducing red tape. I did not vote for this party to have my city subjected to more red tape to complete basic projects.\nPreventing the construction of new bicycle lanes, and requiring the removal of old ones, is directly contrary to the province's stayed goal of improving traffic flow. Without a dedicated bicycle lane, bicycles will be mixed in with the flow of motor traffic. In addition to the intrinsically slower speeds of bicycles, motor vehicles further reduce their speed due to the high consequence of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles.\nAs a regular driver, I expect this bill will cause worse congestion. I am disappointed that the province is wasting my tax dollars picking on an emotive target, instead of building the high-capacity transit that will actually reduce congestion in the long-run.\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nAppreciate the consultation period to communicate the bill and solicit feedback. As an avid cyclist, I use my bike regularly to travel through the city of Toronto to get to work and run errands. I have alternatives to this with easy access to the TTC by living on a street car line and a car for doing distant trips that are inconvenient through other means. Cycling is the superior method of travelling the city by providing able bodied people a healthy and independent method of transportation. Additionally, through cycling, I am relieving public transit and city roads of congestion. There is evidence that bike lanes have a positive effect to reducing congestion through major cities, through many reputed sources online and public authorities that have been referred to and posted since this policy entered the public eye. This is in addition to providing safer roads for all users and alleviating the environmental impact of cars and maintenance costs on roads throughout the city.\nHave we considered other alternatives to reduce congestion in the city? To build a strong and transparent policy that benefits all people in Ontario, we should cost out the each alternative as well and evaluate the financial, human, and environmental cost for improving congestion problems.\nHere are some alternatives that must be considered before bike lanes are removed:\n- removing street parking on major roads\n- congestion tax for cars/trucks in the city\n- increasing fines and enforcement for illegal parking and dangerous driving in the city that adds to congestion\n- improving public transit\n- adding a levy to parking in the city to fund public transit or a \u201ccongestion reduction\u201d fund\n- increasing access to public transit by adding parking spaces to major terminal stations on the TTC and GO networks\n- incentivizing work from home that alleviates congestion during rush hour in the city\nThank you for your consideration\n- concerned cyclist\n"

If you have, then you'll know that bike lanes are the safest and most convenient way to divide streets.\nCommitting even more money into taking out infrastructure that has already been built and paid for, especially on the Bloor, University, and Yonge corridors, is the most irresponsible use of tax dollars I have ever seen. I enjoy being able to choose the most convenient method of travel, whether that's driving, walking, biking, or taking the TTC, depending on the trip, and I don't want any of those choices to put me at risk of serious injury or death. Using the bike lanes that we already have in place helps me feel safer as a driver and safer as a cyclist.\nPlease know that making life harder for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike will not win my vote next time there is a ballot in front of me. I am appalled that my tax dollars are being wasted in such a way.\n"

        "comment": "The purpose of our roads and our transportation network, is to move people. Some people drive, some cycle and some walk. Increasingly cycling is a growing mode of transport, especially on Bloor street. There are estimates that 40% of through traffic on Bloor is now cycle traffic.\nIf you just look, it doesn't seem so because cycling is so much more efficient than driving, that it appears that there are very little cyclists. That's because cars take up so much more space.\nIf the province forces the city to remove the Bloor bike lanes, it will not improve traffic. It will make it worse. Maybe not all of cycling traffic that goes through bloor will continue cycling there, but many will. The result will be mixed traffic where drivers will have to contend with cyclists in a more direct way. This will be even worse during non-rush our time when the cur lanes will become parking. On top of this not solving congestion, it will also make our roads far less safe. The city saw a 60% reduction in vehicle/cycling/pedestrian altercations after the installation of the bloor bike lanes. The province is literally proposing more injury and death to falsely claim traffic congestion will improve.\nThe worst part is that this is all a distraction. It's a distraction from the province bypassing environmental protections to build a highway nobody wants except for the developer donors to the conservative party. Ripping up prime farmland to increase urban sprawl, pollution and degradation of our green spaces. Ultimately increasing traffic as the people living in these communities have to drive, putting further pressure on our other highways instead of reducing them.\nOverall this bill will do the exact opposite of what it claims. It will put more drivers on our roads, remove safety and increase gridlock and overall traffic. Not reduce it.\n"

I use bike lanes everyday and consider them essential transportation options like sidewalks. The first priority should be how to make roads safer for vulnerable road users, instead of maximizing the number of car through put. When I drive, I much rather bikes have their own dedicated lane.  Bike lanes support our transit investments as it makes it easier to get to and from stations.\n"

And a bike lane only takes up half a car lane, so you get two bike lanes for the price of 1 car lane.\nToronto side streets cannot replace the arterial bike lanes, because we don't have side streets that continue for long stretches, if we did, cars would be already using them.\nIf we don't make cycling safe and efficient then no one will cycle. And if no one cycles then our streets will remain congested.\nThis act is like calling a ban on salads the, \"keeping you healthy\" act.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this act's attempt to restrict the construction of bike lanes on municipal roads. I believe that decisions regarding local transportation management should be left to muncipalities, and that the province is significantly overstepping its bounds by trying to insert itself on these matters.\nI also fundamentally disagree with the reasoning behind this act. It is well known in the transportation planning industry that increasing road capacity is not a long-term solution for reducing congestion due to induced demand. Additionally, driving is a highly space-inefficient method of travel, particularly since drivers often travel as single occupants and do not have any passengers. Therefore, even if current road capacity were preserved, population growth would still result in increased congestion if people continue to choose driving as their primary - or only - mode of travel. Reducing or eliminating bike infrastructure will NOT reduce gridlock or save Ontarians' time - rather, providing more efficient alternatives to travel is the only long-term solution. Bicycle infrastructure is essential to making sure people have adequate alternatives.\nIf the claim is that bicycle infrastructure should not be built because it will be underused, this claim ignores the fact that bicycle infrastructure, like any transportation infrastructure, is less effective if provided discontinuously rather than as a continuous connected network. This can only be achieved by gradually expanding infrastructure over time, not by adding roadblocks to its construction. This also means that the future potential usage of cycling infrastructure cannot be accurately assessed based on existing cycling demand; exising cycling demand will necessarily be underrepresentative of potential future demand because people will be less inclined to cycle where they feel unsafe or where there is no dedicated infrastructure for them to use. This also means that the suggestion to only build cycling infrastructure on side streets is inadequate because this is unlikely to provide a sufficiently connected network to serve all the destinations people may want to cycle too, which would again result in low usage.\nFinally, providing dedicated transportation infrastructure for non-auto modes is absolutely essential for safety. Cyclists and pedestrians are at high risk of injury or death in vehicle collisions; failing to provide dedicated infrastructure increases the risk that they will suffer such collisions. Failing to provide adequate infrastructure is therefore a direct threat to people's safety. By trying to stifle the development of protected cycling infrastructure, this provincial government is stating that they do not care about the lives of anyone outside of a car, and do not respect anyone's choice to travel by any mode other than driving.\nAs a someone who lives and works in downtown Toronto and has made significant use of the available cycling infrastructure, such as the bike lanes on Yonge, University, St. George, Bloor, and Sherbourne, I strongly hope that the province will amend this act and continue to allow muncipalities to make their own decisions regarding how to build a transportation network that is built for long-term sustainability, that provides users with safe and convenient choices for getting around, and that prioritizes users' health, safety, and lives.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot support the removal of existing bike infrastructure along Bloor, University, and Younge.\nRemoval will cost tax payers likely millions of dollars, will increase traffic temporarily through construction processes along these roads, will increase risk for downtown cyclists, and will not reduce congestion. I remember 10 years ago, when bike lanes didn't exist along any of these corridors and traffic was still bumper to bumper.\nIf the province needs to increase lanes along these corridors, perhaps consider removing surface parking lanes and replacing them with standard traffic lanes. These lanes are ineffecient, allowing a small number of cars (often 10-20 per block) to block the movement of all commuters. If cars need to park in an area they should be able to use the local side streets or parking garages.\n"

Many retired people who no longer \u201ccommute\u201d to work still ride bikes (my father is an active cyclist at age 79!)\n-15% of central Torontonians  cycle to work at least some times\nThere is much more info on current cycle use in the article and I ask that the minister and his staff read it so they can stop making policy based on anecdotes, feelings and complaints from the premier and his friends.\n"
