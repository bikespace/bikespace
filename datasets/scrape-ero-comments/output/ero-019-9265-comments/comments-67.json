        "comment": "My comment is focused on the proposed Bike Lane Framework.\nAs a citizen of Ontario and a resident of Toronto for 10 years now, I am deeply concerned about the prospect of bike lanes in the city being removed. I beg the province reconsider this proposal; passing it in its current form would put lives at risk, including my own, and make this province a worse place in which to live.\nProvincial overreach and increased red tape\nPassage of this bill would increase red tape for municipalities across the province, making it more difficult to build critically needed infrastructure and improve cities. Decisions around transportation and city planning should be left to municipalities.\nWaste of taxpayer dollars and harm to small businesses\nRemoval of critical infrastructure such as the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes in Toronto would be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars at the hands of the province. Local businesses have seen an increase in sales/customers since the installation of the bike lanes, and multiple BIAs have come out in opposition to this proposal.\nCyclist and pedestrian safety\nRemoval of these critical bike lanes would put lives at risk, full stop. I cycle to work daily and fear for my life even with bike lanes. A young woman my age, Alex Amaro, was killed by a driver on Dufferin Street in 2020. Her life could have been saved had there been a bike lane, and every day I fear that tomorrow this could be me. Countless studies show that narrower streets with fewer lanes of traffic and reduced speed limits are safer not only for cyclists, but for pedestrians and drivers as well. Human lives should always come first, full stop. Even if bike lanes did cause congestion (which they don't!), the safety of a city's residents is far more important than saving a few minutes in a commute. There's no comparison.\nPolicy founded in fact\nThe statistics that the province has cited around Bill 212 have been erroneous and shared without context. Yes, congestion has increased in big cities in the province, but that has kept up with the pace of population growth, not the installation of bike lanes. Bike lanes globally have been found to increase the number of cyclists, decreasing the number of motorists on the roads and decreasing congestion, or in the worst cases, not resulting in any change. Please listen to the advice of experts, including the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, on these issues. The removal of bike lanes will not help with congestion.\nEnvironmental impact\nOntario is also facing a climate crisis, and the province should be doing all in its power to fight against global warming and reduce emissions. The switch from motor vehicles to more sustainable forms of transit, including cycling, is key to solving the climate crisis. The province needs to encourage more cycling in order to protect our environment for generations to come, and removal of bike lanes is in direct contradiction to this.\nPassage of Bill 212 would be disastrous for the health and safety of the people of Ontario. This government must respect the lives of its constituents.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Ministry of Transportation,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to specific provisions in Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. While I understand the importance of infrastructure development, I believe the approach outlined in the bill raises significant concerns.\nFirstly, the expanded powers for expropriation without sufficient public consultation, as described in the Building Broadband Faster Act, 2021 and the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024, undermine landowners' rights and due process. Stripping protections such as hearings of necessity fails to balance infrastructure needs with community impacts.\nSecondly, the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act that restrict municipal authority over bike lane projects are a step backward for sustainable urban planning. Removing or limiting bike lanes compromises efforts to reduce emissions and promote safe, active transportation for residents.\nI urge the government to reconsider these provisions and ensure that infrastructure projects prioritize environmental stewardship, community input, and fairness.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n"

        "comment": "As a bike rider AND a driver, I am deeply concerned about bill 212 for a number of reasons: 1) our cities are suffering with traffic congestion, which has gotten worse since before the pandemic despite less commuting and likely owing to lower transit use. Adding MORE safe and affordable options to get around including safe, dedicated bike lanes will help ease congestion (look at Montreal that has seen traffic decrease by 10% and cycling increase by 28%. The change is visible: traffic has decreased in Montreal making for a much more pleasant and safe city for everyone including drivers but mostly importantly for those who live, visit and work in Montreal.) 2) taking away cycling infrastructure takes away options for a cities\u2019 most vulnerable: seniors, low-income and kids who can\u2019t or don\u2019t drive creating even less equitable cities at a time when urban living is at an all time high; I see many seniors and youth biking in my neighbourhood to school, work or for exercise. Bike lanes allow these users to safely travel without a car. 3) Transportation projects are YEARS in the making from studies to detailed engineering. Adding a layer of bureaucracy not only slows these projects, it threatens to eliminate funding or requires a complete redesign. Both of which will be MORE COSTLY and less effective in delivering any road work for cars or bike riders. 4) Cities are generators of majority of Canada's GDP but they are also places where people live, work and visit. Focusing on moving cars through a few neighbourhoods to save drivers who are travelling in secure, safe and comfortable vehicles to save a matter of MINUTES to someone's commute is antithetical to creating livable, sustainable and climate resilient cities. Removing bike lanes will either force more people into cars thus exacerbating the problem OR result in cyclists biking in car lanes creating opportunities for conflicts, accidents and less efficient movement for both cars and bikes. The province should be focused on solving the real crises: housing, healthcare and transit NOT spending tax payer money to remove millions in existing infrastructure for no demonstrable benefit.\n"

I wish the government of Ontario would make taking the train from Kitchener into Toronto a viable option for commuters and even getting around the province.\nStop meddling in affairs that belong in the realm of regional and city governments.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI have significant concerns with Bill 212 for serveral reasons - the ones I will highlight in this comment are concerns about the planned regulatory changes around bike lanes and the exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments.\nThe intention to 1) remove key bike lanes and 2) require the Minister to approve any new bike lanes that would remove a lane of traffic is misguided and ignorant. Bike lanes have emerged as a key piece of infrastructure that keep cyclists safe, and give drivers more confidence (separating cyclists from cars - it's safer for everybody!). The 1.2% statistic put forward by this government is fully incorrect - we have data on how many people ride bikes where bike lanes have been installed, and the numbers are much higher. I would encourage this government to actually review current data, and not use incorrect statistics to support bad policy.\nI personally ride my bike - to work, to play sports, to get places that are less well-served by transit (like the beach), to ride on trails, and to meet friends. I don't ride my bike every day, but it's an important option that I have. Removing bike lanes will take this option away from me, because I won't feel safe riding on the road without a bike lane. This bill is states that it will reduce gridlock and save \"you\" time, but what it's actually going to lead to is far more people choosing to drive when we could have actually biked. This will lead to FAR more gridlock and will cause more traffic than we already have.\nCities have actually done studies to understand this, and we know that gridlock in cities like Toronto is actually caused by 1) more people living in the city, and 2) the massive amounts of construction causing routes to be closed and redirected. It's not bike lanes. Again, bike lanes are getting more people out of their cars - bike lanes are helping to reduce gridlock and save us time.\nRemoving bike lanes will also be a massive waste of taxpayer money. The province has promised to foot the bill for municipalities to remove bike lanes. I am a citizen of a municipality, but I am also a citizen of Ontario. MILLIONS of our tax dollars are going to be spent on ripping up perfectly good roads, wasting all of the staff time that went into planning and installing the infrastructure in the first place. This is a disgusting waste of money and I find it completely offensive. Not to mention the months and months of time it will take to remove them, causing MORE TRAFFIC. I don't understand where the government's head is at in proposing this legislation. It doesn't make any sense once you actually look at the cost, and the implications.\nOnce these key bike lanes - Bloor, Yonge and University - are removed (leading to gridlock, massive waste of taxpayer money, and unnecessary deaths), cities will need to get Ministerial approval to ever build a bike lane again. I think the Minister has better things to do then to personally remove and reject or approve bike lanes. It is unacceptable to me that this would be the only way to approve new bike lanes - what this will do is effectively ban bike lanes. Again, people will die. More people will drive, causing more and more gridlock. Where is the logic?\nMoving on from bike lanes, this omnibus bill would exempt the Highway 413 project from environmental approvals. How is this allowed??! This is embarassing and will lead to so much destruction of valuable and important natural heritage. We are in a climate crisis, and destroying natural spaces drastically reduces our ability to be resilient to the impacts of climate change. I don't understand how this highway project can be exempt from our own laws. We are not in a \"highway emergency\" and yet the governnment is treating the highway like emergency measures (i.e. exempting it from respecting the law) are needed. I will be so deeply disappointed if this legislation passes as is. Please ensure the highway project is required to go through environmental assessments. This is just another way to erode our Greenbelt and it is unacceptable.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong Torontonian who drives and cycles weekly, I find this legislation deeply troubling. Prioritizing highways over bike lanes makes our city less safe, sustainable, and livable. Bike lanes ease congestion, promote health, and support cleaner, cheaper commuting with bicycles and personal electric vehicles. Since their expansion, Toronto has become more accessible and safer for families and children. This bill, by delaying or politicizing bike lanes, risks undoing that progress while undermining local democracy with provincial overreach. Respectfully, the province should withdraw this bill and let cities manage what they know best.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am a grade 10 student in the City of Toronto, and I believe that bike lanes are not slowing traffic whatsoever, but they are helping protect myself and other cyclists' lives. In addition to this I strongly disagree with the proposition of another highway (Highway 413) in the GTA as there are better solutions to traffic than paving over the supposedly protected Greenbelt, and ripping out the very infastructure that is in fact helping to reduce gridlock.\nAs a young cyclist myself, in the near 50 trips I have made to commute to and from my school, I have been run off the road once, wrongly yelled at well over 20 for \"not being allowed to be on the road\" [see first link], and nearly hit by aggressive drivers (especially on left turns) 7 times on my school commute alone. This didn't used to be such a problem because the road I mostly cycle on, Pharmacy Ave, had designated bike lanes that were ripped out under the Rob Ford municipal government. Since then, with wider lanes and faster and more aggressive drivers, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists has greatly declined. This is just my reasoning for personally wanting more and better bike lanes, but when researching this topic I came up on an article from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law [see second link] that explains that the removal of bike lanes will in fact increase gridlock in the City of Toronto, as it will encourage using cars as the main method of transportation which not only causes more low-occupancy vehicles on the streets, but it also causes more greenhouse-gas emissions from the extra cars on our streets which, I assume, is not what our Premier wants for the City. As I hope I have shown, this proposition in bill 212 does not help resolve gridlock whatsoever, and instead creates more unsafe conditions for the citizens of our city.\nTo help solve this issue of gridlock and safety, I propose that bike lanes are more encouraged, with more maintained trails off the road, and safer bike lanes on the road. Including these bike lanes in many City roads will not be a problem because the standard lane in the City of Toronto is approximately 10.5 feet wide, and the average Canadian car is only 5.75 feet wide. This means that cars have over 2 feet of clearance on each side, so if lane size was reduced it would leave plenty enough room for bike lanes, and it would encourage safer driving as drivers would be more cautious of clearance, causing naturally lowered speeds. The second part of my proposition is to enhance public transit in the City, because even though the current transit system is impressive compared to most Canadian cities, many other countries have much more advanced transit systems that don't have all the issues of the TTC. By fixing transit in Toronto, more people will be willing to take public transportation that efficiently moves people to their destination, causing even less cars to take up space on our roads. The final part of my solution to gridlock is creating a more coordinated construction, helping with better notice of road construction, and reasonable detours, to provide a simpler, and less chaotic driving experience for the citizens of Toronto.\nMy final issue with Bill 212 is the proposition of creating another highway to supposedly help reduce traffic on the 401. This issue should not even be a problem as we already have 2 400-series highways going through the city, and many other main arteries to increase what is supposed to be high-speed transportation. However one of our 2 biggest highways was for some reason privatized like Doug Ford wants to do with healthcare. This was arguably the biggest transportation mistake in the history of the City of Toronto because it caused a very large and useful road to become practically unused as drivers try to avoid the tolls going to a private company. This is the first main reason why traffic is so bad on the 401, but if the government manages to reclaim the highway or we wait until 2097, then traffic will be lessened by drivers who can now bypass the City instead of adding to traffic going through it. Unfortunately this can't be undone, but by building another highway in the greenbelt outside of the City, it provides more opportunity for urban sprawl to continue, just like it did with the 407, as developers create more large, expensive, single-family housing that is ruining farmland, and creating a higher market for housing. Overall I think the 407 will be another useless waste of taxpayer money, and  instead that large amount of money could be used for actually helpful solutions to not only solve gridlock, but also other major issues not only in the City, but also province wide.\nI hope you have understood the point I am trying to make, and hopefully this helps change your mind on the unnecessary bill that Doug Ford wants to pass as the unofficial mayor of the City of Toronto.\nThanks!\n"

        "comment": "Like many others, I disapprove of the proposed legislation. Overall, these changes are not based on empirical evidence, expert opinion, or justifiable rationale. The bike lane regulations will only inhibit municipalities in implementing safe transportation infrastructure and the public announcements on these changes have not used any research or study to warrant this consideration. As a civil engineer in transportation engineering and a certified road safety professional, I find this proposition by the government extremely disappointing, even disrespectful as it shows how little the government listens to experts.  The bike lane regulation is extremely vague in detail (example: \u2018diminish orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u2019 could mean anything) and even suggests the province will get involved in a project case-by-case. This is extremely inefficient and will not help \u2018build highways faster\u2019. The poorly written bike lane legislation leads many, including myself, to determine that its addition is simply a distraction. The sweeping changes for the Highway 413, including its exemption from the EA act, is being done to force it through without due diligence and the proper checks and measures.  Highway 413 is another item without technical justification - it has already been proven it will not notably save travel time. Like the Greenbelt scandal, the only people to benefit from Bill 212 and Highway 413 are the developers/big businesses along the corridor. Once again, the government are moving to benefit a group of developers to the detriment of the average Ontario resident.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is horrible! There are so many things wrong with this bill, I hardly know where to start.\nWe are living in a climate emergency. We need to do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and this bill does exactly the opposite, by speeding up building new highways and removing bike lanes.\nBuilding new highways is such a massive waste of money and resources, and locks Ontario further into a car-dependent future. My spouse uses a car for work, and he cannot rely on public transit (he moves large amounts of equipment all over the province in order to do his job). My dad is physically disabled and often uses a car to get around (although he also bikes where there are safe routes). I am under no false illusions that we can do away with highways entirely. However building new highways will NOT make travel faster and easier - because of induced demand, it will have the opposite effect. We need to get more people out of cars and off highways, by investing in public transit, so that those who NEED to drive can do so.\nThe portion of this bill that deals with removing bike lanes is such a disgustingly transparent PR move. It has no basis in evidence, and will not accomplish the goals of reducing congestion or improving travel times. Instead it will only serve to put the lives of cyclists at risk - including my daughter who is 1 year old and travels in our cargo bike. I feel much more confident biking with her when we are in a protected bike lane, because of the amount of aggressive and distracted drivers in Toronto. But I'm not going to stop biking if this bill passes - without my own car, this is our main mode of transportation. Instead I will be forced to put our lives at risk, to do things like grocery shopping and visiting grandparents.\nThis bill also represents a massive overreach into municipal governance. Why does Premier Ford think that \"Queen's Park doesn't know best\" when it comes to accelerating building new housing in Ontario (https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/cities-cant-be-trusted-to-\u2026), but suddenly he's the expert on bike lanes and traffic congestion?\nI urge you to reject making my safety (along with my 1-year old daughter's safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, SIX people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community. Maybe someone can explain to the Premier about the difference between his uninformed opinions, and actual evidence!\n\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe. You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was.\"\u00a0That was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date.\nI'm deeply sad although not at all surprised to find out this was just hot air, and that in fact the Premier is completely willing to gamble with the lives of cyclists to score a few cheap points.\nUGH!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 being introduced in Ontario. Reducing traffic does not come from increasing car lanes. This will only temporary relieve gridlock, until demand increases and traffic returns to its current state. The only way to really alleviate traffic congestion is to get people out of cars. I would like to see the Government invest in alternate forms of transportation, so that people can access convenient and affordable modes of transit beyond cars. The more people that can reliably and conveniently use transit and bike lanes, the fewer people will need to use a car to get around - especially in a city as big as Toronto.\nThe explicit inclusion of the plan to rip out existing bike infrastructure in Toronto is especially painful to see. I am a bike rider in Toronto and I use the protected bike lanes daily. Every time I get on my bike I wonder whether that will be the day I get hit by a car. At least the protected bike lane on Bloor provides me some more relief for part of my journey. Without these lanes I will be forced to decide whether getting somewhere quickly and afforadbly was more important than my safety. Without these bike lanes I will be forced to consider driving instead for trips around the city.\nRemoving the already established infrastructure is a dangerous and short-sighted policy move. Investing in public transit and bike lanes will get people moving faster in an environmentally friendly manner. I implore the Government of Ontario to reconsider introducing this Bill.\nThank you.\n"

Bill 212 disregards the safety of these individuals, which is not only unacceptable; but dangerous.\nLimiting bike lanes undermines efforts to make our roads safer for all users. By encouraging more cycling and creating designated lanes, we protect cyclists, reduce traffic congestion, and make the streets safer for everyone \u2014 drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.\nNot only that, but this Bill is completely anti evidence and anti best practice. No self respecting engineer or professional would every put their name on it. The government is skewing data, not consulting municipalities, and creating a culture war around fake facts. It's disheartening that the Premier is putting kids biking to school with parents or students finding an affordable way to get around at incredible risk to win an election and take attention away from the horrid environment destruction of hwy 413.\nOne of the biggest concerns with the proposed legislation is that it would limit municipalities\u2019 ability to make decisions based on their communities\u2019 specific needs. I highly doubt that highway designers with no local context from MTO or the Minister's office have the expertise to determine what's best on local roads.\nI urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the proposed legislation and adopt a more forward-thinking and EVIDENCE BASED approach to transportation. Rather than reverting to outdated, car-centric policies THAT ARE PROVEN TO FAIL MISERABLY, we must invest in a diverse range of public transportation options, including cycling infrastructure, to make our roads safer and our cities more sustainable.\n"
