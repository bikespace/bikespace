        "comment": "I am opposed to this Bill because I believe what it is proposing will bypass existing legislative practices and safeguards - such as environmental assessments and consultations with First Nations and the broader public - to fast-track politically motivated projects that are not in the public interest, will irreparably harm the environment, and will place an irresponsible burden on Ontario taxpayers.  The highly unpopular proposed 413 highway is a good example of this.  There are other proposals (such as changing use of the 407 for commercial trucking) that would address the issue of GTA gridlock without requiring taxpayers to pay the 4-10 billion this proposed project will cost.\nIt is ironic that this what this Bill proposes is that the government be less democratic and less accountable to voters & taxpayers.  Please do not allow it to pass\n"

If the lanes are gone I will be on the road, taking the lane.

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford, Registry, and all representatives of Ontario, this message is to alert you that Bill 212\u2019s efforts to remove bicycle infrastructure, and the fact that this will incite an anti cyclist culture war in cities and beyond, is extremely dangerous for my community and every person and family across the province who travels by bike. Removing protection for cyclists on roads, and preventing further protection from being built, will allow for more people to be injured and killed on bikes. I am also concerned that resentment on both sides of the bike lane \u201cissue\u201d will stoke violence and further danger amongst understandably angry (and predictably spiteful) motorists, cyclists, protestors, police, and onlookers alike. You can simply reduce gridlock instead, by reducing the number of cars on the road. This can be achieved through investments in reliable, convenient, accessible public transit and active transportation options that allow people to leave their cars at home, thereby saving money, improving traffic, and saving lives. Thank you.\n"

I use my bike to commute to work every day and the growth of bike lanes over the past decade or so has been a huge benefit for me, and thousands of others like me. We will continue to use our bikes no matter what, so it only makes sense for us to have space to do so. We need safe and secure bike lanes for people to want to switch over. If there's nowhere safe to ride bikes, many people will choose not to. In the long run this will actually increase gridlock, not reduce it. We have already invested so much time and money into building the bike lanes, why waste even more time and money going backwards on the progress that has been made? I'm so tired of Doug Ford and his cronies only doing what is good for them and forgetting about the people at the bottom.\n"

        "comment": "As a family physician and emergency medicine physician in Ontario, I am extremely disappointed with the Ontario Conservative's stance against active and safe transportation in Ontario. The proposition to increase the speed limits on 400 series highways, but moreover to create impediments to installing safe bike and pedestrian infrastructure (and to actually go so far as to waste tax-payer money in removing safe infrastructure) is a clear pandering tactic at the expense of the health and safety of our communities. People will die as a result of this bill if enacted.\n-I support less government overreach and red tape / bureaucracy (values that I had hoped the Ontario Conservatives would have shared).\n-I support a basic standard of safety and viable options for active transportation and community health.\n-Bike lanes and safe pedestrian spaces are essential parts of transportation infrastructure. Too much of our communal space has been sacrificed to motor vehicle infrastructure.\nI encourage you to be strong leaders and make the right choice in valuing the health and safety of our public spaces.\n"

        "comment": "While the idea of getting their faster is appealing, climate change mitigation relies on alternative modes of transportation including bikes, public transit, etc.\nPublic money has already been spent to forward the biking initiatives, and traffic flow was affected during construction. The people have already dealt with that.\nFurther money should not be spent to rip out this progress.\nMy recommendations include:\n1) for existing bike lanes that reduced lane traffic. There should be no change to remove these bike lanes.  This avoids further construction, related construction traffic issues, and additional cost.\n2) Study how to get better traffic flow through other corridors and on these existing streets.\nE.g would an idea like no left turns when travelling on Bloor street or these major corridors help?  In these existing bike lane areas could traffic be directed to go right and around to then drive across bloor from a side street. From a side street left turns are okay in this scenerio.  I have seen this approach used in New Jersey, USA.\nEg. Is there another corridor of streets that drivers can be directed to use.\n3) i would support plans for future bike lanes that require consideration to meet the goal of traffic flow but must also balance the need of safe bike travel across the city, BEFORE making the change for divided bike lanes.  Divided bike lanes help bikers and drivers from accidents. These have a place in the city and provide a safe corridor for bikes to ride.\nIn time, more and more people will use these or choose alternate ways of transportation if they see traffic is untennable or will shift their behaviour to stay local to home.\nThese are my comments. Thank you\n"

        "comment": "re ERO 019-9265\nI am very much against tearing up existing bike lanes as proposed in Bill 12 and for expanding bike lane infrastructure in Toronto. I live in Toronto and own a car but prefer cycling when possible - and when I feel safe.  Cyclists still need to be aware of surroundings  when using a bike lane but it is far safer than in their absence. Major cities around the world are increasing their bike lane infrastructure but under Bill 212, the Province would be forcing Toronto to take retrograde measures that will lead to more cyclist deaths and more pollution generated by more cars on the road. I happen to live near a busy road and can attest to the pollution that vehicle traffic creates.\nCycling lanes need to be on some major roads to be useful for commuters. Winding through side roads is fine for a Saturday ride but are not helpful for commuting or otherwise in a time-efficient manner. All three lanes mentioned in Bill 212 are on streets where there are subways - Bloor, Yonge and University. That may be the most perverse aspect of the whole proposal!\nWhen I drive, I see that it is the vast number of (largely single-occupied) cars that clog the streets, exacerbated by the constant and never-ending construction.  I lived in London England for some time. Toronto  could learn from London and the construction industry there about hastening construction times through innovative processes and strict  time requirements.\nBike lanes save lives and promote a healthier city through the act of cycling and the reduction of emissions. There are much more egregious reasons for grid-lock in Toronto.  The Province should stay out of this and the City should continue to expand the bike lane protections that allow cyclists to accomplish tasks in a safe and time-efficient manner.\n"

Improve rapid transit, increase capacity, extend lines and add services to satellite communities. Gridlock is a problem created by having too many private vehicles on the road with only one occupant. That is complete lunacy. Those of us who live outside the city have little choice but to drive our cars into Toronto. Clear the road of non-essential private vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "What are your thoughts on the fact that this bill makes it easier for the Ontario government to take my property and the property of Ontarians all across the province? Quoting from the bill:\n\"3 (1)  Despite subsection 39 (3) of the Expropriations Act, a registered owner may not apply under that provision for an adjustment of the date of possession specified in a notice of possession if the Minister expropriated the land under the Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo is Ontario moving to a system where people who live near highways have fewer tools to push back against government expropriation of their homes? As long as it's for a highway that won't actually cut commute times, we're fine with the Conservative government dictating when people have to move out?\nNext, from the bill:\n(2)  Every person is guilty of an offence who hinders, obstructs or interferes with the Minister, any employee in the Ministry or a person acting on behalf of any of them in taking possession of land that is vested in the Crown and which the Minister has the right to possess for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo if the Minister gives someone a date to move, and they need more time to get their possessions and finances in order, too bad, it's a criminal offence and the homeowner has no legal right to appeal the expropriation date?\nAfter that:\n\"13 (1)  A justice of the peace may issue an order authorizing a person named in the order to enter property specified in the order to do anything authorized under subsection 9 (1) or to take possession of land that is vested in the Crown and that the Minister has the right to possess for the purposes of a priority highway project if the justice is satisfied, on information under oath, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that...\"\nCentralizing the power of expropriation of Ontario's homes under the Minister, all to build highways that won't solve anything, do I have that right?\nOn a similar topic,\n\"4 (1)  The Minister may by notice require a utility company to take up, remove or change the location of utility infrastructure if, in the opinion of the Minister, the taking up, removing or changing in location is for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo we're putting the contractors and utility companies in the backseat in favour of what? The opinion of the Minister? Years of experience in infrastructure building vs. one man's opinion, and the one man's opinion wins out?\nFinally:\n\"(9)  An application for an order under this section authorizing the use of force shall specify the nature of the force that may be needed to be used to do the things authorized under subsection 9 (1) or to take possession of the land, as the case may be, and the order may authorize such use of force.\"\nSo in summary, people near highways are more vulnerable to expropriation, will have fewer rights when it comes to fighting expropriation, and they have to move out before some arbitrary date decided by the Minister, under the threat of violence? Cool.\nEven putting aside the clear land grab and overreach by the big government Conservatives, what will this bill do? Throw people out of their homes to build and expand highways, forcing them to move farther away from work and school, and so now they have to get on the highway to get there, increasing traffic congestion. Again, we see this government deciding the best way to reduce traffic is to put more cars on the road. This bill is terrible for Ontario and it needs to be withdrawn or voted down.\n"
