        "comment": "I object to the removal of bicycle lanes that municipalities have worked hard to build. Bicycle lanes in downtown Toronto do not cause congestion on the 401. Having the province intervening in municipal bicycle infrastructure is simply silly and disrespectful of municipal councils.\nOpen up the 407 to manage trucks moving through the city. We drove on the 407 to cross Toronto recently and it was shocking how empty that highway was.\nI object to the building of the 413. We need better management of all forms of transportation in southern Ontario, not more highways. More roads induce more traffic; this is a well-known phenomenon. There are many excellent examples of cities that are getting their transportation/mobility infrastructure right.\nAdding the improvement of broadband for rural Ontario to this bill is an insult to rural people who deserve better from the provincial government. Take broadband out of this bill and get on with providing that infrastructure to rural Ontario. The rural economy depends on it.\nWhile I have had my say, I do not believe the Premier is at all interested in my opinion.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes and expanding highways is one of the stupidest things the government could be doing right now. Many studies have been done that in fact show that building walkable cities, complete with protected bike lanes and safe sidewalks, REDUCES traffic congestion. Studies have also been done showing that expanding highways does not reduce congestion and often creates more traffic through induced demand, while being a huge financial liability that future generations will have to pay to maintain. I wholeheartedly oppose this bill. I would like to see the government doing more to encourage building transit, bike lanes and safer streets and this is a huge step in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 poses significant threats to both the environment and property rights in Ontario. By prioritizing the expedited construction of Highway 413, the legislation circumvents comprehensive environmental assessments, which could lead to severe ecological damage, including the destruction of farmland, forests, and wetlands. The highway is projected to emit millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases and contribute to substantial air pollution costs. Additionally, the bill grants the government broad powers to expropriate land with minimal recourse for affected property owners, undermining individual rights and local governance. It allows for construction activities to occur around the clock and overrides municipal bylaws, prioritizing speed over community concerns and environmental protections. Furthermore, it limits transparency by permitting the Minister to keep certain environmental studies confidential, reducing public oversight. Overall, Bill 212 represents a troubling shift towards prioritizing infrastructure development at the expense of sustainable practices and democratic processes.\n"

They are wrong, but also they should see that as an opportunity, not a problem - *they* could use the bike lanes and avoid gridlock.\nThey will bring up the elderly and the disabled as an excuse, saying driving is more accessible.

This has been proven around the world -\nYou are not thinking of the environment, you are not thinking of our future at all.\nWe need to improve transit and bike lanes instead of supporting the car drivers. Actually look at the evidence before making decisions.\nDon't just say something that comes into your head... a tunnel under the 401! Why not re-purchase the 407? The cost would still be less than building something new, and the environmental impact would be SO much less.\nPlease think before you speak! And think of what is good for all, not just a few of your developer friends who have supported you in elections, and who want to develop green belt land that surrounds the proposed 413.\nI am NOT in favour of reducing and eliminating bike lanes, NOT in favour of the 413, and NOT in favour of a tunnel under the 401.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is very bad for not only the environment but everyone. Tearing down public infrastructure just to increase road size only benefits those with cars and makes. It makes roads more dangerous not only for bikers, but also pedestrians. With fewer bike lanes, it encourages more people to stop biking and to drive due the lack of walkable communities. Why does a provincial power such as Doug Ford need the feeling to change what communities want for the public infrastructure when it is supposed to be a municipal decision. Overall I think this bill is a bad idea and it should not be allowed to pass.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely opposed to this bill. Multiple studies (including our own internal government documents) have shown that building more highways does not reduce traffic, they just allow for more cars on the road. We are going to waste billions of dollars on a project that will negatively impact our environment and agricultural sector. If we want to reduce traffic and put money into our cities and infrastructure, put that money into desperately needed public transit improvements.\nI'm also opposed to the proposal to bypass important checks and balances before projects, including environmental assessments. These are in place to protect people and our environments and I see no reason why we would want to make any of our projects exempt to processes that have been put in place for our protection.\nFinally leave the bike lanes alone. The time, money and traffic you'll cause with construction to pull them out is ridiculous. Pulling bike lanes just makes it more dangerous for bikers and drivers, plus cities are reporting that emergency service response times have improved in areas with bike lanes, not the opposite.\n"

Increase usage of 407 greatly by reducing the toll charges, thus reducing 401 traffic and cost for motorists and keeping predictable income flow.\nBuild subways and any LRT underground, consider moving streetcars underground.\nStart building roundabouts instead of four way stops.\nIntroduce yellow box junction blocking offenses and enforce them.\nKeep bike lanes, I work at 700 University Avenue in Toronto. Last week I counted 40 bikes in our bike storage room, that is 40 people just from our building that are using the bike lanes to commute to from work, 40 less cars, 40 fitter people.\n"

        "comment": "I have strong reservations about Ontario's Bill 212 and its implications for our communities. First and foremost, I believe that the bill undermines local governance by allowing the provincial government to remove bike lanes and other infrastructure without proper consultation with municipal councils. This top-down approach feels dismissive of the voices of residents and local officials who truly understand the needs of their communities. Decisions about public spaces should be made where they matter most\u2014at the local level.\nMoreover, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the environmental impact of the bill, especially regarding the expedited construction of highways. Bypassing environmental assessments for projects like Highway 413 could lead to significant ecological harm and worsen traffic congestion in the long run. It seems counterproductive to rush into construction without thoroughly evaluating the consequences, which could ultimately compromise the quality of life for residents.\nFinancially, the bill raises red flags for me as well. The costs associated with removing existing bike lanes and potentially needing new infrastructure could strain municipal budgets that are already tight. I believe the province should focus on investing in sustainable transportation options rather than dismantling infrastructure that encourages cycling and reduces car dependency. This shift could lead to increased traffic and pollution, which goes against the bill's stated goals of improving mobility.\nIn summary, I feel that Bill 212 needs a more collaborative approach that respects local decision-making and prioritizes sustainable development. It\u2019s crucial that we listen to our communities and work together to create solutions that truly benefit everyone.\n"
