        "comment": "This proposed bill is truthfully a farce in modern times. First, we know from years of scientific studies that a new highway will not improve traffic due in induced demand, which is NOT a \"red herring\". The fact that the government thinks that they can push this through despite all modern evidence suggesting that it is a bad idea would be laughable if it wasn't real.\nSecond, the proposed legislation regarding bike lanes is an egregious overstep by the provincial government. Not only that, the idea that bike lanes make car traffic worse is outstandingly simple-minded. One alternative to no bike lanes is bikes in car lanes, which everyone can agree makes car traffic worse. The other alternative is that those people who would be on bikes are now in cars, which means more cars on the road, which means more traffic. It seems that people have forgotten that cars are the problem; cars are traffic. But okay, if you're in favour of getting rid of bike lanes to give more space for cars, why not go one step further and get rid of sidewalks to give even more space. While it seems like a silly idea, it is the exact same as getting rid of bike lanes. If you got rid of sidewalks where would people walk? They would either walk in the road, which will definitely make traffic congestion worse, or they just wouldn't walk.\nThis bill is unbelievably shortsighted and should never pass. It is embarrassingly outdated in its reasoning with regards to traffic research, not to mention completely disregarding all the Ontario citizens who don't drive for one reason or another.\n"

These bike lanes were implemented by Toronto's democratically elected municipal government after careful studies and pilot projects.  They were also installed with city of Toronto tax dollars. Judging by other of Doug Ford's and his transportation minister's previous comments (see link below) one gets the reasonable impression that this legislation is being driven solely by the personal annoyances of Doug Ford and his cabinet experienced on their commute to Queen's Park in single occupant vehicles.  This is outrageous. If Premier Ford has an issue with the bike lanes, perhaps he should run for municipal office instead, or better yet, write and voice his concern to his city councilor like the rest of Toronto's residents.\nThis bill also strips environmental safeguards to clear the way for the construction of Highway 413. Is this ridiculous bike lane legislation being put forward merely as a distraction from the construction of this equally controversial and hastily planned highway? Bike lane legislation should be tabled in a separate bill if this government is, in fact, serious about pursuing it.\nLastly, where is the Minister of \"Red Tape Reduction\"?  The creation of such an absurd ministry is inherently ridiculous, but the hypocrisy of this government is nevertheless staggering in seeking to waste valuable provincial resources on what are squarely matters of municipal concern.\n"

Cycling in my day to day routine, whether it be for running errands, my commute to my office, or purely for leisure, has improved my experience in this city ten fold. This is because I am a safe, reliable cyclist that follows all traffic laws and actively uses the developed bike lanes in the city of Toronto that my tax dollars went to funding, a statement that can be echo\u2019d by the vast majority of active cyclists in our great city.\nThis decision to remove bike lanes by our Premier is misguided, ill thought, and will put more people in harms way while doing nothing to fix the driving conditions in the downtown core.\nPlain and simple: we, as cyclists, are being scapegoated by a man that lives hours away from our neighbourhoods, does NOT participate in the day to day of this city, and is hell bent on demolishing things that aren\u2019t actively putting money in his pocket.\nInstead of using our tax dollars to fund better conditions for unhoused people, for addicts, or people struggling with mental health, you\u2019re using it to scrap a proven improvement to the city, just to come back in 3-5 years and ask once again: \u201cwhat can we possibly do about this gridlock problem in Ontario?\u201d.\nInstead of introducing licensing measures for unregistered electric scooters and e-bikes swerving between traffic and committing infractions every second they\u2019re on the road, you target safe, reliable infrastructure.\nI do hope a logical, level headed council can determine a date for public comment so cyclists can finally have their voices heard, not ran off the road once again.

        "comment": "I am a vulnerable road user and I deserve to get home safely. My life has value, I have value. As Doug Ford refuses to use facts to support his bills, I'm going to do you all a favour and give you the facts below.\nInduced demand is a concept in transportation planning and economics that refers to the phenomenon where increasing the supply of a good or service\u2014in this case, adding more car lanes\u2014leads to an increase in the demand for that good or service. In the context of transportation, specifically roadways, induced demand is when additional lanes are added to a road or highway, it initially reduces congestion and makes travel more convenient. However, this improvement in conditions often attracts more drivers, either those who previously avoided the route due to congestion or new drivers who change their travel patterns as a result of the improved conditions.\nOver time, the increased number of vehicles can lead to a return of congestion levels similar to or EVEN WORSE than before the additional lanes were added. This happens because the initial ease of travel encourages more people to use their cars, take longer trips, or travel during peak times, ultimately filling up the newly added capacity.\nKey points about induced demand in relation to adding more car lanes include:\n1. **Short-Term Relief**: Initially, adding more lanes can reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.\n2. **Increased Vehicle Usage**: The improved conditions can lead to more people choosing to drive, taking longer trips, or traveling during peak hours.\n3. **Return of Congestion**: Over time, the increase in vehicle usage can lead to congestion levels rising back to or exceeding the levels before the lanes were added.\n4. **Urban Sprawl**: Additional lanes can encourage urban sprawl by making it easier for people to live farther from their workplaces and other destinations, leading to more driving and further congestion.\n5. **Environmental Impact**: Increased vehicle usage can lead to higher emissions and greater environmental impact.\nThe concept of induced demand highlights the challenges in using road expansion as a long-term solution to traffic congestion and underscores the importance of considering alternative solutions such as public transportation improvements, BIKE LANES, demand management strategies, and smart growth policies.\nBike lanes offer numerous benefits across various aspects of society, including the environment, the economy, and public health. Here\u2019s how they contribute positively in each area:\n### Environmental Benefits\n1. **Reduced Emissions**: Bicycles produce zero emissions, unlike cars which contribute to greenhouse gases and air pollution. More people biking translates to fewer cars on the road and thus lower emissions.\n2. **Lower Carbon Footprint**: Cycling is a sustainable mode of transportation with a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to motor vehicles.\n3. **Reduced Noise Pollution**: Bicycles are much quieter than motor vehicles, contributing to less noise pollution in urban areas.\n4. **Less Traffic Congestion**: Bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, reducing the number of cars on the road and thereby reducing traffic congestion and idling emissions.\n### Economic Benefits\n1. **Reduced Transportation Costs**: Biking is a cost-effective mode of transportation. It eliminates fuel costs, parking fees, and many maintenance expenses associated with cars.\n2. **Boosts Local Businesses**: Cyclists are more likely to stop at local businesses along their route compared to drivers. This can increase spending at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n3. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Bike lanes are generally cheaper to construct and maintain than roadways for motor vehicles. This can lead to significant savings for municipalities.\n4. **Health Cost Savings**: Increased physical activity from biking can reduce healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles and related diseases.\n### Health Benefits\n1. **Improved Physical Fitness**: Cycling is an excellent form of exercise that improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and overall physical fitness.\n2. **Reduced Risk of Chronic Diseases**: Regular physical activity, such as biking, can lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.\n3. **Mental Health Benefits**: Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Cycling can also improve mood and mental well-being.\n4. **Safer Streets**: Dedicated bike lanes separate cyclists from motor traffic, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. This makes cycling a safer option for more people.\n### Additional Benefits\n1. **Increased Mobility**: Bike lanes provide an additional mode of transportation, making cities more accessible to people who do not own cars, including low-income individuals, teenagers, and those who prefer not to drive.\n2. **Community Building**: Cycling infrastructure can encourage a sense of community by promoting social interactions among cyclists.\n3. **Efficient Use of Space**: Bikes take up much less space than cars, both on the road and when parked, leading to more efficient use of urban space.\nIn summary, bike lanes are a multifaceted solution that not only address environmental concerns but also enhance economic vitality and improve public health. They contribute to making cities more livable, sustainable, and equitable.\nIf we don\u2019t have safe bike lane infrastructure, more people will be forced to drive. If every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of cycling, walking, or using public transit, several significant impacts would likely arise across various dimensions, including environmental, economic, social, and infrastructural aspects. Here are some potential outcomes:\n### Environmental Impacts\n1. **Increased Emissions**: A significant rise in the number of vehicles would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution.\n2. **Air Quality Deterioration**: More vehicles on the road would increase the levels of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), worsening air quality and potentially leading to health issues like respiratory problems and heart disease.\n3. **Noise Pollution**: An increase in vehicle traffic would result in higher levels of noise pollution, affecting the quality of life in urban and suburban areas.\n### Economic Impacts\n1. **Higher Transportation Costs**: Individuals would face increased costs associated with owning and maintaining a vehicle, including fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking fees.\n2. **Infrastructure Strain**: The government would need to invest heavily in expanding and maintaining road infrastructure to accommodate the increased number of vehicles, potentially diverting funds from other critical areas such as education and healthcare.\n3. **Increased Health Costs**: With reduced physical activity due to less walking and cycling, there could be a rise in healthcare costs associated with treating chronic diseases related to sedentary lifestyles.\n### Social and Health Impacts\n1. **Reduced Physical Activity**: With fewer people walking or cycling, there would be a decline in physical activity levels, leading to higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues.\n2. **Mental Health Effects**: Increased traffic congestion and longer commuting times could lead to higher stress levels and negatively impact mental health.\n3. **Social Isolation**: Reliance on personal vehicles might reduce opportunities for social interactions that often occur on public transit or while walking and cycling.\n### Infrastructural and Urban Planning Impacts\n1. **Traffic Congestion**: Roads would become heavily congested, especially during peak hours, leading to longer commute times and increased frustration among drivers.\n2. **Parking Challenges**: Finding parking spaces would become more difficult and expensive, especially in urban areas. There would be a need for more parking infrastructure, which could take up valuable urban space.\n3. **Urban Sprawl**: Increased reliance on personal vehicles could encourage urban sprawl, as people might choose to live farther from their workplaces and other amenities. This could lead to the loss of green spaces and agricultural land, and increased costs for providing public services to sprawling areas.\n### Public Transit and Cycling Infrastructure\n1. **Decline in Public Transit Use**: Public transit systems might see a significant drop in ridership, leading to reduced revenue and potential cuts to services. This could disproportionately affect those who rely on public transit, including low-income individuals and those who cannot drive.\n2. **Underutilization of Cycling Infrastructure**: Investments in cycling infrastructure might become underutilized, leading to a potential reallocation of funds away from sustainable transportation options.\n### Overall Impact on Quality of Life\n1. **Decreased Quality of Life**: The combined effects of increased traffic congestion, pollution, and reduced physical activity could lead to a lower overall quality of life.\n2. **Environmental Degradation**: The natural environment could suffer due to increased pollution and urban sprawl, affecting biodiversity and ecosystems.\nIn summary, if every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of using more sustainable transportation modes, it would likely lead to significant negative impacts on the environment, economy, public health, and overall quality of life. It underscores the importance of promoting and investing in sustainable transportation options like public transit, cycling, and walking.\nThe introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had several positive impacts on local businesses, contributing to improved economic activity and community vitality. Here are some ways business has improved after bike lanes have been introduced in Toronto:\n### Increased Foot Traffic\n1. **More Visitors**: Bike lanes make it easier and safer for cyclists to access various parts of the city, leading to increased foot traffic in business areas. Cyclists are more likely to stop at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n2. **Improved Accessibility**: Bike lanes improve accessibility to businesses for people who do not drive, including younger and older adults, and those who prefer not to own a car.\n### Higher Spending\n1. **Frequent Stops**: Studies have shown that cyclists tend to make more frequent stops compared to drivers. This can lead to increased spending at local businesses as cyclists are more likely to shop at multiple locations during their trips.\n2. **Local Patronage**: Cyclists often prefer to shop locally, as biking is more convenient for shorter trips. This boosts revenue for neighborhood businesses.\n### Enhanced Community Appeal\n1. **Attractive Streetscapes**: Bike lanes contribute to a more attractive and vibrant streetscape, making areas more appealing to visitors and residents. This can enhance the overall shopping and dining experience.\n2. **Community Well-being**: The presence of bike lanes can promote a sense of community and well-being, encouraging people to spend more time in local areas and supporting local businesses.\n### Economic Revitalization\n1. **Business Growth**: In some areas, the introduction of bike lanes has been associated with an increase in new business openings and a reduction in business vacancies. This can contribute to the economic revitalization of neighborhoods.\n2. **Property Values**: Improved infrastructure, including bike lanes, can lead to increased property values, benefiting both commercial and residential property owners.\n### Case Studies and Examples\n1. **Bloor Street**: One notable example is the Bloor Street bike lane pilot project. A study by the City of Toronto found that the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street resulted in a 4.45% increase in customer spending and a 49% increase in the number of customers who visited the area by bike. Businesses along Bloor Street reported seeing new customers who might not have visited the area without the bike lanes.\n2. **Danforth Avenue**: The installation of bike lanes on Danforth Avenue also showed positive impacts, with local businesses reporting increased foot traffic and customer spending. The bike lanes made the area more attractive to both residents and visitors.\n### Reduced Transportation Costs\n1. **Employee Benefits**: Businesses can benefit from bike lanes as they provide employees with a cost-effective and healthy commuting option. Reduced transportation costs can lead to higher disposable income, which can be spent at local businesses.\n2. **Delivery and Logistics**: Some businesses have adopted cargo bikes for local deliveries, which can be more efficient and cost-effective in urban areas with bike lanes.\n### Health and Environmental Benefits\n1. **Healthier Customers**: Healthier lifestyles promoted by biking can lead to healthier customers who are more likely to engage in community activities and support local businesses.\n2. **Environmental Appeal**: Businesses that support sustainable transportation options like biking can attract environmentally conscious customers who prefer to support green initiatives.\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had a positive impact on local businesses by increasing accessibility, foot traffic, and spending, while also enhancing the community appeal and contributing to economic revitalization. These benefits highlight the importance of continuing to invest in cycling infrastructure as a means of supporting local economies and creating vibrant, sustainable urban environments.\n"

        "comment": "In 1977, the Barton-Aschman report to the City of Toronto's Bikeway Technical Advisory Committee recommended that Bloor St not be considered as a cycling corridor. This may have been acceptable policy 40 years ago, but the idea that major roadways should not accommodate all forms of transportation is antiquated thinking.\nStripping municipalities of the right to deliver what's best for city residents should not be in the interest of this government. Cycling infrastructure not only improves cyclist safety (for the most part, vehicle-users are still a threat), but improves pedestrian safety, limits damage to roadways from vehicles, and shows a commitment to accessibility by providing safe spaces for all road users. Cycling is a necessary form of transportation for youth and adults alike, as vehicle ownership and use is a privilege many cannot afford.\nThe negative framing of cycling as interrupting car road use is damaging to long-term place-making and city planning. Municipalities have continuously demonstrated a willingness to explore and implement ideas such as Vision Zero and walkable communities, however this cannot be accomplished without adequate cycling infrastructure. Municipal civil servants and councillors know their communities best and have a duty to provide for these communities. Bill 212 demonstrates a lack of critical thinking from the provincial government by taking more powers away from municipal government and wasting taxpayer dollars on the removal of bike lanes.\n"
