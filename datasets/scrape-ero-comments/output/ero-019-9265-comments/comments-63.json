        "comment": "Hon. Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2028Minister of Transportation of Ontario\u20287700 Hurontario Street, Unit 402\u2028Brampton, ON L6Y 4M3\nGood day Minister Sarkaria and representative staff,\nThis comment is directed at the proposal of Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\u201d Below, I will address Schedule 4 outlined in the bill relating to the Highway Traffic Act.\nPREAMBLE\nHaving lived most of my life in the City of Toronto and City of Ottawa, I\u2019ve observed the consequences of the rapid population growth since 2021. As someone that commutes by car, TTC, train, bike and walk, I believe there should be great consideration of the rights granted to municipalities to plan their cities. Businesses and residents have to grapple with the consequences of the drastic growth of an already strained social infrastructure. As recent studies have shown, it was concluded that direct actions taken by the federal and provincial government\u2019s policies on temporary foreign workers and international education programs, and other recent schemes to have accelerated strain or \u201cgridlock\u201d the bill claims to want to address.\nIt was found that the application of policies of strategies in programs to increase immigration of students and temporary foreign workers indiscriminately caused a surge in the population specific to the City of Toronto and surrounding municipalities as these are in-demand locations. Recent provincial and federal mandates have also identified significant deficiencies with housing, population displacement, and public infrastructure to support the rapid population growth. It goes without saying that immigration of asylum seekers and giving opportunities to educate individuals to lift our communities is fundamental to the functioning of Canada and Ontarians of metropolitan populations. Toronto is revered for it\u2019s vibrant culture, with a progressive economic ideology for city planning that caters to the businesses and residents of the city. The municipality is best equipped to balances the intricate needs of it\u2019s residents, businesses, and their employees.\nThe amended provisions seeks to transfer certain rights from municipalities to the Province regarding matters affecting the pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles otherwise reserved to the municipality to plan for it\u2019s residents. These amendments are required for the Province to remove popular bike infrastructure in heavily populated areas of town where the consequences of passing the amendments will a) increase congestion of already congested roads of the City, b) allow the Province to make decisions on matters affecting the diverse needs of the neighbourhoods, and c) continue to endanger cyclists, pedestrians and all in between.\nCAUSES OF \u201cGRIDLOCK\u201d IN TORONTO\nPopulation increase, rapid immigration, housing deficiencies, and strained public transportation have led to the reliance of vehicular transportation as commuters are forced out of living where there jobs are, businesses having to transport goods to support the population and is the driving factor of gridlock on motor roads, as claimed by the bill.\nResidents of the City are less likely to have ownership of personal-use vehicles and instead elect to use the TTC, cycling, or alternate means to transport themselves to their destinations. Vehicles owned for personal use tend to be by individuals or families that have to leave the City on a regular basis or for jobs that require driving in the City. Motor vehicles are the cause of majority gridlock of all other modes of transportation, with the exception of special events hosted by the City, an understanding I hope the Ministry recognizes as well.\nAs cars, vans, and trucks don\u2019t typically offer the same occupancy density as walking, cycling or taking public transportation, bike lanes used by couriers, commuters, and for leisure, offers more of the population to get to their destinations. Investing in providing housing to people of a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, paying them adequately to live closer to their place of work will decrease gridlock. Reducing commuters depending on cars to come into the City\u2019s core (Yonge, University, College, and Bloor) will be the only sustainable mode that will alleviate congestion for transportation vehicles and residents.\nTherefore, decreasing access of protected lanes, which supporting denser flow of non-vehicular traffic, will lead commuters to rely on taxis and cars more often which will only increase congestion.\nOVERREACH OF PROVINCIAL POWERS\nAlthough, information sharing of key highway infrastructure granted by the Municipal Act, 2001, should be expanded to ensure proper disclosure and collection of engineering data to help make informed decisions based on research and science. An argument can be made that the Province is not equipped to require large municipalities to require the approval of the Province for the construction or decommission of bike lanes, as the concerns of local communities are the ones using the infrastructure, and not typically used by visitors or commuters in other parts of the province or have the diverse needs addressed for municipalities, such as Ottawa, Toronto or Thunder Bay.\nSupporting the growing population, expanding the Province\u2019s rights to require the approval of the municipality would result in stagnation of key development of boroughs and cities. There would be an significant delay from one government to review the needs of the people at this scale. Powers are already granted to cities to conduct projects affecting it\u2019s businesses and residents based on democratic, localized, and studied communities using the infrastructure. Existing bike lanes already go through careful consideration and local oversight by governments, associations and residents before approving construction.\nApproval of this amendment will result in additional bureaucracy, expense, and regulation from a provincial government for such complex degree on a provincial scale. As mentioned, the City of Toronto is unique and requires careful, thoughtful, and detailed consideration localized outside of the Province\u2019s ability to provide at this scale. The Province would be able to focus instead on improving the transportation requirements of trans-urban infrastructure like rehabilitation of the Gardiner and Don Valley parkways, continue making GO trains better adapted to reduce reliance of single-occupied vehicle commuters, and provide funding to municipalities to expand local public transportation with greater efficiency than having the Province conduct construction themselves as with the ongoing costly16 year Eglinton Crosstown Line and the ongoing of the almost 6 year Ontario Line construction.\nSAFTEY OF BOTH MOTOR VEHICULAR AND NON-MOTOR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC\nThe climate crisis is worsening, and cars have a reliance on fossil fuels or precious metals which continue to endanger the future of the population. While the abolition of fossil fuels is not possible with our current infrastructure, removing safe access to commuters, businesses, and residents will not help with the country\u2019s emission goals. We\u2019ve seen the affects of climate change in the City, with floods, wind, and fires accelerating the destruction of our environment, affecting biodiversity, along with the economic cost to residents and businesses.\nMotor vehicles when compared with other forms of transportation cause the most injury on highway roads. Mixing various modes of transportation increases this risk. Combining bike lane traffic with pedestrian traffic also leads to an increase risk of injury. Segmenting traffic of motor vehicles from cyclists (delivery, e-bike, accessibility devices) from pedestrians (walking, running or using accessibility devices) is the only way to maximize safety in congested areas of metropolitan municipalities.\nThe health implications of having the population rely on using single-occupied motor vehicles is also affected. Having the population cycle or walk has profound health benefits and decreases the number of vehicles polluting denser local communities.\nThe removal of bike lanes or adding bureaucratic barriers to any municipal study supporting for proper segmentation of traffic will only increase injury and deaths. Therefore it is not the place of the Province to overrule these municipal determinations. The amendment of this bill will decrease in the adoption of using the other forms of transportation as motor vehicles will continue to pose an increased risk on the growing population of cyclists, pedestrians, and all commuters in between.\nCONCLUSION\nExistence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, more people are able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population making the roads less safe, have municipalities lose their autonomy to serve their population, and all while not addressing the problem of gridlock.\nThank you for your time in taking our considerations regarding the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act as outlined in Schedule 4 of the bill. For the reasons outlined in this commentary, I oppose Bill 212.\nRegards,\nA City of Toronto and City of Ottawa resident.\n"

The 401 is the perfect example that adding more lanes doesn\u2019t help the flow of traffic.\nWe should be building more public transit corridors. A train line that spans the 401 and connects all GO Transit corridors. And more subways.\nWe should use true examples of world class cities like London, UK. that do not have severe grid lock problems and make over 1 billion annual trips on their robust public transit system. Another example is Copenhagen that has a network of bike lanes that support reduction of car traffic and as result do not experience our immense traffic.\nOur decision makers need to travel to leading European cities and take example of how smart policies and focus on public transit can reduce dependency on cars and as a result no need to expand highways . Also leads to a healthier society which reduces health care spend.\n"

Please let local communities decide when and where they are deployed.\nI want to remind the committee that Bill 212 will not cause cyclists to migrate back to their station wagons and sedans. It\u2019s not 1974. Today, parking spots, at a cost of $200,000 each are being built in Toronto at a ratio of less than 1 for every 3 new residential units. This ratio must continue to drop as our population swells. Let\u2019s build housing instead of parking. Cycling, along with transit, is here to stay\u2013 please don\u2019t stand in its way.\nThis committee will hear many submissions that remind it that bike lanes save lives. This government will have blood on its hands if the swelling number of individuals on bicycles are forced to merge with individuals who need or choose to manoeuvre 2-ton steel vehicles through our streets. I also want to remind the committee that active transportation, enabled by the complete-streets model, supports the physical and mental health of our workforce. And it appeals disproportionately to the young, creative demographic that will drive the economic growth of our province.\nFinally, evidence indicates that cycling, and the infrastructure that supports it, is key to relieving congestion on our roads so that they are available for emergency services, the disabled, deliveries\u2026 and motorcades. Please be guided by the plea of the Ontario Professional Planners Institute and return to evidence-based policy-making. This government should not punish those citizens who have given up car travel. They are modern-day heroes, making way for those who truly need to travel by car. I encourage this government to celebrate and support cyclists rather than limiting and removing bike lanes.\n"

Now that the lanes are pretty much complete, I finally feel safe, I finally don\u2019t grip my handlebars as tight as I used to because of road anxiety. With many other cyclists sharing these amazing lanes, we feel pleasure as we get a little bit of exercise and safely travel to our jobs and back home. Hey, and I arrive at the office in a good mood!\nI have seen 6 people die as a result of negligent car drivers and I know this number is going to go up if bike lanes are removed.\nI also drive a car in the city and you know what, I appreciate that the new bike lanes separate me from cyclists. It\u2019s a barrier that I feel safer with when I am driving my vehicle because both drivers and cyclists can stay in their own lanes. We know what to expect. If you remove bike lanes, I will end up creating more traffic because instead of using my dedicated bike lane, I will be \u201ctaking the lane\u201d with my bike instead of cowering at the curbside while cars squeeze past me.\nPlease don\u2019t punish bike riders.

It will only force cyclists into shared roads with vehicles, which would likely in turn lead to more congestion and more dangerous conditions for all parties.\nAt a time when emissions need to decrease, the provincial government should actively promote active transportation rather than encouraging more people to drive.\n\"In 2023, emissions from transportation increased 4.7% from 19.1 MtCO2eq to 20.0 MtCO2eq and have nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels (The Atmospheric Fund 2024. 2023 Carbon Emissions Inventory for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area).\"\n"

        "comment": "The newly introduced proposal, Bill 212, brings a significant concern in terms of power between the provincial and municipal administrations. The legislation aims to reduce traffic congestion and expedite infrastructure projects, but by doing that, it is risking local stakeholders and destroying years of urban planning work to maintain sustainable communities.\nThe plan to make large traffic lanes for more vehicles by removing bike lanes might have a negative consequence in the long run, such as less safety for riders and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which can even lead to less trust in the government's decision-making power. The possibility to bypass environmental reviews is especially troubling, as it implies a lack of accountability for any environmental damage.\nFurthermore, the cost ramifications for towns like Toronto, who have already invested considerably in bicycle infrastructure, are significant and appear misaligned with the broader climate and safety goals. While the goal of removing gridlock looks absolute, a detailed, researched, and balanced plan that represents multimodal transportation, municipal sovereignty, and environmental sustainability is more likely to provide better benefits for people in Ontario. In addition, a chance to participate in the decision-making process should be given to every stakeholder to make sure that such policies are beneficial and reflect the needs and values of the communities affected by them.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposed through Bill 212. Staff from the Town of Halton Hills has the following comments:\n\u2022\tThe Town is concerned with the provisions of the Act that override most municipal by-laws that might prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to facilitate around-the-clock, 24/7 construction of HWY 413, including restrictions relating to noise or the use of highways under the jurisdiction of the municipality. It is critical that activities which will be disruptive to the municipality and its residents be communicated in advance and mitigation strategies be put in place to minimize impacts to residents and businesses in the area. It is important to highlight that Project 1 (embankment for a ramp for the 401/413 interchange) is located within the Town\u2019s Premier Gateway Employment Area. Currently there are a number of planned and ongoing municipal transportation and water/wastewater projects, active businesses such as the Toronto Premium Outlet and ongoing development in the area. Coordination with active businesses and ongoing construction projects in the area should be prioritized. To minimize disruptions and ensure a regular communication channel, municipal staff should have direct access to a construction liaison officer or other field staff working on the project.\n\u2022\tThe Act places restrictions regarding obtaining compensation in relation to a site inspection on land under municipal ownership. Specifying that if the property owner is a municipality or a local board within the meaning of the Municipal Act, 2001 or the City of Toronto Act, 2006, the Minister may compensate the property owner for any damages resulting from the site inspection, but does not have to; and that if the Minister compensates the property owner, the Minister shall decide the quantum of compensation and may provide only partial compensation. Site inspection activities, include altering in any manner any natural or artificial feature of the property to carry out early works. To alter in any manner could mean that negative impacts on the Town\u2019s NHS are not mitigated, including compensated for. The wording should be clarified to add that reasonable harm to the environment will be avoided during site inspections and if reasonable harm is proposed that the Town be consulted to review mitigation and that any residual losses be compensated.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my serious concern about Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This bill would negatively affect the future of sustainable mobility in the Province of Ontario and do little to nothing to actually reduce gridlock.\nInduced Demand\nStudy after study worldwide shows us that building additional lanes onto or creating new highways has little impact on overall congestion. The additional space for cars encourages more people to drive, and in a matter of months to years the travel times go back up to pre-expansion levels or worse. In my lifetime, the numerous expansion to highways across Ontario and in the GTA have not improved my travel times. Instead, thanks to the dramatically higher number of cars I avoid driving on 400 series highways if possible during the day for safety reasons and will even take back routes to avoid them because there are no alternative modes of transportation available. I\u2019d much rather be on a train taking a nap but I\u2019m forced to stare at a strip of pavement for hours at a time.\nFor a specific example, we can look at the recent 18 km Highway 401 expansion project between the Credit River in Mississauga and Regional Road 25 in Milton, at a taxpayer cost of $640 million, which has failed to alleviate traffic congestion on the 401. How many more times must we do the same thing, while hoping for a different outcome, before we start using taxpayer money on solutions that actually work?\nGovernment Overreach in Municipal and Other Local Decision Making\nHaving grown up in Grey-Bruce and lived in both Waterloo and Toronto before moving back to the area, it is obvious that the specific transportation needs of these regions vary significantly. Locally elected governments are in the best position to address and respond to these needs because they live in the towns and counties they serve, and their staff have the expertise and data to provide prudent recommendations case by case. Whether or not you personally think bike lanes are important, requiring provincial permission to adjust lanes of traffic for the installation of bike lanes is an egregious overreach by the province into municipal governance and adds red tape to decisions that should be made by our locally elected officials.\nDiverse Transportation Options\nProviding a range of transportation options like buses, streetcars, subways, local and regional high speed trains, and safe walking and biking infrastructure encourages people to make different choices about how they get around, taking cars off our roads and highways and reducing gridlock.\nIn Toronto, investing in these options allows people to save money on transportation because they can own fewer cars or use them less (average car ownership in Canada costs over $1,300 per month, money that would be better off in people\u2019s pockets). City staff also note that \u201cResearch and experience from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating traffic congestion in a growing city,\u201d\nSimilarly in Grey-Bruce, we could be encouraging people to leave the car at home for short in-town trips and providing incentives for e-bike purchases; this would reduce air and noise pollution, save people the thousands of dollars it costs to own a car, and the light, regular exercise would improve local health metrics and give people the opportunity to meet others in their community more frequently (an important factor in community cohesion and safety as more and more new people move here).\nAdditionally, many people in our ageing population are going to lose their driver\u2019s licences for medical reasons in the next decade or so. It can already be seen in Hanover as the number of mobility scooters and electric bikes is steadily increasing. Many of these people choose to ride on the road because our sidewalks are uneven or non-existent, creating a dangerous situation for all road users, increasingly so in the winter.  If Hanover or Grey County wanted to install a lane separate from the pedestrian sidewalks for these people, would the province veto it because it might take space away from cars? This attitude tells our residents that how they get around only matters if they drive, that they don\u2019t deserve transportation safety unless they drive. How must it feel, I wonder, to realise that as soon as your driver\u2019s licence is gone you are perceived by the province to be an invalid, undeserving of the same consideration we give drivers so immediately.\nCost\nBill 212 would have the bike lanes on Bloor, Young, and University torn out to reinstall a car lane. I question the financial responsibility of a government that wants to waste the $27 million spent to install these and then spend an additional $48 million (likely more if other recent construction estimates are any indication) to reconstruct those roads when Toronto\u2019s data show that \u201cThe reduced network capacity due to construction-related road closures is a primary factor contributing to congestion across the city.\u201d for example, \u201cthe ongoing construction of major provincial transit projects including the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (Line 5), Finch West Light Rail Transit (Line 6), and Ontario Line, private development activity to support population growth, and major infrastructure renewal including the Gardiner Expressway reconstruction\u201d. Surely many more months of bonus construction to tear up bike lanes up isn\u2019t the answer, especially when the result will be \u201clikely minimal improvements in travel time\u201d.\nBeyond the direct cost, there is also the cost of lost business and job opportunities. A study from 2019 noted that only 10% of visitors arrived by car to businesses on Bloor West in the Korea town and Annex neighbourhoods. 18% of visitors arrived by bike, and half of all visitors arrived by walking. A new report (November 17th) from the University of Toronto calculates that should the Bloor Street bike lane be removed, \u201cthose businesses will no longer be reachable by bike to on average 88,000 potential customers. Businesses on Yonge will do even worse, and will no longer be reachable to on average 138,000 customers.\u201d By reducing access to safe and connected cycling infrastructure \u201c600,000 people across Toronto will have fewer destinations they can safely reach by bicycle. Of those 600,000, the average person will lose access to 84,000 job locations, making it harder for them to reach workplaces, food stores, parks, shopping and healthcare.\u201d\nThere is also the as yet to be estimated cost to relocate bike lanes, if the province even permits it. Nearly any bike lane in Toronto will require shifting some space away from cars, even the side streets the province suggests they would be moved to, and it is extremely unlikely that an appropriately connected cycling network could be achieved without astronomical costs. City staff noted that a significant amount of infrastructure would need to be built to put bike lanes on side streets, including additional land acquisition, and construction disruptions to local residents. These same city staff have already spent years researching and collecting data on the best places to put high-impact bike lanes in accordance with Toronto\u2019s long term strategic plans. If there were better places to put bike lanes, they wouldn\u2019t be where they are. If the province has to review all new bike lane installations to replace these existing ones (requiring extra staff and time), I again question the financial responsibility of this government given such redundancy and red tape.\nEnvironmental Protection\nBill 212 also seeks to provide exemptions from Environmental Impact Assessments for the Highway 413 Project. Having studied and completed these in university, I understand how time consuming even small ones are. However, they are a vital part of ensuring that we do not cut corners and cause undue environmental damage with our infrastructure projects.\nOntario\u2019s own Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment, uses the government\u2019s own data to show that Ontarians\u2019 food, homes and health are at very high risk of harm within the next few decades \u2014 particularly if responding and adapting to a rapidly-changing climate doesn\u2019t happen immediately. Shirking EIAs to pave over more of Ontario is an irresponsible and short-sighted measure that will impact our children and grandchild long after we are gone. Again I say, I\u2019d rather be on a train enjoying the scenery while I read a book than driving on yet another concrete scar across our beautiful province. Let the government invest in mass transportation solutions that make sense and do less harm to the environment.\n"

I've been cycling in Toronto for over 20 years and am impressed by the progress that's been made, in terms of bike lanes.

One person in a different level of government should not be able to singlehandedly destroy all this work and waste my money.\n"
