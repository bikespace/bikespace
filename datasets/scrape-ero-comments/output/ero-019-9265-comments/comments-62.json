There is a reason that we have protections around certain environments and ecosystems and species. To name a few that would be significantly damaged by the building of these highways: Wood Thrush, the Scarlet Tanager, the Black and White Warbler, the Veery and Ovenbird.

I do not support spending my hard earned tax dollars on a project where the evidence that I have on-hand shows that it will have little to no benefit or value.\nUnless the province can independently demonstrate that this bill and the highway 413 project will benefit the people of Ontario, I cannot support the removal of safeguards that ensure this project follows established standards of practice to ensure all Ontarians are getting value for their tax dollar that won't leave a lasting negative environmental and community impact for future generations.\n"

        "comment": "TLDR: By providing alternatives to highway travel to get more people off the road, road and highways will be open to those who need it. By providing choices for alternate travel for rural Ontarians like trains, Ontario can become a more equitable place to live and get around, no matter who you are.\nMultiple studies over decades (2 sources listed below) show that adding lanes of highway only produces more traffic. If it's easier to drive then more people will, and therefore the congestion is ultimately the same. It is instead more effective to provide alternatives to car travel by providing *reliable* and *convenient* modes of public transit like trains, LRTs, etc as well as infrastructure like bicycle lanes. Of course, sometimes driving is the only option depending on where you're going and what you're carrying with you. In which case, if more people take the train or their bike, highways will be less congested with commuters going to the office and be open to the people that need them.\nIf it's easier to take the train to work, why *wouldn't* people use it?\nInstead of building more highways, I'd instead suggest reacquiring the 407, infrastructure that already exists and is severely underutilized.\nCanada is lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to high speed trains and interconnected networks of reliable and convenient transport. Train travel to BC is SLOWER than when it was first built over a century ago. In Germany, there is a train station in every small hamlet creating transportation equity between both rural and urban regions of the country. Rural Ontarians don't need to be isolated from the rest of Ontario.\nWith more choices for travel to suit everyone's needs, we'd make it more equitable for everyone, no matter where you live.\n"

If they all expect to drive cars downtown, there will always be gridlock.

        "comment": "I have lived in Ontario all of my life. Recently, I attended a town council meeting where I live and was shocked to find out about the details within Bill 212. To say that this bill is draconian and terrifying is not an understatement.\nThe fact that this bill impacts so many different pieces of legislation is very scary and makes it very hard to keep track of all the changes that are being suggested and the impact of those changes on our already existing laws. I feel that this bill has been written to be intentionally confusing to be able to push through any project that the Province wants (regardless of what the people who live in the Province actually want) and on whatever timeline the Province wants. This is absolutely not acceptable! MPPs are elected for a reason - and creating legislation like this, that takes away rights of our citizens and completely disregards negative impacts to the environment is not democratic at all!\nBill 212 will take away consultation with Indigenous Peoples about Highway 413.  Given all that has happened in the past few years, I cannot fathom why the Province would think this is acceptable at all.\nThe details in Bill 212 about the expropriation of land are shocking [Building Highways Faster Act, sections 3(1), 9(1)(e), 13(6), 13(9), 13(11)]. This Bill allows police to enter dwellings, land to be taken by force and no opportunity for an individual property owner to be able to appeal the date on which they need to leave their land. Many of the people that own these lands are seniors that have lived on the land for many decades - imagine if you were near the end of your life (or even in a palliative state) and were told you need to vacate your property and all your decades of belongings within 90 days. And you can't even ask for a reconsideration of the timeline. That's not the kind of Ontario that I want to live in. The Province should not be bullying its citizens - that is not democracy, that's a dictatorship.\nThe fines to an individual for obstructing or not vacating the land to be expropriated are shockingly high [Building Highways Faster Act, section 12(4)]. It's a shame that the Province would go to these lengths to advance projects they deem are important (without having the backing of the citizens), but the Province would not take the same action to increase fines for illegal land use (which is a problem all over the GTA). If only the Province would take action to punish the people breaking laws, instead of bullying good and decent citizens - this Province would not be deteriorating as badly as it is.\nThe details in Bill 212 regarding the impact to the environment and cultural heritage are also terrifying. The proposed Highway 413 Act, section 2(1) means that Highway 413 (or any GTA West Corridor project) does not have to follow the Environmental Assessment Act. We have the Environmental Assessment Act for a reason - to protect the environment. To proceed with any project and completely disregard the Environmental Assessment Act should be illegal. The Province should not be writing a Bill to absolve them from following the law. Paving over environmentally sensitive lands and destroying habitats for threatened and endangered species to build a highway that we don't need makes no sense at all.\nWhat I find even more shocking is section 6(4) of the Highway 413 Act - this allows the Minister to not publish studies or updates to studies that contain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters. To me, this means that whatever studies are done, any studies that are negative or the public would not see as positive - these studies would be hidden from the public. What exactly does the Province have to hide here? How is this democratic at all??? Why even bother doing studies at all, if you are only going to accept ones that say go ahead with your project? I don't really know how you can live with yourselves in doing this.\nThe Highway 413 Act, sections 12(1) & 12(2) would allow the highway to go against policies in the Planning Act and Provincial Plan. What is the point of having these pieces of legislation if you are just going to disregard them? And how are municipalities expected to plan their communities if you keep changing the rules?\nSection 13 of the proposed Highway 413 Act removes the ability of the public to participate in anything to do with the environmental assessment process. Again, this is shocking that the rights of Ontarians to have a say in how their land is being used is being taken away. The existing process that involves the public is that way because we are a democracy - our elected officials are expected to follow the laws that are in place - not write legislation to circumvent those laws.\nWhat kind of place is this? The last time I looked, I lived in a democratic country - with this bill, my rights and the rights of all Ontarians would be completely disregarded in order to pave over green space and agricultural land for a highway that this Province does not need. This would also set the precedent for the Province to keep doing this same thing over & over again for whatever project they deem is important (without consulting or considering what the people who elected you actually want). That is a dictatorship - not democracy. You should all be ashamed of yourselves - I don't know how you can proceed with this bill and look your families and your constituents in the eye.\nI ask that the Province scrap Bill 212 and instead, focus your time and energy on following the laws that are already in place and proceeding with infrastructure projects that will actually help this Province and the environment (like investing in public transit and better using the highways that already exist, like the 407 and allowing trucks to use that highway either for free or at a highly discounted rate). You should not be spending your time taking away the rights of Ontarians and destroying the environment - that is not why you were elected. Follow and respect the laws of our democracy - that's what we expect of you.\nA concerned Ontario resident\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern about Bill 212, regarding the provincial overreach impacting Toronto\u2019s infrastructure management, adversely affecting the safety of cyclists and fast-tracking Highway 413 ahead of indigenous consulation and environmental assessment.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I am deeply concerned about the implications of Bill 23 and the proposed Bill 212. The significant reduction in our city\u2019s infrastructure budget due to Bill 23 has already strained our ability to maintain and improve essential services. The additional measures proposed in Bill 212 threaten to further disrupt our city\u2019s carefully balanced infrastructure planning, which is crucial for addressing street space allocation, climate action, affordability, road safety, and overall quality of life.\nI believe that the City of Toronto, with its unique needs and challenges, is best positioned to manage its own infrastructure. The proposed section 195.2 of the Highway Traffic Act represents an overreach that undermines local governance and the ability of our elected officials to serve the interests of their constituents effectively.\nFurthermore, it puts the safety of the cyclists at risk. A 2019 City of Toronto report suggests that nearly  44% of Toronto residents identified themselves as utilitarian cyclists which means they use biking to commute to work, school, shopping or social purposes. Data from the 2016 census indicate that the mode share of cycling in some Toronto neighborhoods is as high as 34%. Copenhagen in Denmark saves an estimated $357 million a year in healthcare costs by encouraging biking instead of driving. With the provincial government wanting to make the best use of taxpayers' money, ensuring safe biking can be an effective way to do so in the long run.\nI urge you and your colleagues to support this motion and advocate for the withdrawal of the proposed section 195.2. It is essential that the Province respects the jurisdiction of municipalities to manage their own infrastructure and address the competing demands of their residents. It is also important to prioritize sustainable transportation modes like biking and ensuring the safety of the cyclists.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I completely oppose Bill 212. The bill is a complete over-reach of legislative authority, poorly thought out, not based in facts or reality. The bill will make the lives of all Ontarians worse environmentally (destroying sensitive lands, species loss, farmland lost, decreasing local food production, etc.) and financially (subsidizing more urban sprawl, taking on more debt to pay for highways, etc.), and less safe (faster speeds, fewer safe roads to bike on, etc.).\nAs a driver, the government should be focusing on making our streets safer by restricting vehicle size and weight, as well as maximum speed and acceleration. Heavier vehicles wear out our roads faster which means more costly, congestion inducing construction on a more frequent basis. Heavier vehicles and faster moving vehicles also result in more severe injuries; the combination of the two factors is deadly.\nAs a driver, I wish that the government would instead restrict the size of vehicles too make more room on the roads for additional vehicle traffic. The average vehicle size in 2013 was 4.45m, but by 2023 that had increased to 5.00m. That means that in a 1km stretch of road you can fit 25 fewer vehicles than just 10 years ago. The result is that on 40kph road, such as Bloor St, 1,005 fewer vehicles per hour can flow through the same stretch of road just on increased vehicle size alone. The over-sized pickups and SUVs have no place in our province unless needed for professional purposes (but even that is a lie, tradespeople in the rest of the world get along fine with smaller vehicles that are more practical and with better visibility).\nAs a driver, I wish the government were serious about clearing up congestion and ban on-street parking EVERYWHERE, all of the time, and require that if on-street parking were allowed that vehicle owners be charge the FULL and TRUE cost of parking. The public subsidization of private property (vehicle) storage needs to end. We do not allow people to store their clothes in our water pipes, and we certainly would not let them do it for less than the full cost of maintaining that pipe. I can\u2019t store the contents of my garage on the road, why should I be allowed to store my vehicle? Especially when it is impeding and reducing the flow of traffic.\nThe BUILDING HIGHWAYS FASTER ACT and HIGHWAY 413 ACT are not needed because we need to stop building new highways, and stop widening existing highways; especially when there is a completely underused highway 407 that could be better used.  We are in a climate crisis and building new highways will only increase emissions (both from construction and road material production, but from more congestion and more kilometres driven). The 407 could be bought and its tolls removed essentially overnight for a fraction of the cost of a new highway (and unlike a 413 would be completed immediately not a minimum 15 years from now). Tolls could be placed on other roads and highways to shift demand away from congested routes.\nStudy after study, and city after city, have shown that bike lanes do not cause congestion. Bike lanes are a part of the solution. Part of the issue is that the government is using the wrong metrics. Roads are meant to move PEOPLE and GOODS, not VEHICLES AND GOODS. So instead of measuring number of VEHICLES moved per hour the better metric would be the number of PEOPLE moved per hour. By measuring by that metric then bike lanes, bus lanes, transit lines, etc. improve those metrics most AND get people out of their cars leaving more space on the roads for others who want or need to drive. People need viable, safe options. As a driver I prefer when roads have dedicated and separate space for motor vehicles and bicycles. It makes both drivers and people who bike much more predictable, and yes, it often forces drivers to slow down. Just because someone used to be able to \u201cget across town in 15min\u201d, does not mean that they should have been able to do so. It just means that previously they were excessively speeding, and are now the being forced to travel the speed limit.\nRequiring Ministry approval for a bike lane is the opposite of red-tape reduction; it is unnecessarily bureaucratic. Limiting a municipality from even marking (painting) a bicycle lane is also extremely petty and vindictive. You are telling me a municipality that has a 5m wide lane and wants to paint a line to denote 1.5m of it is now for bicycles and leave 3.5m for cars needs Ministry approval because it \u201cmight\u201d unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic?\nThe government should also legislate that all self-driving vehicle features should be able to communicate seamlessly across makes, models, and manufacturers. This will allow for vehicles to travel closer together, at faster speeds, with greater safety and efficiency than an unpredictable human driver.\nNew and wider roads are only going to exacerbate and accelerate the impacts on our climate. More and wider roads only induces demand. We are at the point where congestion is a geometry problem. We simply cannot fit any more vehicles into our city cores. We should be focusing on how to reinvigorate our rail lines to rely less of truck shipping, how we can re-establish industry closer to our cities so that we don\u2019t need to ship things across the globe, but make them closer to home.\nThe government should also launch an investigation into why infrastructure projects in Ontario (highways, transit, water, etc.) are so much more expensive and slower than in the rest of the world. There must be illegal collusion and price fixing involved.\nGiven that the government just spent $100 million dollars on satellite internet the portion of the bill pertaining to amending the BUILDING BROADBAND FASTER ACT, 2021 seem irrelevant now.\nI can only imagine the outage of a then Councillor Ford had if a provincial government tried to over-step on municipalities like this back then.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will will not save you time, nor will it reduce gridlock. Below are some major issues with the bill:\n- It is extremely authoritarian. The Provincial government has no business dictating how every single municipality in the province should be building local infrastructure. Municipal governments are elected for that, not the province. For example, they will have power over whether Timiskaming will be able to install a bike lane on a residential street, which is extremely overreaching.\n- It completely ignores the overwhelming amount of research (see a meta analysis of induced demand in the attached link) showing how bike lanes reduce congestion. Induced demand governs traffic patterns, so if there are more car lanes, more people will drive (not the amount that drove under less car lanes). In addition, the people who would've cycled will now use cars instead, further adding to car traffic congestion, and reducing the number of available travel options.\n- The province was dishonest in saying 1% of people use bike lanes, quoting a study for the entire region. On Bloor, University, and Yonge in particular, there are large amounts of people that ride bikes, which is certainly far more than 1%.\n- The province appears set on moving as many cars as possible instead of moving the most amount of PEOPLE as possible, opting for extremely inefficient modes of transport (cars) which take up far more space than bikes and transit. If they really want to reduce car congestion, they should build public transit which is far more space efficient than highways (line 1 moves more people than the 401 daily despite the 401 being 18 lanes wide at its widest point - but a few more lanes will surely solve it instead of building transit, right?).\n- The city of Toronto already paid millions of dollars to install the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University, and even the province reimburses them, those are 100% wasted tax dollars on behalf of the city/province.\nFrom spending $250M of tax payer dollars to expedite sales of alcohol in convenience stores, to bad ideas like the Bradford bypass which will cost billions to save people 10 minutes of travel time between the 400 and 404, which will clog up with traffic within a year or so due to induced demand, to withholding funding to the health sector, etc.\nMost importantly with this bill, they ignore the fundamental concept that the only way to reduce car traffic, is viable alternatives to driving. This government is not representing the best interests of the people, and are wasting our money. As someone who voted for the conservatives in the most recent election, they have absolutely lost my vote. Along with my entire family.\n"

Complete Communities include a full range of transportation options, meaning bike lanes. Removing bike lanes would violate this section. Would Bill 212 override the PPS and, by extension, the Planning Act?\nSecond, there could be delays in the planning process. With Bill 212, a municipality would have to wait for the province to review its application to reduce a laneway for vehicular traffic and decide whether to approve it. This shows that the province does not trust municipalities to use common sense when installing a bike lane. Municipalities either conduct traffic studies or hire consultants to do so. If a bike lane were structurally and politically impossible, a city would not install it.\nThird, with the added delay, some municipalities would decide not to add bike lanes to arterial roads. This could make the streets more dangerous and prompt cyclists to drive or take public transit, increasing vehicular traffic. This would wear the roads down even faster, increasing infrastructure costs a municipality would have to pay.\nThe Province should leave the city planning details to the municipalities and focus on regional objectives.\n"

The solution to traffic gridlock, increasing carbon emissions, and air pollution is absolutely not adding more cars on the road.\nRather than wasting taxpayer dollars removing existing infrastructure that well-used and loved by the public, I suggest investing in more and better transit and infrastructure to support active transportation.\nI use the Bloor bike lanes every day, at least twice, to take my children to school. Without that bike lane in place, we wouldn't feel safe enough to ride. It is the most joyful part of my day to see dozens of other families, children, seniors, people with disabilities, flooding the bike lanes instead of using cars. Many of those people are there because of how hard the City has worked to make cycling safer. The cycling network is a vision of a vibrant, connected, healthy, and beautiful city, and it's saving lives. And, there is no network that exists \"on side streets.\" People on all modes of transportation need to reach the same locations that people in cars do.\nThe provincial government's overreach into municipal jurisdiction, and their intervention into decisions that have been made based on evidence and expert planning, is not welcome here.
