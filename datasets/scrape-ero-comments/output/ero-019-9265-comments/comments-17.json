This Bill is a step in the wrong direction.  Downtown has been congested before the bike lanes were installed, and with the increasing population density, will continue to be congested whether the bike lanes are removed or not.\nI strongly oppose this Bill for numerous reasons.  The data is old and flawed.  Safety is a priority, not having space on the road for a car.  We all need more options downtown such as streetcars, subways, GO train, bikes, ebikes, and walkways.  Many of my nurses and staff use the GO train then the hire bikes to get up University to the hospital.\nI would vote against this government in the next election if this Bill goes ahead.\n"

        "comment": "Hi I know that the government definitely doesn't care about these comments but as someone who grew up in Toronto in the Highpark Area I have always biked 3-4 times a week and the only reason for that was the bike lanes on Runnymede and Annette. I know these aren't proposed to be ripped out but this bill just makes me sad as I along with everyone in the neighborhood uses the Bloor bike lanes. Although I would not be apposed to the Etobicoke Bloor bike lanes being removed I complete disagree with the removal of bike lanes downtown as no matter what there will be traffic and these bike lanes provide us with options and give our city world class transportation. I really hope this bill is reconsidered as removing these bike lanes will be removing this cities progress as a world-class city and will waist so much money. I hope you reconsider this proposal, thank you, as a 18 year old who drives, takes transit, AND rides my bike.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a conservative, my family is conservative, what in the world does this have to do with conservative values? I bike 15km to work year round, my mother worries about me constantly, friends at my Church pray for me because they know I've been hit by cars and that trying to get around by bike and advocate for my safety is incredibly discouraging. The construction of bike lanes is a policy that values human life and gives our children safer streets so that hopefully they will be able to walk or bike to school or friends' houses, something I was never allowed to do since a kid was run over and killed a few streets from my house.\nYou could argue that this bill values reducing congestion over human life, however I cannot find a single real study finding that adding bike lanes increases congestion anywhere in the world. Much less that any city in Ontario, which have built very little bike infrastructure, have experienced increased congestion as a result.\nYou could also argue that this bill values economic growth over human life, however the studies on the economic impact of the Bloor Street bike lanes clearly show that bike lanes there increased economic activity. There's definitely an economic argument to be made that giving families the option to save 10s of thousands of dollars a year on car ownership would be good for the economy.\nThis policy is not backed by any evidence or intelligence, I'm not sure what values the authors of this bill have but they do not value human life, reducing congestion, or economic growth.\n"

These cyclists will either drive and make traffic worse or be on the road where they might get hit and slow down traffic. I'm all for saving time but this is the exact opposite of that. Additionally Highway 413 Will bring even MORE cars on the road that slow us down. How is the government going against its own policies so obviously like that\n"

        "comment": "The Fallacy of Removing Bike Lanes to Reduce Traffic\nIn urban planning debates, the issue of bike lanes often stirs passionate opinions, particularly when it comes to their perceived impact on traffic congestion. Some argue that removing bike lanes can alleviate traffic by freeing up road space for cars. However, this notion overlooks several key factors that demonstrate why eliminating bike lanes is unlikely to reduce traffic and may even exacerbate the problem.\nEncouraging Alternative Transportation\nFirst and foremost, bike lanes play a crucial role in promoting alternative modes of transportation. When cities invest in dedicated bike infrastructure, they encourage more people to consider cycling as a viable option for commuting. Research shows that when safe bike lanes are available, cycling rates increase, which can lead to fewer cars on the road. Removing these lanes would likely discourage cycling, resulting in more cars returning to the streets, thereby increasing overall traffic congestion.\nSafety and Traffic Flow\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to safer roadways for all users. Studies have demonstrated that well-designed bike lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents involving cyclists and motorists. Safer roads encourage more people to ride bikes, which can reduce the number of cars on the road. Conversely, the removal of bike lanes can lead to an increase in accidents and conflicts between vehicles and cyclists, creating a less efficient traffic flow. A chaotic traffic environment tends to slow down overall vehicle movement, counteracting any perceived benefits of increased road space.\nThe Reality of Urban Traffic Patterns\nAdditionally, urban traffic patterns are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the availability of bike lanes. These factors include public transportation options, population density, and the availability of parking. Simply removing bike lanes does not address the root causes of congestion, such as the growing number of vehicles on the road due to population growth and urban sprawl. In many cases, reducing the number of bike lanes can lead to a perception that cycling is less safe and feasible, which may push commuters back into their cars, further exacerbating traffic issues.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations\nFrom an environmental perspective, removing bike lanes is counterproductive. Increased reliance on automobiles leads to higher emissions and contributes to air pollution, negatively impacting public health. Cities that prioritize cycling as a legitimate form of transportation can reduce their carbon footprint, improve air quality, and promote healthier lifestyles. This aligns with broader goals of sustainability and livability in urban areas.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the idea that ripping out bike lanes will reduce traffic is a misconception rooted in a simplistic understanding of urban mobility. Rather than alleviating congestion, the removal of bike lanes can discourage cycling, create unsafe road conditions, and fail to address the underlying factors contributing to traffic issues. For cities aiming to manage traffic effectively, investing in comprehensive transportation solutions that include bike lanes is essential. By fostering a multi-modal approach to transportation, cities can create more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly urban environments.\n"

        "comment": "As a car commuter, I am deeply opposed to this proposed bill. This bill would make commuting worse given that it would remove viable alternatives for people to use instead of driving, which will induce more demand for car travel and lead to higher congestion and travel time, the opposite of what this bill intends to achieve.\nBy limiting or outright removing the limited bike infrastructure that exists today, this bill has the potential to undo much of the progress that Ontario has done to increase mobility and sustainable transport from the last several years.\nI advocate that more bike lanes should be built, not removing them. Cyclists should be able to safely travel to their destinations away from car travel while remaining on main roads. Especially as a driver, I prefer for cyclist to be removed from traffic given that accidents involving cars and cyclist can often lead to unnecessary fatalities.\nGiving people access to safe bike lanes to use is not only beneficial environmentally but also helps families save money as a cheaper means of transportation and provides greater mobility to people with disabilities. This government should seek to give more options to people commuting to work, school and shopping, not lock them into only a single viable means of transportation.\nWhile some people may argue that the bike lanes are underused, I believe that that is mainly due to the fact that our bike networks are in their infancy and ridership will continue to grow as complete, car separated bike networks begin to be accessible to a larger population as opposed to the patchwork of unconnected and unprotected painted bike lanes we have currently.\nI would invite members of the legislated assembly to try biking on any major road to understand why so few people choose to cycle there due to safety concerns.\nIn summary, I am opposed to this proposed bill as this would increase red tape for municipalities, decrease the safety of cyclists on our roads, increase congestion and travel times for the majority of Ontario and be a step back for the progress we need to make towards reducing our environmental impact.\n"

Please do not allow this to happen so that we can continue progressing towards a more sustainable, accessible city for all and not set us back a decade. Thank you\n"

I also personally depend on bike infrastructure provincially and believe that this bill will not only make my life harder but put my safety at risk when it removes and stops the construction of infrastructure that would allow me to commute and travel safely. I also encourage law makers to ask themselves what they believe that this bill is going to achieve for Ontarians since if the goal is to improve the car commuting experience that potentially other constructive rather than destructive initiatives might be more effective.\n"

I am a cyclist, pedestrian, and I own and drive a car. The current bicycle infrastructure is helping grow more confident cyclists, and more cyclists mean less cars on the road, easing congestion. This is a common sense approach. Do not remove current bike lanes and eliminate choices in getting around the city. That would be going backwards. It\u2019s also showing a blatant disregard for cyclists\u2019 lives.\n"

        "comment": "Six cyclists were killed in Toronto this year. Does the premier and his government want this number to rise so he can save a couple of minutes on his commute to Queen\u2019s Park? The bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University are essential parts of Toronto's cycling network. Removing them would force cyclists onto the road, putting their safety at serious risk.\nResearch worldwide shows that bike lanes reduce congestion and improve safety in cities the size of Toronto. This plan is rash and dismisses the research entirely. It seems to cater to drivers looking for a quick, uninformed fix\u2014ignoring that removing bike lanes will barely reduce commute times and will jeopardize both cyclist and pedestrian safety.\nAdditionally, this is not an area for the provincial government to decide. Toronto's elected officials built these bike lanes for the residents of the city. Doug Ford and his government were not elected to manage municipal transportation. Instead, perhaps the provincial government should focus on fixing our broken healthcare system\u2014something squarely within their jurisdiction and something they were actually elected to address.\n"

        "comment": "This bill cannot be allowed to pass. The proposals for removing our most important bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge Street, and University Ave represent an atrocious waste of public funds, will add more traffic to Toronto\u2019s core, and cost lives.\nBike lanes are safe, offer faster routes for more people to commute through the city, and are growing every year in use. Every cyclist that uses the bike lanes is one less car on the road, they alleviate congestion, limit pollution, and offer safe healthy transportation means as a option for the vast majority of commuters through the city. We just finished construction in these routes!!! DO NOT TEAR UP OUR ROADS AGAIN.\nThese lanes will continue to see growing use as the data shows. City residents need to be able to bike safely through the city, not everyone has a car and if you force more people to drive all the time the roads are just going to get way more congested! There\u2019s already no parking to support the current amount of cars driving around. With our population exploding this is going to get worse and worse. This bill is a shame, and an emotional proposition that ignores what the real outcomes will be for all commuters.\nIt\u2019s a giant waist of our tax payer dollars - OUR money! This will take us back decades to a time when cyclists were getting run over and killed regularly and the people pushing this through should stop and really think about the lives they will cost when there are no safe bike lanes along our main corridors. The roads will simply fill up with more cars without alternative transportation methods. Commute times will not improve.\nBike lanes increase access to local businesses and business grows with bike lanes. Not the opposite.\nCars can use the side streets!!! Anyone that drives (myself included) knows to use the barren side streets.\n"

        "comment": "This bill does not reflect a common sense approach to congestion in Ontario. The only solution to traffic is making sure people have solid alternatives to driving. Transit is one way to reduce traffic, but so are bike lanes. Whether or not we remove the lanes in downtown Toronto, people will still cycle. The only difference will be that they will be much more likely to get hit and killed by a vehicle. I am a suburban Ontarian who primarily drives, but I recognize that adding more cars to the road will only make traffic worse. Please reconsider this bill and the awful long-term effects it will have on the cities and towns of Ontario.\n"

Me and my family would definitely bike more, including those streets that are mentioned in the bill, if there was a reasonably safe and adequate infrastructure for cyclists. Currently, it\u2019s not. Rather than removing the lanes and creating red tapes and bureaucracy, there should be proposals to improve and modernize bike infrastructure which will also make it safer for car drivers. When I drive, I do want cyclists out of the way and it should be done by introducing more proper bike infrastructure not removing it for the sake of the cars. Bike lanes are essential for the city of Toronto.\n"
