        "comment": "First, removing existing bike lanes constitutes both a massive waste of money and a blatant misuse of government power. I am one of a multitude who would much rather see tax revenue devoted to critical areas, such as health care.\nSecond, bike lanes reduce the scourge of bike accidents. The less accidents there are, the more willing people will be to use bikes.\n(Admittedly, cyclists can be irritating and hypocritical when they glide past stop signs and ride on sidewalks. But this is a false argument used far too often to counter proponents of cycling. These breaches of etiquette and the law by cyclists are no more prevalent than are drivers who block intersections, engage in \u201crolling stops\u2019 or make unsafe lane changes.)\nThird, studies have shown time and again that jurisdictions which encourage bike use become steadily less congested. Advocating for cycling is a natural companion of promoting the use of public transportation. Both result in there being less automobile drivers out there to become frustrated and potentially reckless. I might also mention that it is financial folly to spend vast amounts of money on constructing subway and LRT lines, only to fall short when it comes to motivating people to use them.\nIn University-Rosedale riding, 8.3% of people bike regularly, thanks in part to our evolving bike infrastructure. What is really needed are effective public education campaigns that contrast the use of public transportation, biking and walking, to the teeth-gritting experience of inching along in congested traffic inside vacuum-sealed, polluting metal boxes (if you\u2019ll excuse the hyperbole). A spectrum of decisions involving transportation could be made and aligned by a government that chose to apply rational thought, study and foresight.\n"

        "comment": "I have several major concerns with Bill 212 and associated acts and request that you reject this bill or amend it to address my concerns. I have attached a document summarising my concerns and proposing solutions. Briefly:\n1) Highway 413 will not reduce gridlock and is only predicted to save drivers ~ 30 seconds per trip. An Advisory Panel that reviewed the corridor for MTO concluded that there are more effective ways to reduce gridlock. Highway 413 should be stopped\n2)  Highway projects in Bill 212 will have wide-reaching and long-lasting environmental effects that will increase risk to residents, municipalities, and Ontario. For example, the 2013 Toronto flood cost an estimated $1 billion and the 2024 flood cost an estimated $940 million. Removing green space in major watersheds will increase these costs by increasing the probability and severity of flooding events at a time when climate change is increasing the frequency of severe precipitation events. Ignoring these, and other effects by exempting projects from the EAA is bad business. The assessment and construction of priority Highway projects must be subject to the Environmental Assessment Act.\n3) Bill 212 undermines the public trust by disenfranchising Ontarians of their property rights without an option for independent appeal or legal remedy, and puts the Minister in direct conflict of interest.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a physician working in Toronto who uses the university and Bloor west lanes nearly every day to commute to hospitals on university avenue. These lanes are essential for not only physicians but cyclists all over the city. The data being cited that these lanes worsen congestion are incorrect. The subway construction is what is worsening congestion and this is widely known by members of the community. The misrepresentation that bike lanes are worsening traffic is egregious. If you remove these lanes you will only worsen traffic and place both cyclists and motorists in danger.\n"

It is not economically efficient to try to stuff large personal vehicles into downtown Toronto, it heavily restricts the maximum number of people who can travel and therefore how productive the city can be. We should be concentrating on improving bike lanes & public transport to let people move around more efficiently, cheaply and sustainably, not building more freeways.\n"

Destroy there cities with more cars, more pollution and fewer cars.\nWe have known for almost 40 years how to fix our transportation systems and this goes against everything we know. This bill is failed 1960s American planning. More roads, more cars, more traffic, more congestion, more pollution, more time wasted, more money wasted.\nFix health care or get out of government and stop working against the public interest. Nobody who lives in these areas wants this.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 70 year old resident of Ottawa and take many trips by bicycle, for the sake of my health and fitness, to reduce carbon emissions and congestion, and for the efficiency of not having to find parking in crowded city spaces.  Bike lanes make such cycle commuting safer and more attractive than having to contend with full-on car traffic.  Does my provincial government really want to discourage this, even take it away from me?  Has there been any reference to studies in many jurisdictions around the world which demonstrate that bike lanes reduce congestion, and that more and wider roadways induce demand and increase traffic?\nPlease reconsider this ill conceived legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Adding new lanes to roads (or building new highways) will provide temporary relief from congestion/gridlock, but will not adequately solve the problem long-term. Induced demand is a well-observed phenomenon - new roads and road expansions will encourage drivers to use said roads more often, as well as draw in new drivers from further away. Within a couple of years, the average commute time will take just as long as it did before Highway 413 was built. The project will be a waste of time, money, and green space.\nSimilarly, preventing the construction of bike lanes will keep bike ridership levels low across the province, which will discourage commuters from making the switch from car to bike (which would take cars off of roads and reduce congestion!).\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m currently on the fence about this issue. While I typically support bike lanes, I strongly oppose the northbound bus/bike lane implemented in Old Ottawa South from 2:30 to 5:30 PM. This change eliminates all parking on both sides of Bank Street for two hours, which puts our local small businesses at significant risk. From my own experience, I know that a lack of parking can severely impact these shops.\nIt seems the city made this decision without conducting proper studies or engaging in meaningful consultation with the community and local shops. I believe a more effective solution would be to have the bus/bike lane operate northbound in the morning and southbound in the afternoon, aligning with rush hour and promoting a safer commute.\nIf it weren't for this particular issue, I would likely  oppose the impending bill However, I am concerned that the city may not be fully considering the consequences of these decisions on our traditional Main Street neighbourhoods. I would advocate for a more comprehensive consultation process that takes into account the needs of our local businesses.  Small shops are almost extinct and we need to protect them before we all have to drive to the malls and big box stores.\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen of Toronto and Ontario, I find this Bill reprehensible.  Congestion will not get better if we can't get people out of cars, cycling is an environmental (reduced local pollution and carbon emissions) positive and a health positive.  Now you want to waste money by undoing money already spent by our elected local officials.  It is just mind blowing.\nWe also have to factor in the safety of our families.  My daughters routinely biked to their high school along a bike lane, and were able to do safely.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this ineffective, wasteful and deeply undemocratic action that will also imperil the lives of our citizens\n"

        "comment": "I'm strongly opposed to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable. They are also good for local businesses. Think of any neighbourhood first as a place for people to live in, not an obstacle that a car has to be able to drive through as fast as possible. Removing bike lanes, and even sidewalks since we're at it, won't be able to accomodate all the traffic needed if we all decide to drive. If you really want to solve congestion in big cities invest in public transit, a good network of bike lanes, and establish flexible tolls on roads and a congestion charge downtown.\nThe requirement that municipalities seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic is a blatant overreach by the provincial government into matters that should solely reside with the municipalities. If this is not savage micromanagement and rampant red tape I don't know what else is.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion, instead making it worse. The Greenbelt lands are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. They also add to the quality of life of the many Ontarians who like to enjoy spending time in nature. The solution to getting people around from places far from major urban centres to the downtowns of major cities such as Toronto should rely on a solid and sustainable backbone of public transit. Unlocking new lands for suburban sprawl is a solution that does not scale as evidenced by the gridlock that this bill will not in the end reduce.\nI would like to invite the Ford government to go back to the future and leave the 1970s behind. That model for urban development has reached the end of the road. As per the famous line: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned that Bill 212 will increase gridlock, lead to unnecessary infrastructure, and waste the tax dollars of hard working people in Ontario. Decades of science has shown that building more highways induces demand for highways rather than improving travel times.\nA summary from the City Observatory describes how increasing road capacity \"generates a proportional increase in traffic, with the effect that congestion and travel times quickly return to (or worsen from) pre-expansion levels\". Given how bad the congestion already is and the many other priorities for tax dollars, Ontario cannot afford to expand highways.\nIn addition, removing existing cycle tracks and lanes seems reckless - both for public safety and responsible spending of public dollars. For example, after cycle tracks were installed in Toronto, there was a 38% reduction in collisions along tracks and 35% reduction in the streets around them. This benefit to Ontarians doesn't even account for the health benefits of actively moving and the congestion and cost benefits of saving car trips.\nI hope the Ontario government will focus on improvements to the transport infrastructure that will be more responsible use of tax payer dollars and help everyone who's on the road. There are innovations such as congestion charges, dedicated public transit lanes, and regional rail that are used widely in other countries but completely missing in Ontario.\nThere are many other sources to point to the same issues:\n1.
