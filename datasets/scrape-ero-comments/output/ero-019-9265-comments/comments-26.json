        "comment": "This bill is made in flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of Ontarians and the wishes of those who live here. The bill proposes loosening environmental standards for highway 413 construction to allow for faster construction of a highway we don't need. Construction of this highway will cause immense environmental damage to our precious green belt and lead to more development in the area. We already have a second highway to help reduce 401 traffic and building another one to connect to the 400 will only lead to more congestion in the long term. Another issue is municipal bike lanes. I have no idea why roadway decisions are any business of the provincial government. Adding more lanes does not make traffic better, it never has and never will. All it does is provide more incentive to drive. It is a DRAMATIC OVERSTEP of provincial power to tell cities what is good for their roads. The cities build and maintain them and the provincial government should have no say in what happens with them. What makes this worse are ideas of removing existing bike lanes. This will not reduce congestion. This will not make a certain unnamed Premiere of Ontario's commute to Queens Park shorter. It will only make roadways more dangerous for cyclists and waste taxpayer money on removing infrastructure that was just put in. These bike lanes are getting plenty of use every day, businesses in the annex BIA want the lanes to stay because it brings in more customers, they even warn that removal of the lanes could be disasterous. The majority of people who live or work anywhere near the bike lanes want them to stay. Please take into consideration the pleas of everyone who knows the damage our cities sprawl has caused damage to our lives and livelihoods. Ignoring the importance of our greenbelt for the sake of saving time and building more car infrastructure and destroying existing infrastructure that carries thousands of people everyday will do nothing but cause more damage to Toronto and the greater GTA.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider this policy.  I am a resident of Toronto and use these bike lanes frequently.  They are important to my safety, and then safety of those around us.  Removing the bike lanes does not mean there are no longer bikers on the road, it just means that we are now going to be mixed in with the cars and there is going to a much higher risk of fatalities and accidents for both sides.\nI supported Doug Ford in the last election, but passing this act will lose you my vote.  City bikes lanes should be managed by the municipal government, who was voted in by the people who live her to represent them.  Please leave city bike lanes for the municipality to manage.\n"

        "comment": "This issue should be handled by individual municipalities, and not at a provincial level.\nRemoving bike lanes not only will not solve the issues with gridlock, but will most likely increase the number of cars on the road. making the gridlock worse, even with the extra lane, if it adds on at all.\nBike lanes are for the protection of cyclists, and if there are networks of them, to get around towns and cities, more people would use them. Removing them does nothing but increase traffic, pollution, and risk to cyclists.\nThe solution to grid lock is increasing access to public transit, increase bus routes and how often the busses are running. Making the tickets and access to it much more affordable and inciting for drivers to hang their keys up, and hop on a bus/train/tram instead. The only solution is reducing the cars on the road. Not endangering cyclists who use the bikelines this bill will remove. Not adding another lane.\n"

        "comment": "Subject: Strong Opposition to Bill 212 and Proposed Removal of Bike Lanes\nDear Members of the Ontario Legislature,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, particularly the provisions that would allow for the removal of existing bike lanes, including the newly built lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets. As a daily bike lane user, I have witnessed the positive impact these lanes have on our community, providing safer spaces for cyclists and promoting a more livable city.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets are essential not only for ensuring the safety of cyclists but also for improving the overall traffic environment. By incorporating greenery and making the roads feel narrower, these lanes effectively slow down car traffic, encouraging drivers to be more cautious. This design approach enhances the safety of all road users and contributes to a more sustainable urban ecosystem.\nIt is particularly disheartening to see how the mentality of our leadership can undermine progress. In \"Fordnation,\" Doug Ford openly expresses his disdain for bike lanes, revealing a narrow perspective that prioritizes his personal commute over the broader needs of our community. His reasoning\u2014that he dislikes seeing bikes pass him while he sits in traffic\u2014reflects a selfish and simple-minded approach that is not conducive to effective policy-making. It is troubling that such views are allowed to shape transportation policy in Ontario, leading to decisions that ignore the growing demand for cycling infrastructure and the benefits it brings.\nIt is vital to recognize that the removal of these bike lanes would undermine the progress we have made toward creating a safer and more accessible city. Instead of reducing our cycling infrastructure, we should be focusing on expanding and improving it to encourage more residents to choose cycling as a viable and healthy transportation option.\nFurthermore, transportation policies should be grounded in sound evidence and scientific principles, ensuring that decisions reflect the needs and safety of our communities. I urge the government to reconsider the implications of this bill and prioritize the protection and expansion of our cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,\na Phd from University of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I read the proposal for highway 413 and I do not approve of it\nWe have lost too much biodiversity and species in Ontario already, and we are about to witness the extirpation of the red side dace and critical wetland habitat if we go ahead with this highway. We have laws that protect endangered species, but those laws mean nothing if we disregard them. We will be no better than countries that exploit their resources that we judge on the world stage.\nThe way I see the proposal is 1 of 2 options.\nOption 1 -\tWe build the highway, in 10 years we will be just as congested as before, we will need to build a new highway and expand the 413 on even more critical habitat to stop even more congestion. We will make a mockery of our Endangered Species Act and prove to the world we don\u2019t care about our wildlife. We will have extirpated the red side dace and pushed even more endangered species that much farther to the brink. The worst part of it will be when our kids and grandkids go to the ROM with us and ask us \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have these fish anymore, what happened and didn\u2019t we know better\u201d and all we can do is look at ourselves in shame and tell them \u201cwell we could have done something but we wanted to build a highway instead\u201d.\nOption 2 -\tWe don\u2019t build the highway, we will have more congested streets but we will find solutions like everyone has when they are given any problem. We protect the endangered species that we promised we protect and stand up to our word. We leave the critical habitat for these species and still have them on our landscape. The best part about it is when we can tell our kids \u201cWe saved a species from going extinct and I left a better place for you than when we found it\u201d\nI'm not just some hippie, I voted for Ford. I have worked blue-collar jobs since I was 14. I enjoy every second I am outside, and I love the environment, it will be a shame if we lose even more species than we already have.\nI don\u2019t think we should build this highway. We need to stand by our word and protect the endangered species and our critical habitat. Every problem will have a solution and this highway is not the only solution to this problem. Let's lead by example and show Ontario we care about the environment, and not look at it as it is ours to destroy.\nUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot. Nothing is going to get better, It's not.\nDr Seuss\n"

        "comment": "Removing already installed bike lanes is a huge waste of money, they were installed for a reason. If there was a concern about them before that should have been flagged BEFORE, so we're not spending money twice for no reason. Work with the city, not against.\nMore traffic lanes does not mean less traffic or less congestion, has been proven many times, see 401 or any highway as examples.\nThis is going to end up as more red tape, more government involvement in what should be local city decisions. The province can have an opinion, and offer their input based on data. Does the province have information the city doesn't showing that installing the bike lanes would have a negative impact on the community? Note traffic includes bikes and anything that uses the bike lanes, pedestrians, and drivers alike, not just vehicles.\nThis will turn into delayed approvals and construction where it's needed. Does the government not have anything better to do than nit pick where bike lanes get installed?\nIf there is such a concern about traffic/ congestion, they should increase the fees developers have to pay when construction sites take over lanes of traffic and side walks. It's all over the city, for extended periods of time, and has a huge impact on congestion and pedestrian safety. Allowing private companies to limit/ eliminate the city's use of public spaces and infrastructure for their gain and convenience is a serious problem, especially given all the development in the city.\n"

It will also adversely affect the watersheds of the Oak Ridges moraine. A new highway 413 will encourage more urban sprawl which will in turn put pressure on local agricultural operations.\nInstead of a highway located so far north of the east-west routes between Windsor and Montreal, the money should be spent on paying truck tolls on highway 407 to makes better use of existing highways.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill. The province has provided no evidence that congestion of our roadways is attributable to cycling infrastructure or to cyclists. It is irresponsible to create major policy decisions that impact the safety of cyclists without evidence and continually model city planning on outdated notions of car supremacy that simply will not work for a city the size of Toronto. The proposal is fiscally irresponsible as many of these cycling lanes were long term investments and would require millions to remove - and inevitably more time and resources to re-install when a new government takes office, which will create never-ending construction that will actually lead to congestion.\nOntario should not get involved in municipal infrastructure decisions. The politicization of cycling infrastructure only reveals the cyclical and shortsighted thinking of this government.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

Are you going to remove parking? (As parking is often built into the bike lanes). If you are removing parking, then you have now taken away parking while generating demand for more cars. If you intend to keep parking in these lanes, then what's the point? They will be used for parking, and nothing else. Lastly, even if you open the lanes for driving, cars will stop temporarily, increasing lane switching (which drives up the chances of crashes), while doing nothing to remediate congestion.\nLastly, I do not support the policies by which the Ontario government is intending to bypass the environmental studies for the 413 Bradford Bypass. Those pieces of land are critical for animal life and agriculture, and the intent of this building to bypass that shows the smoke and mirrors happening with this Bill.\n"

Furthermore, these areas is the headwaters of thousands of people's drinking water, and a lack of environmental assessment puts their drinking water and hence their health in jeopardy.\nAs for schedule 4, the power to remove bike lanes is a question truly of life and death for the bike commuters of Toronto. Many Toronto bicyclists will bike regardless of lanes, but their removal will put the many cyclists at risk of collision and death on their daily commute. Giving cyclists their own lane protects both cyclists and drivers from the risk of collision.\n"
