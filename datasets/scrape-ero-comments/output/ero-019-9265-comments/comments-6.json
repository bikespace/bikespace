We already have a big invasive species problem that's seeping into our natural areas from disturbed ground, we do not need to add more by building unnecessary highways (the solution to traffic is not building more lanes or highways to further incentivize car use). Having grown up in Vaughan it hurt to see the nature I grew up loving being turned into development, and this bill may take those valuable spaces away to young children in addition to disrupting the environment.\n"

We should be working on making biking and other car alternatives more appealing to get more cars off the road, not encouraging more cars in a space that isn't built for it.

After several projects since 1950 on 401 alone, we all circle back to congestion, and somehow \"more lane\" is still the only solution.\n2) Drop the \"continue to work with communities\" promise. It's disingenuous, to say the least, right after you threaten to \"override most municipal by-laws that might prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to the priority highway project \"\n3) Better yet, drop the entire highway thing and build infrastructures that work, e.g high speed rail, you know, the thing that has been historically proven to work by connecting the entire continent of North America.\n4) If that's too grand or too slow, do something with 407\n"

        "comment": "I am a family doctor living in Toronto. There are so many reasons why bill 212 is foolish and ill-advised:\n1. Decreased Physical Inactivity and Its Health Implications\nCycling provides accessible, low-impact exercise that many people incorporate into their daily routines. For some, biking to work or school is their primary way to stay active. Removing bike lanes makes it less safe and accessible, discouraging this habit. Without safe cycling routes, fewer people will choose to bike, leading to worse health outcomes across the population and higher healthcare costs. Further, active transportation, like biking, has been linked to improved mental health outcomes by reducing stress and anxiety. Families, children, and individuals with mental health challenges are particularly impacted by the removal of a peaceful biking alternative.\n2. Pollution from Increased Car Traffic:\nFewer bike lanes results in more car traffic (this is well studied and documented), leading to higher levels of air pollution. This could aggravate respiratory issues such as asthma, bronchitis, and allergies. Patients who are especially sensitive to air quality, including children and older adults, will face worsened symptoms.\n3. Exacerbation of Climate-Related Health Issues:\nMore car usage contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, worsening climate change. With extreme weather events on the rise, people are experiencing heat stress, and air pollution issues that aggravate health conditions, particularly in urban settings.\n4. Higher Risk of Traffic-Related Injuries:\nWith fewer designated bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries. As a family doctor, I see the real effects of these injuries\u2014sometimes leading to lifelong complications or fatalities. Promoting safe, active transportation like biking reduces reliance on vehicles, which in turn lowers accident rates for motorist, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n5. Accessibility and Equity\nBiking is an accessible and low-cost form of transportation, crucial for low-income families who cannot afford a car. By making cycling less safe, the city will alienate these community members and increase reliance on public transit, which can add to their financial burdens.\n6. Well-Documented Link to Congestion:\nFinally - research consistently shows that removing alternatives to cars, such as bike lanes, increases road congestion. When people lose safe, viable options for active transportation, more individuals turn to cars, adding strain to already busy streets. This congestion leads to longer commutes, increased emissions, and more idling cars.\n"

        "comment": "Yes, congestion in Toronto really is at a crisis point. A shared frustration about traffic might be the only thing that unites downtown Torontonians, 905ers, and everyone in between. But this legislation is incredibly foolish, and will only serve to make congestion worse by holding people back from shifting away from car-dependency.\nThis move concentrate power in the MTO so that Queen's Park can choke off new bike lanes, ostensibly as a tactic to tame congestion, offers no solutions to the problem at hand. Setting aside the many public health, affordability, economic, and climate benefits of active mobility infrastructure; and setting aside the gaslighting, power-grabbing, and politically divisive strategy behind the government's agenda and messaging on this issue; the ultimate impact of this policy is to make congestion worse.\nThat\u2019s because, time and time again, in cities all over the world, the only thing that has ever led to long-term improvements in urban car congestion is giving people viable alternatives to cars. That's not up for debate. That's just how traffic works. Again, I'm talking about car congestion. In order to get cars moving, we need to shift people to other, more efficient modes. Indeed, the simplification of our roads to prioritize one mode \u2014 the car \u2014 over all others is what got us into this mess in the first place. More of that same approach will only entrench the dynamics of the current crisis.\nWe could \u2014 and should \u2014 have a deep, academic, evidence-based discussion about things like induced demand and network effects \u2014 two concepts that are critical to understanding how our infrastructure can actually get people moving \u2014 but the simpler point is this: in a crisis, you don't take options off the table, and you don't limit your toolbox.\nAnd bike infrastructure is a really great tool! Depending on the study, a bike lane have been consistently shown to move anywhere from 4 to 12 times as many people per hour as a car lane, while taking up half as much of the road\u2019s cross-section. With such limited space to work with on any given downtown street, we simply can\u2019t afford not to take advantage of that level of performance. And because we\u2019re focusing on downtown areas, with speed limits in the 30-40 km/h range, bikes tend to move just about as fast as cars \u2014 especially after accounting for time spent waiting at red lights, when everyone moves at the exact same speed. The existing bike lanes that this bill targets are the only reason I am able to move through downtown with any speed, and breaking away from car dependency is the only reason I am able to afford the life I live.\nAre bike lanes perfect? No. Are they effective in every context? Certainly not. The thorough debunking of the myth that bike lanes cause the kind of congestion we\u2019re seeing in downtown Toronto has revealed the exact opposite: in urban settings, bike lanes eat congestion for lunch. And yet, this bill offers no solutions to a process the government claims is 'broken'. It only promises to slow down the growth of our cycling network by forcing projects to clear one more hurdle: provincial approval.\nSo, what might we do instead to break this soul-crushing pattern of gridlock?\nHow about, instead of taking away a tool, we unlock a new tool? Or better yet, get more use out of a tool we already use? In a recent episode of The Agenda all about the crisis at hand, the panel expressed unanimous support for the expanded use of automated enforcement to improve traffic flow immediately by enforcing existing rules \u2014 because even with fines for infractions like \u2018blocking the box\u2019 rising to $450-500, the deterrent effect is practically zero if it's not enforced consistently. The consensus was that, if we could prevent a handful of bad drivers from spoiling the commute for everybody, we could do a lot of good in a short amount of time.\nAnybody who\u2019s ever sat stationary through a whole green light wishing swift retribution on the nimrod who was too anxious to follow the basic rules of the road can surely support sending that guy a ticket in the mail. So, why can't we make that happen? Because automated enforcement is heavily restricted by \u2014 guess who! \u2014 the Province. And the Province holds all the power to un-restrict it.\nIf this government were actually interested in improving the flow of traffic, they would be bringing solutions like expansion of automated enforcement to the table, instead of taking away good (if imperfect) solutions like bike lanes. Given their unapologetically pro-car (and, by extension, pro-congestion) track record, I'm not optimistic they will change their tack. But maybe, just maybe, some of those voters from the 905 stuck in gridlock, at intersections blocked by cross-traffic, on roads that don't even have bike lanes, might see through the rhetoric, see the lack of progress, and take their frustrations to the ballot box. One can only hope.\n"

        "comment": "Local by-laws exist for a reason; local government knows what is required in their area. This act is yet another instance of the provincial government trying to circumvent established procedures in the interests of private profit, with no thought to the knock-on consequences for Ontario in the future. Environmental assessment must be preserved, and property expropriation should follow the current standards. The infrastructure proposed is unnecessary, and stands to profit associates of the provincial government in ways that contravene the principles of anti-corruption. If the government wants to improve infrastructure, it should repair the infrastructure which is already in place. If it wants to reduce congestion, it should spend more money on public transportation infrastructure. Improving service on the GO train is one way in which car use could be minimized. Additionally, greater monitoring of highway speeding would reduce congestion caused by accidents.\n"

Bike lanes also allow me to continue getting around my Ontario city without needing to buy a car, providing assistance during this province-wide affordability crunch.\nThis legislation has no data or evidence to support the claim that bike lanes cause congestion.

        "comment": "I've worked in Transportation Planning for over 20 years, and there's a common misconception that widening roads and building new roads will reduce congestion. In fact, it always makes it worse in the long term. Ontario's proposed Bill 212 won't reduce gridlock, and won't save commuters time. I strongly oppose Bill 212. Hwy 413 will lead to more urban sprawl, people moving further from their jobs because of the perceived new travel savings in the short term, leading to more vehicles kilometres travelled and more congestion in the long term. It is the black hole of highway widening. And it comes at great cost to society.\nInduced demand is a non-intuitive concept, but an important one. Building more roads leads to more traffic. This doesn't mean we should never build roads, but we must take a more holistic approach and consider the entire transportation system. This includes encouraging active modes of transportation and public transit. There is no way to relieve congestion if the quantity of vehicles on the roads continues to increase. Car travel is extremely space inefficient. We need transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "Good day.\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212 that aims to reduce bike lanes and centralize control over cycling infrastructure development, taking this authority away from municipalities.\nAs a concerned citizen and advocate for sustainable urban planning, I believe this bill would be detrimental to our communities for several reasons:\n- Safety Concerns: Reducing bike lanes will compromise the safety of cyclists, potentially leading to an increase in accidents and fatalities. Dedicated cycling infrastructure is crucial for protecting vulnerable road users.\n- Environmental Impact: Discouraging cycling by removing safe infrastructure goes against our climate goals. Bicycles are an eco-friendly mode of transportation that helps reduce carbon emissions and air pollution.\n- Public Health: Cycling promotes physical activity and improved public health. Removing bike lanes may discourage people from choosing this healthy transportation option.\n- Local Expertise: Municipalities have a better understanding of their specific local needs and challenges. Centralizing control may lead to one-size-fits-all solutions that don't address unique local circumstances.\n- Economic Benefits: Bike-friendly cities often see increased foot traffic to local businesses and improved property values. Removing cycling infrastructure could negatively impact local economies.\n- Traffic Congestion: Well-planned cycling networks can help alleviate traffic congestion by providing alternatives to car use, especially for short trips.\n- Community Engagement: Local cycling initiatives often involve significant community input and engagement. Centralizing control may reduce opportunities for citizen participation in urban planning.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and instead focus on policies that support and expand safe cycling infrastructure. We should be empowering municipalities to create more bike-friendly cities, not hindering their efforts.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\n"

        "comment": "I am hardly an activist, nor am I of any particular political bent, nor am I prone to hyperbole, but I feel forced to comment on this proposal.\nIt is appalling - starting with the cynical name of the bill.  There is no evidence that building more highways reduces congestion.  Numerous studies have shown that any relief is temporary.   Usage will gradually increase to the new capacity.  A ten percent increase in highway capacity will lead to a ten percent increase in vehicles on the road.\nAs this is the ERO comment site, I would suggest that there are only environmental downsides - chewing through the Greenbelt and agricultural land,  both for the highway and the land used for urban/suburban sprawl, as well as the increased number of cars on the road and their attendant emissions.\nSadly, there are no upsides.  And it goes way beyond environmental concerns.  This bill will not achieve its stated purpose.  In fact, in the long term it will likely make things worse.  The government cannot be unaware of the numerous studies that show real, effective ways of reducing  traffic congestion (See attachment) - none of which include building more roads.\nIn this light, a more appropriate name for the proposed bill might be \"Reducing Responsibility - paving the way for our friends the developers to get richer quicker\".\nSorry for the cynicism.  I would welcome some advice on how to see it any other way.\n"
