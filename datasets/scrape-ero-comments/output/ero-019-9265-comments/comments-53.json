        "comment": "In my opinion, what Ontario needs is not additional highways, but a more robust public transit system.\nIf the various municipalities were willing to cooperate more on constructing interconnected rail transit systems that allowed those from the outskirts to have easier access to other regions WITHOUT requiring the use of a vehicle, its safe to assume there would be less reliance and strain on the highway system as it exists currently.\nAdding more highways will not solve the issue, and will ultimately end up being expensive to maintain in the future.\nwith personal transport vehicles(electric scooters, bikes, evokes, etc) growing more in popularity, I believe it would be best to pivot and build infrastructure supporting those modes of transportation, rather than the inefficient and space consuming cars.\n"

        "comment": "I seriously believe Bill 212 should rethink the notion of taking away bike lanes in Toronto. By removing bike lanes, you are taking away a safe avenue for many Torontonians' commute. Removing will not reduce congestion.\nIf anything, by logic, by removing a part of a road to favor cars, it will just put more vehicles and cars on the roads. By having a diverse landscape of transportation, it supports peoples' choice on how they want to commute. Therefore, with more people using bike lanes over their cars, there will be less congestion, as some may opt to use their bicycles over cars.\nAdditionally, some residents in Toronto, like myself, cannot afford to own a vehicle. Using bike lanes is ESSENTIAL to getting around the city. Many rely on bikes lanes top be kept safe while on busy roads, like Bloor St West. It is insensitive to assume that every person in Toronto stands on equal footing, and would benefit from taking these away in the name of reducing congestion.\nBy having bike lanes on these major roads, it is an act of fairness, and an act of choice. Taking that away, leaving people stranded, is unfair, and that is not what a leader of Ontario should be doing to its people. It shouldn't be about what's beneficial for one mode of transportation, but instead a balance of both.\nBiking is physical activity. Its good for the environment, keeps people healthy and happy through exercise, and many who cannot afford cars rely on it. By taking bike lanes away off major roads and intersections, you and endangering those who choose to ride bikes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a parent with a young child and commuter to unequivocally oppose Bill 212. This short-sighted bill prioritizes drivers over the long term needs of Ontarians. As someone who both drives and cycles, it is imperative that we facilitate as many bike lanes being built as possible while supporting the construction of feasible public transit. Overwhelming data from Europe shows that adding additional lanes only means that people drive more. As a shift away from fossil fuels becomes more critical than ever, this bill only incentivizes further damage and destruction to our environment while simultaneously making it more dangerous for people to opt for climate-friendly transportation  (like cycling and taking transit). This bill is disgraceful and future generations will pay the price for refusing to act on well-established pro-climate decisions.\n"

        "comment": "RE: Opposition to Bill 212 Specific to the Building of Highway 413\nI am writing on behalf of Town of Caledon Council to share our opposition to significant elements of the proposed Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. Specifically, we object to the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (Schedule 2), which infringes on the rights of residents whose properties are impacted by the construction of Highway 413.\nMore than 45 per cent of Highway 413\u2019s length spans Caledon. Residents with properties in the 413\u2019s Focused Analysis Area have ostensibly had their land uses frozen since the project\u2019s initiation in 2007. Family farms could not expand knowing they would never recover their capital investments before expropriation. Several homeowners could not sell due to market rate suppression due to speculation of future expropriations.\nNow, Bill 212\u2019s expedited timelines to take possession of resident\u2019s lands needed for this priority highway will leave those residents vulnerable and potentially unhoused. Resident rights during the construction of Highway 413 must be upheld. To that end, Caledon seeks the following changes to the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (Schedule 2):\n\u2022\tRevise the expropriation provisions to ensure clear and fair compensation that may help minimize disruption for affected residents, small businesses, vulnerable groups, and low-income communities.\n\u2022\tRemove the punitive, first offence fines of $50,000 plus $10,000 for each additional day that will be imposed on individuals who struggle to find appropriate alternate housing within the expedited timelines permitted by the Bill.\n\u2022\tRemove Section 13.6 which authorizes entry into the private dwelling of a Caledon resident and the use of force to take possession of their land.\nIn addition, Caledon also seeks these additional revisions to Bill 212:\n\u2022\tRestore comprehensive environmental assessments that evaluate the impacts on water sources, ecosystems, wildlife, noise, air quality, and local habitations.\n\u2022\tStrengthen provisions in the Bill that protect water sources, forests, and other natural resources from the adverse effects of highway construction, ensuring that such policies are integrated into highway planning.\n\u2022\tCreate independent oversight bodies to monitor the execution of highway projects to ensure the projects are aligned with the public interest and promote Provincial accountability and transparency.\n\u2022\tProvide legal and planning frameworks for land-use planning surrounding the highways to prevent further legal implications and zoning issues that may arise from unregulated developments around new highways.\n\u2022\tRevise the Bill to include clear and accessible processes for public participation to ensure that any changes to land use, zoning, or environmental regulations are subject to appropriate legal scrutiny.\nWe are registering this opposition with the Environmental Registry of Ontario before the November 20 deadline.\nSincerely,\nplease see attachment for full details\n"

        "comment": "If the Premier is committed to reducing commute times at all cost without referencing any data to support his decisions, he should probably just outlaw traffic lights, stop signs, and pedestrian crosswalks next. Surely these trite pieces of infrastructure are not worth the increased travel time to the suburban car commuters that the Ontario government seems to value above anything else.\nWe have plenty of data that shows that the best way to reduce traffic is to invest in other methods of transportation. Why are we wasting time and money on backwards policies like this instead of investing in existing alternative transportation infrastructure? Give this money to the TTC, stop building highways at the cost of the environment, and let's leave city bikelanes alone.\n"

If your highway is as great as you say it will be why not back that up with some facts before you build it to prove so?\nPlanning to take land from suburbanite owners is NOT cool either.\nRemoving and prohibiting bike lanes WILL cost so much money and have so many negative consequences (safety for ALL road users, cause immediate & future congestion, limit transportation options for people, promote more environmental destruction / pollution, limit safe cycling infrastructure for commuters, utilitarian cyclists and recreational cyclists trying to connect to trails, kids, families, etc.)\nThis is a municipal issue outlined in many municipal Acts. Are you revising all the acts? Why create more red tape when you created a ministry to get rid/limit red tape?\nThis is NOT COMMON SENSE. If it were you would have actual fact based information to share with the public and do you due diligence to make an informed decision instead of using your feelings to justify horrible actions because you simply feel like it.\nTry to improve lives in Ontario, not make them worse.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should not be closed because they are essential for promoting safe, sustainable, and equitable transportation. Closing bike lanes forces cyclists to share the road with vehicles, significantly increasing the risk of accidents and discouraging people from choosing biking as a mode of transport. Bike lanes also reduce traffic congestion and environmental pollution by encouraging the use of bicycles instead of cars. Furthermore, they support healthier lifestyles and provide affordable transportation options for individuals who may not have access to other means. Eliminating bike lanes undermines city efforts to create inclusive and accessible urban infrastructure that prioritizes safety and sustainability for all road users.\n"

Taking away bike lanes to prioritize vehicles will not solve the gridlock problem. You cannot solve a problem with the same thinking that created it! Please find alternative ways to support and incentivize non-motorized vehicle options and flexible work environments and schedules.

I purposefully don't drive (and instead bike or transit everywhere) and a big reason is to help make this city a better place. I am 30 years old and I have more and more friends who are turning to cycling over driving because it is the faster more enjoyable way to commute. We need to be pushing this type of thinking if we want to create a city that is greener and more enjoyable to live in.\nSome good points from Dave Shellnutt of The Biking Lawyer:\n\"EMS vehicles are not delayed by bike lanes in getting folks to emergency rooms as confirmed by the City of Toronto\u2019s EMS leads.\nThere is not a petition of 50,000 people against the bike lanes on Bloor. It\u2019s more like 13,000 who\u2019ve signed over several years now and Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition in support of bike lanes is approaching that number in just weeks.\nBike lanes are good for business! They boost sales in areas they are installed, attract higher spending clientele, can increase property values, and even attract talented work forces.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion, they move people around more efficiently, create safer driving routes (less collisions, less congestion), and get people out of single occupancy motor vehicle, which actually are the cause of congestion.\nSide streets are not the answer. Unconnected segments of bike lanes that force cyclists to take circuitous routes on various side streets will not encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes;\"\nBuild a city that is better for all! Not just drivers. Driving is a privilege and not a right, and should be treated as such. Congestion should not be our biggest concern. Get people out of their cars and into our city! We do not build communities stuck in gas guzzlers. Don't spend our tax dollars on removing the things that make this city a wonderful place to live in.\n"

Just this year, six cyclists were killed on Toronto\u2019s streets.\nOntario should not be limiting municipalities - Instead of restricting municipalities\u2019 ability to install bike lanes, we should empower them to make decisions that reflect the realities of their communities. Each city should be able to create a transportation strategy that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and accessibility for everyone \u2014 not just motorists.\nThe proposed legislation is counter-intuitive and would undo years of non-partisan work to build a bike-lane network within the city of Toronto that protects cyclists throughout the city.\n"
