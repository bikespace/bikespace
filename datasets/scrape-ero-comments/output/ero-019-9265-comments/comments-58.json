        "comment": "I ask that you please leave the Bloor and University bike lanes in place. And trust the elected councillors of the City of Toronto to decide if changes should be made.\nI live with my family in the High Park area. My wife and I, who are both over 50, ride bicycles to work every day. My daughter rides to high school in Parkdale and last summer, biked to various locations around the city to her job which was at different sites. My son used the Bloor lane to bike to school north of Bloor West Village until he graduated. I take the waterfront trail to Front and Spadina all year round. There are no decent TTC options to get there. My wife takes the Bloor lane to her job at Yonge and Bloor as long as it is not icy. It takes her 30 minutes to bike door to door - but to reliably arrive on time using the TTC, she must set aside one hour and fifteen minutes EACH WAY and often it takes longer.\nWe are also the owner of two cars and drive several hours each week to commitments across the City, eg Sunnybrook Park and Avenue and Lawrence. Our extended families live outside Toronto and we must drive to see them too. As regular drivers, we understand and share the frustration of gridlock and would like to spend less time in traffic. But we see no correlation between bike lanes and being stuck in traffic. For the last few years, Bloor Street has been reduced to singles lanes for construction at the rail crossings, Mirvish construction site, and for road repairs between Bathurst and Avenue. These are all valuable projects but they cause(d) very lengthy delays and congestion. I also regularly encounter shorter delays caused by drivers stopped or parked in a lane of traffic. Finally, the most delays occur on streets without bike lanes. Bike lanes are not a significant cause of delay within the City.\nWe have regularly biked on streets without bike lanes. It is frequently terrifying, particularly when cars are moving at high speed. You must have the statistics and have seen the many ghost bikes marking where cyclists have been killed by drivers. Please add cyclist and pedestrian safety to your criteria if you decide the province will take on these decisions.\n"

        "comment": "I am hoping that Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria will move Bill 212 forward because the City of Toronto has fallen prey to the cycling advocates and only serves this minority. My other primary issue and I did notify the city of my concerns, and I asked them for a copy of the disability assessment they were required to do at the onset of this project when they decided to make a massive change to the use of space and access in the City and they did not do one. I sent the city of Toronto numerous pictures and videos evidencing how the new lanes for parking were limited for people like myself who have physical disabilities and require reasonable access. I often use a cane and must exit on either side of the vehicle into fully live traffic, either cyclists if I am a passenger and also speeding e-bikes and scooters and none in a bike lane will ever stop for anyone trying to get out of a vehicle they just scream and say move it or hit their bell- it's horrible and this is to elderly and visibly disabled people forced to step into live bike lane traffic over a cement barrier. The other concern is the amount of accessible parking the city removed for bike lanes, it's over 40% and for those of us who cannot move freely this is a lot. The other issues are during the winter when the city clears the snow for bike lanes and I notified the city that 6 ft high snow banks made it impossible to exit as a passenger and there were no mid block breaks to get to the curb. The city told me, knowing I used a cane, to walk several blocks in the snowstorm on the street in live traffic to get to the end of a large block on Danforth Ave. This is the way the city views disabled people and bike lanes. Also at St. Mikes all but one spot vs. the two blocks at the emergency for a trauma hospital have been removed for bike lanes and ambulances are frequently stuck getting to the hospital after exiting the DVP and trying to get up Gerrard St. Exit to go to the trauma unit due to bike lanes. Police, Fire and Ambulances are trapped on all streets because cars cannot pull over and in Toronto we are left with one single lane and then foreign people new to Canada who don't care about road rules and driving uber simply block the lane and sit there- it's utter chaos. The city and their people they rally around say bike lanes don't cause traffic- it's not true, they have. Our population has increased 17% in the last 10 years and in 2021 when the pandemic happened we had traffic, but nothing like this. Now that the city has put in all of these horribly designed bike lanes we are at a complete standstill and we simply can't go anywhere. We didn't get millions of people in a year and a half and those who did come in are low wage earners per the federal guidelines, they are the e-bike users and not a large volume of car drivers so the only thing that is causing the traffic jams are that every single street in Toronto is one lane only from two due to bike lanes, no advance green lights being used so cars just sit there trapped due to bike lane barriers and often streetcars will block intersections causing you to sit in a car for up to 6 light changes and not go anywhere while traffic builds for blocks and blocks- it's utter insanity and this mayor has ruined the city. Worse the city of Toronto does not have a disability advocate on staff who works on projects but rather has a very vocal bike TO advocate who is paid with tax dollars to swing the public opinion and provide unequal views at any meeting, again not fair and not how government decisions on projects should be made. Hospitals, main arteries and any street with a streetcar should not have a bike lane. I ask you to consider Dundas Street and Adelaide Street East the two streets downtown that both link up to the DVP. They should be free of bike lanes. Most certainly Dundas St should never have had a bike lane because it's widely used to get to the DVP and with the streetcar traffic is often backed up from River Street to just west of Jarvis solid bumper to bumper and this is what prompts the extended TTC streetcars to then pull up and block intersections like Sumach and Dundas, which because of the bike lanes prevents anyone from turning right and then just forces a giant traffic jam and blocks access to parking garages. It's a total horror show. I also find it appalling that the city of Toronto is dragging out BIA reps who are political jockeys and not the hard working business staff who have lost business and this was evidenced by the store owners on Bloor Street West who said they have a loss of business since the bike lanes went in. The arrogance and bravado of this mayor to ignore them is the problem we have in Toronto and I do not know one person who thinks the bike lanes are a good idea. I also talk to the store owners, bar and restaurant owners all along Danforth and they all say the bike lanes coming out of the pandemic destroyed them and they lost even more money they they could absorb. This is telling and you can see what was once a thriving city with cute busy stores where you could go pick up  a large load for your home and drive it home, you are now prevented from doing so- clearly this hampers business owners and no one is riding on their bike to go buy large items and then hop back on and ride off into the sunset. All the Mayor has done is to wage a war on the car and ignore an aging city and ignore disabled people with her bike lane agenda. The city of Toronto councillors have also failed to identify their connections with bike lobbyists which is clearly a conflict of interest when the lobbyists have so much pull in this city and my question is who is getting a kick back at city hall over this bike lane business?  The city of Toronto should never have continued with shoving in bike lanes once they knew there were concerns raised about disability access and they knew going back to 2022 there were concerns, but they ignored them. The city has taken away parking from people on Broadview ave by randomly adding a bike lane at Cosburn northbound to Pape and has then threatened to close two full streets one going north and one going south to make each fully bike only access- again another fully unbelievable move as people own homes and have cars on all of these streets. People have families and need to use their vehicles and the city arbitrarily just decides to slam these in and on Broadview the planned building will further compound reduced lanes the mayor has now created, grinding this area and turning it into a total circus. It's also an issue because when the DVP has road closures Broadview is the secondary road along with the Bayview Extension and when the Bayview Extension floods Broadview again is the secondary road used and this city fails to ever consider these things just like they fail to consider the massive builds and massive road retstrictions with the subways that are already in play. All we get is a very underwhelming city response where it's so clear this mayor doesn't care and doesn't consider anything else going on and has an agenda that aligs solely with lobbyists but doesn't serve the majority of society. I am asking the Premier and Member to ensure the Bill moves forward and that they remove the majority of the bike lanes and look at a strategy to move them into the city bike trail system and free up our roads. What we will see is an immediate reduction in traffic. All that has to happen is remove the white pickets and repaint the roads, this is not the cost the mayor is saying. Also we need to have clarity if she is tossing out these numbers as to what she has wasted on this poor design. Lastly I would like to close with the design of these bike lanes is flawed and not natural. Cars parked obstruct the sightline of the bikes and when turning it's almost impossible to see anyone in the bike lane while looking for pedestrians also crossing, those who simply walk out into traffic and then oncoming traffic. It would have made more sense to have cars remain where they were beside the curb as drivers were already used to looking out for bikes and put any lane on the outside. Again all of this is such poor design and function it should be scrapped. I believe once this is fully viewed the Premiers office will be able to safely say the park system is where these should have been originally put with key intersections into the city thus leaving the majority of the streets free and clear and disability access must be at the forefront of the minds and not excluded and all concrete barriers that are knee high and all concrete bollards must be removed due to tripping hazards and design must be redone with a disability consultant involved. I have tripped when using a can exiting a bike lane on to the city sidewalk bays due to the ice and the city of toronto simply doesn't care. This is a recipe for disaster and litigation waiting to happen due to negligence.\n"

        "comment": "One main concern for the passing of Bill 212 is, fundamentally, it's exemption of certain projects from the Environmental Assessment Act, which has the following purpose: \"The betterment of the people of the whole or any part of Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the environment.\" Not only does the Environmental Assessment Act mandate that assessments include information about expected impacts to the affected environment, potential impacts, and the actions necessary to mitigate damage, which allows for a critical consideration of potential habitat destruction for native species and species at risk, it also mandates that information in Environmental Assessments be made available to the public for review. Bill 212 implies that the public which may be directly or indirectly affected by these projects may not be notified or fully informed of the impacts of these projects, and removes the voice of concerned Ontarians from the planning process. This removes the ability of the public to share their concerns for a project, and their opinions on whether or not the advantages of the completion of these projects outweigh the disadvantages, thus taking the ability of Ontarians to determine whether or not we feel these projects are necessary, or effective to remedy highway infrastructure challenges. This could also severely impact certain species at risk, including Jefferson's Salamanders and various species of turtles that rely on the wetlands that will be affected and divided by these projects.\nIn addition, the important role of wetlands in natural flood control could be severely impacted by these projects. The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time, and Building Highways Faster Act lists it's purpose as \"to expedite the construction of priority highway projects by streamlining and supplementing existing processes in order to alleviate delays to the timely completion of such highway projects.\" While on a surface level this may seem to be a matter of efficiency, one could wonder how it may affect the carrying out of important processes that ensure longevity of the infrastructure and proper construction. Will this leave room for cutting corners on assessments for the purpose of building a highway faster? Current policies and assessments allow for critical consideration and investigation of potential factors that may impact the efficacy of the proposed infrastructure. Drawing on incidents of flooding on the Don Valley Parkway since it's construction, it seems counter productive to have a policy in place that, at it's core, cuts corners in favour of faster construction, considering that faster construction will not make a difference if the construction is flawed in a way that makes these highways unusable or ineffective at remedying the traffic issue, such is the case with the Don Valley Parkway after instances of heavy rainfall.\nI urge those deliberating on this Bill to sincerely and serious consider the negative environmental impact that these acts could have on the areas affected by the currently proposed projects, but also how it could affect areas that could be the site of similar projects in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nAs a resident of Mississauga, I strongly oppose Bill 212. Municipalities across Ontario have invested significant resources in developing bicycle lanes, which are increasingly being used by residents, including myself during the summer months. Expanding and improving bicycle infrastructure is vital for several reasons: it promotes health and well-being, provides affordable and sustainable transportation for those who cannot or choose not to own a car, and helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile cities around the world are moving towards prioritizing active transportation, passing Bill 212 would push Ontario in the opposite direction. Focusing solely on highway expansion undermines efforts to create vibrant, livable communities where people can rely on safe, accessible, and eco-friendly transportation options. Instead of doubling down on highway development, we should prioritize infrastructure that encourages active transportation, such as protected bike lanes, pedestrian pathways, and transit-oriented projects.\nI urge the government to reconsider this bill and focus on building infrastructure that aligns with global trends and community needs, making Ontario\u2019s cities more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient. I've attached the OPPI's comment on the Bill as it consolidates essential points that I stand by.\nThank you\n"

A world class city, focuses on efficient urban design, safe neigbourhoods/streets for pedestrians and tackling climate change through a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nI am born and raised in Toronto, and I am fortunate to have also travelled to other parts of the world, primarily Europe where my grandparents reside. While I understand Canada is much larger in geographical area than that of countries in Europe (or even Europe as a whole) I see the benefits of incorporating bike lanes in the city.\nWe don't even half to look far, when looking for improved state of life of residents, for example Montreal, who are taking a lead in building bike lanes to get people moving around the city. I am against the proposal and urge the province not to interfere with the design of municipal areas, specifically regarding bike lanes, as there are numerous health benefits and congestion relief benefits to bike lanes. Further studies should look into the air quality effects of idling, however removing bike lanes and adding back a lane for vehicles will only result in more traffic and more cars on the road via \"induced demand\".\nOne thing to note, is that building bike lanes is not sufficient enough to reduce gridlock, as improvements in transit systems must also be made to ensure there are safe and reliable options for citizens. While cities in the West were primarily designed for cars, numerous studies show that this is not sustainable for the future of mobility as populations grow and more people move to or live in the city.\nUpdating street designs to make it more safe for pedestrians, removing spaces for cars in certain areas, adding various modes of mobility all have a place in our discussions today for a better state of living for future generations.\n"

        "comment": "As I navigate through our modern urban landscapes, I am increasingly disheartened by the car-centric design that dominates our cities. This infrastructure, which prioritizes automobiles over people, not only impacts the environment and public health but also perpetuates ableism, marginalizing those with disabilities.\nThe Predominance of Car-Centric Design\nCar-centric design has become the default mode of urban planning in many parts of the world. This approach prioritizes the convenience and mobility of car owners while often neglecting the needs and safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users. Wide roads, expansive parking lots, and urban sprawl characterize this paradigm, creating environments that are challenging and sometimes even hostile for those who do not or cannot drive.\nImpact on People with Disabilities\nFor individuals with disabilities, car-centric urban design poses significant barriers to accessibility and independence. Many people with disabilities cannot drive due to physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments. In a car-centric city, this means they must rely on public transportation, walking, or cycling\u2014all of which are frequently underdeveloped or unsafe in such environments.\nInadequate Public Transportation\nPublic transportation systems in car-centric cities are often insufficient, infrequent, and poorly connected. This inadequacy forces individuals with disabilities to navigate long distances to reach the nearest bus stop or train station, which might not be wheelchair accessible. Furthermore, the lack of reliable transportation options can severely limit their ability to access employment, education, healthcare, and social opportunities.\nChallenges for Pedestrians\nPedestrian infrastructure is another area where car-centric design falls short. Sidewalks, if they exist, are often narrow, uneven, or obstructed by parked cars and other barriers. Crosswalks may be few and far between, and traffic signals rarely allow sufficient time for those with mobility impairments to cross safely. These issues not only endanger individuals with disabilities but also discourage their participation in everyday activities.\nExclusion of Cyclists\nCycling can be a viable transportation option for some individuals with disabilities, particularly those who use adaptive bicycles or tricycles. However, the lack of dedicated bike lanes and the dominance of car traffic in car-centric cities create a hazardous environment for cyclists. This exclusion further limits the mobility of people with disabilities, reinforcing their dependence on cars or inadequate public transit.\nAbleism in Urban Planning\nThe ableism inherent in car-centric design is a critical issue that needs addressing. By prioritizing the convenience of drivers over the needs of all city residents, urban planners effectively marginalize those who do not fit the mold of an able-bodied car owner. This exclusionary approach disregards the diversity of abilities and modes of transportation that make up a truly inclusive society.\nSocial and Economic Implications\nThe social and economic implications of ableist urban planning are profound. When individuals with disabilities are unable to access transportation, they are often cut off from job opportunities, education, healthcare, and social interactions. This isolation can lead to increased unemployment, poverty, and social alienation, perpetuating a cycle of marginalization and inequality.\nThe Need for Inclusive Design\nInclusive urban design is essential for creating equitable and accessible cities. This approach involves prioritizing the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users, and ensuring that all infrastructure is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Wide, well-maintained sidewalks, frequent and accessible public transportation options, and safe, dedicated bike lanes are key components of inclusive design.\nMoving Towards a More Inclusive Future\nTo move towards a more inclusive future, we must shift away from car-centric design and embrace urban planning that considers the needs of all residents. This transition requires a commitment from city planners, policymakers, and the community to prioritize accessibility and inclusivity in all aspects of urban development.\nPolicy Recommendations\nPolicy changes at the local, regional, and national levels are necessary to promote inclusive urban design. These changes might include:\n\u2022\tImplementing strict accessibility standards for all new infrastructure projects.\n\u2022\tInvesting in the expansion and improvement of public transportation systems.\n\u2022\tEnsuring that pedestrian and cycling infrastructure is safe, well-maintained, and accessible.\n\u2022\tConsulting with individuals with disabilities and disability advocacy groups in all stages of urban planning.\nCommunity Involvement\nCommunity involvement is also crucial in the push towards inclusive urban design. Residents can advocate for more accessible infrastructure, participate in public consultations, and support policies that prioritize the needs of all city dwellers. By working together, we can create cities that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, car-centric design is not only environmentally unsustainable and detrimental to public health, but it is also inherently ableist. By prioritizing the convenience of drivers over the needs of individuals with disabilities, we perpetuate inequality and exclusion. It is time to rethink our approach to urban planning and embrace inclusive design that considers the diverse needs of all residents. Only then can we create truly equitable and accessible cities where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\n"

        "comment": "Why I Oppose Bill 212 and the Push for Highway 413: A Case for Sustainable Infrastructure\nAs an regular cyclist and a resident of Scarborough, I have experienced firsthand the challenges posed by inadequate cycling infrastructure. My father, who recently began using an e-bike for shopping and errands, shares these concerns. Bill 212, which seeks to restrict the installation of bike lanes, and the proposed Highway 413 project, threaten to exacerbate these issues, undermining Ontario's environmental, economic, and social well-being.\nThe Case for Bike Lanes\nBike lanes are more than just pathways for cyclists; they are vital components of a safe and connected community. Bill 212's restrictions on bike lanes overlook the clear benefits these structures provide. Research indicates that protected bike lanes can reduce road fatalities and serious injuries by up to 50% (sciencedaily.com). They safeguard cyclists, encourage active transportation, and improve safety for all road users.\nIn Scarborough, the lack of cycling infrastructure is particularly pronounced. Many bike lanes have been removed before they could form a cohesive network, leaving cyclists like my father and me to navigate busy streets without adequate protection (cycleto.ca). This absence not only discourages cycling but also poses significant safety risks.\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to local economies. In Toronto, the Bloor Street bike lanes led to a 49% increase in cycling, making it the second-highest bicycle facility by volume in the city (torontomu.ca). Cities that embrace cycling infrastructure have demonstrated that these investments lead to thriving, walkable communities. Removing bike lanes, as proposed under Bill 212, would dismantle these gains and impose substantial costs\u2014up to $48 million in Toronto alone\u2014for benefits that are, at best, uncertain (toronto.ca).\nLocal communities and businesses have expressed concerns about the removal of bike lanes. The Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) in Toronto stated that removing bike lanes would be \"disastrous to the neighbourhood,\" highlighting the role of bike lanes in promoting local commerce and community well-being.(toronto.citynews.ca)\nEncouraging cycling through dedicated infrastructure contributes to environmental sustainability and public health. A study published in BMJ Public Health reported that cycling commuters had a 47% lower risk of early death and a 10% lower risk of hospitalization compared to those who drive or take the train. (nypost.com) Bike lanes also play a critical role in combating climate change. Encouraging cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions, eases traffic congestion, and lessens our dependence on fossil fuels. To strip communities of this vital infrastructure is not only shortsighted but also counterproductive to Ontario\u2019s environmental goals.\nHighway 413: A Step in the Wrong Direction\nThe push for Highway 413 epitomizes outdated thinking that prioritizes cars over communities. This proposed 52-kilometre highway would destroy 2,000 acres of productive farmland, pave over critical wildlife habitats, and disrupt the watersheds of the Humber and Credit Rivers (environmentaldefence.ca). It\u2019s a textbook example of how not to build for the future.\nHighway 413\u2019s environmental toll is staggering. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated to generate 17.4 million tonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions, undermining our commitments to combat climate change (environmentaldefence.ca). While proponents argue that the highway will reduce congestion, decades of research on induced demand show that building more roads simply encourages more driving, perpetuating the cycle of gridlock.\nFrom an economic perspective, Highway 413 is equally flawed. At a projected cost of $10 billion, the highway represents a massive public expenditure with questionable returns. Instead of building new highways, why not optimize existing infrastructure? Highway 407, for example, remains underutilized. Subsidizing truck tolls on this route could alleviate congestion without the environmental and financial costs of a new highway (environmentaldefence.ca).\nA Better Path Forward\nOntario doesn\u2019t need more highways or fewer bike lanes. What we need is investment in sustainable, inclusive infrastructure. Public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly streets offer far greater returns, fostering vibrant communities while addressing the pressing challenges of climate change and urban sprawl.\nIf we are serious about building a livable future, we must reject Bill 212 and resist projects like Highway 413. These proposals cater to outdated, car-centric paradigms that have proven to be both costly and unsustainable. Instead, let\u2019s champion solutions that prioritize people, planet, and prosperity.\nTogether, we can build a better Ontario\u2014one that values innovation, community well-being, and environmental stewardship. It starts by saying no to Bill 212 and yes to the infrastructure that will truly move us forward.\n"
