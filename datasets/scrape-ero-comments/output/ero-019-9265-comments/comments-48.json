        "comment": "Removal of existing bike lanes is a gross overstep of provincial authority.\nIt needs to remain under the purview of the city/local planning and the City is the best suited to handle this.\nThe City is the one with the vision, the LONG term plan, and the DATA and statistics supporting how bike ridership has been continuously increasing with every year after a bike lane on a given stretch is implemented. That's more people out of cars and less cars on that stretch to creat congestion. Win win.\nClaims that businesses suffer with bike lanes is also completely false. The province is only citing anecdotal evidence and it's simply not true. Talk to boor Street BIA - business has increased. Remember, people don't want to walk along, and shop along, a highway centred around cars. Inviting public spaces drives PEOPLE traffic (not car traffic) into the area and makes them spend more money.\nBike lanes only on secondary routes is absolutely not a solution. They need to be in addition to, not instead of.\nI challenge the province to find any continuous side road immediately parallel to Bloor where bikes lanes are proposed to be removed. It doesn't exist in Toronto's street fabric. This is another clear example where the province has not informed themselves and is just hastily pushing this forward without any critical thinking.\nSo far all claims I've seen to date made by the province and the Minister of Transportation as evidence to why removals of Bloor, University and Yonge bike lane is warranted, is flat out false, and/or misleading.\n1.2 % are bikers is entirely false. That census data includes so many GTA car centric suburbs which significantly dilutes the numbers of users in downtown Toronto where these bike lanes are.\nIt's imperative the province realizes there absolutely cannot be enough road space available to have every single person in Toronto and GTA drive for every trip they make. It's was never possible and shouldn't be possible because one would want to live in a place where that is possible because it would be just massive highways everywhere and nothing else.\nBuild bike lanes, and people will come. This results in less emissions, more people getting around using a significantly smaller portion of the right of way per capita than cars which helps the provinces case in lower congestion.\nBuild road capacity for cars and people will come - this is law of induced demand. A principle that has been proven over and over again here and all around the world. Building more road space for cars DOES. NOT. SOLVE. CONGESTION.\nThe public should not need to teach the government on how this works.\nThe province seemingly chooses to have traffic engineers only look at the modelling in the first year or so after implementation of increased road capacity to see that it briefly lowers congestion, but fails to analyze all the years after; how congestion will be just as bad, or worse. Increased capacity will just bring out more drivers into the road. It's a never ending cycle therefore capacity does not solve congestion.\nI work for a transit agency in Ontario and am proud to be working on solutions and bringing new transit lines to fruition - getting people out of cars and where they need to go, faster and more conveniently.\nTransit and active transportation is a crucial and long term plan with a lot of different pieces and capital needed over time to make a comprehensive network, and the province is exclusively looking very short term which undermines and destroys the years of long term planning the City has done.\nThe province seems to be making opinion based decision instead of evidence based decisions, relying on personal opinion and anecdotal evidence, to try and justify this as opposed actual planning experts (not just traffic engineers).\n"

        "comment": "Friends and Families for Safe Streets is a group whose loved ones were struck and killed by a motorist, and people who survived being struck with severe life-altering injuries. We are unwilling experts on the human toll exacted by dangerous road design, and car-centric laws and public policy.\nWe are appalled to see our government attack safe streets. The complete streets that Doug Ford wants to rip out would have saved our loved ones\u2019 lives, by preventing the collisions that killed them entirely, or by reducing driver\u2019s speed to something survivable.\nBy prohibiting municipalities from building safe streets, the sole outcome of passing Bill 212 is that more people will be violently killed in crashes that would have otherwise been prevented. It is unconscionable and unforgiveable that this government is openly trying to get more Ontarians killed.\nLast year in Ontario, 616 beloved Ontarians were senselessly killed in crashes. Their families and wider communities were devastated. 36,090 Ontarians were injured, ranging from minor to life-threatening injuries. Between 2015-2023, 5216 loved people were killed in car crashes. A jaw-dropping 392,904 people were injured, ranging from minor to life-threatening injuries. That is a devastating amount of carnage, grief, anguish, and loss. In a province with such a shockingly poor road safety record, it is perverse to destroy safe streets, and prohibit municipalities from making road safety improvements, effectively prohibiting them from saving their own residents\u2019 lives.\nDoubtless, countless experts in many fields will weigh in with research and studies to demonstrate that Bill 212 is a wasteful travesty. What we can offer is our unwilling expertise in abject suffering in the aftermath of senseless road violence, of losing a loved one or nearly losing a life in a preventable crash. This Bill will directly cause: more funerals, more anguish and grief, more tear-filled days and nights, more irreparably shattered families and communities, more empty chairs around tables, more joyless holidays, more silent bedrooms in homes, more children without their parents, more parents without their children, more bloodstained clothing and wallets and wedding rings handed back in paper bags, more isolation, more devastation, more lives destroyed, more brain injuries, more spinal cord injuries, more jobs lost, more people living in poverty and unhoused, more lifelong chronic pain, more strain on our overburdened health care system, more trauma to bystanders, more fear, more white-hot rage at the callous injustice, more cruelty unleashed on people who did nothing to deserve it.\nThe reasoning publicly stated for Bill 212 is perverse, insulting, and a callous slap in the face to the thousands of people in Ontario grieving their loved ones. Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria has said he wants to give people more time with their families. What about the thousands of families across Ontario who can\u2019t spend time with their loved one, because their loved one was killed in a preventable crash? How can anyone spend time with their family when they are struck and killed by a motorist? What about all the families of those who will inevitably be killed where this government rips out or prohibits safe streets? If Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria wanted to guarantee families more time together, he would act to build safe streets across the province instead of ripping out the safest streets. You can\u2019t spend time with your family if you are killed in a crash.\nLet us share what it is like in the aftermath of road violence. First, the police unexpectedly call you or show up at your door and deliver the news that shatters your world and your heart into millions of pieces. You are brought to the hospital where your loved one is, whether they are your spouse, child, parent, brother or sister. You have to see them lying there, dead, to identify them. Your heart breaks with the care the health care staff took to clean the blood up for you, even as you see the spots they missed. Or your loved one haven\u2019t died yet, and you are helplessly trapped at their bedside in horror and desperation, begging any possible higher power for them not to die, until they eventually succumb to their injuries.\nYou receive your loved one\u2019s belongings handed back to you in a paper bag. Wallet, keys, maybe a wedding ring. You receive back your loved one\u2019s torn, bloodied clothing. You are paralyzed for years, struggling to decide what to do with it.\nYou are thrust into planning a funeral. You probably didn\u2019t have a chance to ask what your loved one\u2019s preferences would be, because they were killed so suddenly and so long before their natural death would have occurred. Burial or cremation? Secular or religious ceremony? What are you supposed to do? What if you do the wrong thing?\nYou are left with an empty chair at your family\u2019s table. Your family holidays are subdued and bleached of joy. There is an empty bedroom that simultaneously is silent while also screaming at you. What do you do when your loved one\u2019s scent fades from their clothes and sheets, and the meagre comfort you drew from that withers away? What do you do with the furniture? The trinkets and memories? What do you do with the photographs on their walls?\nYou might receive support from your community in the early days. But it falls away gradually, until you feel forgotten. People move on and think you should have gotten over it too, but there is still a gaping hole in your heart that you carry around every second of every day.\nYou are subjected to legal processes that are shockingly hostile and insulting. If the driver who struck you or killed your loved one is charged at all, it is likely a trivial highway traffic act infraction. The value of human life is reduced to a small fine, a few hundred dollars maybe, and a few demerit points if you are lucky. You are utterly denied any sense of justice, while the driver who devastated you is allowed to keep driving and put more people at risk. Having recently voted down Bill 40, Moving Ontarians Safely Act, 2023, Conservative MPPs will be very familiar with the lack of consequences for at-fault reckless drivers who kill and severely injure others.\nTHAT\u2019S what happens in road violence. It is not just numbers. It is not abstract. It is gut-wrenchingly real and it destroys lives. This is the fate that will be inflicted on more Ontarians if you move forward with Bill 212. It is infinitely worse than being stuck sitting comfortably in your car for a few extra minutes.\nWill this government start paying for funerals and lawsuit settlements for all the people guaranteed to be killed on the streets they ripped up, and on the streets they denied lifesaving upgrades to? In the face of an ongoing affordability crisis, will this government start reimbursing Ontarians for their increased transportation costs, when they are forced back into their cars and have to spend thousands more every year on gas and car maintenance instead of using active transportation?\nSpeaking on behalf of crash survivors, and for countless Ontarians who have lost their voice because they were killed in a preventable crash, our membership demands you change course. You must not rip out safe streets and sentence more of our neighbors to the anguish we have experienced. You must not prohibit municipalities from saving lives and preventing injuries. Crashes kill pedestrians, cyclists, and car drivers alike, and human life is more important than speed or convenience. If what happened to us had happened to you, it would never occur to you to inflict this horrible fate on more people in this province, solely for a cheap political point in what is the ultimate non-partisan issue. If you continue on this reckless, immoral path, you will own every preventable death and serious injury on Toronto\u2019s roads.\n"

        "comment": "The study (attached) by the Belgian institution Transport & Mobility Leuven found that if only 10% of cars on the roads got replaced by motorcycles, time stuck in traffic would decrease by a whopping 40%.\nWhile this may not translate 1:1 to the situation in Ontario or specifically in the GTA, there is no reason to believe that the results here would be significantly worse. Thus, not performing similar research specifically for the GTA and Ontario demonstrates a lack of care about the quality of life of motorists, and any measures that cannot be shown to have a potential effect of similar magnitude are nothing but wasting taxpayer money.\n"

        "comment": "We are residents of Bloor West Village since 1984 and welcomed the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor St. because it served as a traffic calming initiative in our area. You will recall that our area in Swansea was festooned with Slow down signs due to the epidemic of careless driving after the COVID period. Bloor St. West  between Keele and Six Points was never an area that drivers could \u201cmake time\u201d if that was their chosen route. As a former bicyclist the bike lanes are the safest option for residents in addition to the \u201cBetter Way\u201d which is the option most local residents avail themselves of. Bicycle Lanes are the most serious urban response to the Climate crisis. This seems to be the options adopted around the urban world except in Ontario.\nMunicipal governments occupy the lane for this decision and it would be better for Ontario democracy that they retain decision making capacity in this area. Cynicism and resentment will only expand among citizens of this city if every decision isn\u2019t achieved in a collaborative context.\n"

        "comment": "Hello. I am a young adult resident of a small town in the Durham Brock region, Beaverton. I regularly cycle to work in my home town, but also commute weekly to Oshawa for my university education. I favor public transportation where possible, and don\u2019t agree with car dependent transportation on a fundamental level. To put it briefly, the cost in lives and health both for those who are obliged to drive and those who can refrain has never been acceptable; legislation to further reinforce automobile dependance and impair the use of public transit and micro mobility like bicycles, goes against my hopes for the future of Canada as a whole.\nIt is my opinion that Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction; Bill 212 will ultimately worsen the efficiency of the transportation system and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with it. Additionally, the inclusion of highway development in a bill primarily about bike paths on roads is not relevant and appears to be in bad faith.\nI don\u2019t like the inter-meshing of Bicycle infrastructure legislation with highway development legislation: they are separate topics, and Bill 212 appears to be using any negative outlooks on the former to quietly push rushed expansion of the latter. They should be kept separate in legislation and in discussion. Bill 212 includes changes to overwrite protections and safeguards built into highway development. Rushing highway development, especially without long term input from the communities directly disrupted and affected by that development should not be permitted to pass\u2026 regardless of the biking infrastructure effects the bill primarily pushes.\nBill 212 pushes for the removal of existing bike lanes and heavy suppression of establishing bike infrastructure going forward. The Bill originates from the city of Toronto, but disconcertingly applies these restrictions to the entirety of Ontario. I am not a resident of the dense city centre, so I cannot provide first hand opinions of the existing bike infrastructure, or how this bill impacts the city. However, by trying to apply these restrictions universally and overwrite the agency of other areas to choose for themselves, Bill 212 acts as an overreach beyond the areas of contention it came from. Why should the opinions and perspectives of a dense urban area, determine if my rural hometown and suburban place of study are allowed to develop safe biking infrastructure? These are different, unique places that should be shaped and developed according to the people who live there. I as someone who has a great many years of time in the workforce left, and want a subrural future where safe biking and public transit options are widely available\u2026 I want the agency and freedom to shape the places where I live, not have it controlled or interfered with by strangers who live radically different lives in the city.\nAddressing Bill 212 directly, it is my opinion that destroying existing and preventing the establishment of safe bike lanes will have the inverse effect that the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d is claiming to provide. I actively choose to bike to work for personal reasons, such as getting additional exercise, minimizing my carbon footprint, and saving money to one day own a home. Regardless of these reasons however, is that each commute, shopping trip, or visit to friends and family done via bike is another vehicle not on the road [or lining its sides]. A person choosing to bike = one less car contributing to congestion, pollution, wear and tear on infrastructure, or at risk of accident involvements. By removing/restricting the infrastructure that enables safe travel by bike across the entirety of Ontario, people who want to bike for any reason are denied that choice [or risk becoming part of a growing statistic by travelling beside automobiles https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/opp-says-cyclist-deaths-up-300-p\u2026]. When travel by car left as the best available option, then those trips end up being made in a car. Adding more lanes, especially by removing safe alternatives to driving between destinations, will directly cause more congestion\u2026 not alleviate it.\nI want to be able to bike to safely and comfortably where I need to go, without worrying about dying because someone is not paying attention behind the wheel. Bike lanes, paths, and especially separated bike paths are the best way to do that. But Bill 212 comes from a city I don\u2019t live in, to actively remove and deny that option in a short sighted to rush development of road infrastructure at a steep cost in funds and lives: which itself will put more vehicles on the road in a time where we need less.\nIf we as Ontarians want to be rid of congestion, the only real option is to enable viable alternatives to driving. Please don\u2019t erase the real progress made to give people the freedom to choose. Stop Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I'm appalled that the government is planning to give itself the power to remove bike lanes that have already been planned, built and paid for by local municipalities, ostensibly to provide the most trivial reductions in driver travel time.\nEvery study shows that bike lanes increase safety for cyclists and motorists, benefit local businesses, and reduce pollution. The City of Toronto says that response time for first responders has not increased. BIAs are opposed. There is no logical reason to do this, and no data that prove eliminating bike lanes will have a noticeable impact on traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is caused by too many vehicles. Take out the bike lanes and cyclists are still going to be riding in traffic. All those couriers and food deliverers will be in traffic or on the sidewalk.\nIt's also another example of the premier meddling in Toronto's business\u2014reducing the size of council during an election, destroying Ontario Place, moving the Science Centre on the flimsiest of pretenses to justify building a parking garage for a foreign-owned spa nobody wants. It's time his focus was on finishing transit projects, getting housing built, and ensuring that everyone in Ontario has a family doctor.\n"

        "comment": "My first issue with Bill 212 is the exemptions being planned for Highway 413, specifically that it will be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act. The impact of building this highway and further encouraging driving will have grave effects on the environment. As stated in a report from Environmental Defence, Highway 413 would cause over 17 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions by 2050 \u2013 the same date by which Canada is committed to reach net-zero emissions. The building of Highway 413 would pave over 400 acres of the Greenbelt, and over 2,000 acres of Class 1 and Class 2 farmland while harming over 29 species that are protected under the federal Species at Risk Act as reported in The Pointer. We need to respect the process of evaluation and study the benefits and consequences of these decisions. We cannot ignore our environmental impact and how damaging the actions we take now will be to current and future generations.\nTrying to build this highway without following proper protocol is indicative that this government is willing to cut corners for actions that benefit themselves instead of the people.\n"

The only way to solve congestion is to encourage active and public transportation. Creating a network of bike lanes can help alleviate congestion since a good network can encourage drivers to cycle, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes also increases the risk of serious injury and death not only for cyclists, but for pedestrians and drivers as well since drivers drive more calmly on streets with bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nThe purpose of this legislation is to reduce gridlock and save time for drivers in Ontario.\nThese comments focus on Part XII, which requires Government of Ontario approval/review of:\n\uf0b7 municipalities\u2019 plans for bicycle lanes that reduce lanes for cars, and\n\uf0b7 bicycle lanes that have been built in the past five years (with the potential for removal of lanes that are in place.)\nThese measures will not significantly reduce gridlock.\nThere is no evidence that bike traffic and bike lanes contribute to gridlock.\nThe problem with gridlock is too many cars.\nIncreasing space on roads leads to increases in car use, more congestion, and eventually more\ngridlock.\nReducing infrastructure for cyclists may contribute to congestion and gridlock if they opt for\nmotorized transport instead.\nThe legislation makes no provision for improvements to public transport which could at least\nabsorb the trips of some of the cyclists who will ride less because they have lost bike lanes.\nThey will also degrade the benefits of cycling to Ontario.\nTransportation\nEliminating or slowing the growth of bike lanes will drive cyclists back to motorized\ntransportation--which will increase congestion.\nThe transportation system will be less efficient, incenting use of expensive (car/transit) modes\nover the less expensive one (cycling).\nHealth\nFewer bike lanes will reduce safety for cyclists, leading to more injuries and possibly, fatalities.\nReductions in cycling infrastructure will lead to less riding, exercise and fitness, which will\nreduce population health.\nEnvironment\nCycling is the one of the most efficient modes of transportation in terms of space, energy and\npollution.\nMore trips by car and public transit will only lead to more pressure on available space on roads,\nas well as increased energy use and GHG emissions.\nCars require much more land than bicycles: both while travelling and not in use (parking\u2014which\nis often under priced). They require more public space per passenger mile--so are a less efficient\nuse of that space.\nMunicipal Finances\nRoads and car infrastructure are expensive. Municipalities across Ontario are struggling to build\nand even maintain the road networks needed to support \u201ccars first\u201d transportation.\nIn municipalities such as Ottawa, (which has a \u201crevenue shortfall\u201d) the huge investments in road\nbuilding and maintenance are crowding out expenditure on other important public goods and\nservices.\nMunicipalities, whose revenues are constrained by their narrow tax bases, tax increase\ncommitments and dependence on other levels of government for funding, will not be able to\nsupport ever-growing road networks.\nCycling lanes are a fiscally responsible means to increase transportation capacity in Ontario, at a\nlower cost than roads dedicated primarily to cars.\nRecommendation:\nRemove section XII from the proposed legislation.\n"

        "comment": "While Bill 212 is well intended, it will neither meaningfully reduce gridlock or traffic congestion, and will damage our environment. It must not be passed.\nHighway 413 will actually make traffic work, in part due to induced demand. The creation of more options for driving results in more people driving or taking similar routes and thereby creating traffic. This also results in sprawl, spreading things out and forcing more people to use cars, which are space inefficient.\nWorsening this is that it encourages car use at the detriment of alternative forms of transportation that are not only more economical, but better for Ontarians health and Ontario's environment. Bicycle infrastructure promotes activity, reducing health care costs, emits less, helping the environment, and is less costly to maintain for both the government and the riders, saving both money.\nFurthermore, car infrastructure, like highway 413, harms people, especially vulnerable groups like children, both directly through accidents and indirectly through air pollution both from the tires wearing out and the exhaust.\nLastly is the problem that it exempts highway 413 from the Environmental assessment act, as quote, \"The following are exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act: 1.  The Highway 413 Project, including any change to the Highway 413 Project.\" That act helps us make sure the environment is minimally harmed, this cannot be an exception. In addition, are the carbon emissions. Given the nature of the project it will produce a tremendous amount of emissions and currently we are not reaching our emission targets. Climate change is already harming us, physically, mentally, and economically, we must not exacerbate it and cause needless suffering.\nIt is due to these reasons that Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, must not be passed. Instead, more effort should be put into helping alternatives to cars such as buses and bikes. These latter two are good for Ontarians, Ontario's economy, and Ontario's environment.\n"

        "comment": "As a Peterborough resident, I am deeply concerned about the implications of Bill 212, particularly its potential to reverse the progress our city has made in creating safer and more inclusive streets. Initiatives like the Bethune Street project have introduced well-designed cycling infrastructure and pedestrian spaces, making Peterborough not only safer but also more vibrant and attractive to residents and visitors. Bill 212 threatens to derail this progress by centralizing decision-making at the provincial level, removing local autonomy, and prioritizing car traffic over all other road users.\nThe requirement for provincial approval for new bike lanes, coupled with the risk of removing existing infrastructure, would be a step backward for Peterborough. This city has worked hard to create streets that accommodate everyone\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. Projects like Bethune Street have demonstrated clear benefits: fewer accidents, more active transportation options, and a growing sense of community. Why jeopardize these successes?\nMoreover, discouraging cycling infrastructure in a city like Peterborough ignores the clear economic and environmental advantages. Accessible bike lanes encourage people to spend time downtown, supporting local businesses. They also reduce traffic congestion and emissions, making the city cleaner and more pleasant for everyone\u2014not just cyclists.\nSome might argue that cyclists \u201cdon\u2019t bike in the winter anyway,\u201d but that\u2019s a shortsighted view. With proper infrastructure and maintenance, cities worldwide\u2014yes, even ones with winters more severe than ours\u2014see year-round cycling as a viable and growing mode of transportation. Why should Peterborough, or any Ontario city, settle for less?\nBill 212 doesn\u2019t just target bike lanes; it undermines the idea that streets should be safe for everyone, not just those in cars. In Peterborough, where active transportation projects are just starting to bear fruit, this legislation would send the wrong message: that the safety of cyclists and pedestrians is an afterthought, and that progress should be sacrificed to maintain the status quo.\nI urge the provincial government to reconsider the sweeping implications of this bill. Local governments are in the best position to understand the needs of their communities. Provincial overreach will only make it harder for cities like Peterborough to build on the progress they\u2019ve made. Let\u2019s keep moving forward, not backward.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing today to indicate my strong opposition to Bill 212, not with my opinion but with data and evidence. I want Ontario to move faster, and I strongly support efforts to reduce gridlock. However, so much of this bill is not considering accurate data or studies on how to build road infrastructure. Most of my comments refer to how the bike lane legislation will affect Ontario\u2019s streets for cars and all other road users.\nTravel Times\nToronto City Council produced a thorough report (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-250545\u2026) in response to this bill with many important figures. I highly recommend the entire committee read the full report, as this bike lane legislation seems to be targeted at Toronto without using data from Toronto. The city planning experts who wrote this report reported that travel times on streets where bike lanes are proposed to be removed will increase greatly for 4\u20139 months as lanes will be closed for construction to occur. Then, after the lanes are reopened, the non-partisan planning staff report that there will be \u201clikely minimal improvements in travel time once lanes are removed\u201d. This is largely due to induced demand, where making driving the only viable option for many people puts many more cars on the road, which over a short period of time will fill the reclaimed car lane and then some with no easy way to improve traffic once car demand has increased even more. Also, driving times often only increase by mere minutes. As the Toronto Star reports (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/do-cycling-corridors-really-slow-traff\u2026) the major streets with bike lanes do sometimes see travel time increases, but they are \u201coften by a minute or less.\u201d These slight increases could also be uninfluenced by bike lanes, as Toronto is one of the fastest growing cities in North America which would naturally increase drivers and thus travel times. Another main travel time measure is emergency response times. In a recent community consultation for the Bloor Street West Complete Street Extension bike lanes, Toronto Fire Deputy Chief Jim Jessop reported that the fire department has not seen an increase in travel times and he told members of the community that \u201cYour response times have been improving,\" (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bike-rally-community-meeting-bik\u2026)\nBike lanes on University Ave, Toronto\nThe new University Ave bike lanes are some of the best in the city. They are protected, preserved street parking where it was needed and separate cyclists from cars with a green barrier of plants creating a more beautiful street. This bill proposes removing these lanes which are not meaningfully contributing to traffic. Healthcare experts including the President of Mt Sinai Health (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2020/cc/comm/communicationfile-1028\u2026) and the President of Sick Kids Hospital (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2020/cc/comm/communicationfile-1025\u2026) that strongly support bike lanes on University.\nThe Environment\nEnvironmentally, this bike lane legislation along with the removal of environmental requirements for highways is in fierce opposition to our province\u2019s environmental targets and our country\u2019s climate goals. Road transportation is the largest source of pollution in the province, responsible for more than a quarter of all of Ontario\u2019s emissions and by subsidizing driving with new highways and making environmentally friendly options like cycling far more dangerous and disincentivized, the government is contributing to climate change and risking the future of our province for future generations.\nRoad Safety\nSeparated bike lanes will always prevent road deaths full stop. As reported by 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto (https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026) these senseless tragedies are avoidable and cannot continue to happen on our streets. I strongly urge the committee to carefully read this open letter from physicians in Ontario who cannot keep treating drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists in our emergency departments.\nThe Future of Ontario\nLastly, we need this bill to consider the future. Not just the environmental future but how we will continue to grow and allow a growing population to move around the city. In a recent City of Toronto council meeting on Nov 6th, of all the new buildings that were approved that day \u201c22% of units in the most recent developments being debated at Toronto City Council have access to a parking space\u201d as reported in the Toronto Star (https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/doug-ford-wants-a-toronto-\u2026). Toronto, but also many municipalities in Ontario will not be able to sustain the population growth if we do not create non-car options for transportation. There is simply not enough space on the roads, or as seen in these new developments, the parking garages of new homes for everyone to drive as their primary mode. 78% of individuals in these new developments will not have a car, and we cannot leave these people stranded. We also need our businesses of Ontario to thrive and continue growing. The Bloor BIA reported that removing the bike lanes on Bloor \u201cwould be disastrous to the neighbourhood\u201d. (https://www.torontotoday.ca/local/politics-government/bia-warns-removal\u2026) It is not fair to punish small business just to allow cars to fly by them without stopping to make purchases and help our economy.\nI hope you take this data and thoughts from all linked articles and letters into consideration and amend this bill. I am not alone in these thoughts and as of this submission, 22,164 people have signed Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition (https://www.cycleto.ca/ilovebikelanes) wanting to stop this bill and protect our bike lanes. to improve our communities safety, the environment, small businesses, and stop gridlock for good by investing in non-car modes of transit.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I think that building Hwy 413 would be a travesty. It would undoubtedly threaten some of Ontario\u2019s most fertile land, and as far as I can see, it would do so needlessly.\nHwy 407 is grossly under-utilized, due in part to its high toll fees. Instead of building an entirely new highway through some of Ontario\u2019s most precious farm land, perhaps the province should simply buy Hwy 407 and eliminate its toll fees.\n"

        "comment": "Schedule 4, 195.2 (1) adds bureaucracy by requiring all municipalities to seek permission to install bike lanes on whatever roads could be designated as a \"highway\" by the Minister, and subsection 4 increases the risk of collisions at community or on local roads. People live and work here, so make it livable, and easier to work drive/bike/commute/transport your self here. Contrast the language in the bill with doing the work to simply installing barrier separated bike lanes to better demarcate the road and improve the road speeds. This basically assumes from the jump, a bike lane doesn't offer any benefit to drivers, when it literally would move them out of the way..\nKeeping barrier separated bike lanes wouldn't degrade overall road safety either and would likely improve traffic flow, since that is the justification for the extra powers and uploading of bike lanes to the Minister. Other suggestions here include increase traffic flow along roads that have bike lanes such as better timing of intersections to let drivers drive more efficiently and prevent dismantling of good infrastructure that everybody has to fund one way or another..\nYou physically can not go faster on roads which are gridlocked anyway, regardless of bike lanes being present or not. Why does everybody who uses the road environment have to suffer in the worst possible way by removing transportation infrastructure when practical solutions are being proposed that offer flexibility or options?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212.\nI'm concerned about the whole bill, but my comments are specifically about the provincial government's plans to take over jurisdiction of the responsibility for bike lanes from municipalities. I believe decisions about bike lanes should be left in the hands of the municipal governments.\nI live in south Etobicoke. I own a car and a bicycle - I'm both a driver and a cyclist. I'm very disappointed when leaders try to pit residents against each other with labels that really don't reflect reality.\nI want to see more bike lanes in Etobicoke and in the rest of the city so people on bicycles can get around safely, and because evidence shows that well-designed streets with bike lanes are safer for everyone - pedestrians, people on bikes, drivers, and everyone else.\nWhen I drive, I find congestion is terrible almost everywhere in the city. I don't see worse congestion on Bloor than on lots of other streets that don't have bike lanes. Removing the few bike lanes we have will not begin to solve our congestion problems. Improving our transit system and providing a network of bike lanes will provide needed alternatives to driving, which will help solve our congestion problems.\nI regularly use the bike lane on Bloor between Old Mill and Royal York Road as part of my commute. I always used to avoid the section of Bloor between Old Mill and Prince Edward because it felt so unsafe, with cars speeding past. I'm so grateful to have that protection. It allows me to safely get to shops on that section of Bloor on my way home from work.\nI live near Evans and Browns Line. I would love to use the bike lane lane on Bloor west of Royal York more often, but there's no safe route for me to connect with it. I risk my life on Evans when I commute because at least it gets me to and from the painted bike lane on Royal York, which is better than biking on a street with no lane.\nSpeeding and running red lights are huge problems on our streets, and one thing I notice is how much worse the speeding is on streets with no bike lanes. Evans is treacherous, and Bloor west of Kipling, where the lane ends, is also incredibly dangerous. I like the way bike lanes have a calming effect and make neighbourhoods feel more welcoming, not just places to speed through on your way to somewhere else.\nI've been so happy to see children with their parents, or young people on their own, biking safely on Bloor in the lanes. We know that the new developments coming to Bloor are going to bring many thousands of new residents to the neighbourhood, and we'll need options for them. We must not remove what little bike infrastructure we have. Instead, we need to see it as the spine of a network and give our kids and all of us the safety on our streets that we all deserve.\nThis work is best left in the hands of municipalities who know local needs and have the long view in mind.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n"

        "comment": "Incentivizing cycling is one element of several that should be taken to reduce the existing gridlock in our cities by reducing the number of vehicles on them.  A cyclist (or even 2 or 3) who would otherwise occupy a private vehicle requires far less space than that of a vehicle both while in transit and upon reaching their destination (i.e. parking space for a bike is tiny compared to that of a vehicle). The proposed legislation that prevents municipalities from installing bicycle lanes where doing so would reduce the number of lanes for automobiles is based on the claim that doing so will improve automotive traffic flow.  What is the evidence to support this claim?\nAn article entitled \"The Traffic Calming Effect of Delineated Bicycle Lanes\" published in the Journal of Urban Mobility in June 2024 makes the following observation in the literature review section:\n\"The relationship between introducing a bike lane and motor-vehicle travel speeds has been a topic of conversation among cyclists and transportation planners, although there is a lack of empirical evidence on the topic.\"\nThe same article highlights the safety benefits of bicycle lanes as do many others, some of which are cited in the article.\nRemoving cycling lanes installed in the past 5 years is an even worse idea. By now, such routes will have become established for some cyclists and though many will stop using it when the cycling lane is removed, some will continue with bad outcomes resulting for cyclists and motorists alike.  Poor cycling infrastructure leads to poor behaviour by both parties which will hamper traffic flow and may lead to increases in serious injury or death of cyclists.  Furthermore, it requires spending money to reverse a change which has already been paid for!\nThis legislation is unsupported by evidence and it restricts municipalities and their citizens from making appropriate decisions locally.\n"
