Please invest our tax money in sustainable, public forms of transportation instead. Please make informed decisions that will benefit us in future, not cause more gridlock down the road.\n"

        "comment": "As an active cyclist, driver and walker, I believe this proposed legislation to be regressive and put forward with a blatant disregard for treating all modes of transportation equally.  Studies have shown that removing bike lanes and prohibitions on new active transportation corridors will have the opposite effect of the desired outcome. This legislation will put many municipalities years behind in building much needed safe cycling infrastructure. The roads are increasingly unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists and I strongly believe that this proposed legislation will more vulnerable users at risk of injury and death. How many cyclists and pedestrians have been killed in Ottawa and Toronto in just the last few months. I\u2019d like to honour the memory of my friend Julia Cleveland who was killed in Toronto recently by sharing these thoughts. This legislation cannot be made into law and does nothing for the health and safety of Ontarians who are desperate for safe, efficient alternatives to getting in the car to live their lives.\n"

It is unclear why highway development needs this special consideration.\nThe measures appear to ignore established research that asking road capacity fits not improve congestion and more recent research showing that multimodal transport is more beneficial in reducing congestion in the long-term than additional roads.\nMy reaction is on the balance, against this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not based on data and will do nothing to improve gridlock. Research shows that bike lanes either reduce or have negligible impacts on travel times, make roads safer, and increase visits to local businesses. It has also been shown that increasing the number of car lanes actually worsens traffic by increasing usage. Reversing existing bike lanes and attempting to block new bike lanes will therefore do the very opposite of what this bill\u2019s title claims.\nToronto is a city that was not built for the number of drivers we have. What we need are forward-looking policies that actually deal with the problem instead of looking for political scape goats. The only real long-term solutions to gridlock involve removing cars from the road by incentivizing alternate modes of transport. This includes installing bike lanes, improving public transit, and instituting city road tolls, as many major cities around the globe have done.\n"

They could also potentially help cities hold companies to account who are bungling transit projects in the province (RTO in Ottawa, and whatever company is building the Eglington Crosstown in Toronto).\n"

        "comment": "Dear Members of the Legislative Assembly,\nI am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This legislation not only removes decision-making authority from municipalities\u2014who are best positioned to understand the needs of their communities\u2014but also threatens vital infrastructure like bike lanes, which are crucial for public safety and reducing congestion.\nMunicipal governments know their residents\u2019 needs and should retain the authority to plan infrastructure accordingly. Instead of provincial interference, funding should be allocated to support public safety and transit infrastructure. Such investments enhance everyone\u2019s quality of life, allowing people to travel safely and efficiently without the constant stress of driving. Even drivers benefit from reduced traffic when strong public transit and cycling networks are in place.\nThe bike lanes specifically targeted by the premier are among the most heavily used in Toronto. Their removal would disproportionately harm the people of Toronto, who are already contending with extensive construction disruptions caused by the long-overdue expansion of public transit. Taking away these lanes during a time of upheaval risks alienating the very community that will be most affected. The bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond, for example, enable an additional 400 people to commute during rush hour\u2014far more than the 80 or so people that a car lane could accommodate, given the bottlenecks at exit ramps. Beyond serving cyclists, these lanes also provide vital support for emergency services, allowing ambulances and other vehicles to bypass traffic during critical moments. Removing this infrastructure would not only hinder mobility but also jeopardize lives by delaying emergency response times. Fire engines may be unnecessarily deployed to incidents that could be managed by smaller, faster vehicles if these lanes remain available.\nIn addition, the legislation\u2019s focus on removing bike lanes and easing car travel risks increasing congestion through induced demand. Making driving more convenient often results in more people choosing to drive, which has historically erased any benefits from highway expansions in Ontario within 13 to 18 months. Simply put, removing bike lanes or expanding roads will not solve gridlock; it will exacerbate it.\nRather than doubling down on outdated solutions, Ontario should focus on well-designed transit projects. Such transit systems would also alleviate the need for expensive highway expansions by offering convenient and attractive alternatives to driving. High-speed rail, operating with local, express, and local-express modes on coordinated schedules, would allow people to commute comfortably, reducing the pressure on roadways.\nBill 212, in its current form, guarantees only more gridlock and diminished mobility. It risks creating urban enclaves where people are effectively trapped in their neighborhoods, with fewer options for safe and efficient travel. Toronto, like all cities, needs infrastructure that reflects the realities of modern urban life\u2014not provincial directives that dismantle critical bike lanes and push residents toward more car dependency.\nI urge the government to reconsider this legislation and engage meaningfully with municipalities and residents to develop solutions that enhance mobility for all. A forward-thinking approach, focusing on transit and public safety infrastructure, will foster a healthier, more livable Ontario for everyone.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\na concerned practicing civil engineer\n"

This policy will create a city that is less pedestrian friendly, more polluted and caters to a certain demographic.  While most leading and livable cities are moving away from building more highways and focusing on making policy to build green public transport systems our policymakers are working hard on taking us backwards.\nI urge our policymakers to focus their efforts to create policy to make it easier to build green public transport, ensuring our city is future proofed and caters to all.\n"

        "comment": "This act (Bill 212 build highways faster act) appears to trample over the rights of citizens, businesses and local municipalities to review, evaluate, comment and critically assess the implementation of large infrastructure works. In lieu of such oversight, it provides the provincial government powers to override critical checks and balances. This sort of oversight is foolhardy in the best case scenario and malicious in its worst form. We cannot let the decisions of one person or body (i.e. the Minister) override the lived concerns of a mosaic of various stakeholders. By providing these overarching power to one government body we risk appropriate oversight, diverse thought and potentially open ourselves up to catastrophic outcomes including environmental impacts (e.g. flooding) and economic impacts (e.g. loss of small business revenue).\n"

While it will ease congestion for a brief time, it is simply going to push the problem onto another government and another generation.  Start being forward/future thinking please!\n2.  We have a highway (407) that could ease congestion on the 401.  Make better use of it.  Move truck traffic there.  Take the tolls off.  Whatever, but make more effective use of the infrastructure that we already have before putting billions into building new highways.\n3.  We don't need legislation that helps us to build highways faster because we don't need more highways.  We need legislation that helps build greater infrastructure that moves MORE people, not more cars - busses, bikes, trains.\n"

        "comment": "If passed, the proposed Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 would define Highway 413, Bradford Bypass and Garden City Skyway as priority highway projects.\nIt has been scientifically proven that there is nothing about these projects that will benefit the Ontario people as a whole. It will pollute and endanger the environment, it will not move people as fast as proper efficient transit, it will destroy parts of saved and protected natural spaces, and it will promote housing and industrial sprawl which has been proven to be better placed as part of existing city densification. Worst of all, these projects promote food insecurity, and the horrible effects of climate change.\nOntarians should not be duped into thinking they need these destructive projects especially in light of them in no way helping with the climate crisis, in fact they would help accelerate the horrific effects of climate change, and turn around towards sustainable practices and saving our natural spaces and farmlands for the future Ontarians to thrive.\nWe are more than concerned, angry, and frankly shocked that this government would put unnecessary projects ahead of the good of the health and future welfare of Ontarians.\nPLEASE STOP THIS BILL, STOP THE HIGHWAYS, and STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR NATURAL LANDS.\n"
