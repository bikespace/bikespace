We all know that the cost of living is getting unbearable, the government does not need to kick the most disadvantaged people down even more. Reducing their options for mobility in such a way will have a disastrous impact on their livelihoods, not to mention their physical safety as they will be forced to bike in high-traffic areas.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping up the existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, University would be absolutely criminal. As a former student at Ryerson (TMU), I used the Bloor bike lanes daily. Those lanes are incredibly well used, even seeing a considerable amount of congestion during peak times. These routes represent an immense investment in green infrastructure, which actually does reduce gridlock and save people time. Without the bike lanes, those bikers will either hop in a car (Increasing gridlock), take the already congested subway line, or continue to bike as usual, without a bike lane, which puts them at risk and created havoc for drivers. A cyclist was killed at Bloor and Avenue earlier this year, due to a dumpster being illegally put in the bike lane. If Doug Ford's response to that senseless manslaughter is to remove the bike lane, he's out to lunch and completely unfit to serve.\nThe provincial conservative party has no business weaseling into municipal affairs such as this one. If the City of Toronto didn't want bike lanes, they would've elected a mayor who reflected those values, however the opposite happened. If Doug Ford cares so much about these issues he should just run for Mayor - oh wait, that already happened...\nMost importantly, the way Doug and Prabmeet vilify cycling is shameful. I don't understand when or why cycling became a left-wing virtue. Shouldn't people of all political backgrounds want their kids to have safe routes to bike to school, friends house, soccer practice etc., and safe and reliable mobility options for folks who don't want or need to own a car? Cycling promotes positive physical and mental health, is environmentally friendly, economically friendly, safe, and makes sense spatially in big cities. If the conservative party is against all those things, they should probably take a long look in the mirror.\n"

        "comment": "Space in a downtown urban environment is precious. The people of Toronto enjoy a wealth of spatial variety, from its rich green spaces and parks, to its economically active corridors and thriving intersection of culture and business in the downtown and surrounding areas. Changes in any shape and format must consider costs compared to the benefits they propose.\nThe city has grown considerably in a few short years, and is projected (and planned) to do so for more years to come. Moving people around to where they need to be\u2014for work, for study, for recreation and socializing\u2014is critical for such growth to be prosperous. These methods of mobility in a city such as Toronto must consider a variety of distances and route offerings.\nFor something like mass transit, we have the subway system, surface transport such as bus and streetcar networks, and (soon) the LRTs. Form follows function here, and so large amounts of people are moved in a general fashion, with the last mile predominantly coming from BRT, walking, and bicycling.\nHowever, the adoption and expansion of the bike lane network specifically in Toronto on key corridors has allowed for an incredible amount of accessibility along them. Paired with lanes for traffic and transit (both surface and underground), these corridors offer commuters options. If we are to assume the GTA region grows as it has been for the foreseeable future, then we must consider the balance of space to accommodate many options for moving people around on a mass scale.\nThe amount of space a single bike occupies compared to a single car is significant, and allows for considerable savings in the form of monetary cost (maintenance, fuel, infrastructure), air quality, and noise, at a small cost of perhaps comfort on a few particularly cold days of the year. Cars often predicate a lane not only for movement, but parking as well, requiring additional space on-street as it currently stands. Under the concept of induced demand, an additional lane for cars nudges commuters to consider driving more than they do, just as a bike lane encourages riders to cycle. The primary difference is that the stickiness for riders is greater, meaning that removing a bike lane does not remove the riders using it to the same extent that reducing a lane for car traffic discourages car use (again going back to the space issue). This incurs costs particularly in the realm of safety. By removing a physical design barrier between motor vehicles and bikes, the likelihood of collisions goes up, meaning people come to harm more frequently. This is antithetical to former mayor Tory's-led Vision Zero.\nI strongly urge you to rescind this part of Bill 212, for the betterment of Ontarians in consideration of our future growth. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "The Government is using faulty, outdated data to 'support' its case for removal of cycling infrastructure.\nOne of the supporting data points cited by Doug Ford's Minister states that only 1.2% of the population uses bicycles for transportation, but this data is from 1991! 34 years ago! Seems like an attempt to cook the books with faulty data to support faulty legislation.\n\"We know that these bike lanes, where only 1.2 per cent of people use to commute to get to work, are taking away almost 50 per cent of the infrastructure on those streets from vehicles,\" Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria said. False data, taken completelty out of time and out of context.\nOntario cities and towns in general, and Toronto in particular, need MORE cycling infrastructure, not less. Cycling traffic on major shopping streets is a positive, not a negative. Cyclists are more likely to visit business on streets like Bloor and most Toronto BIA support increasing cycling infrastructure.\nRemoving existing cycling infrastructure from Toronto roads is a costly, regressive step. Akin to the first term of the Ford government when he cancelled partially completed clean energy projects, costing taxpayers billions of dollars to undo useful energy projects.\nThe government should be prioritizing the Eglinton Crosstown project, and other mass transit projects. Instead they seem intent on building massive parking lots near Lake Ontario, massive highways through our farmlands and Greenbelt, and destroying existing hard-won cycling infrastructure in Toronto.\nMr. Ford is not the Mayor of Toronto, but he wishes he was and acts like he is. Torontonians wish he would stop bullying us.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply worried about this bill.\nThere is no \"final solution\" for how much infrastructure is required for a car-culture to continue; adding (or returning) lanes for cars to occupy is not a long term, medium term, or even short term solution to congestion.  Full stop.  And everyone knows it.\nThis bill is not about reducing congestion, it is about scoring political points to bolster an election.\nIf this bill moves forward, we will be wasting taxpayer money removing cycling infrastructure, instead of investing it in things that will actually help with congestion; providing transportation alternatives like walking, cycling, and public transit.\nThe argument that only 1.2% of Torontonians ride bicycles is provably false.  Within Toronto proper, surveys show numbers as high as 44%.  1.2% is a number from over 10 years ago that included people from Burlington to Ajax, from the lakeshore to Lake Simcoe.  Through that incredibly wide expanse, there is nearly no bicycle infrastructure even if people wanted to survive a ride to work or to the Go train or to the local grocery store.\nIt is a cyclic issue; people don't feel safe riding a bicycle to do day-to-day things like commuting, errands, or going to see friends, because there is no cycling infrastructure.  And politicians score points saying no-one is riding so it is a waste of money to invest in cycling infrastructure.  But if you actually look at the numbers, you see that when you do invest in infrastructure, deaths go down and ridership goes up.\nOf course, this is the \"Environmental Registry of Ontario\", and none of this has touched on the actual environment.  Cars are bad for the environment, full stop.  And not just from their tailpipes; the amount of green space that gets destroyed to support a car culture is ghastly.\nThere is no positive outcome from ripping out existing bike lanes and proactively blocking the creation of new cycling infrastructure, period.  We need to invest in the people, not the profits of foreign car companies by paving over every blade of grass to ensure they're they only hope for Ontarioans to get around.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n"

Bike lanes are crucial for my commute and help me feel safer on the road. It also makes it safer for drivers who don't need to swerve into a different lane to avoid me.\nResearch has shown that increasing car lanes only increase traffic over time; it incentivizes more people to drive. Conversely, increasing bike lines encourages more bikers, which reduces the concentration of cars on the road. In Montreal, our neighboring big city, bikes lanes and pedestrian streets have also be shown by research to improve traffic to business.\nI don't have a car. I need bike lanes to get around and to keep me safe. Everyone hates traffic. Research clearly shows that adding more car lanes is NOT the solution.

        "comment": "Provincial legislation (Bill 212) aimed at keeping towns and cities from building bike lanes and even forcing some to remove them is bad news for everyone in Ontario, wherever they live. For people who live in the towns and cities directly affected, it will result in more dangerous streets and more congestion. For those who don\u2019t, it introduces a dangerous and false polarization, pitting drivers against cyclists and encouraging dangerous driving.\n  The proposed legislation is not just an urban problem. Rural municipalities and small towns across Ontario have been creating cycling infrastructure because they know cycling reduces traffic, promotes health, reduces environmental damage and promotes tourism. For instance, the County of Renfrew has embraced this thinking with its Active Transportation Policy, and a network of roads with hardened shoulders is quickly developing as a result. Municipalities around the County are doing the same with their roads. The Province putting the brakes on bike lanes sends a negative message about these developments.\n  Cycling brings together citizens of all political persuasions, as shown by the huge turnout for group cycling events in Westmeath, Killaloe, Eganville, Braeside and Petawawa. Local businesses are going bike-friendly to attract the growing number of cycle tourists.\n  Creating a polarized us-versus-them, drivers-versus-cyclists atmosphere is bound to encourage negative attitudes and dangerous driving. Parents sending their kids off to school, commuters getting to work, folks out shopping, seniors touring and exploring new places \u2013 all these people have reason to feel threatened by this proposed legislation.\n  The proposal has also pitted the provincial government against municipal ones. Having the Province tell towns and cities what they should do is so deeply offensive and makes so little sense that the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) \u2013 a non-partisan association of municipal officials \u2013 has condemned Bill 212, on which it was not consulted at all before it was introduced.  \u201cBicycle lanes are an essential element of urban transportation planning and road safety,\u201d it wrote in a news release.\u201d Requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction.\n  \u201cBased on local knowledge and community input, municipalities develop transportation plans that balance traffic flow with planning priorities like active transportation, multi-modal transportation and environmental and health protection.\u201d Local leaders and staff are much better equipped to know local needs than provincial politicians.\n  Premier Ford argues that bike lanes cause traffic congestion. Research says they don\u2019t. The City of Toronto has done extensive research, as reported in City Hall Watcher, finding that while bike usage has jumped by as much as 1,000 percent on some streets as a result of bike lanes, travel time for cars has actually dropped on some routes (Adelaide St., University Ave.) and increased only marginally in  others (Bloor and Richmond Streets).  CBC News reports that from New York to Montreal to Copenhagen to Paris, installation of bike lanes has led to rapid growth in cycling and less traffic congestion, as people find cycling an attractive, affordable and safe alternative to driving.\n  In England, one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject has shown that building roads, on the other hand, actually encourages congestion because it encourages more people to drive. As urban planning expert Lewis Mumford wrote in 1955, \u201cAdding car lanes to deal with traffic congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity.\u201d More and better public transportation and more people on bikes are more effective deterrents to congestion.\n  The growing popularity of e-bikes is bringing a multitude of new commuters to the existing bike lanes as they use them for everyday transportation. This trend is growing quickly and if encouraged by providing enhanced safety for those commuters, will lead to fewer cars on the crowded urban streets as people opt for the faster commute and fewer parking problems offered by e-bikes.\nFurther, segregated bike lanes, in numerous studies in Toronto, NY and others, increase business for retailers.  Patrons arriving by bicycle or foot visit most often and spend the most money per moth.\nThis bill is a step backward and should be withdrawn in favour of action that truly enhances safety and gets people moving.\n"

All research points to bike lanes reducing traffic and increasing business revenue.
