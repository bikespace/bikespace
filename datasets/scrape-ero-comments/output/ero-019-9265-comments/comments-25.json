        "comment": "Dear Mr. Ford,\nAs a resident of Ontario, I am very concerned with your plan to build Hwy 413 and in doing so destroy a portion of the Green Belt. This highway is completely useless and will not affect a main traffic issue in travelling from the communities surrounding GTA.\nInstead of a useless highway, it would make perfect sense to reduce the overall traffic by creating a better public transportation system similar to what can be witnessed in any big European city. It is a shame, that here in Ontario our train system is so poorly organized and overall very limited.  We all would be better off if you used the $28 billion for the train transportation system. Look at our subway lines! Such a big city as Toronto has so limited access to the subway system. All consecutive Ontario governments ignored this issue and it looks like to plan to do the same.\nShame, that you do not want to act in a way which is efficient and environmentally friendly\nThere is still time to rethink this unnecessary highway and put our money where it would work for the future.\nRegards,\nA.B.\n"

I speak from experience. I am a daily commuter cyclist in Ottawa\nResearch has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse\nWe need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and encouraging people to bike is an important part of this reduction\nRemoving bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money, and businesses will also suffer from reduced traffic\nOntarians need more options to get around, not fewer\nThe Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This bill stands as a clear example of the hypocrisy in our current transportation policies. It forces cities and municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes and critical infrastructure improvements that could significantly ease traffic congestion. At the same time, the province dismisses the need to support the construction of four-plexes across the province, claiming that municipalities should have the freedom to make their own decisions. I firmly oppose this bill, as it fosters the misguided notion that cars are the only legitimate form of transportation.\nThe belief that expanding our already overcrowded highway network will resolve gridlock is fundamentally flawed. The 401 is not just North America\u2019s busiest highway; it is also the widest in several areas. Rushing to increase highway spending and construction will only exacerbate our traffic issues.\nInvesting this money in our rail network, on the other hand, would generate jobs, position the province as a leader in transportation innovation, and provide a sustainable long-term solution to congestion.\n1. The provincial government must eliminate the obstacles that undermine local efforts to expand transportation options.\n2. Bike lanes are as crucial as sidewalks in our transportation infrastructure, and I use them daily.\n3. Instead of adding more vehicles to our roads, we should prioritize safety and create accessible options for vulnerable road users.\n4. When I drive, I prefer to see cyclists safely in their designated bike lanes rather than navigating through traffic.\n5. Bike lanes also enhance public transit by making it easier for people to access transit stations.\n"

I will save my energy from listing out everything but this will be devastating for small businesses, congestion, the cost of living, the climate crisis, human physical and mental health, air quality, and the international competitiveness of Ontario cities. Mayors should be responsible for their city's infrastructure. I am confident that this will slow vehicle traffic; There will always be a few cyclists who will ride on the streets and they will ride in the centre of the lane if there is nowhere else safe to do so.\nDo not pass this bill. It's deadly.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario resident, I am deeply concerned about the potential consequences of reducing bike infrastructure under Bill 212. Bike lanes are a proven, effective solution for reducing urban traffic congestion, improving air quality, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Cities that prioritize safe and accessible bike infrastructure consistently report fewer cars on the road, less strain on public transit, and reduced commute times for everyone, including drivers.\nRemoving or restricting bike lanes would undermine these benefits and force more Ontarians back into cars, ultimately worsening congestion and pollution. For those who rely on biking as an affordable, sustainable, and time-efficient way to get around, removing these lanes makes daily commutes longer, more dangerous, and more expensive. It also discourages others from choosing active, green transportation options, pushing our communities further away from environmental goals and healthier, safer streets.\nOntario's cities are growing rapidly, and we need transportation solutions that help people move around safely and sustainably. I urge the government to recognize the value of bike infrastructure as part of a holistic, data-driven approach to reducing gridlock. We should be working to expand, not limit, transportation options that benefit everyone in our communities.\n"

        "comment": "Cars worst enemies of congestion traffic is others cars, not bikes. Removing existing bike lanes in Toronto will not stop the traffic gridlock in this city. Many other main roads across the city without bike lanes continue to have busy traffic congestion of cars. Main roads like Bloor will continue to have heavy traffic even if bike lanes are removed. With many more condos currently under construction or with future plans to be built,  the population and density along Bloor will continue to rise. I ride my bike regularly & use the bike lane routes and hope they are not removed for just the car.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is nonsensical, and my arguments against it are as follows:\n1. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options.\n2. I use bike lanes every day and consider them essential transportation infrastructure.\n3. The provincial government should be concerned with guaranteeing the safety of ALL road users, particularly those most vulnerable, like cyclists and pedestrians.\n4. When I drive, I would much rather cyclists be out of the way in their own bike lane - this bill will put them in the road.\n5. In this day of growing inactivity, should the government not be encouraging any form of physical activity for its citizens?  Biking is a low cost and accessible option for transportation that frankly, gets people off the couch.  Making biking safer and encouraging more to be doing it safely should be supported not discouraged.  When much of the world outside of North America is investing in biking infrastructure for all the reasons mentioned above, how can you justify removing bike lanes and in so doing, encouraging inactivity?\n6. Finally, bike lanes are a low-cost investment that supports pre-existing transport infrastructure by making it easier to get to train stations and bus stops.\nThe people of Ontario need more transportation options as opposed to more red tape and bureaucracy.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212.\n1. It is obscene overreach by the province. City Planning is the responsibility of the city. The residence of Toronto vote to have the bike lanes.\n2. The bike lanes are good for business. This has been shown by numerous studies across north america. The bloor business association publicly stated revenue has improved with the bike lanes. Bikers and pedestrians shop at the businesses, while the motor vehicle traffic drives past them.\n3. It improves the community and atmosphere of the neighborhood. This not only leads to improved business but home values as well.\n4. Removing bike lanes will make traffic congestion worse, not better. Even a small percentage of those bikers being moved to cars will immediately overwhelm any gains from the additional lane. Bikers will still exist, and traffic will have to move at the pace of a bike.\n5. It misses completely other sources of congestion. By far the worst sources of congestion are left hand turns across traffic, right hand turns when pedestrians are crossing, illegal street parking (especially during rush hour), lack of signal priority for TTC, and motor vehicle volume. Addressing any of those would have a far greater impact.\n6. There is a lot of high rise development in the core. These people have to get around some how. The volume is absolutely impossible to expect cars for all of them.\n7. Parking for all those residences is extraordinarily expensive to build because it is all below grade.\n8. Removing the bike lanes will kill people.\n"

        "comment": "Bike Lanes are important. I live downtown and I would be using my car if I did not have safe bike lanes. The bike infrastructure down town has really encouraged me to bike more instead of use my car. I use my car when I am going long distances often out of the city. If lanes are removed, I will use my car more often downtown for safety reasons.\nI have had friends that have been injured when biking. Bike lanes reduce the risk of injuries. Bike injuries can have a significant impact on someone's life and can also be very expensive for our health care.\nWith the densification of Toronto, we need to make our public transit better and we need bike infrastructure. If cars are our only option, the gridlock will get worse with densification.\nBiking is important for health and in fighting climate change.\nAny plans to rip out bike infrastructure will cause more gridlock as it takes time to rip out bike lanes.\nIt will also be a waste of money as likely they will be added again as this is the progressive solution to building a better Toronto.\nWhat we really need is to get the Eglington cross town subway working. This will be an important step to reducing gridlock and be part of the logical plan for city infrastructure.\nI see momentum in bike lane use which comes with a better bike infrastructure. This is the better future for transportation.\n"

        "comment": "The construction of the new highway 413 is wholly unnecessary and counterintuitive to saving commuting time. Its construction will not produce a reduction in travel time, but in fact do the opposite as it will encourage more people to drive and thus increase overall traffic. To truly reduce traffic and congestion, we must give commuters and travellers legitimate public transport alternatives. The completion of LRTs and new subway lines in the city should be prioritized. Not only will this reduce congestion but also emissions and overall carbon footprint. Finally the new highways proposed path cuts through vital green belt farmland, groundwater assets and vital natural areas which serve as a refuge for the GTA\u2019s fleeting wildlife.\n"
