        "comment": "Highways are not meant to be built quickly. Highways take up so much land that simply assessing the whole land takes a long time, and can't just be ignored. By allowing this to pass we are opening ourselves to property seizure and destruction of our land with asphalt and concrete in the name of saving 30 seconds on average, for a limited amount of time. By allowing the province to perform expropriations without the chance for a citizen to appeal with a judge, all homes in ontario become at risk of expropriation simply because the province says a road should be there. This can be grossly abused through the approval of short connection roads that have no benefit, other than targeting an individual without the option for them to stop it. Even worse it's being used to take dozens of properties for the 413, removing the people from the communities its meant to help.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the new provincial approval process for the installation of new bike lanes:\nAs a licensed professional engineer specializing in transportation, I think this is a very poor item for the provincial government to deem a priority. The province should let municipalities make these local decisions, and stick with delivering transit projects on time. If you care to read the City of Toronto's website for information on bike lanes and travel times, you will see that they have a negligible effect. But they do encourage people to use bikes as means of transportation, meaning fewer motor vehicles on the road and less congestion overall. Sometimes this process take a couple years, but it does happen. It's called modal shift.\nIf this ill-conceived process does come to pass, who will review municipal applications and make the decisions about whether bike lanes should go in? The MTO? They specialize in maximizing efficiency for motor vehicle traffic, and do have have the expertise to make balanced local decisions about transportation. And how long will each process take? Does the MTO even have the resources for this?\nI think Doug Ford should stop trying to be mayor of Toronto and try riding a bike sometime.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should leave matters such as bike lanes to the municipalities. This is a clear overreach of power and targets bikers disproportionately, starting by tearing out three bike lanes in critical downtown locations. If this bill is supposed to provide a framework for determining the removal or addition of a bike lane, why do these routes automatically get a pass on that process? Additionally, removing bike lanes only increases the danger for bike and car commuters alike. Food delivery cyclists will be out on the roads working whether there are dedicated bike lanes or not, just as other commuters downtown where it just doesn't make sense to drive 5 km for 15 minutes when they could bike for the same amount of time. Removing bike lanes will not magically improve traffic in Toronto. The province needs to stay in their lane.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nWe, the city builders of the National Capital Region are writing to express our strong opposition to provincial legislation that would make it more difficult to build safe cycling infrastructure. As developers, architects, urban planners, urban designers, landscape architects, and transportation planners, we believe this decision would be detrimental to the safety, health, and overall well-being of Ontarians. Specifically, we urge you to reconsider the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\nIt's clear you are passionate about working to save people\u2019s time when they travel around their cities, it\u2019s right there in the title of the act. We are too! However, it is important to understand that prioritizing cars over bikes will not get people moving faster. It will however increase congestion, increase emissions, increase altercations on our roads and ultimately lead to more fatalities. We are not advocating for a war on cars, we simply want to provide the residents of Ontario with options to move around their city safely.\nLet\u2019s talk about why restricting bike lanes would not be good for Ontario.\nWe need alternative modes of transportation for the density and pace we are building at. We are in a housing crisis that needs homes built quick and at higher densities than what our cities currently have. Your provincial government, as well as the federal and municipal governments, have identified intensification as a key strategy to achieving our housing targets. Our cities are already choked with vehicle traffic and adding more cars to the road will not solve the issue. There is no space in our cities to endlessly widen our roads, instead we need to rethink how the space on our roads is currently distributed. Transit, walking, and yes, cycling need to be realistic, safe, and direct options for getting around our cities.\nBuilding bike lanes reduce congestion.  A two-way protected bike lane can move 7,500 people per hour whereas a single lane of vehicle traffic can only move 600-1,600 per hour, all while the bike lane takes up less space.  This is simple physics, a bike lane moves more people than a car lane does. To get that many people using our bike lanes, we need to continue to build a connected and safe network of cycling infrastructure. You said it best on Political Blind Date, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s not bike lanes\u201d.\nThe idea that bike lanes slow emergency services is also a misconception. The City of Toronto has studied how emergency service response time has changed after bike lanes were installed on Bloor and there has not been a significant difference in response times compared to the city average.  In fact, when designed and built correctly, bike lanes can speed up emergency response times as emergency vehicles can use bike lanes.\nBike lanes increase economic production. Bike lanes allow more people to access stores, encourage people to stay longer, and make it easier for people to move from one store to another. In the City of Toronto, installing bike lanes on Bloor Street has been correlated with increasing economic activity.  A study out of the University of Arizona showed that a $600 million investment in complete streets that included cycling infrastructure was associated with $6 billion in redevelopment investments.  For businesses to benefit the most, bike lanes need to be built on main streets, where our business are and where people want to go.\nAs cities across Ontario densify, protected cycling infrastructure is a key part of the future. It reduces our dependency on cars, alleviates traffic, lowers our cost of living, and helps to build greener, more livable cities for everyone. Ontario has the opportunity to be a leader in sustainable transportation by supporting, not restricting, cycling infrastructure.\nWe, the developers, architects, urban planners, urban designers, landscape architects, and transportation planners of the National Capital Region, urge you to reconsider the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, listen to the experts in the field, and position Ontario as a leader in the development of protected cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue.\nSigned,\nBrigil\nWindmill Developments\nTheia Partners\nDream\nTCU Development Corporation\nLinebox Studio\nHobin Architecture\nCSV Architects\nSiteform Inc\nPerkins&Will\nWSP Canada Inc.\nArcadis\nRe:Public Urbanism\nDS Studio\nArchitects DCA\nKadus Group\nS.J.Lawrence Architect Inc\n"

        "comment": "This law will waste taxpayer money. Removing existing bike lanes costs more than installing new ones. Removing a lane requires traffic to be shut down for months, causing even more traffic delays. How many roads do you want to have one-way traffic? Bike lanes have reduced congestion and improved travel times in every city where they've been implemented. There are fewer deaths and injuries to cyclists.\nRemoving bike lanes costs a lot of money, increases travel times, and ends up getting people killed. This law has literally zero points in its favour. It's another example of big government interfering with municipal matters. Vote no on the bill. Save money, save lives.\n"

        "comment": "This is a frivolous bill that should be rescinded. The City of Toronto has jurisdiction over Yonge St., Bloor St., and University Ave. / Avenue Rd., and the province has no business interfering in the City managing these roads (unless MTO would like to redesignate them as connecting links for Hwys 11, 5 and 11A and pay for them).\nBike lanes on these City streets have very little impact on congestion on southern Ontario highways, and I would urge the province to focus its attention on matters of provincial jurisdiction. Bike lanes are part of an overall balanced transportation strategy for the City, and the more we provide cycling infrastructure and encourage people to not use cars in the City the better off we all will be. Bike lanes enhance safety for all road users, will reduce congestion by getting more people out of their cars, will encourage healthier lifestyles, will reduce our carbon footprint, thereby making the City a more desirable place to live, work and play. We are eliminating the requirements for min. parking spaces in new developments in Toronto and elsewhere, and in its place adding more bike parking spots in new residential developments.\nRipping out bike lanes and facilitating more cars is regressive and sends the wrong message to those that have an interest in healthier lifestyles and wish to reduce pollution. Leave the bike lanes alone, and focus provincial interest and money on more critical matters in Ontario, such as dealing with the homeless and housing crises.\nThanks\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not causing congestion in the City of Toronto.  The massive number of drivers in the city are creating the congestion.  Larger roads with more lanes do not solve the problem as they will fill up with cars.  The solution is to provide alternative forms of transportation that reduce GHG emissions and allow folks to move more quickly and easily around the city.  Other cities in the world have made these changes and have seen the benefits.\nOther options for reducing automobile congestion:\n1. Improve bike infrastructure\n2. Improve mass transit, make it free\n3. Fee-for-use on major roads and highways\n4. Downtown congestion pricing - as Toronto grows, it's not possible for everyone travelling downtown to drive their car.  It's a physical impossibility of space.\n5. Close some streets to vehicular traffic\nI hope that MPPs will stand up for the hard-won bike lanes and support the growth of bike infrastructure to build a city that is not created for cars, but created for people.\n"

Bike lanes make travel by alternative means than combustion engines more accessible and safe.\nIt is despicable that the Province of Ontario is prioritizing inefficient, dangerous, and high-carbon emitting transportation means rather than supporting transit options that are faster, promote health, promote environmental action, and overall create a stronger sense of community.\nWho do you think wins in a situation where is it a person on a bike vs a one tonne vehicle? By removing bike lanes, and making it harder for municipalities to add bike lanes, and are directly impacting the safety of Ontarians.\nHow many more lanes and roads do you think will solve traffic? The answer is none. Doug Ford needs to prioritize rapid public transit and alternative means such as bike lanes.\nSome key questions:\n- If bike lanes are causing so much traffic, than why do highways such as the 401 (where there are no bike lanes), experience so much traffic? (I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s not the bikes causing traffic)\n- What type of studies or scientific information is being used to make these decisions? (A quick google search offers a wide variety of academic articles that provide evidence that bike lanes only increase delays slightly)\n- how is induced demand being taken into account?
