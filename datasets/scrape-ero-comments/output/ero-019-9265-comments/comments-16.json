        "comment": "This comment is specifically about the province's desire to remove bike lanes in Toronto.\nBike lanes reduce fatalities. Remove them, and more Ontarians die.\nRemoving bike lanes won't make commutes any faster - the outside lane on pretty much every street in Toronto is used for parking. People can't drive through parked cars. Want to create an additional driving lane? Ban on-street parking on major streets.\nIf y'all were actually serious about reducing gridlock, you'd be expanding cycling infrastructure, not removing it. More people choosing bikes to get around means fewer cars on the roads. More people choose to ride a bike when there is the infrastructure to safely ride them.\nAs for Ford's whole, \"bike lanes should be on side streets\" shtick, side streets have only one lane in each direction. There's no space to add bike lanes to them. (And no, sharrows aren't the same as bike lanes.) All of the bike racks are on major streets, not side streets.\nI thought Conservatives were supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility. But here you are, planning to waste taxpayer money to remove things that are benefitting Torontonians. Whose budget will the removal come out of - Toronto's, or Ontario's? Are you planning to give Toronto back the money that it paid to install them? Will the province be paying to build new ones on side streets? Businesses saw an increase in customers after bike lanes were installed. Is Ontario planning to reimburse businesses for the sales that will be lost by removing them?\nThe fact that three bike lanes have been slated for removal before there are any criteria for deciding whether or not a bike lane should be removed makes it pretty obvious that this is just another one of Ford's attempts to punish Toronto for rejecting him. Safety for cyclists needs to come before stroking Ford's ego. Leave the bike lanes alone, and stop trying to micromanage municipalities.\n"

Bike lanes reduce congestion, they do not contribute.\nAlternatives to driving reduce congestion, they do not contribute. Transit and active transportation options reduce congestion.\nRemoving existing bike lanes uses public funds that can be better used on healthcare or education.\nAdding additional review steps will slow down and paralyze municipalities when it comes to making decisions that benefit their local population.\nEvery person taking transit or utilizing active transportation is one less car on the road, leading to more room for people who have no choice by to drive.\n"

Cycling is a great alternative to driving but it feels inaccessible sometimes due to lack of infrastructure. More and better bike lanes should be developed in Toronto (and all Ontario cities) to support and encourage all residents who want to bike to be able to safely and comfortably.\n"

I use bike lanes everyday, from going to work, to getting groceries, and their removal would be detrimental to both my safety and that of others.  We need to think about the safety of road users OTHER than motorists.  Where do you expect us to go?  If I were a driver, having bike lanes keeps them out of car traffic, meaning both a safer ride for the cyclist, and a simpler drive for the motorist.  These bike lanes also support easier and safer movement to transit stations, overall increasing the effectiveness of the transit system.  Why build transit if it's impossible to get to it?\n"

        "comment": "Adding more lanes and more roads will only increase the number of cars on the roads, and increase traffic.  If you do this we will be gridlocked again in a few years and you\u2019ll be insisting more roads will fix it again.  It\u2019s expensive, environmentally unsustainable, and ultimately doesn\u2019t fix the problem.  We need viable alternatives to driving, please don\u2019t waste our money removing existing bike lanes.  The only way to reduce traffic is to give people safe and affordable alternatives to driving.  People should have choices about how they get around, and many people can\u2019t drive and need alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirstly, I would like to begin by pointing out the absurdness of using provincial power to micro manage municipalities. The premier has been steadfast in his unwillingness to require increased municipal development, so it begs the question why bike lanes are receiving different treatment.\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lanes is a waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by wasting billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be driving THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "I have read the contents of Bill 212 as well as the related debate proceedings so far. As an Ontarian, I am dismayed at the poor governance exhibited here.\nFirst, this bill is a mess in contents and scope. Is this bill about streamlining highway construction? Or increasing bureaucracy for city planning? There\u2019s a lack of cohesion and strategy here that reveals weak policy. There\u2019s plans to overstep municipal street planning. There\u2019s a proposed elimination of checks and balances in the development of Highway 413. There\u2019s intented forced removal of already constructed urban projects in the city of Toronto. There are major negative implications here on citizen safety and civic trust in our provincial transportation planning.\nSecond, I\u2019ll speak to the issue of cycling infrastructure. There is a level of unwarranted focus on cyclists in this bill that feels targeted with how small the scale of cycling lanes is in this province. The strategic removal of heavily used lanes on main streets in Toronto can only be viewed as politically motivated by MPPs who commute to Queen\u2019s Park by car. This would be a gross misuse of legislative processes for personal convenience.\nIn the debates, the members in favour of the bill bring forward only the perceived inconveniences experienced by a handful of their constituents as evidence for forced cycling infrastructure removal. This isn\u2019t where MPPs should be focusing their attention, on the whims of a disgruntled few with time to make calls and send emails. They should focus on the safety and mobility freedoms of ALL their constituents, including youth who cycle to school, couriers who deliver by bike, and others who rely on bike lanes every day for safe commutes and recreation.\nThose against permanent separated cycling infrastructure seem to view cyclists as some intangible \u201cother\u201d distinct from the rest of their community. No one advocates for the narrowing or removal of sidewalks in favour of additional lanes of car traffic. No one shrugs and says \u201cyou walk on the streets at your own risk\u201d to pedestrians who have concerns where sidewalks are missing or unsafe. We see news every week about cyclists who are injured and killed in mixed traffic and unsafe intersections in this province, and still this lack of care persists. Why the neglect for the public safety of cyclists? To anti-bike lane advocates: cyclists are not phantoms that materialize out of nowhere to inconvenience you. These are your neighbours, your friends, your colleagues, and your children going about their daily lives that you hold so much frustration and anger for. To MPPs in favour of Bill 212: these are your constituents you disregard, whose public safety you are accountable for.\nAssuming the intentions of the bill in good faith - what would it take to improve traffic in Ontario\u2019s cities? Traffic IS CARS. There is no other way to spin this. A focus on adding car lanes and highways can only increase the volume of traffic concentrated in cities, and increasing cyclists and transit users can only decrease the amount of cars on the road. The members in opposition to the bill bring up a wealth of other opportunities for transportation improvement across the province in the debates. Let\u2019s redirect traffic to the existing underused Highway 407. Incentivize employers to bring back pandemic-era work from home policies. Get people out of single occupancy cars and onto transit. Use those overextended provincial powers to finish the ongoing Metrolinx projects and increase capacity and frequency for regional commuter transit options.\nThere are better options than Bill 212, which presents no solutions for Ontario, only a politically-motivated onslaught against cyclists as a distraction for the government\u2019s shady intentions for highway development and mismanagement of provincial transit projects. Where\u2019s the forward-thinking? The evidence-based policy making? We expect better from our Minister of Transportation, our MPPs and our Premier.\n"

        "comment": "This act is unquestionably a joke. This Government has been lucky that they have no opposition, but it is starting to get ridiculous how they are treating residents of this province.\nIf you want to build your highway in the middle of nowhere, fine do that. But putting a culture war issue that has been invented solely to distract the public on bike lanes, so that you can build highways without following the province's own existing laws is just ridiculous. There is no reason for the Province to override municipal powers on this issue. Cities will have a chance to vote on city matters during the next municipal election.\nIf you want to build the 413 without the EA or whatever other nonsense, fine do that, you have a majority, pass the law, no one can stop you. But tying it up with a totally unrelated, and non provincial issue just for political points is quite honestly something that our Federal government would do. People voted PC for status quo, which meant municipalities keeping power over local roads. This government constantly is touting how the Feds should stay in their lane, maybe they should think about things a bit harder before they end up as popular as them.\n"

The bike lanes are essential for safe passage of cyclists on the busy street, without them cyclists will be in danger.

I do not drive downtown regularly. This bill does not affect me any way. Yet, I can't help but see it as incredibly ill-informed, divisive, ineffective and downright dangerous. As many people have been saying, getting rid of this bike lines will cost lives. But I also don't see it as lessening gridlock at all. If these bike lanes are removed, the cyclists aren't going to stop using these streets. Instead, they will just bike in lanes of live traffic which is a: more dangerous and b: just as bad for gridlock since now cars will have to be weaving in and out of each other to avoid cyclists. There is also the short-term pain to consider of the construction needed to make the changes. I cannot see a single good result to come out of this proposal and I do not want my public tax dollars funding this\n"

The bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University are an important part of our cycling infrastructure that encourages people to get around in ways that are not via car and therefore reduces congestion. Removing these lanes is short-sighted, embarrassing, a waste of tax payer money and most importantly will not have the intended effect. Short term, there will be construction causing a slow down. Long term, there will be more people in cars, not to mention bikes and cars forced to use the same lane, causing permanent traffic issues and dangerous situations.\n"

        "comment": "Here is my list of reasons why the bike-lanes plan will make roads more dangerous for cyclists and motorists, add unneeded red tape and move us back decades in both infrastructure:\n1. Removing or restricting bike lanes leads to more bikes sharing the road with cars, which is more dangerous and slows the flow of traffic.\n2. Commuting by bike instead of car means one less car on the road, which improves traffic for those who choose to or need to drive.\n3. Bike lanes, especially with physical barriers, are very safe. There have already been 6 bicyclist deaths this year, which is 6 too many.\n4. Provincial approval for municipally led bike-lane projects add unnecessary red tape, which is antithetical to the provincial government\u2019s agenda. Has Mike Harris Jr., Minister of Red-Tape Reduction, weighed in on this plan?\n5. Ripping up established bike lanes is a waste of money. Time and again studies have shown adding car lanes is not a universal fix for congestion.\n6. The existence of bike lanes is not a war on cars. I agree that we need a balanced approach that considers cars, bikes and pedestrians. There will always be people who rely on driving as a primary means of getting around urban spaces. However, I fail to see how such a restrictive plan, one that would pause or even undo Ottawa\u2019s progress in building safe and reliable biking infrastructure, is fair to cyclists. All of the arguments against bike lanes are based on shoddy anecdotal evidence without consideration for data on how they benefit motorists and cyclists alike.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill for the following reasons:\n1. Cost of implementation and burden on the government. This bill would increase bureaucracy and red tape by requiring public servants to administer, thus increasing costs to taxpayers. In addition, removing existing bike lanes would be a further cost to taxpayers at a time when we should be focusing precious tax dollars on things like health care (which is sorely underfunded in this province) and infrastructure that would actually reduce traffic, like transit projects.\n2. Safety. Removing existing separated bike lanes would increase the number of cyclist deaths. They have been proven to reduce fatalities so this is only going to cause more unnecessary deaths. At least 5 cyclists in Toronto have died this year, a number that has increased from last year and will only continue increasing if we move forward with this bill.\n3. Essential infrastructure. As a cyclist, I use bike lanes every day in the same way that, as a driver, I use roads and as a pedestrian, I use sidewalks. No one would ever suggest removing roads or sidewalks as these are considered essential for mobility, so why are we considering removing bike lanes? What makes them less essential?\n4. Predictability. Dedicated bike lanes provide predictability and structure for all road users. It does not make sense having slow moving vehicles like bikes sharing road space with cars that move much faster. As a driver, it makes things simpler knowing that I won\u2019t need to interact with a cyclist on a busy street.\n5. Not a provincial responsibility. Local governments know their communities best and should be empowered to make decisions that best fit their communities in consultation with their residents.\n"

As cycling grows in popularity, bike lanes offer a safer option for riders, separating them from cars and reducing the likelihood of accidents.
