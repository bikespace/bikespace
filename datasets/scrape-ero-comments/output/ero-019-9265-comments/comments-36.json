As a recent graduate working a new 9-5 office job it is difficult to find time for exercise in my new life. The bike lanes give me over an hour of outdoor physical activity each day and has a noticeable impact on my health and well-being. Removing the bike lanes will make it more dangerous for the many bikers that use them and I would not feel comfortable biking on the city streets. Please do not remove what little activity I get in my life.\n"

Study after study shows the positive impact of people bike lanes \u2014 people on bikes are much more likely to stop and spend their money in local small businesses than those driving past. Climate change is real and is an emergency. Making it easier for people to swap their car for a bike for some trips involves making cyclists safer. The move to increase provincial powers in municipal affairs is disheartening. As a voter, driver, cyclist and pedestrian I call on you to reconsider this bill and implement some eveidence-based solutions to reducing traffic\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to share my dismay at the Ontario government's decision to propose Bill 212. As a cyclist, I will have a decision to make to either 1) switch to driving (adding yet another car on the road) or 2) continue to cycle, and abide by the government's regulation, \"You do not need to stay to the right when...the lane is too narrow to share.\" This situation applies to many roads in the city, which means I will be riding in the centre of the lane in most instances, requiring cars to travel behind me (or pass me once the left-most lane is clear). Neither of these options will improve the driving experience for anyone, and will not lead to increased travel times.\nAdditionally, the legislation to remove bike lanes reduces safety for the large number of individuals who use bicycles in Toronto to travel between home and work, to school, to leisure activities, to visit friends, etc.  Bike Share continues to expand in the city (https://schoolofcities.github.io/bike-share-toronto/growth) and experienced 5.7 million bike trips in 2023 -- this means 5.7 million fewer car trips in the calendar year.\nAdditionally, every trip by bike helps to reduce damage to the environment. More people riding bikes reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and as an added bonus, leads to improvements in one's personal cardiovascular health!\nIt's a no-brainer that more bike lanes rather than fewer are what is needed for a large urban environment like Toronto. We need a suite of options for effectively moving the folks who travel through the city every day - reducing the number of cars, by making the city more welcoming to those who choose these alternate ways to travel, including by foot, by bike, and by transit.\nPlease listen to the research evidence that so many well-informed folks have been publicly sharing with you, so that we can continue to make Toronto a livable, strong city for all.\n"

        "comment": "I cycle, drive, walk and use transit in Toronto. The bike lanes on Bloor are an essentially biking commuting artery for me. If I did not have access to those bikes lanes I would likely be driving adding more driving congestion rather than decreasing the congestion. The evidence bears this out and demonstrates that cycling infrastructure helps to convert vehicular traffic to cycling traffic which ultimately will make the city easier for all to get around. The answer to the GTA gridlock problem is NOT to eliminate bike lanes. I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nAlso, there is absolutely no excuse for removing the need for environmental assessments for the 413 project and I have grave concerns around the province's ploy for power to expropriate land. This is deeply concerning.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI do not support the removal of any bike lanes. Particularly in urban parts of Toronto like bloor street downtown, danforth, university and yonge. Cycling has grown as a way to get around the city massively and the city has invested a lot of time and money into making sure cyclists can be safe. I understand if lanes will be removed in etobicoke where fewer people use them if the residents don't want them. However, it's clear that people living downtown do want bike lanes and do use them.\nThe city is growing more dense and bicycles offer a much more space efficient form of transportation. The province needs to invest in this as people want it and it helps reduce car dependency and the number of people driving cars. Everyone can win from cycling infrastructure including car drivers.\nPlease support all of your constituents and take a nuanced approach to your approach. There is no need for suburban transportation methods to be forced on people downtown who prefer walking  cycling and taking public transit.\n"

Bike lanes save lives.\n- The only way to reduce congestion is to make it so less people have to drive, something bike lanes do. People take the easiest option which in many cases is biking. If the people biking were instead driving, traffic would be way worse. This bill will worsen congestion, not make it better.\n- Bike lane planning cannot adequately be conducted at the provincial level. This is a municipal issue and a municipal decision. Regardless of the constitution. Cut the red tape!\n"

        "comment": "The Building Highways Faster Act that Bill 212 is proposing in order to reduce gridlock by speeding up the construction of Highway 413 and the creation of the Bradford Bypass will make little to no difference on users daily commutes. This proposed act does not make it clear that the government will not be completing environmental assessments for the areas that these roadways will be going through. The Bradford Bypass is proposed to go right through an important and strongly protected section of the Greenbelt, the Holland Marsh. The Holland Marsh is a very important provincially significant wetland and farming area. It has some of the most nutrient rich soils for growing crops in the province and many species at risk call this wetland their home. Flags have already been raised in past years about the construction of this highway. In 2021, concerns about how construction will affect three federally protected species at risk were brought to light. These concerns still exist and have been unanswered. Bill 212 discusses how they will manage environmental protection by discussing how construction will affect the surrounding communities with things like noise, dust and lighting but no mention of the impact this will cause to the biodiversity of the surrounding wetland and its inhabitants. Overall, the construction of these highways will impact the environment more than help people's commute. Bypassing environmental assessments on protected land could severely impact the population of a species at risk or even get rid of that population in the area all together. Saving commuters a couple minutes by reducing gridlock is not worth losing important protected wetland and species at risk.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing my comment to express my disapproval of Bill 212, especially schedule 4. Ontario has historically lagged behind in smart urban development, including adequate density, sufficient public transit, and especially cycling infrastructure. Given the urgent challenges of climate change and social inequality, I believe we must prioritize and expand these areas, particularly cycling. A bill that makes building new cycling infrastructure nearly impossible is a step in the wrong direction for Ontario. I am aware that there is more to this bill than just Schedule 4, but it is enough to dismiss all of Bill 212 even if there are some parts I might agree with. I believe this is an example of legislation created completely in the absence of expert knowledge and purely for political reasons, considering just about all current information around cycling infrastructure would contradict this bill. Another key thing to keep in mind is that just because this comment is written in a more professional manner with greater technical terms, does not mean you should just think of me as someone not in touch with the genuine sentiment of Ontario residents. I am also someone who will suffer from this bill, who will have added difficulty getting around, and will be dealing with this bills consequences for decades to come. I highly recommend Ontario's officials to veto Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I doubt that the bicycle path would warrant the expense. We frequently attend church at Bloor and Windermere. We leave our house near Bloor and Tomken at 10 am and return at noon. On two Sundays in March when the weather was sunny, we counted cyclists to and from chiurch. On neither Sunday was there a single cyclist using Bloor Street. Rather than forsaking two traffic lanes for cycle paths, I am astonished that the cycle paths were not proposed for the ample boulevards on either side of Boor Street. The cost would be much less than tearing up the existing  pavement and just paving two paths for cyclists on the boulevards on either side of the existing Bloor Street.\nSo I'm against the current proposal because the potential cycle usage  does not warrant the cost to provide it and because reasonable steps were not taken to provide it as economically as possible\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the proposal to reassess bicycle lanes. I live and work in downtown Toronto. I am a\nphysician. I ride a bicycle and drive a car in Toronto. The separated bike lanes added in Toronto\nin recent years (including Bloor Street and University Avenue) have made my commute much\nsafer, with fewer close calls. I am more inclined to bicycle to work, particularly in inclement\nweather, now that I can use separated bicycle lanes. When I drive (including on Bloor Street and\nUniversity Avenue), I have not found that the bicycle lanes have a\ufb00ected the driving time. In\nfact, I find it is new building construction that most often results in lane closures that negatively\nimpacts driving times. Municipalities, not the Province, are in the best position to determine the\nneed for and utility of bicycle lanes.\nRegarding the proposal to exempt proposed highway 413 from Environmental Assessment: it is\ninappropriate to bypass the act for particular projects. The intention and spirit of this act is\nspecifically to include projects such as highway 413, and to protect people and the environment\nfrom potential negative impacts of the project. Speeding up the project is not an appropriate\nreason bypass the act. I do not believe that we should be building a highway through some of\nOntario's best remaining farmland. I regularly drive on highways 400, 401, 404 and 407 and\nwhile I could potential benefit from using the proposed highway 413 for some trips, on\nbalance do not think it's worth it given the high cost and negative environmental and social\nconsequences. Furthermore, there is evidence that the extra capacity from building new\nhighways only temporarily improves travel times until the new highways reach capacity.\n"
