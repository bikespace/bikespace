        "comment": "I am not in support of this proposal as this goes against environmental efforts to reduce emissions and build sustainable infrastructure throughout Ontario. Bill 212 proposes building Highway 413 through Ontario's greenbelt. If built, it will destroy forests and wetlands and imperil precious farmland. It threatens to extirpate the red-side dace, a fish listed as endangered under the federal Species at Risk Act. It will incentivize car travel, jeopardizing Canada\u2019s ability to meet its climate targets. If a mega-highways can be built through greenbelts, no forest in\u00a0Canada\u00a0is\u00a0safe.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I would like to highlights the important of bike lane as they make our streets safe and provides access to sustainable and active transport. In the long term, more development can be created around the bike lanes, which will create a structure centered around their use. Having bike lanes helps Metrolinx and TTC in their goals of decreasing carbon emissions, and increasing the share of people biking to their stations by creating safe places where people want to bike. The City of Toronto public opinion and municipal government are strongly in support of municipal bike lanes, as well as municipal control over the process. The province stepping into the city's affairs in order to legislate specific design choices is a terrible overreach of their power.  This also wastes public money, since the of city of Toronto already spent money building new bike lanes this year. It will waste the city's money to tear them out, and will unnecessarily harm public trust in government planning. Since the bike lanes were so recently built, tearing them out will unnecessarily damage the public's trust in the government to accomplish meaningful goals. I urge you to not move forward with this harmful proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 must be opposed because it prioritizes car-centric infrastructure at the cost of the province's climate goals, without any meaningful reduction in traffic. This bill proposes to force through Highway 413 through the Ontario greenbelt. The Greenbelt is an area of protected land of crucial ecological significance, which also helps support human life in Ontario. The Greenbelt protects particularly key forests that sequester carbon, farmland that provides food to Ontarians and economic revenue to the province, and wetlands that sequester carbon and filter drinking water that the province uses. Highway 413 would destroy this ecologically and socially crucial land. It would also cause great harm to the endangered red-side dace, a fish that is federally recognized as endangered under the Species at Risk Act. This highway will also induce greater demand for car usage, meaning that it likely will not have a significant impact on traffic or travel times within the province as more car drivers pour into this space. Ontarians will not gain a reduction of travel times under this act. However, Ontarians have much to lose from the continued loss of the greenbelt. Since there is very little benefit provided for the likely costs, this bill will be a net loss to Ontario residents and therefore should be opposed.\nInstead, of prioritizing highways, regional rapid transit should be prioritized.\n"

        "comment": "Key question: What if we\u2019re doing the math wrong\u2026not thinking through potentially grave, unintended consequences for this province.  (With apology for the very hasty writing.  I learned of this opportunity too late. Also for the lack of clear structure. All formatting of numbering and bulleting of points was stripped away in pasting this into the submission form.)\nThis proposed bill takes as its starting point that the easy flow of the automobile is the number one criteria to be optimized in infrastructure planning.  Opposition to this proposal often centres on environmental concerns (in the case of highways) and personal safety and preference in terms of built urban environments\nFor the purposes of this submission, I am focusing exclusively on the government\u2019s plans to reduce bike lanes in the GTA, and would like to briefly raise three separate questions, that focus on potentially unintended but significant consequences of this decision, quite apart from the environmental impact, or the safety of riders.\nCONTRIBUTING to future congestion, rather than diminishing it.\nWill removing bike lanes actually work to deliver against intended goals: i.e.  alleviate congestion -- or ultimately aggravate instead?\nLet's say, to begin, that our only concern is the average commute time in and out of downtown Toronto, for those who live outside of the city.  Congestion is high\nCommuters are spending some between 1.5 and 4.4 minutes more commuting\nThe thinking is that If we remove bike lanes and add an additional lane for cars, traffic will move more quickly.\nThis is/would be true only if the volume of cars stays constant -- or at a minimum increases less than the new road capacity gained.\nBUT the volume of cars will almost certainly increase owing to two effects\nINDUCED DEMAND: If the relative convenience of cars is increased vs other modes of transport, car volume will increase\nSUBSTITUTION EFFECT: At least some portion of existing bicycle traffic if forced to start driving more.\nA huge customer of bike lanes at this point is deliver\nCommuters\nAs a result, FEWER bike lanes is ultimately like to result in MORE cars on the roads, and MORE congestion, not less. And in surprisingly short order.\nIf we turn back the clock now on the impressive progress that the city has made in \u201cinducing demand\u201d for cycling as a mode of transport -- how will we accommodate the transportation needs of the anticipated growth in population of the GTA\nThe population growth of the next 25 years (3.5 million) is expected to be more than the last 25 years.\nYet, our capacity to build new roads within the GTA is severely constrained by a lack of vacant space -- esp in the downtown core.\nWe simply cannot rely on cars to connect us to work, play and each other: Cars\nDesigning a car-centric transportation strategy for Toronto risks big implications for other critical areas of public policy priorities in Ontario\nCONTRIBUTING TO THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS\nIf residents own cars, new housing must accommodate them.  Adding parking to new construction adds $100K+ to building costs which must then be added to purchase price.\nParking lots consumes an enormous amount of space that could and needs to be made available for housing and recreation.\nIn the highly sought after residential Danforth neighbourhood, for example, the G&M reported 1parking lots within a 1.5-kilometre stretch.\nSiphoning limited household funds to car ownership, rather than allowing households to focus savings on housing.\nThe average Canadian who owns a car, spends $1387 MONTHLY on all car related expenses.  This compares to $1759.  Many of the people who are struggling most\nProviding Ontarian with meaningful alternatives to a car can almost double the disposable income that a household is able to maintain\nCONTRIBUTING TO OUT OF UNSUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH\nTwo of the most significant sociological drivers of our escalating healthcare costs -- are drivers that have strong correlation with daily exercise (even just walking to, and taking transit) -- and NEGATIVE correlations with time spent in car commuting.\n1. Obesity:\n\u201cEach additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6% increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8% reduction in the likelihood of obesity.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15261894/\u201d\n2. Addictions and Mental Health\nPhysical exercise -- basic daily movement -- is broadly acknowledged to be one of the most effective, and least costly tools to affect mental health outcomes.\nAs well: Direct system costs of car accidents -- to drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians.\nHealthcare costs in Ontario attributable to car-related accidents are estimated at $1.6 billion.\nLess congestion = more speed. Speed kills (and injures\nBy focusing on a transportation and infrastructure that is balanced against all modes of transport: walking, cycling, transit and cars -- we can reduce these direct costs, and perhaps most importantly, the tremendous societal cost to individuals and families of these automobile related accidents.\n"

        "comment": "The Premier needs to stop making rules for the Province whenever something annoys him about Toronto. He is NOT the major of Toronto and there is an entire other territory outside of that city.\nI can only believe that Premier Doug Ford WANTS cyclists, the majority of whom are also drivers, to die. He wants them to fill the non-functioning hospitals because he wants to tear up bike lanes that keep them safe.\nMore bike lanes encourages more people to cycle and that reduces cars on the road. This entire thing doesn't even have the effect he's seeking (but adding millions of people to Ontario and not building infrastructure sure does).\nThe idea that he would waste $48 million tax dollars undoing bike lanes and ENDANGERING Ontarians and once again interfering with cities is appalling (oh - and when we WANT interference like the ability to recall municipal councillors like Rick Chiarelli in Ottawa, then we get nothing from Premier Ford). $48 million on top of the upcoming $2 million pre-election bribe to tax payers. On top of the last pre-election bribe taking tax money away from health and education and giving it to drivers.\nMaybe he should get busy having another wedding so he can get bribes for developing protected land - at least that doesn't endanger people.\nFinally, I DO NOT agree with exempting Highway 413 from Greenbelt regulations or the Environmental Assessment legislation. It should ONLY be done in compliance with the laws. It requires environmental oversight.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, in particular Schedules 2, 3, and 4 relating to highway construction, provincial approval of bicycle lanes, and removal of bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto.\nI strongly agree with the submissions provided by various organizations in opposition to the provincial upload of bicycle lane approvals and the proposed removal of bicycle lanes in Toronto, including the City of Toronto, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, and Ontario Traffic Council. Bill 212 proposes needless and harmful provincial intrusion into municipal planning and engineering authorities. It will create red tape that will delay and increase costs for bikeway and other road construction projects. The fact that so many transportation and planning experts oppose this legislation demonstrates the lack of evidence supporting the proposed legislation.\nRoads should be designed and built with consideration of its use over all times of day, not just peak periods. Roads designed to accommodate peak hour demand are overbuilt for much of the rest of the day, encouraging higher speeds which increase the frequency and severity of collisions. Roads that are overbuilt are also more expensive to build and maintain. This legislation will be an obstacle to projects that reallocate road space on roadways for bicycle lanes, driving up costs of future municipal and provincial infrastructure projects due to the need for larger roadways, longer or wider structures, and more relocation of curbs, drainage, and utilities to implement bikeways in the boulevard.\nReallocation of motor vehicle capacity to other modes improves road safety for all road users, not just people cycling. Road diets are a proven countermeasure to reduce collisions, as researched by the US Federal Highway Administration. In addition to pedestrians and people cycling, it's likely that more motor vehicle drivers and passengers will be seriously injured or killed as a result of this bill. Instead of getting home a few minutes quicker, a higher number of motor vehicle users will end up going to the hospital instead, or never make it home at all.\nIf the Province wants to spend money supporting congestion relief in Toronto, there are many other projects that would be more effective than removing existing bicycle lanes. Any funding should instead be used for more productive projects to relieve congestion, such as targeted modifications to address operational needs on these corridors (including for accessibility), more adaptive \"smart\" signals on these and other corridors, more frequent GO bus and rail service, and measures to reduce duration of vehicle lane, bicycle lane, and sidewalk closures on Provincial projects.\nThe proposed creation of an entirely new and dedicated approval process for bicycle lanes is even more red tape. In the past, certain bicycle lane projects - particularly those involving lane removals - were subject to the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process. This process is a frequently used process with which professionals in government and the private sector are well acquainted. If Bill 212 is passed, the regulation should adopt existing approval processes for which there is an established and familiar process, preferably the Municipal Class EA or its proposed successor.\nI am also opposed to the Highway 413 Act, exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, the Highway 413 project as a whole, and other proposed measures to accelerate highway construction, such as those related to property acquisition and overriding of municipal by-laws that may limit work.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto\u2019s Davenport riding.   The nature of my job is such that my job site is always changing, and it is therefore essential for me to own a car and drive to work most days.   I also love to ride my bike around the city and will take any chance to use my bike to get somewhere when it is convenient.\nAs a regular driver and occasional cyclist I am vehemently opposed to bill 212 for the following reasons:\n- [ ] I feel much more comfortable driving when I am separated from cyclists.  I\u2019m not worried I\u2019m going to hit them.  And of course I feel more safe cycling in a protected lane than in a lane with cars.  Bike lanes prevent deaths.\n- [ ] Bike lanes give people alternatives to driving and transit.  This makes for less cars on the road.  The removing of bike lanes will likely not speed up traffic, there is plenty of research that supports this.\n- [ ] a conservative government should not be promoting adding red tape and bureaucracy to the development of transport networks in cities.\n- [ ]  We should be building towards a carbon-neutral future. And building bike infrastructure is a very cost effective way of doing so.\n- [ ] There is no feasible east-west route on side streets to replace the Bloor lane. The major arteries are the only roads that cut uninterrupted through the city of Toronto\n- [ ] The exemption of the planned highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act would allow for significant damage to natural heritage, hydrological features and to the Greenbelt system, robbing us of ecosystems that keep us healthy\nThe idea of removing bike lanes to speed up traffic is nonsense.  I suspect the bike lane issue is just a distraction from the easing of environmental protections to get the 413 built.\nThis bill is rooted in ignorance and corruption.  The corruption of the premiere himself in seeking to open up our greenbelt to wealthy developers.\nThis destructive bill will only serve to keep us trapped in the age of car-dependent development, and really just reflects an antiquated view of the world.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI\u2019m writing as a deeply concerned citizen to oppose Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. This bill threatens the heart of our communities, the environment, and the safety of Ontarians. By exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, this legislation allows irreversible harm to sensitive Greenbelt lands, which are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. Environmental Defence has shown that this highway will destroy over 400 acres of critical natural habitat.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a huge step backward. These lanes don\u2019t just help cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. My two children are avid cyclists and I fear for their safety in the absence of these bike lanes.  Plus, local businesses benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Why would we take away something that helps people get around safely and supports our economy?\nPlease reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that brings people together, not policies that divide us and harm our future. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-centered transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\n"
