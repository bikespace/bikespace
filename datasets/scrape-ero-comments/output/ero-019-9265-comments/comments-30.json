        "comment": "This is an incredibly frustrating bill to be tabled that is not based on evidence whatsoever. As someone who lives in Toronto, bike lanes are incredibly important to SAFE transportation in the city. I have always wanted to be a cyclist, however, I live on Bathurst St and refuse to put the life in the hands of rushed drivers in two lane traffic. If there was a bike lane on Bathurst, then I would certainly cycle for my commute. Apparently it needs saying that bike infrastructure encourages cycling which is not only better for the environment, it also encourages healthy living and gives mobility to people who cannot afford a car. There are oodles of studies that will tell you that more traffic lanes only serve to increase traffic. Look at LA. I am not going to sit here and quote studies, because I know for a fact that there are two brilliant Urban Planning Departments just steps away from Queen's Park. So, listen to experts, and you will quickly stop debating this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212 (removing bike lanes).\nIt\u2019s common sense that a solution to gridlock in Toronto is prioritizing infrastructure for pedestrians (public transit) and people on bikes (dedicated protected lanes)\nOne bike using a bike lane = one less car on the road\nCounter arguments:\n- an entire lane for parking on Bloor\n- cars are inefficient for transporting a large number of people, while taking up a disproportionately larger % of the road (typically not carpooling)\n- fiscally irresponsibly to remove bike lanes  and a waste of public resources\n- not to mention, greater safety, health, & environmental benefits with cycling\nDriving downtown is exhausting. Give commuting by bike a try, it\u2019s amazing and a real alternative.\nThe arguments against needs more data and I do not believe in the 1.2% number Doug Ford shares as it is dated and also not representative of reality.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes through the city of Toronto and particularly on Bloor St are an essential mode of transportation in the city. They increase accessibility and already contribute to a reduction in traffic by increasing the number of people cycling. People will always cycle through the city, however to do so without a bike lane with barriers from traffic will greatly increase the risks. The fatality of cyclists is a much more likely outcome if the bike lanes are removed. I personally bike instead of driving to work and I only feel safe in doing so because there are barriered bike lanes on Bloor St. Please do not remove them as they are so essential for safety. I do not wish to live in a city with we take away safe, essential and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. This would be a tragedy for our city and I gravely worry for everyone\u2019s safety if this bill proceeds. The people of Toronto have spoken, please respect our need for bike lines with barriers.\n"

You want to ignore EAA regulations so you can build highway 413 as fast and as cheap as possible.\nI hope you have evidence that this is not the case.\nYou would only be wasting tax dollars removing  bike lanes and ignoring EAA regulations.\nIf you remove bike lanes bikes will take the road and cause actual congestion. Keeping them in separate lanes makes life easier for everyone.\n"

You know the government has access to the same information as everyone else showing sales have increased due to bike lanes and a reduction in traffic on Bloor. This will hurt my business all in the name of 1960 debunked city planning. This is big government anti business.\nWhy is the government pushing through a bill to override common sense rules and regulations preventing stupid useless highways to nowhere. My sales will go down and now I have to pay for a waste of space highway.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal of bill 212 is uncalled for. Time and time again, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure has contributed to lower injury and death rates across the world. North America is knows for it's inhumane and hostile car infrastructure that leads to obesity rate, and death. The Ontario Government shouldn't be placing red tape to municipalities who want to increase OTHER OPTIONS than driving.\nWHEN YOU PROVIDE OPTIONS TO PEOPLE OTHER THAN DRIVING, THEY WILL USE IT MORE. Statistics over the past several years have shown steadily increasing use of cycling and pedestrian infrastructure in areas where there is the option. Quite frankly, North America is ridiculed for it's lack of pedestrian infrastructure and hostile road design. People are dying. Not just cyclists and pedestrians, but people in cars too. Sometimes it can take several years for use to go up, but it increases every year.\nADDING ONE MORE LANE DOES NOT SOLVE CONGESTION. Providing different options other than driving does decrease congestion. In fact, adding one more car lane induces demand for unaffordable cars. Having the option not to drive, saves Canadians money. My husband and I have one car, and we we only ever have one car, or no car. I use public transportation, and bikes lanes and sidewalks everyday. I regularly feel in danger on my bike in traffic with no cycling infrastructure and also on certain sidewalks. We save money by only having one car.  Having the option not to drive, saves Canadians money. Doug Ford is price gouging the Province of Ontario to make more money on cars. He is out of touch with a large portion of the people of Ontario.\nWhen I do drive, (which is what I do professionally, operating a bus, 8 hours a day, everyday), I would much rather cyclists be completely separated from car traffic, so that the risk of hurting or killing the human being on a bike is greatly diminished. It is safer for everyone on the road. Cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.\nBike infrastructure supports public transit investments, as bike lanes are usually connected to the transit stations. We want people to use public transit as it has proven to reduce congestion and the province has put so much money into transit investments. Not everyone can drive.\nWhen you build it they will come.\n"

The removal of the lane closures all along Avenue Road, north of Bloor, as well. For instance, eliminating a full lane of south-bound traffic on Avenue Road at Dupont Street is now a new major contributor to major traffic backups causing unnecessary and extended travel times by car.\nb. Avenue Road between Lawrence Avenue and St. Clair Avenue is subject to several unusual traffic bottlenecks. Traffic flow improvements should be investigated here as well.\nc. This bill should also consider the removal of parking [for automobiles] on these major roadways.\nThank you!\n"

        "comment": "Dear Provincial Representatives,\nI am concerned with the decision of the Province to remove the bike lanes on our roads. I use these regularly during my commute and these protected bike way are necessary piece of infrastructure that promotes, road safety ( reduces automobile traffic and speeds). The city needs more alternatives to get around the city with having amenities accessible via non-automobile commutes is essential to a vibrant city. The bike lanes are a step forward, which need more time to show its full benefits.\nThe province needs to consult the experts in these fields rather than unilaterally going against it for short term political gain to the detriment of generations to come.\nThank you for listening and I hope proposal 212 is reconsidered and stopped. Also the city of Toronto can make its own decisions on what is best for its residents and we don\u2019t need the provincial body to overstep. Look at London and Montreal for examples\n"

        "comment": "I have a number of concerns with this proposal.\n1.  It does not clearly identify an actual problem that: a) isn\u2019t already addressed through existing legislation b) that would require a *legislated* response vs. other approaches e.g. project management, collaboration, negotiation.  If anything the proposal appears to be a misuse of law to avoid said other approaches.\n2.  municipalities are extremely important for understanding and serving local populations and constituencies. It appears that a key purpose of the proposal is to undermine municipal authority and autonomy of decision-making.  The key question on this point has to be \u201cwhy?\u201d; surely the province doesn\u2019t want to have the responsibility for fulfilling the role of municipalities themselves.  However, using legislation to automatically over-ride municipal input/concerns etc. also means undermining the voices of all Ontario residents.  So while the proposal promises to \u201cSave You Time\u201d it also promises to do so by \u201cMaking You Silent\u201d.\n3. The Environmental Protection Act and the associated processes of assessment exist to protect the public interest.  I understand that there may be room for improvement in these processes, especially between Federal and Provincial governments.  And the \u2018other approaches\u2019 listed in point 1. could be exercised to great effect.  The proposal appears to suggest that \u2018priority projects\u2019 would be exempt from environmental assessment and protection, or subject only to minimal requirements. This is not acceptable.\nIt is not acceptable, under any circumstances, to sacrifice public interest and the long term sustainability of provincial farmland, food security, water tables and water quality, air quality and natural habitats, migration routes etc. for something that *may* only serve a small fraction of the population.  And, this is assuming that there is a case for new highway development.\n4. It is unclear why the \u201cpriority projects\u201d have been selected at all, never mind made priority.  There are many options for transportation. Highways are one.  What about all the others?\nIf there was an argument for having new legislation, it might be to support a comprehensive, integrated, multi-use provincial transportation plan, developed in collaboration with municipalities and the Federal government.\n"
