        "comment": "This proposal would make Ontario and less and less liveable and desirable place for all of its residents. Bike infrastructure is integral to the operation and success of cities. The solution to congestion has been proven time and time again to increase mixed modes of transportation (which cycling is a huge part of) instead of catering to drivers, most of which are single occupancy. Removing vital cycling infrastructure will inevitably lead to more drivers, more congestion, and more dangerous and toxic environment for all of the citizens. I also strongly oppose the powers the bill would grant to circumvent environmental policy to build more highways. It is 2024. We know that climate change is the biggest existential threat to our planet. This bill would only accelerate this threat, and as a resident of Ontario, I am outraged, disgusted and embarrassed.\nCyclists are not going anywhere. We don't cycle just as a choice, for many it is a necessity. By removing lanes and barriers, you are not removing us from the transit equation, but are removing the only safety measures we have. If this bill passes, all future cycling injury and death that could've been avoided by having bike infrastructure will be blood on this governments hands. You wouldn't imagine removing safety barriers on the sides of highways, so why would you do it for the least protected commuter?\nThere is sufficient data from a multitude of trustworthy sources that prove that cyclists are not the cause of congestion, and that they are in fact part of the solution. Premier Ford is using cyclists as a scapegoat to fool everyone into turning against them.\nThese are conclusions drawn from and surmised from The Biking Lawyer's website (Dave Shellnut):\n\"EMS vehicles are not delayed by bike lanes in getting folks to emergency rooms as confirmed by the City of Toronto\u2019s EMS leads.\nThere is not a petition of 50,000 people against the bike lanes on Bloor. It\u2019s more like 13,000 who\u2019ve signed over several years now and Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition in support of bike lanes is approaching that number in just weeks.\nBike lanes are good for business! They boost sales in areas they are installed, attract higher spending clientele, can increase property values, and even attract talented work forces.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion, they move people around more efficiently, create safer driving routes (less collisions, less congestion), and get people out of single occupancy motor vehicle, which actually are the cause of congestion.\nSide streets are not the answer. Unconnected segments of bike lanes that force cyclists to take circuitous routes on various side streets will not encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes;\"\nFinally, this is complete government overreach. It goes against many of Doug Ford's alleged values as a Conservative politician, and would be a complete waste of tax dollars. Even a single dollar spent on removing newly installed, expensive public infrastructure, would be an absolute waste.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's chokehold on Toronto's infrastructure is wildly unethical. Torontonians invested in bike lanes. The Province has no business choking the city's infrastructure investments at the behest of non-Torontonian commuters. Toronto's infrastructure should be built for Torontonians (many of whom bike), not for non-Torontonians (who may commute in). Torontonians demand agency over our own infrastructure. Stay in your lane, Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver who lives in St. Catharines, and regularly drives in Toronto and Grey County. This act seems so harmful and backwards. The two most egregiously foolish elements are the destruction of valuable and prime farmland and watersheds for the 413 which, which will not make a substantial benefit for drivers, and the new rules around the creation of bike lanes. I strongly prefer driving on city streets with bikelanes, and they keep both me and the cyclists safer. These both feel like embarrassingly backwards moves, and I hope they will be rethought before wasting billions of dollars of our tax payer money to make Ontario a worse place to live and to drive.\n"

Please don't make the same mistake again with the 413.\nDo not touch the Greenbelt to build the highways. Do not touch the Greenbelt. This is just so disappointing.\nThe constant overriding of municipal decisions is just so undemocratic and unfortunate. I encourage my children to learn and consider all options. This bill is yet another item added to a destruction legacy.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who rides their bike weekly for transportation, I am very opposed to Ontario requiring provincial approval for bike lanes that remove a lane of traffic. I am also opposed to the removal of sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in Toronto.\nWe have seen time and time again that \"one more lane\" does not sustainably reduce traffic congestion. Having safe, separated bike lanes where people can choose to participate in active transportation does. We need to induce demand for transportation choices that promote human health and environmental sustainability, not ever more vehicle traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an incredible waste of time and money and will actively make our streets less safe and slower for all users. Ripping out existing infrastructure that exists and is used is an incredibly wasteful use of taxpayer money.\nCreating additional meddling and red tape to have cities' infrastructure built and approved, by requiring the provincial government to sign off on everything, is also incredibly wasteful. Whatever happened to reducing government meddling and reducing inefficiencies?\nShould this bill pass, the Conservative party will forever lose my vote. Whether municipalities are a creation of the provincial government or not, stay in your lane. Focus on provincial matters and stay out of municipal politics.\n"

        "comment": "Putting bypass highways as a priority form of infrastructure planning is the absolute wrong path to choose in attempting to alleviate vehicular gridlock. Highway 401 was constructed as a bypass highway through Toronto in the mid 20th century. Then highway 407 was built as a bypass to highway 401 in the early 21st century. Now the planned Highway 413 will be a bypass to both roads? It has been consistently proven that the 'one more lane' (or in this situation 'one more highway) is not effective in reducing road congestion.  If there is any excess capacity in our roads and highways, our vehicular dependent society will overload it until it is not efficient anymore. In addition relying on private vehicular transportation is the absolute least efficient way to transport people from.one point to another.  Consider the space that a single vehicle takes up on the road, and compare it to the carrying capacity of a bus. Even assuming there is more than one person travelling in a car at a time, a bus or train that is at 50% capacity far exceeds the effectiveness for transporting people. If the Premier and elected members of the Conservative Party who are blaming the traffic issues while driving in the GTA only need to look at themselves for being a part of traffic they so despise. If there were feasible mass transit options for people to commute in and out of the GTA along the Highway 401 corridor, people would make the choice to take a bus or train! This will reduce the amount of vehicular traffic on the highways which improves the strain on the highway for people who need to use those roads.\nIn addition, the details in the bill that will provide the Minister of Transportation powers to reject municipally proposed bike lanes when they are proposed to replace a vehicular lane is dangerous to vulnerable road users and will be a financial strain on the taxpayers in Ontario.\nFirstly, the Ford government prides themselves on being \"open for business\". This part of bill 212 creates more red tape for hundreds or thousands of active and potential infrastructure projects in the Province of Ontario. Creating additional bureaucracy for construction through the provincial approval of municipal affairs will stop municipal infrastructure projects dead in their tracks, negatively impacting jobs provided by the construction of these infrastructure projects.  As a civil engineer in Ontario, I am well aware of how ineffective the provincial government is when it comes to obtaining approvals on development and infrastructure projects, and there is no reason to think there would be any changes with this new bill.\nI think the proposed sections of the bill in relation to the removal is an absolute ghastly waste of municipal and provincial tax payers money. Why remove a piece of valuable infrastructure that was recently implemented and is positively impacting traffic congestion? The estimated 48 million dollars to remove the existing bike lanes in Toronto is an absolutely immature way to spend taxpayers hard earned money. That is also not to include the municipal funds that were used to recently construct the infrastructure. Also, not to mention the negative impacts to traffic gridlock from the deconstruction of recently implemented road infrastructure will cause the exact opposite of what this bill is proposing to solve in the first place.\nNot only will the proposed changes in this bill not reduce gridlock, or save people time, they will also be a heavy burden on the taxpayers and make roads more dangerous and ineffective.\n"

        "comment": "This is a disgusting act of overreach by the provincial government. The bit about the removal of bike lanes being exempted from the environmental assessment act is telling. These transportation planning decisions (and I'm including the highway here) by the Ontario government have no basis in fact. They WILL make gridlock worse. They go against established best planning practices and against the trend of what every other major city on earth is doing\nI oppose this act in the strongest possible terms\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are extremely important for the safety of the growing number of cyclists, from children all the way up to the elderly. As vehicles are becoming larger and more dangerous, sharing the road is not sufficient to keeping these people safe. Cycling is an important mode of transportation for those who cannot or choose not to drive, and as an environmental option for both short and long distances. It is the responsibility of the government to keep their people safe, and cars are extremely deadly to anyone who isn\u2019t inside of one.\n"

Reduction of the bike lanes on major roads doesn\u2019t prevent bicycles from travelling on these roads or parallel streets where gridlock will continue to build up, it just makes it less safe for them to do so and gives impatient drivers the semblance of efficient roads.\n"

Looking at options that involve the 407 including subsidizing tolls in the section of the 407 that the 413 would run parallel to is one, making some other deals with the current owners of the 407 is another.\nThis bill is very disturbing and I would like the government to reconsider most of this bill.\n"

        "comment": "This comment will not matter because the government is not interested in doing what is best for the community or what is evidence-based. The Ford government repeatedly cites a decade-old and irrelevant figure to paint an inaccurate picture of cycling in Toronto. There are much more relevant figures available to the government but they choose to manipulate public perception and pander for political gain. I am not going to cite those numbers here because I am certain that the government is already aware and choosing to ignore these.\nOur metrics for evaluating projects should consider the efficiency and safety of movement of PEOPLE, whether they are in vehicles or not. Prioritizing one method of transit is a narrow view and will lead to higher costs, longer travel times, and deaths. This is in addition to additional economic losses created by undermining our transportation systems.\nWith an ever-densifying Toronto (based on provincial targets), the best way to move PEOPLE can only be achieved with a holistic view. Transit alternatives such as the Eglinton LRT can have a massive impact on vehicle traffic and travel times. Cycle paths such as those on Bloor and University are already moving numbers of cyclists that are comparable to vehicular traffic.\nNone of this is news to the current provincial government. Unfortunately, though, they are choosing to pander to their supporters at the cost of the economy and public safety - all while stoking divisions within the province. This is not leadership.\n"

        "comment": "This Act is a terrible idea from the Ontario government that will result in more deaths due to cyclists being forced to share the road with motorized vehicles on busy streets, and more pollution by encouraging more motorized vehicles on the roads. Additionally, this Act would enable the province to override the transportation planning within municipalities, which in cities like Toronto, would mainly benefit individuals who do not live in the city, rather than Torontonians themselves. Continuing to build more highway infrastructure will never result in less traffic and gridlock, as building more highways will only continue to encourage more people to get on the roads with their personal vehicles. Instead, the province should be focusing their efforts in building better infrastructure for public transportation, and safe cycling infrastructure, as this would allow more people to be moved in cheaper, more sustainable, and healthier ways. If the efforts in attempting to pass this Act and the resources that would be spent thereafter, would instead be redirected on creating more public transportation infrastructure, the benefits would be experienced on a much larger scale.\n"

There has been a huge uptake of cycling in recent years, especially through the Bike Share network. Eliminating existing bike lanes would have a catastrophic impact on the momentum that we have built. It would also be disastrous for cyclist safety.\nI live in downtown Toronto and cycle nearly all year round. The downtown bike lanes, especially on University and Bloor, are essential for my well being and transportation needs.\nThe best way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road, not by ripping out bike lanes that were just installed for a few extra meters of car space which will quickly be filled in by more cars. Please do not take Ontario backward by prioritizing cars over sustainable, active transportation choices.\n"
