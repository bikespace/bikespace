It has been proven that more lanes don't reduce traffic.\nEven with bike lanes, motorists don't respect cyclists, but maintaining the bike lanes adds a layer of protection and visibility. Removal of the bike lanes leaves cyclists completely vulnerable.\nPlease invest the money that would have been spent on bike lane removal on more reliable transit and TCC infrastructure.\nWe are in North America's 4th largest city. We are not entitled to having no traffic. If people are going to drive downtown, they should expect traffic. Cycling, walking and transit are more accessible, sustainable, and reliable. We should be investing in the future, not the past.\n"

        "comment": "If bike lanes that keep your constituents from dying cause traffic, why is there traffic on every single road in this province when 99.99% of them don't have bike lanes?  Its cause cars cause traffic, not bikes.  People on bikes are trying to go to work and shop in the area.  If this goes through, it will hurt business as cars don't buy anything, people do.\nHas the government stopped to consider why not a single road expansion in history has reduced traffic?  Why do they think this time, this time will solve traffic when this approach has never work any other time, in any area of the province or world.  Why would it work here.  #InducedDemand.\nThis bill is bad for business, bad for residents, bad for traffic, bad for the environment, and will kill people for zero gain.\nCan the government tell me why I am second class citizen who they are fine with dying at the hands of a car?  Why is it not important for me to get to work or shop?  Why is the government trying to push this through with data from 1990?\nWhy cant cars take a parallel street since they wont be stopping to go in any of the stores?  Also there are no parallel routes, why must the government lie so much about this bill?  Is it cause there is nothing good about it so they need to lie to say anything.\n"

        "comment": "Nothing about this bill will save me (or anyone) time or reduce gridlock.\nThe proposed exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act is extremely irresponsible. The EA is not only intended to reduce environmental risk, which in itself should be enough of a reason, but it also identifies any issues early on in the process. This way, you won't build on a swamp or floodplain where the highway will inevitably sink or be flooded. This highway is completely unnecessary and this legislation is being pushed forward to skirt essential due diligence.\nI have already submitted a separate comment on the bike lane legislation, but my brief opposition is as follows: bike lanes don't cause congestion, they improve traffic flow; the province is ignoring data that doesn't fit their narrative; vulnerable road users deserve safe routes to travel on; side streets are not a viable alternative for the same reason they aren't for cars; ripping out existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer dollars; and this is a serious overstep by the province.\n"

Also, you want to solve gridlock with more cars... How will more cars solve gridlock? Removing bike lanes on Bloor will hurt businesses.\nCars are terrible and constantly getting into accidents, so you are removing bikes while adding more accident prone cars?

It is also regularly packed with cyclist also using it daily for the same purpose. The separation from traffic keeps us safe from harm. When I take other routes with no lanes, I am often weaving in and out of traffic and putting myself at risk.\nMost cities around the world are moving towards active transportation to improve the wellbeing of citizens and the planet. Cars cause congestion and pollution. The way to reduce traffic is to reduce cars on the road. Safe active and public transportation options create viable alternatives.\nI implore you to reconsider and instead take action to reduce cars on the road, for our health and environment.\n"

        "comment": "Please reverse Bill 212 as it is not based on valid data for informed decision making that prioritizes the health, safety, sustainability, and economic prosperity of Ontario residents and businesses. Consider this analysis and the objections pasted below from experts, BIAs, and advocacy groups:\nIt won't reduce gridlock or save time. Motor vehicles and infrastructure that prioritizes them cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place (read: induced demand).\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nThis move is out of line with other provincial priorities, such as growth targets, efforts to boost transit, and the current e-scooter micromobility pilot program.\nWhy we need more (not fewer) bike lanes:\nA few key reasons why municipalities across Ontario have committed to building bike lanes, which are likely familiar to you:\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\nBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\nReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nCycling is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life, reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nThere is a wealth of evidence in support of building bike lanes.\nStatements from expert groups, associations of businesses, and community groups:\nBloor-Annex BIA: https://x.com/dmrider/status/1849123389937508607\n\u201cPremier Ford has asked for the installation of bike lanes to be evidence-driven. Well, all of the evidence we\u2019re seeing tells a very compelling story - bike lanes are good for business, they improve safety for all road users, and reduce congestion.

        "comment": "After reviewing Bill 212 and its contents, I think the passing of such a bill would be detrimental to Ontario's fragile ecosystems and should be reconsidered. First, the bill promises accelerated building processes of infrastructure by reducing the time spent on analyzing the environmental impacts, and allowing work to be started before the assessments are completed. This can lead to important environmental characteristics being overlooked, and therefore allowing infrastructure to be built and further degrade Ontario's already hurting wildlife. Also, the passing of this bill would make highway 413, along with other works, a priority and practically force it to be built. This action will jeopardize endangered species which have habitat along the outlined area of development, and diminish our greenbelt. Ontario's environment minister needs to step in and subject highway 413 to a new review, and help save our fragile environment before it's too late.\n"

The reasoning behind this decision is factually incorrect. As someone who was born and raised in this city and is an avid cyclist, I genuinely fear for my safety once the bike lanes are removed- and am disappointed in the province interfering with municipal jurisdiction. Biking is a cost effective, accessible, efficient transportation method. By removing bike lanes, the province is removing the access to a safe and reliable form of transportation. In addition, the province is ignoring and dismissing the significant health benefits and environmental benefits of choosing to bike over driving. This is an absolute shame and speaks volumes of the PCs priorities.\n-27 year old Toronto resident.\n"

They require more public space per passenger mile--so are a less efficient use of that space.\nMunicipal Finances\nRoads and car infrastructure are expensive.  Municipalities across Ontario are struggling to build and even maintain the road networks needed to support \u201ccars first\u201d transportation.\nIn municipalities such as Ottawa, (which has a \u201crevenue shortfall\u201d) the huge investments in road building and maintenance are crowding out expenditure on other important public goods and services.\nMunicipalities, whose revenues are constrained by their narrow tax bases, tax increase commitments and dependence on other levels of government for funding, will not be able to support ever-growing road networks.\nCycling lanes are a fiscally responsible means to increase transportation capacity in Ontario, at a lower cost than roads dedicated primarily to cars.\nRecommendation:\nRemove section XII from the proposed legislation.\n"
