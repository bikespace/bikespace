        "comment": "BIKE LANES KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMY.\nThere is no valid reason to be against bike lanes. Bike lanes keep both cyclists and traffic safe. If there weren\u2019t any bike lanes, cyclists would be in the road with traffic, causing delays and slowing down cars. Not to mention how many more accidents and road rage incidents it would cause.\nPrioritizing bike lanes also has statistically improved businesses and the economy.\nAs well, not everyone can afford to 1. own a car 2. pay for insurance. Bikes are extremely accessible for those who can\u2019t drive or can\u2019t afford to. This improves quality of life (also because it\u2019s a great physical activity!) Parking a bike is also free whereas parking with a car can get horribly expensive in the city.\nWhy would you want cyclists to be put in danger and slow down traffic when there is a way to 1. Improve safety 2. Improve quality of life and promote fitness 3. Help businesses and the economy 4. Keep traffic running smoothly?\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will only make congestion worse \u2013 to prioritize bike safety, cyclists will need to ride in the center of a lane to remain fully visible which will only impede higher speed traffic. Moreover, the resources and energy to uproot established cycling systems is much better directed at other issues, instead of spending money to uproot infrastructure which is prioritizing the safety of Toronto citizens. As for toronto\u2019s green goals and lower emission, this can only be supported by protecting cycling infrastructure and encouraging more people to cycle. In addition, this would reduce traffic congestion as you get people who would usually resort to vehicles for mobility encouraged to bike short distances instead. This further perpetuates an inclusive city, as lower income people are safely able to utilize cycling infrastructure to traverse the city as well.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives in Toronto and uses the bike lanes every day I\u2019m extremely concerned by this proposal. Bike lanes increase safety of citizens and over time decrease congestion by getting people off the roads. They should be implemented in ways that are guided by experts in transport planning and not by politicians. I hope that this government seriously rethinks this proposal.\n"

No highway project should be exempt from environmental assessments, and Ford should NOT have a say in which bike lanes get put in Toronto's streets, and other city's streets. Removing bike lanes will make traffic worse, cause deaths, and harm local small businesses.\n"

        "comment": "The portions of Bill 212 dealing with bike lanes are wrong-headed and counterproductive.  They will lead to more gridlock, less safe streets (for bikers, pedestrians, and car drivers), and will have an adverse effect on local businesses.\nAll this is well known, and could easily be confirmed with a modicum of research.\nI live on Yonge Street, in an area served by a bike lane.  I moved to this location, in part, because it offers multiple travel options: car, bike, walking and transit.  Despite being a senior, I use all of these options on a regular basis, and removing bike lanes would potentially put my safety at risk.  There is no reason to believe that removing the bike lane would result in any permanent reduction in automobile congestion, as more cars would certainly fill the new lane (refer to studies of \u201cinduced demand\u201d).\nIn the strongest terms, I urge the Ontario legislature to reject this bill.\n"

        "comment": "My comment is in firm opposition to the proposed Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, specifically the introduction of a new provincial approval process for the installation of new bike lanes.\nThis particular section of the act would only exacerbate gridlock as bike lines have a net positive benefit on traffic congestion. See key statistics provided by the Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) below and at the following link:\nhttps://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/10/24/which-nasty-and-terrible-bike-la\u2026\nBloor Annex BIA bike lane stats:\nEVIDENCE-BASED HIGHLIGHTS: (Source \u2013 Bloor Annex BIA)\n\u2022 Monthly customer spending and number of customers in the Bloor Annex increased after bike lanes were installed\n\u2022 Retail vacancies in the Bloor Annex have not changed in eight years since bike lane installation\n\u2022 Road safety for all users has improved since the installation of bike lanes resulting in fewer fatalities and better road safety outcomes for all road users\n\u2022 No evidence of increased emergency response times due to bike lanes said chiefs of Toronto Paramedics and Toronto Fire to city\u2019s Infrastructure & Environment\n\u2022 Putting bike lanes on residential streets would have an extreme negative impact on street parking for residents\n\u2022 Bike lanes reduce congestion\nBY THE NUMBERS:\n\u2022 1 million: approximate number of cyclists who rode the Bloor Street bike lanes between Avenue Road and Shaw Street between February 2018 and February 2019\n\u2022 8,000: number of cyclists per day that Bloor Annex BIA believes currently use the Bloor bike lanes today\n\u2022 9 years: number of years that Bloor Annex bike lanes have been part of complete street renewal\nThis is an argument for practically every bike lane built in Toronto, not only just for Bloor Street (of which I use nearly every day as a cyclist). But let\u2019s talk about Bloor St. since Premier Ford has signalled his intent to rip up previously installed cycling infrastructure that has proven to be effective at reducing congestion, improving safety, and increasing revenues for small businesses (see above link for Premier Ford admitting his intention to remove specific bike lanes with absolutely no data to support it).\nBloor Street is the road I use more than any other to visit businesses and shop. I use it to go to the Royal Museum of Ontario with my wife and I use it as part of my  weekly journey to Kensington Market (from my home in the Dovercourt Village area)  for pub trivia with my wife and her family. Without the Bloor bike lane and others in the surrounding area (Shaw St., Grace St. Harbourd St., College St., Palmerston Blvd., etc.), I would be less inclined to travel at all for buying goods and services. Sure, I might take transit or walk, but if transit happens to be slow or down and the weather\u2019s bad and I don\u2019t want to walk, well, I\u2019m not going to make those trips. I should mention that I bike year round unlike what the Minister of Transportation may say and I do so in practically all weather so long as the City keeps the road reasonably clear of snow and ice on the few occasions when these are serious impediments. So yes, I am a cyclist who rides his bike even in the winter months and not much will stop me from doing so.\nLack of safe infrastructure would be the main reason for me to not ride my bike and, absent the bike lanes I would need to feel safe, I well tell you now that Toronto small businesses will not be getting nearly as much money from me should the bike lane provisions of this act become law. I would instead pay online retailers such as Amazon who can quickly get goods to my door without me having to risk my neck on a then unsafe bike ride to local stores. This is an economic argument against both ripping up existing cycling infrastructure and stymying planned infrastructure as this Act intends to do.\nOn the subject of safety, it is plain that this Act would do nothing to improve the safety of vulnerable road users if the only bike lanes that could be built are those that would not reduce vehicle traffic and it would absolutely endanger cyclists who have come to rely on the key bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge. I would encourage the Province to work with the City of Toronto whose Vision Zero Road Safety Plan (https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation\u2026) is gradually being implemented with the goal of \u201creducing traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on Toronto\u2019s streets.\u201d Despite this plan, six cyclists have been killed so far in Toronto out of a total of 36 road users in 2024 (see Vision Zero Dashboard in the above link). I put it to the Provincial Government that the benefits to road safety alone justify the continued expansion of Toronto\u2019s cycling network, which is one aspect of the City\u2019s Vision Zero plan. We know that when protected cycling infrastructure is installed, not only does it incentivize more people to bike instead of driving their cars, it also calms traffic flows as well by forcing cars to slow down. Enforcement via police or speed cameras can only go so far as we have seen on Parkside Drive where there is no bike lane, which has witnessed 1,487 collisions between Aug. 2014 and Aug. 2024, seven of these \u201cresulted in five serious injuries and three deaths.\u201d https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/parkside-drive-bike-lanes-1.7353\u2026\nLastly, it must be said as the Bloor BIA has already stated, \u201cbike lanes reduce congestion.\u201d The Premier and his Minister of Transportation have yet to provide a shred of evidence that the presence of bike lanes contributes to congestion in Toronto. To date, all I have seen are anecdotes and uninformed opinions/blatant falsehoods (e.g. Toronto winters are six months long and no one rides in winter). One thing I do agree with the Minister on is his statement in a recent opinion piece (https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/ontarios-transport-ministe\u2026) in the Toronto Star where he suggests that \u201cwhat we need is a common sense, evidence-based bike lane policy.\u201d The key word here being \u201cevidence-based.\u201d If the Minister can demonstrate with actual facts that bike lanes in Toronto add to congestion, then by all means proceed with this legislation. The fact that neither he nor the premier have done so indicates that there are no facts and there is no foundation to needlessly centralize a process that is best left with Ontario municipalities. Instead, perhaps the Minister can lead by example and take the GO Train to work. This would take one more vehicle off the road and perhaps inspire others to leave theirs behind as well.\nI want to finish by mentioning that my wife will be giving birth to our first child in January 2025. We are overjoyed and can\u2019t wait to introduce our son to walking and cycling in his community. We also do not own a car because it\u2019s frankly not necessary and too costly for us. We were able to make this decision because we have other options available to us instead of driving a car. There are many businesses within walking distance on Bloor St., for example, where I feel safe walking because cars can only go so fast with one lane of traffic going each way. Additionally, equipped with two paniers that attach to my rear bike rack, I am able to do practically all of my errands on two wheels. Yes, that includes grocery shopping. Doing so saves me buckets of money, it keeps me (relatively) in shape, and my carbon footprint is much lower than any of my car-owning neighbours. Those same neighbours don\u2019t have to compete for anywhere near as much road space with me as my bike is significantly smaller than any car and I never use street parking.\nI want to live in a city and a province where both levels of government actively work to reduce both congestion and fossil fuel emissions. It is abundantly clear that investing in public infrastructure so that more Ontarians walk, bike, and take public transit, will accomplish both of these goals. Tying the hands of municipal governments and effectively preventing any new cycling infrastructure from being built only exacerbates congestion and encourages more people to drive. Simply put, this Act will make traffic worse not better. I don\u2019t want Toronto and Ontario to go backwards on this very important policy area for many reasons, but, most of all, I implore the provincial government to eliminate this section of the bill because I am fearful for my son. One day he might be out on the streets of Toronto on his bike and I pray that he doesn\u2019t become yet another road casualty for no other reason than the Premier of Ontario thought he didn\u2019t deserve safe cycling infrastructure. He does and so does everyone else. I beg you to do the right thing and let Ontario cities build bike lanes free from provincial government interference.\n"

        "comment": "I believe bike lanes are carbon friendly transportation options essential to the growth, evolution, and densification of cities: single users cars are among the least efficient methods of transporting people within a city.  This has been demonstrated by major population centers globally, with major population centres with a high considered quality of life all having significant and growing cycling infrastructure.  This bill will not only be regressive and increase gridlock in major cities (Toronto) but act contrary to global trends.  Let Toronto manage it's transportation solutions through evidence-based decision making.\nLastly, we owe it to our cyclists to design infrastructure which is fast, efficient, and safe.  Such a design would encourage more users, and decrease gridlock in a space constrained city.\n"

        "comment": "There are a few problems with this proposed legislation.\nFirst, there does not seem to be any reason that these particular highways are a priority in any way that justifies special treatment. If it has been decided that they need to be built they should be subject the same rules as any other highway project. If some sort of priority process is deemed necessary, than there should be a clear process for determining that and not simply the minister making that decision.\nCorners not cut in the construction of highways in general and non of the measures being proposed seems warranted.\nLastly, bigger picture, if the goal is the reduce congestion the focus should be on actions that would have more on an effect. Building more highways is likely to only lead to a temporary improvement as the extra traffic encouraged will in the long run add to the levels of traffic being funnelled in the routes supposedly being relieved. The measures that need to be taken are pricing of road use, incentives for more efficient use of the road network, improvements of alternatives to roads (for both passengers and cargo), and incentives to use of alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Bloor West Village since 2004 and in Ontario since 2002. The Conservative Party of Ontario seems built on the assumption that the effete progressives of Toronto are shoving our lifestyles and values down the throat of suburban and rural Ontarians. Yet all I have ever experienced is the opposite. This is yet another example. We LIVE here. Why don't our voices matter more than the people who visit a few days a week? We do not get to, and should not be able to, dictate things like whether a conservative leaning town in rural Ontario gets a bike lane. So why do suburban and rural conservatives get to do that to us? We like these lanes. They offer a different mode of transportation and they calm traffic. Yes that means you'll move more slowly through our neighborhoods, but is it so hard to understand why that might be desirable from a public safety standpoint. Yet another case of Ford ramming his values down the throat of people who don't want them. He wouldn't allow \"downtown elites\" to dictate what happens in his tony Etobicoke neighborhood. Why should he and his political gang be able to do that to us?\n"

        "comment": "I want to know how this will affect biking infrastructure in the city. I worry that by trying to reduce traffic on busy streets bike lanes will be taken away to make room for more car lanes. I am a frequent biker and commute to work every day by bike, and already feel as though there aren\u2019t enough safe bike lanes in the city as it is. I believe that bike lanes reduce traffic by encouraging people to bike instead of drive. I hope that all of the bikers are being considered in these new plans to reduce traffic. Taking away bike lanes will not stop me from biking but it will make me feel a lot less safe. The number of biking accidents and deaths in the city is an issue that I think could be heavily reduced by ensuring proper bike lanes. While I am all for reducing traffic by creating more highways and lanes, I also believe more vulnerable commuters like walkers and bikers should be prioritized over drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, aimed at reducing \"gridlock,\" is criticized for potentially harming public health, safety, mobility, and the environment. The bill's requirement for provincial approval of new bike lanes that replace traffic lanes is seen as an overreach of government authority and a lack of trust in local democracy. This approach contradicts extensive municipal planning processes that include research and community input.\nThe concept of Induced Demand suggests that adding more car lanes actually increases traffic, contrary to the bill's objectives. Critics argue that to truly reduce gridlock, the government should invest heavily in transit projects and comprehensive cycling networks. Bike lanes are highlighted as an efficient use of road space, with each cyclist representing one less car on the road. Additionally, areas with bike lanes have shown increased success for local businesses.\nThe bill's impact on cycling infrastructure is a major concern. Cycling is presented as a healthier transportation option that leads to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Bike lanes are also credited with improving overall street safety for all users and providing greater accessibility to those who can't afford cars. The removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto is criticized, given their high usage and the recent cyclist fatalities in the city.\nThe bill's proposal to exempt Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments is viewed as short-sighted and potentially disastrous for the environment. Critics argue that paving over environmentally sensitive land will permanently destroy natural habitats, carbon sinks, and flood control measures. The exemption is seen as a disregard for environmental concerns and contradictory to the goal of reducing gridlock. The summary concludes that Bill 212 will likely worsen gridlock, public safety, local economies, and health outcomes while causing irreparable environmental damage.\nThis is one of the most regressive bills I have seen in a very long time, and I will never vote for anyone who has supported this bill\n"
