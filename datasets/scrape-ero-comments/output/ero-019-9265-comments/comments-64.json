        "comment": "Ontario is experiencing rapid population and economic growth, particularly in urban centres and surrounding regions. This growth demands a modernized approach to integrate land use and transportation planning to accommodate increased development while maintaining the ability to move people and goods effectively. On a municipal level, cities are responsible for providing safe and efficient transportation networks for all users. Cities achieve this by using a variety of tools available to build wisely and maintain effective, affordable and connected transportation networks:\n\u2022\tcities are obligated and committed to provide public service facilities, including roads and active transportation corridors with a goal to reduce traffic and create safe roadways that include multiple options including walking, cycling, public transit and driving;\n\u2022\tbike lanes are an integral component of a connected system that supports inclusive and complete communities in accordance with the direction of provincial policies; and,\n\u2022\tbike lanes are a tool to help ensure that road design is convenient, equitable and provides options for people to access their daily needs.\nProper planning for growth is an essential service municipalities must provide for the benefit of all people living in Ontario. Without careful planning the increasing development could:\n\u2022\tcompromise the integrity of existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tlead to increased congestion, reducing the efficiency of transportation corridors, goods movements and transit;\n\u2022\terode environmental sustainability, including impacts on green spaces, agricultural lands, cultural heritage and waterways;\n\u2022\tcreate challenges for municipalities in balancing infrastructure investments with growth needs; and,\n\u2022\tadd to a growing asset base of infrastructure for which municipalities are not able to sustainably afford the full lifecycle costs of maintaining those assets.\nBill 212 introduces measures contrary to the principles of good planning, including those in Environmental Assessment Act, municipal Official Plans and the Provincial Policy Statement. The proposed Bill establishes an additional bureaucratic layer for infrastructure improvements, contrary to Provincial initiatives to reduce red-tape. The proposal will restrict municipalities\u2019 ability to plan, design and implement safe multi-modal transportation systems in accordance with community-developed and Council-approved visions and priorities.\nTo support growth while still moving people and goods effectively, Bill 212 should be revised to:\n\u2022\treinforce municipal authority to align development with existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tsupport municipal initiatives to encourage travel by transit and active transportation, recognizing these modes are more cost effective and more efficient in the long term;\n\u2022\tprioritize policies that support investment in transit infrastructure and active transportation, ultimately with a goal of building communities with reduced car dependency; and,\n\u2022\tmaintain protection of natural and cultural heritage features through a strong and robust environmental assessment process for major highway corridor projects.\nBill 212, in its current form, undermines the very transportation and land-use planning principles necessary to support Ontario\u2019s growth. To ensure sustainable development, the legislation must be amended to reinforce integrated planning, preserve strategic transportation networks, and align growth with economic, social and environmental objectives.\nThe need for a rethink of this Bill is reinforced by the outpouring of statements and positions being released by countless organizations representing  the many professional fields that grapple with the intersection of land use planning, infrastructure investments and planning our transportation systems daily. We support the positions to revisit this Bill put forward by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, the Canadian Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Ontario Traffic Council, the Association of Ontario Municipalities, the Ontario Public Health Association, Good Roads, the Ontario Association of Architects, the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects, and countless municipalities across the Province of Ontario.\nCity of Peterborough staff would be happy to assist provincial officials in making improvements to Bill 212 that would achieve the stated goal of reducing gridlock through evidence-based approaches. Further, we would be willing to assist the Province with development of new policies and programs to support municipalities in their efforts to plan and build efficient and connected transportation networks for all users.\n"

        "comment": "Opposition to Bill 212 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (ERO: 019-9265)\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Building Highways Faster Act, 2024. While I understand the importance of improving infrastructure, this Act raises significant concerns about environmental protection, community engagement, and public accountability.\nEnvironmental Concerns:\nThis Act disregards critical environmental safeguards. Wetlands in the Greater Toronto Area are already essential for minimizing flooding and mitigating climate risks. Paving over these natural defenses without thorough environmental reviews will cause irreparable harm to ecosystems, endangering both human health and local wildlife. Accelerating highway construction without proper study risks amplifying flood risks and destroying habitats critical to Ontario's biodiversity.\nAdditionally, investing in expansive highway construction contradicts Ontario\u2019s commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Public funds should be directed toward sustainable transit systems and renewable energy infrastructure that align with climate action goals rather than perpetuating reliance on car-centric development.\nMunicipal Overreach and Inequity:\nOntario municipalities are already struggling financially, leading to eroded trust in government decision-making. This proposed legislation further undermines local governance by granting the provincial government sweeping powers to bypass municipal bylaws. This overreach ignores the unique needs of communities across the province and centralizes authority with an out-of-touch government at Queen\u2019s Park.\nThis inequity is particularly concerning for cities outside the Greater Toronto Area, including Ottawa, Sudbury, North Bay, Thunder Bay, and Sault Ste. Marie. Time and time again, provincial investments disproportionately benefit Toronto while municipalities in other regions are neglected. This Act not only strips local governments of their authority but also fails to provide meaningful resources to address infrastructure needs across Ontario.\nProperty Rights and Fairness:\nThe removal of legal protections for property owners is deeply troubling. Eliminating the right to appeal expropriation timelines under the Expropriations Act undermines fairness and leaves individuals vulnerable to undue hardship. Landowners deserve the ability to protect their interests and negotiate timelines without the looming threat of accelerated government action.\nConclusion:\nIn its current form, the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 sacrifices environmental protection, public accountability, and local decision-making in favor of hastened timelines. I urge the Ministry of Transportation to reconsider this legislation and instead pursue infrastructure solutions that respect Ontario\u2019s natural ecosystems, empower municipalities, and prioritize sustainable development for all regions of the province.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to urgently oppose Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. This legislation raises serious concerns about the future of Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and communities. By exempting Highway 413 from environmental assessments, the government is bypassing crucial protections for our natural resources. The Greenbelt, which this highway will cut through, plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity, preventing floods, and absorbing carbon emissions. Environmental Defence has shown that this project will destroy over 400 acres of environmentally sensitive land.\nIn addition to environmental damage, Bill 212 promotes car dependency by removing essential bike lanes. These lanes aren\u2019t just for cyclists\u2014they make our streets safer for everyone, reduce traffic congestion, and help lower emissions. They also boost local economies, as businesses on bike-friendly streets benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Removing this infrastructure will make our cities less accessible and less sustainable.\nHighway 413 will cost over $8 billion\u2014a staggering amount for a project that won\u2019t reduce gridlock. Decades of research show that building more highways only leads to more cars on the road, worsening traffic and emissions. Ontario should focus on expanding public transit and cycling infrastructure, which deliver far greater economic and environmental benefits.\nBill 212 is not the solution Ontario needs. I urge you to abandon this legislation and instead focus on sustainable, forward-looking transportation policies that benefit all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Hello as a permanent resident for the last year of Canada, working in the advertising technologies industry, one of the great draws of Toronto was its versioning cycling culture. This great city design was one of the things that drew me to move to Canada from the United States. This draw of talented professionals is now endangered by the premier who claims to be focussed on increasing business in Ontario.\nAdditionally, the reach of this bill goes against cities rights to self-determination. Wow, constitutionally the province can overrule cities the cities, and the people that live in them have a right to determine how their roads sidewalks by lanes transit, and any other infrastructure is executed. It only makes sense that the people that have to live every day with these decisions Are the ones who get to make them. It should not be determined by those who happen to commute through certain neighborhoods. While the need to accommodate multiple types of transportation is a parent the benefit of having multi Moto main thorough affairs is greatly apparent to me as I commute through the city daily , I make daily use of the bike lanes, particularly on poor and University additionally the proposal to use side streets as bike lines either would make cycling a secondary form of transportation which it is not or would put cyclist intermixing with traffic, causing even greater congestion, potentially, though of vehicular cycling are much greater to the cyclists and then the drivers . Cycling can be efficient because cycles are space efficient but they are so space efficient that 70 or 80 cyclists an hour in each direction of a bike claim are almost unnoticeable 70 or 80 cars an hour take up a tremendous amount of space. And if we look at the side streets of Toronto , there are almost no side streets that run the length of lower East west or university north south in fact in those examples there are zero side streets that are suitable for that. To make Mike lanes through side streets viable, we will have to use as we did for cars eminent domain to knock down  Houses in neighbourhoods to make straight efficient bike lines. Now I am not really proposing we do that but we have done much more destructive options in order to accommodate drivers.\nThe lowered amount of space from the bike lanes is quite minuscule, and it is shown that more lanes do not typically improve traffic flow. In fact, it could be seen that having fewer lanes can make drivers pay more attention and react quicker because there are fewer distractions coming in from other lanes. Additionally, there is the discussion of cost ultimately vehicle taxes, and gas taxes are insufficient to cover the cost of roads in order to make this plan work. It may be necessary to implement tolls on city streets or raise property taxes. Since property taxes are a major revenue stream that is used for roads and mini cyclist, pay property taxes, and of course sales taxes, which are used  For roads logically follows that cyclist should get cycle lanes. Additionally, the biggest logic is that for everyone who is on a bicycle there is a good chance that they could be driving a car and we know that the biggest driver how much traffic there is is how many drivers there are.\nBike lanes, especially on these main thorough fairs, greatly improve safety make Toronto and more attractive city for hard-working highly skilled professionals and save lives and infrastructure cost. Getting rid of them and causing the province to interfere with Toronto and every other municipalities right to determine how their infrastructure is created is a horrendous and something that we will surely regret. Please do not pass this bill. It will not do anything that it says in the title, and it will needlessly endanger the lives of cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Hi There,\nIt disappointed me when I first heard the news that the Province was considering removing bike lanes. As a resident of Toronto, with a car, the bike system in Toronto is still my favourite way to commute around the City. When I'm travelling within the City, I use the bike system, before driving and before public transit. My boyfriend bikes every day to and from work with lanes along the road through his whole journey. We love how bike friendly the City is with the bike lanes and feel extremely safe biking here, which plays a significant role in our decision to use biking in the City as our main form of transportation.\nIf we reduced the amount of lanes, I may resort to calling more Ubers or begin driving (which doesn't help with the traffic issue). We want to promote healthy ways of commuting around the City and find alternative solutions to traffic issues. Possibly reducing public transit costs, or removing street cars?!! We shouldn't be taking away bike lanes after we spent so much work and money putting into the City in the first place.\nThanks for listening. I hope this made a little bit of difference!\n"

Not only will this bill add more red tape to municipal governments, but the bike lanes in Toronto were approved by democratically elected local representatives. Bike lanes are what Toronto wants and has voted for. Bike lanes make streets safer for all road users. As a mother, I much prefer bloor street with bike lanes. I feel safer taking my kids on bloor street to shop/go to a restaurant with less traffic speeding by right next to the sidewalk. I also use the bike lanes to get to work and removing them will put me in danger. Bloor, University, and Yonge street should be main streets and not highways for the rest of the province to get downtown faster.\nThis bill is a distraction and is based on politics and ideology instead of facts and evidence.  It will do nothing to ease congestion and will only make congestion worse. The province should focus on their responsibilities like housing, healthcare, and education instead of municipal matters. I am deeply disappointed in this bill and urge the Ford government to reconsider this bill and prioritize safety, sustainability, and livable communities.\n"

        "comment": "Canadians don't need more infrastructure for personal automobiles. What they do need is more alternatives to get people out of cars so that traffic congestion can be eased. Bike lanes are necessary urban infrastructure and are good for the local economy. It is much easier to bike up to a store than it is to drive, park and then shop. In reality, large amounts of sales are lost due to car-centric urbanism. Cars are just not well-suited to urban environments unless they are there for utility and/or business. They are certainly incompatible when the road is saturated with them. The limited space on tight urban streets is quickly filled up due to amount of area a single vehicle occupies. It is preposterous to believe that adding more lanes is going to do anything for very long, as this will simply induce demand and the new space will fill up and we will back to the same old problem, now with double the volume. We need transportation solutions that allow the largest volumes of people to be moved with as little space as possible to be prioritized. Bike infrastructure is one of those solutions and a comprehensive network of protected bike lanes will allow people of all ages to traverse the city with ease at a low cost. Investing in better public transit on top of this will also work wonders in improving travel times.\nBeyond this, this act will save no one time. Highway 413 is going to be a colossal waste of taxpayer money. What Premier Ford should do is right the wrongs of his predessors and buy the 407 back for drivers or do whatever is necessary to reduce or outright eliminate tolls. The 407 is underutilized during most of the day and sits fully built and ready to accept traffic. It is my understanding that congestion is costing Canadians 10 Billion dollars annually which means that we need a solution as soon as possible. The 407 will allow for instant traffic relief on the 401 and other major highways. The Bradford Bypass is a slightly better idea but I believe it is still flawed. The 407 would effectively do the same job as the Bradford Bypass, again, already built and ready with large capacity.\nPremier Ford, your bill is self-serving to yourself and those who would benefit from its implementation. But it does not benefit most Canadians. It is going to cost them a lot of money for little, of any gain. And in the case of bike infrastructure, it is going to cause many deaths that could have been avoided. Someone's cherished family member will be killed by this bill. Stop pretending Premier. This is not going to save us time or money. It is just going to cost us our tax dollars and our loved ones. I urge you to hire urban planners and those who understand how to build loveable, livable, enviable cities.\nI know you stand to gain a lot from this bill but it's going to hurt your fellow countrymen and women. You can still make the right choice and drop this bill. Say no to your rich friends and go back to the drawing board. You can still gain our respect by making the tough choices no one wants to make. Buy back the 407. Invest in GO expansion to further accelerate our regional train service. Consider a GO train service between Bramalea GO and Pickering GO with transfer points and other stations along the CN corridor. And for God's sake, do not remove bike infrastructure. Add to it and watch the local economy boom. People will have more money in their pockets to spend if less of it is being spent on cars!\nAsk any financial advisor: cars are a bad investment!\n"

It should be easier rather than harder to approve and put in place active transportation improvements such as bike lanes in order to reduce CO2 emissions, help to build more connected and accessible neighbourhoods and improve safety for all road users. Creating more walkable and cyclable neighbourhoods helps to create more desirable places to live that are more economically productive.\nHighway 413 and similar highway projects should not be excluded from the requirements of the Environmental Assessment process, Environmental Bill of Rights and Planning Act. The emphasis on expanding roadways at the expense of other considerations, especially environmental ones, is short-sighted. These Acts exist for a reason.\n"

        "comment": "This is an irresponsible Bill that will not improve gridlock across Ontario, especially in Toronto. Our over reliance on cars, and designing cities that only work for cars, makes gridlock worse. There is no way out of congestion by planning for more cars. The phrase \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d applies for both bike lanes and vehicular lanes. This bill will not mean that the existing amount of cars on the street will get more space- this will just result in more people having to drive and the road will end up with the same (if not more!) congestion that was there and sparked this Bill. If your goal is to reduce gridlock, we need to make transportation planning choices that encourage a more even mode split, and promoting safe and separated bike lanes is one way to do so. I cycle around Toronto, but not when there is no bike lane. When you take them out (or make them difficult to build) you take away a plausible mode choice for me. And that will put me in my car with the rest of us that \u201cinterested but unsure\u201d about cycling to get around.\nAlso- the amount of fatalities and serious injuries caused by collisions between cyclists and vehicles is unignorable. As our provincial government, you should be concerned with the safety of your constituents, yet that will be deprioritized through the passing of this Bill. It is terrible to think this government cares more about the commute time of someone in a car than the life of someone on a bike. Even for those who don\u2019t bicycle- bikelanes make walking around safer- especially at intersections- where drivers may be more attune and aware than in roadways without a bikelane. In addition, the environmental impacts of Highway 413 would be detrimental to ALL Ontarians.\nThis bill is, at its core, a fundamental misunderstanding of transportation planning and will result in worse cities and towns for everyone if passed.\nThe future of our Province is not in catering to the car- we\u2019ve had nearly 70 years of that- and we need to be more progressive (and think outside of the car) to actually make better transportation!\n"
