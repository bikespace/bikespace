The requiring removal of a traffic lane and for existing ones, where a traffic lane was removed makes NO finances sense!. The removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave.is counter productive to Vision Zero, reducing climate change emissions and Toronto Public Health input on the city streets return to a lane of car traffic.\nDoug Ford know all of the above, his actions are politics on the negative side for cyclist safety. What happen to one deaths too many, the injury and blood will be on his hands for all to witness, sad!\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an irresponsible and short-sighted approach that compromises public safety and wastes taxpayer money. Removing bike lanes and scaling back bike infrastructure directly endangers citizens, particularly as Ontario cities face increasing traffic congestion, pollution, and a need for safer, more sustainable transportation options.\nBike lanes are not luxuries\u2014they are essential infrastructure. They protect cyclists, reduce accidents, and encourage more people to choose an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Eliminating these lanes only reinforces car dependency, ignores climate change, and disregards the needs of citizens who rely on bikes for their daily commutes. Not to mention the people in mobility scooters who rely on bike lines to navigate the city.\nFurthermore, this plan is an expensive step backward. The funds required to dismantle existing bike infrastructure would be far better spent on improving our roads, sidewalks, access to healthcare, and enhancing public transportation. Investing in biking infrastructure promotes healthier lifestyles, reduces traffic, and lowers long-term costs for both individuals and the government.\nThis bill is misguided and illogical. Rather than stripping away the progress made toward safer streets, Ontario should be enhancing and expanding bike infrastructure to build a future that is safer, greener, and more accessible for all.\n"

        "comment": "I think that this is a great proposal - From my commuting experience in Toronto, I think that it will be important to reduce the presence of bike lanes in major arteries and especially along BLOOR Street.   The bikelanes have significantly increased my travel time especially during working hours as I commute even for simple errands between Bloor West-Kingsway-Islington.  As well I often travel downtown to visit elderly parents in long term care often transporting items and the commute is horrible.\nPlease, please, please remove the Bloor bike lanes.\nAs well, I have noticed the problem is exacerbated when there is a subway closure and shuttle buses are used , this puts a massive backlog and slows commutes to a snails pace.  I can't imagine how this has impacted the TTC, and would expect also that bike lanes may even decrease ridership and revenue to the TTC along bloor.\nI can't imagine what this is also doing to business for local retailers and parking has either been eliminated, reduced or is situated in such a way that it is unsafe to enter and exit the vehicle.\n"

With the subway running along those streets, ie easy access to another mode of transportation, we do not need bike lanes.  That was NOT logical/smart thinking, to put bikes lanes on those specific streets.\nThere are plenty of other streets that can accommodate bike lanes:  secondary streets that are parallel to Bloor, Yonge and University.  In fact, make those secondary roads bike-only and no cars.  But allow no bikes on major streets.\nAlso, cyclists do not obey traffic rules.  Many don't even use the bikes - they are in the car lanes!  They run red lights, or they stop at red lights, but jutt way out into the street, preventing cars from making right turns.\nI live in proximity to Bloor Street West, in Etobicoke.  There is bumper-to-bumper traffic from Prince Edward to the South Kingsway.  But the bike lanes are empty.  And with the white posts, and gaudy extra markings on the road, a very pretty stretch of Bloor St. West has been made ugly.\n"

Other major cities throughout the world are investing in more bike infrastructure, with Paris recently establishing a Limited Traffic Zone in its downtown core following the lead of other major European cities, whereas Ontario talks about removing bike lanes.\nI recently spent 3 days in Montreal and was reminded how a large network of safe bike lanes with supporting infrastructure results in more people biking.  Many lanes have been modified for bike traffic, and the traffic is not gridlocked!  Montreal is a much colder and hillier city than Toronto, yet this does not deter the cyclists.\nI observed more people biking than in cars on the morning commute on Rue St. Denis.  On a Sunday morning in Le Plateau, it seemed like they had closed the roads, but it was just everyone choosing to bike or walk, resulting in a quieter and cleaner environment and a healthy community.\nThe province should not be meddling  in the business of municipalities!\n"

        "comment": "The City of Toronto\u2019s carbon emissions by sector website, states that unless (1) 30% of cars are electric and (2) 75% of local trips (within 5km) are made by means other than driving \u2013 by walking, cycling or transit \u2013 the City will not meet it\u2019s 2030 carbon emissions reduction target!  Note: the Province\u2019s  carbon emissions website was last updated in 2013.  Removal of the bicycle lanes ear marked by the Premier will not only reduce the safety of citizens attempting to comply with this critically important City of Toronto initiative but will most certainly dissuade other citizens from participating.  I offer as evidence the recent killing of a young female cyclist by a large construction vehicle when she was forced out of the current bike lane on Bloor at Avenue Road by an illegally located  construction bin.  Further to these specific locations Bill 212 indicates that all bicycle infrastructure existing or proposed that restricts lanes for vehicular traffic will be subject to provincial censure.   It would seem clear that the Province places little importance on the issue of carbon emissions and by meddling with the City of Toronto's business is imposing its self serving agenda on the City's ability to meet these critical targets!  All other provincial municipalities should take note!  I'm left to believe that the Conservative Government of Ontario under Premier Doug Ford doesn't believe in or care about Climate Change and it's impact.   I trust the Ontario Environmental Registry does and will demand that the Premier rescind Bill 212 in its entirety.\n"

I moved here 15 years ago, and growing up in Saskatchewan, driving was the only way to get around the province and cities. What I love most about Toronto is the wide variety of transportation options that don\u2019t require me to get behind the wheel.\nI currently live near Danforth and Warden, and I\u2019m excited about the expansion of bike lanes into Scarborough. I regularly bike to Shoppers World, all the way down the Danforth, and into downtown for shopping, dining, and various activities, I am excited to be able to bike East and new the lanes is expanded in the opposite direction.\nThis proposed bill, however, will hinder the growth of Toronto\u2019s cycling network and, in turn, jeopardize the safety of all road users. It\u2019s important to recognize that the city should focus on solving broader issues, like congestion, rather than limiting the city\u2019s transportation options. Removing bike lanes in downtown Toronto will do nothing to alleviate the congestion on the 401 and other regional highways.\nIn fact, we need more bike lanes, not fewer. Expanding cycling infrastructure is a proven way to reduce traffic and provide more sustainable transportation options. The fact that Toronto Bike Share usage has grown from 600,000 rides per year to 6 million rides per year clearly demonstrates how much Torontonians want and need to bike. This growth in ridership speaks for itself, and it\u2019s time for the city to continue supporting cycling as a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly mode of transport.\n"

Single-driver cars cause traffic. And \u201cclearing\u201d any route just means that more traffic will be directed to those areas.

        "comment": "This bill is a gross misuse of tax payer dollars and is overstepping provincial jurisdiction to impede on municipal decision making.\nTo begin, the proposed oversight of all new municipal bike lanes to the province will be a massive time misuse drawing the province away from larger more critical issues such as housing accessibility, reduction of cost of living and healthcare improvements all in the name of controlling municipalities right to make decisions which are best for their residents (of which the province does not have the same level of nuance and understand as the municipalities will).\nThe proposal to remove the recently completed bike lanes in Toronto is widely costly for works that are already completed and have not impeded traffic from my experience (as both a biker and car commuter). This is a misallocation of funds which should go towards more important and pressing issues like housing (perhaps funding the City of Toronto\u2019s request for provincial funds to help subsidize affordable rental housing rather than declining to comment or discuss the matter).\nI could go on about the environmental impacts of building then immediately removing critical and heavily used infrastructure and how critical it will continue to be as the share of bike ridership continues to skyrocket in Toronto.\nThis is a joke and a sham of a bill. Highway 413 serves no notable purpose and will not have any impacts on reducing highway 401 traffic. These funds could also be used much more efficiently. For a government who prides themselves on fiscal responsibility, this bill is the most unnecessary and useless spending of taxpayer dollars. As a taxpayer, please try to use our funds to actually fix something that is a real problem to us (like\nHousing affordability).\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which would grant the provincial government the authority to remove bike lanes in Toronto. This legislation represents an unnecessary and costly jurisdictional overreach, threatening the safety and sustainability of transportation in our city.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure for modern cities. They provide safer commuting options, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and alleviate congestion on roads and public transit. Evidence shows that bike lanes foster economic growth by attracting businesses and encouraging active transportation. Removing these lanes would undermine these benefits, making Toronto less safe and less sustainable.\nContrary to the claim that only 1.2% of Torontonians bike to work, more recent and accurate data tell a different story. Based on the 2021 census, the cycling commute mode share in Toronto was closer to 2%, and in areas with established bike lanes, it reached as high as 10%. A 2019 City-commissioned poll reported that nearly 9.8% of people use a bike to get to work. Furthermore, Toronto\u2019s Bike Share data demonstrates explosive growth, with trips along targeted corridors like Bloor, Yonge, and University increasing by over 120% since 2020. This growth indicates a rising demand for bike lanes, not a justification for their removal.\nThe financial implications of this legislation are staggering. Allocating millions of taxpayer dollars to remove existing bike lanes\u2014essential infrastructure for thousands of residents\u2014contradicts responsible fiscal management. These funds could instead address pressing urban challenges such as housing affordability, transit improvements, or public health.\nBeyond its financial and environmental ramifications, Bill 212 also constitutes a jurisdictional overreach. Decisions about Toronto\u2019s local infrastructure should be made by Toronto City Council, which is best positioned to respond to the needs of its residents. Stripping the city of its autonomy undermines democratic processes and sets a concerning precedent for provincial interference in municipal governance.\nBike lanes save lives, reduce emissions, and contribute to a vibrant, healthy city. I urge you to reconsider Bill 212 and instead support initiatives that expand, rather than dismantle, active transportation networks.\nOn a personal note, bike lanes have made me feel safer as a woman cycling in Toronto. I have had multiple instances of aggressive drivers threatening me with violence or making lewd suggestions. The bike lanes provide an easy route for me to get away quickly from these aggressive drivers. I would encourage you to use an equity lens when considering this bill. Many of us cannot afford cars and rely on boke lanes to keep us safe in a myriad of ways. Removing them will be detrimental to the safety of so many Torontonians.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to the proposed plan to remove existing bike lanes on Toronto and to the proposed plan to force municipalities to seek provincial approval in order to install new bikes lanes in place of a lane of traffic.\nThere is sufficient research to prove that more lanes (and indeed more roads) do not lead to less traffic. There is a brief period immediately after the change that shows improvement in travel times, but this result is not permanent and in fact backfires in the long term, because more lanes means more cars on the road, and more cars on the road means more traffic. Instead, what the government needs to do is find ways to reduce our reliance on personal vehicles overall. Cycling and public transit require more investment, not less.\nTraffic aside, there are other reasons this is a bad idea. One, the lanes that the government wishes to remove have been here long enough that cyclists and drivers have become accustomed to them. Removing them means removing a safe means for cyclists to travel on these routes. Drivers will have to be more attentive to cyclists sharing the vehicle lane instead of a dedicated bike lane. Toronto has had a number of serious and fatal collisions between vehicles and cyclists in this year alone; removing a dedicated bike lane will only make this problem worse. At the end of the day, what is more important to the Ontario government: traffic or people's lives?\nSecond, we are in a climate emergency. I urge the provincial government to remember this fact and to act for the long term, not the short. Yes, removing a bike lane now may speed up traffic but ultimately it will lead to more cars on the road and more pollution and more damage to the climate. The government should seek long-term benefits, not short-term benefits with long-term harms. I urge the government to plan for future generations, and again to ask itself what is more important: a temporarily faster commute or a liveable planet for our children and grandchildren?\nThank you for the opportunity to share my comment. I hope the government will take its constituents' opinions into consideration on this matter.\n"
