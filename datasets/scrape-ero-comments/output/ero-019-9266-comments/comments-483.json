        "comment": "Toronto has one of the most diverse and robust transportation networks in all of North America and it is something to be proud of. As the cost of living increases and action to curb climate change is more and more crucial for the survival of the human species, bikes play an important role in everyday people's lives for quick cheap and accessible forms of transportation.\nIn all my times talking to my friends colleagues and family, I haven't met a single one that said they enjoyed driving in Toronto. This is not due to the bike lanes that have been installed, but for the fact that the narrow pedestrian streets built over a century ago have been since retrofitted for cars that only grow in size every passing year. Many of my peers love biking as they provide the same individual freedoms of transportation that cars do without the high cost of insurance, gas, and stress that a 2 ton motorized vehicle brings.\nThe main reason why most Toronto and GTA residents wish to bike but currently do not is simply the fact that the current state of public transportation infrastructure is inhospitable to bikes. The solution is to add more bike infrastructure, not to tear down the great examples of it that we already have.\nPlease reconsider the decisions to perpetuate the grip the automotive industry has on our personal freedoms, and instead democratize transportation for the people of Canada in the form of cheap, green, compact, and physically healthy bike ridership. Thank you.\n"

Delegating us to bike on the shared roads puts everyone\u2019s safety at risk and not to mention will actually increase traffic as cars try to maneuver around my bike and trailer (if we\u2019re lucky that they see us.) For a government who wants to care about voters bottom line, biking is the most affordable way to get around. With housing cost, cost of gas and insurance, not everyone has the ability to have a car.\nAlso not to mention the bike lanes are already installed so removing them at this point will only cost more money. Keeping bike lanes just makes sense for all\n"

        "comment": "I fully support bike lanes in the city of Toronto and am very upset at the prospect of losing them.\nI live in Davenport and am both a driver and a cyclist. My family walk, cycle, and travel by car on Bloor Street. The Bloor Street bike lane has had an incredibly positive impact on my neighbourhood. My children can get to school more safely - whether cycling to school or crossing the road as a pedestrian. Bloor is more vibrant and businesses are thriving.\nHaving lived in the neighbourhood for 18 years, I am fully aware that when Bloor Street devoted 4 lanes to cars, traffic was equally congested. However, the speed of traffic is not a measure of the success of a street or neighbourhood.\nCommuters who travel by car aren't the only ones with a stake in this decision and I feel it necessary to point out that seniors, families, children, pedestrians, those with disabilities - really everyone - will be affected.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

Like Amsterdam!\nIf bike lanes are removed, there is a lot more risk to cyclists! It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll stop using the road to commute. And in case they feel unsafe, all these cyclists will be riding on sidewalks!\nAlso, adding additional lane will certainly not accelerate traffic. Check studies!\n"

        "comment": "How upsetting this idea is!  Not only do bike lanes save lives and help prevent accidents and injury, but those bikers are using fewer cars that clog up the roads.  So even if it takes drivers a few more minutes to get somewhere, from the studies I have read any extra time is minimal and certainly well worth it in both the short term and long term (I am both a biker and driver).  I ride the Bloor bike lanes regularly; they are well used and so much more safe for people than before.  I do not understand why this would become a provincial jurisdiction, when clearly it is a local issue.  People in small town and rural Ontario have no interest in spending tax-payer dollars ripping up bike lanes (that are so useful) in downtown Toronto.  This seems a personal beef for Doug Ford, who should run for municipal government again if this is where he wants to spend his time and energy (perhaps he ought to take up biking - he might quite enjoy his commute!).  The long-term effects of having less pollution, a healthier population, and the safe assurance that constituents will get home to their family and friends at the end of the day should really be his main priority if he really does want to make bike lanes his number one focus.\nAs for building another highway (413), this too makes no sense when we have the hardly used highway 407 sitting right under us.  He could buy back the lease on this or pay for truckers to use this road before he considers tearing up more green space to build something new.\n"

Not to mention the costs of removing these lanes which have been some of the greatest successes in Toronto infrastructure in decades. This will set the city back years and millions for no good reason except to sell drivers on the lie that congestion is caused by cyclist despite every urban planner consistently noting that this is not the case. Extremely disappointing\n"

If he had done any actual work on this bill, he would know that's simply not true.\nEven the groups that he purports to be the beneficiaries of this policy have spoken out against it; namely, the Bloor St. BIA and Beck Taxi, among others.\nAny actual data from other, more well-run locations around the world show that bike lanes reduce traffic and make driving with bikes present easier and safer for all.\nHe has not done any work, nor put any effort, into showing how his position is correct. I challenge him to prove that this is anything other than a way to line the pockets of construction companies with endless projects. But he won't, and he won't be able to even if he tried.\nFor the safety of those that choose to bike, please quash this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is one of the cheapest forms of transit and can be faster than public transit and cars when in the GTA. Instead of bike lanes being removed, more should be built, so the biking network can grow. The bigger the network is, the more it will be used by people because it's a fast and cheap option that also benefits people's physical health.\nI, myself, prefer biking over taking a car or public transit, but the lack of safe biking and lack of a full network of bike lanes has been preventing me from cycling, because some places in Toronto cannot be biked to without going on a street with no bike infrastructure, which is unsafe.\nThis bill will move the cycling infrastructure progress backwards and only worsen traffic as more people are forced to take cars. Instead more bike lanes should be added to important roads so it is possible to use the cycling network to reach more places, which will lower the amount of people that take cars.\nFurthermore, cars are expensive, and public transit has become less safe with the increase of homeless people and drug laws becoming more lax.\nWhat causes the most traffic currently are cars, with it usually being one person per giant noisy box vehicle. Why don't we just get more people out of cars and into using alternative methods of transportation instead of promoting car usage which just worsens traffic further?\n"

As a tax payer and a senior, I would expect that an elected government would make decisions based on in depth study and consultation with constituents.  None of this has been done.  This move will not only increase pollution in our cities, at a time when we're seeing record temperatures and climate catastrophes in our province.  It will increase further the carnage on our roads.  Many of us all already concerned about the speed of cars and congestion on the streets.  The only steps towards easing congestion are more dedicated bike lanes and efficient public transit.  Take those billions that it will cost to rip out bike lanes and put them into our tragically underfunded health care system.\n"

Creating car dependent infostructure only increases the traffic on the roads. I personally am unable to drive. I use my bike to get back and forth from my job and some errands. Unfortunately some streets I feel are too dangerous for me to go down as they offer no protection to cyclists. I have been struck on more than one occasion while following all laws. Not only was my body injured, but each time the cars drove away and I was unable to get justice. I now take a taxi when I need to traverse these dangerous regions which only adds to traffic.\n"

It\u2019s a bad use of taxpayer dollars. Tearing up our roads will increase congestion and make them less safe for both cyclists and drivers.\nMayor Chow expressed this in a public statement on October 23rd:\n\u201cRipping up our roads will make people less safe, make traffic worse, and put lives at risk[...] The congestion in this city is partially the result of the province\u2019s failure to deliver transit projects on time and has led to long construction delays and years of road closures. Stay in your lane, open the Eglinton Crosstown and Finch West LRTs and fix the chaos at Metrolinx.\u201d\nThe province is baselessly accusing cyclists for creating traffic on the streets of Toronto and is blatantly ignoring the real problem here -- there are too many cars on the road. If the province is genuinely interested in improving traffic in the city, they would invest in improving our transit infrastructure.\nAs a resident, passionate cyclist, and frustrated urbanist, I urge the government to put an end to this political mess. Stop creating a divide between cyclists and drivers. Make choices based on evidence and data. I deeply oppose the introduction of this bill.\n"

I took advantage of these bikes lanes this summer and felt safe knowing they were designated to cyclists. Surely there must be other solutions to reduce gridlock. In a world where mental health and chronic illness are on the rise, biking is an excellent form of cardio and encourages folks to use this type of commute as it is good for their overall well-being and gets us from point a to point b in a reasonable time. I strongly encourage the addition of more bike lanes. Removing current ones is not the answer. Thank you.\n"
