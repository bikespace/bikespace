        "comment": "I am writing to oppose the proposed Bill 212. I find it embarrassing that the Ontario government is proposing such outdated, backward legislation when other governments (municipal, provincial, state, and national) around the world are aiming to reduce vehicular traffic in cities and their carbon footprint. Bicycles and bike lanes do not create traffic congestion and gridlock, cars do.\nTo create healthy, sustainable, livable cities, we need to look beyond cars. The Ontario government needs to recognize all modes of transportation: walking, biking, public transit, as well as vehicles. If the Ontario government really wants to \"reduce gridlock to save you time,\" they should invest in public transit and complete the public transit projects that they are already committed to.\nBicycle use is increasing and municipal roads need to adapt to meet this change and to encourage more active transit. In Canada, cities like Montreal and Edmonton have led the way by creating kilometers of dedicated bike lanes. Bike lanes keep everyone on the road safer: drivers and cyclists know where they should be on the road, accidents are greatly reduced, and traffic flow is maintained. This bill with its proposal to remove bike lanes so that cars can get where they need to go faster is ludicrous. How can Toronto call itself a \"world city\" when such backward legislation is being considered?\nThe bill also overreaches its responsibility. Municipalities should have the autonomy to find the most viable solutions for transit on their roads.\n"

        "comment": "As a person who cannot afford a car, and who cannot rely on the underfunded TTC to reliably get me where I need to go on time, I rely on the safety of bike lanes to get me around the City of Toronto.\nI have been harassed, honked at, and treated violently by vehicle operators, as well as hit on my bike three times and doored once while using roadways that were not equipped with bike lanes. Bike lanes, especially the protected lanes on Bloor and University keep me alive on my daily commute.\nFurther, bike lanes do not increase congestion. Building highways instead of bike lanes and instead of funding public transit initiatives increases congestion more\u2014the more highways are built, the more a car culture dominates our cities and provinces. It is more environmentally friendly, especially within a climate crisis, to be investing in public transportation such as trains, busses, streetcars, and subways to decrease traffic, rather than building new highways which will only serve to increase traffic more. Why? Because highways are an industrial complex, meaning their presence alone increases their need and use.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s investment in infrastructure depends upon said infrastructure\u2019s ability to serve the interests of industry and capital\u201d\u2014 and doesn\u2019t serve the needs of the environment or the people. \u201cExhaust emissions of the vehicles that drive on roads \u2018pollute the atmosphere with gases that raise global temperatures and make the air less safe to breathe.\u2019 In 2014, light-duty vehicles \u2013 vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight under 8,500 pounds \u2013 alone produced around 12% of Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2019, the Canadian federal government reported that 25% of Canada\u2019s total GHG emissions came from transportation. By comparison, about 26% of the country\u2019s total GHG emissions were generated by the oil and gas sector. Moreover, the wear and tear of car tires and brake pads also contributes to microplastic pollution. Researchers estimate that tire wear and tear make up 5-10% of all plastics that end up in the ocean and 3-7% of the particulate matter in the air. These microplastics, which have already entered our food chains, are hazardous to the health of animals, especially marine creatures, and may also be hazardous to humans.\u201d This quote is from an article I have linked below. This is not new information. This bill is clearly negligent and irresponsible, foreclosing the very real risks cars and highways pose to our environment.\nSo why destroy the bike lanes that cyclist commuters rely on to get across the city each and every day, and why invest in highway infrastructure that will ultimately serve to further pollute our environment under the auspices of \u201cdecongesting\u201d the province and its cities? Why invest in a culture of cars and their  rhetoric of individualism, when we could be investing in making safe and accessible communities where cyclists can safely navigate the city and where we can depend on public transit to reliably get us to where we need to be. I am utterly against Bill 212\u2014 and its rhetoric of \u201creducing gridlock, saving you time.\u201d Bike lanes do not contribute to gridlock as increasing bike lanes would save EVERYONE time because it would increase the number of cyclists and reduce cars on the road. Just as carpooling efforts and increasing funding in public transit saves EVERYONE time because it encourages a lower amount of individual cars to be driving each day.\n\u201cBike lanes have a greater passenger capacity than lanes for vehicular traffic. The average single lane of private motor-vehicle traffic has a capacity of between 600 and 900 vehicles per hour, representing between 600 and 1,800 people (and it\u2019s closer to the lower end of that range because most cars have but a single occupant).\nBy contrast, the average two-way protected bike lane (which typically occupies less space than a single lane of traffic), has a capacity of 7,500 people per hour.\nThat\u2019s right: a single two-way protected bike lane can move about 10 times as many people, and do so using less space, than a single lane of car traffic.\u201d (Article linked below.)\nIt is ridiculous, and frankly dense and idiotic to come to the conclusion that bike lanes increase gridlock. I am aghast, and truly questioning those who were responsible for the research and formulation of this bill, not to mention the government of Ontario under Ford.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not just bike lanes- they are infrastructure to support accessibility. They enable people to use a variety of human-sized vehicles, mobility scooters, e-kick scooters, and bicycles, of people of all ages, abilities and incomes, to get to where they need to go. To remove bike lanes is tantamount to removing accessibility features of buildings. What would it be like to get rid of elevators and escalators, automatic doors or ramps? Removing bike lanes is a barrier to mobility. Accessibility should go past buildings, past the sidewalk.\nGoing back to how it was without bike lanes, cyclists filtered through and cars tried to leap-frog around, only to be passed again. There will be more and more lightweight, human-size vehicles and without bike lanes will cause greater conflict.\nBike lanes are an accessibility feature.  Their removal (and their failure to be built) is ableist and assumes the ability to drive is a given.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to the removal of bike lanes in the City of Toronto. I use them everyday, especially the lane on Bloor/Danforth. There are frequently large number of cyclists on the route. Prior to the lanes being installed, the curb lane was usually used by vehicles illegally stopping and rarely functioned for the flow of motor vehicles. Tagging and towing illegally parked/stopped cars will do much more for the flow of traffic than removing bike lanes and forcing cyclists back into vehicles.\nWe should be encouraging people to look for alternatives to motor vehicles in this day in age. Many other cities have proven that bicycle infrastructure can be incorporated into the city fabric and the safer it becomes to cycle, the more people will do it. Before any bike lanes are removed there should be a current study done of cyclists in Toronto and we need to stop referring to a decade old study. The city has dramatically changed in that time, as has bicycle technology with power assisted models making longer trips and trips with more topography more comfortable to cycle.\nThe province should be focusing their efforts on getting our public transit infrastructure open and functioning, rather than unravelling the work that has already been completed implementing bike lanes.\n"

It goes against the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and drivers.\nIt\u2019s not cost effective since the lanes have been built in recent years and it will be very expensive to remove. Any removal will contribute to interfere with traffic which is counter to the idea of reducing gridlock.\nThe government should be encouraging public transport and diminishing gas emissions by decreasing car traffic, encouraging healthy and safe exercise by cycling in the city.\nEvery major city in the world from Amsterdam, Paris to New York City is developing their bike lanes and decreasing car presence. Think of air pollution and our health and safety!\n"

        "comment": "As a university student living in the Rosedale neighbourhood, I use bike lanes daily for getting to and from U of T, to work and to see my friends and family across the city. I have been living in Toronto for around 8 years now and have memories of what cycling in the city was like along Bloor, Danforth, and other main roads I needed to take before the bike lanes and it was, and there\u2019s no other word for it, terrifying.\nThe introduction of cycle lanes on these major roads have made life for me and countless people my age much safer and more affordable through opening different modes of affordable transportation. But we still have a lot of work to do, just a couple months ago a cyclist exactly my age was killed at Bloor and Queens Park/Avenue because of an obstacle parked in the bike lane. The fact that immediately after this, and during one of the deadliest years for cyclists in history, the provincial government, which I did not vote for, has seen this as a good time to suggest removing cyclist infrastructure we have fought so hard to install and that has still not been rolled out fast enough is just disgusting.\nIt is made especially disturbing by the loose use of facts and lack of consultation with local communities and the youth who will be the ones most likely to suffer the most and bear the cost of both their removal and eventually and inevitable reconstruction. Minister Sakaria\u2019s flouting of studied facts and public safety is particularly disappointing, with just a little digging you can see that according to tomtom, the site he referenced saying that Toronto is the 3rd worst for congestion in the world, Amsterdam, a known cycling paradise and similarly sized city, is 151st, Copenhagen is 160th.\nAs far as costs, the Brimley cycle lane that was removed for \u201conly\u201d $80,000 were basically nothing more than painted lanes, only unused because they were still on a massive arterial in the middle of the suburbs. The protected, asphalt, curb level lanes will require lengthy and disruptive rebuilds of the whole street, this after years of enduring complicated and disruptive construction on Yonge and Bloor from their installation and the condos being built along side.\nAs someone who\u2019s trying to find their place in the world, I do not want to be a part of a backward, regressive society that ignores facts and experts in favour of vanity projects. Bike lanes have massively improved businesses, pedestrian and cyclist safety, accessibility and pollution levels. They have revitalised Bloor, College and University into actually walkable, pleasant streets and made alternative, affordable commuting methods a viable alternative for so many to the underfunded and inflexible TTC and the absolutely unsustainable car-based commuting that this government seems to still think is relevant. At this rate, myself and many other young people will look to leave to places that actually care for their citizens and their health and future.\n"

I suggest that the government stay in its own lane as there are many other problems that they are better suited to solving.\nPoint 2\nIf there is any concern at all for pedestrians, I believe adding more bike lanes is THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURE available.  I witnessed this myself on Annette street where it was used as a drag strip before they were put in.  So much so that you could not walk your child to school with them on the roadside of the sidewalk for fear of an accident happening.  There is no longer this fear with the bike lanes.\nPoint 3\nTo reduce congestion it is suggested that construction activities MUST TAKE PLACE within the confines of the construction site.  Lanes cannot be closed down to accomodate it.  If builders have an issue with this ask them to \"figure it out\".\n"

        "comment": "Firstly - the bike lanes on Bloor are the best thing that this city has done in decades. It keeps cyclists safe and prevents cyclist deaths and disfiguring accidents. It gets people who live within a reasonable circumference of the lanes out of their cars and onto bikes which reduces congestion and emissions, gets people moving which is healthy and I\u2019m sure increases shopping revenues to local small businesses.  I personally shop along Bloor now way more than i used to because it is now a safe and moving thoroughfare in the downtown core.\n2nd - bike lanes are not causing congestion. Cars are. How about some \u201cget out of your car\u201d campaigns instead of targeting the very and only people who are making this city a better place. Large cities all over North America have expanded their bike lanes to fan fare\u2026.NYC, MTL, YVR to name a few. Go visit them. See how functional and safe they are. Cities are for people\u2026not cars or parking spaces.\n3rd -  are scared to use TTC because every trip people are experiencing serious mental health emergencies because the province has no supports for them. You cannot keep shuffling people out of parks\u2026where do they go?\u2026the TTC. The root of THAT problem must be addressed. I use the TTC more now because of how much easier, faster and cheaper it is than taking my car.\n4th - i have it on good intel that the only reason the Ellington line isnt working is because of the TTC is  FOREVER to train people\u2026. The construction is done\u2026get people moving on it. It\u2019s an absolute embarrassment that it\u2019s taken so long for this line to go in. And guess what? The traffic all around the Allan is still a nightmare even with the construction done. Perhaps Metrolinx could update the public as to what the holdup is?? 14+ years. Insanity!\n5th - distracted driving. People in cars are on their phones, angry, and violent. It is terrifying just walking around the city these days. People running red lights every single light!!! People driving way over the speed limit. I have NEVER seen anyone in the city of Toronto be pulled over for a traffic violation. I\u2019ve lived here for 30 years. Let\u2019s put cops at construction sites to help navigate the road. Let\u2019s get the lights timed so everyone isnt constantly hitting every red light when moving from A to B. Let\u2019s encourage people to walk, bike, TTC. The only way to do this is to make it safe for them.\nLastly - We need to be moving towards less cars and a carbon neutral city\u2026not removing bike lanes that have already been put in to local fan fare. This isn't the suburbs nor is it the Toronto of 25 years ago. We have been rapidly growing the population with no infrastructure improvements and the only thing that has been done you want to take out? PALEEEEASE. Is this like the Doug Ford \u201crip out electric vehicle charging stations\u201d to only have them years later put back in? HE is the reason we are so behind the rest of the world. Perhaps he should go to any European city and see what progressive urban planning looks like or just stay the hell out of Toronto infrastructure and leave it to the people who live here. Go back to Aurora or whatever big box hell you want to be around and leave us alone. There are many many things you can do to help congestion. Bike lane removal will merely waste tax payers money and kill even more cyclists.\n"
