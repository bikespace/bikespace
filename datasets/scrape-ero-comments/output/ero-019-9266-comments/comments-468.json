        "comment": "Bike lanes allow for the orderly movement of people in a reliable manner in higher density environments.\nChildren can get to school safely under their own power without contending with the same space as trucks.\nPeople with disabilities can retain their independence with mobility scooters with only needing to transition into it at home, rather than having to lift themselves up and down repeatedly.\nBike lanes extend the reach of transit infrastructure, allowing for us to get more bang for our buck on the heavy investments we're making into them.\nIn an emergency, two directional bike lanes create an express route for appropriately sized emergency vehicles.  They don't have to fight congestion, because cyclists can literally step out of the bike lane onto the sidewalk or boulevard.\nBikes are an affordable method of transportation.\nReasonable alternative streets simply do not exist by intentional design.  Cul-de-sac neighbourhood design intentionally set out to make alternatives to arterial roads inefficient and therefore incentivize non-local people to avoid using the roads inside the cul-de-sac.  That's where this government wants to route bikes.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford seems determined to ruin all the good Toronto has; now it's bike lanes with which I am only 50% in agreement, but I would rather keep them than add more car lanes. Add lanes = more and more cars; there will never be enough room to move!\nWhile I find it quite challenging to cross (and yes, I jaywalk when it's quiet) Bloor Street in the Bathurst-Spadina area, I truly believe bike lanes help cut emissions and allow those who wish to pedal a way to move around faster than by car or TTC. Some basic riding rules could be observed, but I digress.\nWalking is always a great choice, but comes with its own hazards due to bike lanes, which is why I hesitate to praise them too enthusiastically. For example, there are 6-8 obstacles to visually check when crossing this strip of Bloor, legally or otherwise: the first bike in both directions; making sure you don't trip/fall over a raised section e.g. parking island while looking for a gap in the first lane of cars; looking at the second lane of cars; then checking the next possible trip hazard; looking both ways on the next bike lane; the checking the destination sidewalk for pedestrians, locked bikes and trees to run into as well as cyclists on the sidewalk. Bloor West may not be the walking street it once was, but leave the bike lanes as is, please. Maybe we can reduce some of our environmental damage by so doing.\nIf the bike lanes are removed, where does DF think cyclists will ride?  Right! On the sidewalks where they are a silent and serious danger to pedestrians. (Why do so many riders refuse to use their bells or vocal chords to warn us of imminent collision?)\nSuch a waste of taxpayer money; wake up and leave well enough alone. Hands off the Greenbelt; hands of the Bike Belt.\n"

Removing or preventing the addition of bike lanes will only reduce choice and result in more travellers choosing to use a motor vehicle which these days are rather large due to motor vehicle manufacturer marketing. The best way to reduce congestion is to enhance public transportation and provide more options such as bike lanes and walking infrastructure. Enhancing rail connections between the centre and surrounding communities would go a long way to improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This is choosing to willingly endanger the lives of bikers while simultaneously making traffic worse.\nOpening more lanes has never been an effective solution to traffic. When you look at major cities like la or Houston who open more lanes they still have traffic, while the additional lanes encourage people to drive more.\nIf you remove bike lanes on key streets such as university, there are no replacement streets to place these lanes - should they instead go on Yonge? Or bay? Why spend millions of dollars to open new bike lanes when the current ones work just fine\nYou are moving to force bikers onto major roads instead or to purchase cars or take Ubers. All of the above make the traffic problem worse. Soon drivers will be complaining about bikes taking up space on the roads and will have to drive even slower to avoid hitting them.\nThis is a waste of taxpayer money.\nIf traffic is truly a concern the province should move to ban parking on these roads, heavily fine and enforce drivers who obstruct traffic, and even consider implementing congestion pricing to make the direct contributor to traffic (drivers) pay for causing the problem - spurring more of them to take public transit, carpool, drive during off peak or bike.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is a misguided, uninformed and completely unfounded attempt to make traffic better based on outdated or irrelevant data. Taking out bike lanes will make our roads unsafe for cyclists and people will absolutely die as a result. It will make our sidewalks unsafe for pedestrians as some cyclists and scooters will opt to use them instead to avoid the dangers of cars. Having one more lane of traffic on a handful of streets won\u2019t solve the problem of gridlock traffic, but it will increase emissions as more people are forced to drive with fewer viable transportations, like biking, available to them. We need better mass transit and more accessible regional transit for those coming into Toronto for the day if we actually want to solve the traffic. As a lifelong Torontonian, I am furious at the lack of informed decision making demonstrated by \u201cFord Nation\u201d - a country most of us did not ask to live in.\n"

Each municipality is responsible in planning and implementing transportation plans that will work for the people who live and work in those cities.  And having safer infrastructure for all means that people won't feel that they are taking their life in their hands if they chose to use a bike to get to a destination.

However, this is not due to bike lanes. This is due to a lack of investment in high quality, reliable public transit, as well as the fact that MULTIPLE streets downtown are ripped up for a myriad of reasons and there is nowhere else for cars to go.\nIf you really want to reduce gridlock and save us time \u2013 we need to get people out of their cars. We should be walking/biking/taking transit wherever we can, especially when we are within a 10 km radius of work/home/running errands.\nCities around the world are moving away from cars and many cities like London, England actually have tariffs on cars within the city. Let\u2019s be bold and do something similar. These fees could help fund transit and get Ontarians moving.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident I am deeply disappointed with this new proposal.  I commute in Toronto every day using transit and every day I see roads clogged with cars no mater where I go.  Removing bike lanes will only add more cars to roads in the long term.  Considering the rapid growth and densification of the city of Toronto, it is a losing battle trying to fight congestion by allowing more cars on the road.  The only viable long term solution is to get cars off the roads by building alternative infrastructure.\nI personally no longer bike in Toronto due to the complete lack of bike infrastructure in my area and the overcrowding of local roads.  There is no room to bike safely so I am forced to either use public transit or drive.  I do own and bike and now only use it when visiting family in KW since there is bike infrastructure in my families community.\nAdding red tape to slow down the addition of new bike infrastructure makes me worried for the future of this cities transportation system as construction projects are already far too slow considering the massive population growth over the last 10 years.  Using cars to fix urban transportation issues was a solution for 40 years ago when the population was much lower but with the current levels of density car traffic needs to be reduced in dense urban areas in order to reduce commute times.\nFor the sake of the city of Toronto's future, I hope this bill never makes it through the approval process and that the city can continue to build infrastructure to fit the needs of today and tomorrow.\n"

        "comment": "As much as I love the bike lanes as a cyclist, I love them more as a driver. Before they were built, the right lane had to serve three separate functions \u2014 parking, driving, cycling \u2014 and as a result did none of them well. Both cars and bikes had to constantly switch lanes to avoid parked cars, which was confusing, unpredictable and dangerous. Separating these three functions has made the streets safer for both cyclists and drivers. Removing the bike lanes will not solve gridlock, but it will cost lives. If streets are public, they must support ALL forms of transportation instead of privileging one above all others.\n"

        "comment": "This is truly a stupid, short sighted, and cynical piece of proposed legislation. The bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge have removed a tiny, insignificant, fraction of a percent of the city's motor vehicle capacity, but they have allowed a huge increase in the number of people who now have the option to leave their cars at home.\nI drive. Everyday. To work sites all over the GTA. Anyone with a brain knows that traffic is everywhere. It is not caused by the (small number of) bike lanes around the core.\nIf you want to improve driving for tradespeople like me, who actually need to drive to job sites, you need to give people alternatives to driving. If you want some short term gain, go after the selfish drivers who speed, cause accidents, block intersections, and stop in active lanes of traffic. After all, it's not cyclists downtown who make my drives from site to site difficult; it's the number of cars, and selfish drivers who cause delays. Removing bike lanes is a waste of public money and the government's time. Any MPP who supports this legislation will be responsible for all the injuries and deaths that happen to cyclists on these streets, should these bike lanes are removed.\n"

When I'm on my bike and having to ride perilously close to fast moving traffic, I'm upset that there are no guarded bike lanes to use.\nWhere you sit on an issue depends on where you stand...\nHow do we solve this?  If we take an scientific approach, there are a vast number of studies showing that opening more lanes for cars does *not* reduce gridlock - all it does is encourage more people to get into their cars to use those shiny new lanes.\nConversely, there are plenty of studies showing that adding alternate forms of transportation - public transit, safe walking and biking routes, *does* encourage people to get out of their cars and use those modes instead.\nThe solution is clear if we don't want to bury our heads in the sand - build more alternative forms of transit, including public transit, safe sidewalks and guarded bike lanes.\nAnd for god's sake, don't go and tear out any existing ones.\n"

This bill is dangerous because:\nAir quality: Reducing bicycle use increases air pollution, which worsens respiratory and cardiovascular disease.\nHealth and physical activity: Reducing bicycle use reduces the physical activity of bicyclists, which will negatively affect their cardiovascular and respiratory health.\nAccidents: Statistics show that in the absence of bike lanes, accidents are more likely to occur, resulting in serious injuries and high medical costs.\nTraffic congestion: Cyclists will use sidewalks or main roads, creating conflicts with pedestrians and cars.\nCongestion: A bicycle takes up 6 times less surface area than a car, so it takes up less space in traffic lanes. Amsterdam and Copenhagen, which have invested heavily in bike lanes, have seen significant reductions in congestion.\nRemoving bike lanes threatens cyclist safety, air quality, traffic flow and public health. It is crucial to maintain and improve this infrastructure to ensure benefits for all. We must be able to choose to cycle and live in good health: that's our freedom.\n"
