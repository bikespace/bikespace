        "comment": "This is ridiculous legislation at a time when we should be encouraging people to reduce reliance on  private automobiles in our increasingly densely populated cities.\nThis is also an absolutely ridiculous thing for the provincial government to be focusing on. This should remain an area of municipal responsibility and control, while the provincial government should focus on provincial responsibilities.\nOntario is a huge province and the many people who live outside of the GTA would like the province to focus on issues that affect the whole province. Health care is a priority - after 3.5 years on a wait list, I have finally been signed on to a primary care provider, but there are many in my community and across the province that are still lacking care. Hospitals continue to be overcrowded, and hallway medicine is even more of an issue than it was before the Conservatives gained power. Post secondary education is a necessity if we are to have a thriving economy, but most colleges and universities are in a precarious financial state. Covid, and the need to improve ventilation in public spaces isn't even mentioned by our government.\nDo better!\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is the wrong decision for Ontario.  This is a provincial overreach in municipal affairs that will negatively impact municipal planning decisions, and offers no benefit to residents.  Bicycle lanes don't cause congestion: in fact, there is plenty of research to indicate the opposite (CBC News, 2024).  Traffic lanes cause induced demand for car transportation, which will increase congestion because more people will be driving - not to mention the fact that if people have no safe choice other than to drive, the only choice they can make is to drive.  If people have a safe and well-connected bicycle system, they will use it, which will reduce congestion on the road because people will happily use their bicycle to get around instead of their car.  Cyclists are not a small minority of the population, and their numbers are growing.  13.5% of Torontonians cycle to work (Statistics Canada, 2022).  Meanwhile, more cycling infrastructure has contributed to a substantial increase in cycling in Ottawa (City News, 2024).  Not only that, cycling is a popular means of transportation and recreation for Ontario's tourists: in 2023, 58% of overnight visitors and 68% of day trippers included cycling in their agenda (Ontario By Bike Report, 2023).  This should be taken as a sign that the people of Ontario want to ride bicycles - and I have yet to see the Ontario government offer a solid evidence base about why we should discourage them.\nPreventing the installation of cycling infrastructure will not help drivers, but it will take choices away from Ontarians.  The decision of where to put bicycle lanes is best left in the hands of the people who know their cities best: the planners and inhabitants who live there.  When and where a city should install bicycle lanes is a relatively trivial decision that should not concern the Ontario Provincial Government.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThere are so many reasons why bike lanes are important, vital pieces of infrastructure in our cities.\nIt has been proven time and time again that bike lanes help to reduce congestion and greenhouses gases.  They also save lives. I have no doubt in my mind that removing bike lanes will result in deaths and this government will be blamed for them.\nBike lanes are also an affordable transportation option in this high cost of living city. Personal vehicles are simply unaffordable for the majority of people.\nBy encouraging more people to drive, we will be worsening traffic congestion and will not have solved the issue of traffic. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nI live in an area of Toronto with no convenient access to rapid transit. Luckily, I have a separated bike lane near my house that I can take to bike to the subway. I would never bike to the subway without this bike lane as the traffic moves too quickly and would be incredibly dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "If you take out the bike lane, me and every other cyclist will simply use the car lane. In fact, I will personally make it my mission to commute past your riding every single day on my bike. I will take the lane as allowed by law. And I will ride at a reasonable biking speed of 15km/h while obeying every single traffic law in the highway traffic act to the letter.\nIf there is a car parked in the right lane, I will ride dead in the middle of the left lane. If a faster vehicle is approaching, I will scoot over as far as practicable to let them pass me while leaving not less than one meter between them and me as required by provincial law.\nExcept the average vehicle in Ontario can't do that while remaining within the 3.3 metre lane width design standard. Because my 600mm handlebars plus the one metre lawful passing distance doesn't leave enough space for even a Honda Civic to legally squeeze into the same lane as me. Oh well. That's how the provincial government wrote the highway traffic act. I guess any vehicle behind me will have to match my 15km/h speed.\nSo go ahead and take out the lane. I will be there, making sure traffic flows as quickly as permitted by law.\nHere are some links that support bike lanes. Bike lanes do not cause congestion. Cars do. Street parking does. On a 2 lane road an entire road is blocked off for street parking for majority of the streets. Then you have trucks stopped, uber drivers stopped, etc. Do you know what roads are meant for? Roads are meant to move PEOPLE, not CARS. You move people on public transit. You move people on bikes. You move people in cars. Roads are for all modes of transportation. Why don\u2019t we remove sidewalks and build another lane there while we\u2019re at it?\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a waste of provincial tax payer money and government time.\nThe notion that bike lanes slow down traffic and cause congestion has been disproven by studies done on the exact roads where bike lanes are slated to be removed. As an avid user of those bike lanes, I will continue to bike in the absence of bike lanes, but will instead be more at risk of injury and likely to take the whole lane and slow traffic down as a result. Bike lanes keep cars moving quickly, keep bikers and cars safe, and reduce traffic by taking cars off the road.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who drives, bikes and walks around the GTA, here\u2019s why I oppose the bike lane removal and suggest what the government can do instead (even though municipal affairs are not your accountability)\n1.\tCARS ARE TRAFFIC. Remove cars off the road and you will reduce traffic. Did you know that on average vehicles have 1.2-1.5 occupants, depending on the data reviewed? Colossal waste of space.\n2.\tAs a driver, I HATE sharing the road with escooters/ebikes/uber/doordash delivery people who do not follow any rules. Separated infrastructure keeps them SAFER and more predictable (hard to weave when you have concrete barriers to jump through)\n3.\tBiking is good for the health (as long as people don\u2019t get run over by entitled drivers)\n4.\tBikes do not pollute and they do not destroy the roads as heavy cars and trucks do\n5.\tThe bike lanes in question are THE infrastructure we need and aspire to have more of. Safe, separated, reliable, fast way of getting around and they REDUCES traffic. Every person riding a bicycle is a car taken off the road.\n6.\tThere are TWO other drive lanes (on university) PLUS parking. Remove street parking since there are plenty of side streets to park on and parkades.\n7.\tMY municipal tax dollars went to put them in. MY provincial tax dollars would be used to remove them. This is abhorrent financial management, something a conservative government should know\n8.\tFOCUS ON TRANSIT. The Eglinton LRT is a disaster 5 years late with no site of opening. Based on that performance, the Ontario Line has no chance being built on time. Forget the $200 bribes and invest that $3.2B into healthcare and transit.\n9.\tMy daughter just turned 14. She\u2019s not legally allowed on the sidewalk, nor should she be as it\u2019s meant for pedestrians. IF YOU remove the infrastructure YOU will endanger her life and YOU will be responsible for any injuries and deaths. For each piece of cycling infrastructure you remove, I will make it my daily mission to TAKE AN ACTIVE LANE OF TRAFFIC whenever I am commuting to the office or with my daughter to activities, fully to myself for SAFETY reasons. Sharrows, on Spadina for example, DO NOT WORK \u2013 I am constantly run off the road by impatient drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives, increase the number of available parking spaces, reduce noise pollution, and reduce traffic. A city designed to prioritize drivers is a city which reinforces classism. When everyone has to own a car, pay for it, it's upkeep, gas, and insurance this becomes a greater burden on lower income people. You can't save if you have to pay for these things because your municipality removes cheeper options. When there is no funding for public transit, and not everyone can live where public transit is robustly supported, removing bike lanes is an attack on the working class.\n"

        "comment": "If this was a priority for the people of my municipality we could speak up at election time. It is ironic that while the province talks to the overreach of the feds out of one side of its mouth it does exactly the same thing to municipal governments out of the other side (repeatedly). This bill is unnecessary, if we don\u2019t want our municipalities to put in bike lanes we will vote in a democratic election to that effect.\nTo the proposal itself, I have tried to start taking transit and biking into the office when I can in part because of the environmental benefits but also because it saves me money vs paying for parking. Bike lanes have allowed me to bike safely and when I drive it is also safer for everyone. Ironically, biking also gets me to where I need to go faster. So this proposal will put more people in cars, impacting air quality (note domino effect on health etc), making expensive parking harder to find, and jamming up roads so my drive is longer. For me it would remove the option to reduce my commuting time and would do so for many others in the future by adding red tape that stall new projects. On top of that, this proposal touts new highways, a huge capital infrastructure project and one of the biggest draws on provincial finances, which will impact my taxes and likely end up putting more of my money towards paying off debt then services and god forbid bike lanes to help me to get where I need to go faster.\nWhat\u2019s next sidewalks? I\u2019m not sure the rationale would need to be much different.\nFinally, I would strongly suggest consultation with municipalities because as ever this may be a perceived Toronto problem with a solution that doesn\u2019t make sense elsewhere.\nPlease do not move this bill forward, it will have the opposite effect then what is intended and will likely make driving more dangerous and harder as many people will be biking in traffic lanes - unless we\u2019re also going to ban biking.\n"

I ride my bike to and from the hospital each morning and can do so safely because of the protected bike lanes on university and elsewhere in the city.\nRemoving the bike lane on university forces me to occupy a lane of traffic on my commute and endangers my life on my way to and from the hospital. Requiring provincial approval for the city of Toronto to modify bike lanes on their own streets is the definition of adding red tape.\nBike lanes enable people to get around the city quickly and safely, and increased bike utilization reduces the number of vehicles on the road downtown. Please reconsider this decision and allow municipal governments to make their own decisions around urban planning without all of this red tape from the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "These bike lanes that the government of Ontario wants to rip up out of our cities keep our citizens safe and keeps them moving efficiently. The bike lanes on these roads are not the cause of the traffic, and removal of the bike lanes will result in the traffic remaining the same, or getting worse. I drive and cycle in the city frequently, and these lanes are by far, the most efficient method to get around the city, and removing them would restrict thousands of Torontonians. We should be designing our cities to be better places for people, not for cars. A bike lane less than half the size of a full car lane can carry so many more people much more efficiently. Cars are the least efficient method of moving people through the city. This infrastructure keeps cyclists separated from cars, keeping everybody moving efficiently and safely. If the government was serious about resolving traffic in the city, they would push for viable and preferred alternatives to driving. The completion of the ridiculously delayed Eglinton crosstown, as well as the Finch LRT, Ontario line, and the GO expansion project must be prioritized. Investing in transit and viable alternatives to driving is the ONLY way to alleviate traffic in cities. Metrolinx has been a complete failure for Ontarians.  It is completely inappropriate that the provincial government is sticking their hands into municipal decisions. The people of Toronto voted for Olivia Chow, a strong cycling advocate, and it is completely unjust that a voter in Cornwall or Thunder Bay, gets to have a say in the infrastructure decisions in downtown Toronto, where decisions do not affect them. The current government should strongly consider reversing their decision, and keep municipal and provincial matters separate.\n"
