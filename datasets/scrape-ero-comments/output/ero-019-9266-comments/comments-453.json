        "comment": "As a lifelong resident of this city, I know the importance of accessible, efficient public transit. I don\u2019t own a car\u2014I get around by bike and TTC, like so many others who rely on these services every day.\nInstead of investing in infrastructure that brings more cars onto our streets, why not prioritize improvements to the TTC? Reducing gridlock and enhancing transit efficiency would shorten commute times for our working residents and contribute to a healthier city overall.\nOur healthcare crisis is spilling into public spaces. Many of our most vulnerable neighbors are visibly struggling, which impacts everyone\u2019s experience on public transit. Redirecting funds to healthcare and support services would not only help those in need but also improve quality of life across the city.\nAnd on the subject of removing bike lanes\u2014let\u2019s be clear: adding more cars doesn\u2019t mean faster commutes. It means more congestion, more pollution, and a bigger environmental impact. When are we going to seriously address the realities of global warming?\nIt\u2019s time we make choices that reflect the needs of our city and the well-being of future generations.\n"

        "comment": "The only was you can reduce traffic congestion is by giving people viable alternatives to using cars. If you build a city that is only accessible with the use of motor vehicles, people will be forced to use them, and congestion will only get worse. This is a well-researched and studied subject, and is the reason why the 401 traffic congestion will never alleviated by more lanes: increasing people's NEED to use cars, FORCES them to use cars. Every cyclist you see in a bike lane is a car taken out of traffic.\nBike lanes are crucial to many Torontonians living in this city. Eliminating lanes forces cyclists using these crucial networks to either a) use a car, adding more vehicles to the road and exacerbating the existing congestion, pollution, and parking problems, or b) ride their bikes in unprotected lanes, putting them at much greater risk of collision or slowing existing traffic.\nToronto has a car congestion problem; this is undeniable. And oftentimes it is so bad that cycling is actually the fastest mode of transit in the city: even faster than walking, using public transit, or driving.  Bloor and University are the \"arteries\" of Toronto's bike network; the best and safest way for cyclists to commute East-West and North-South. Expanding upon the bike network should be a huge priority as a a means of alleviating traffic. This bill is a step in the complete opposite direction.\nBy eliminating bike lanes and making them harder to build, you are condemning the people who use them to rely on vehicles, and effectively making the problem this bill is setting out to solve even worse.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with the current proposal. My main reason is the lack of scientific and evidence-based investigations to confirm the proposed changes will reduce the congestion. In fact, there are many opposing studies in this regard. To avoid unnecessary waste of time and resources, we need to make decisions based on proven rationals. With the current proposal, I see it likely that the goals of the proposal may not be achieved and more time and energy will be spent on reinstalling the lanes by a future government.\n"

        "comment": "As a dedicated cyclist and daily commuter in Toronto, I strongly oppose Bill 212. Removing bike lanes will increase traffic and put cyclists' lives at risk in our city. Bike lanes are essential for encouraging more people to choose biking over driving, ultimately reducing traffic congestion and public transit pressure\u2014and it\u2019s better for the environment. Rather than improving traffic flow, removing bike lanes will likely lead to more cars on the road, as well as increase risks for cyclists and jeopardize their safety. We should be expanding and enhancing our bike lane infrastructure, not dismantling it. Let\u2019s prioritize safe, sustainable transportation options for all.\n"

        "comment": "Here\u2019s an opposition comment based on your template:\n---\nI am deeply opposed to the proposed removal of bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212. These bike lanes are crucial for supporting the health, safety, and economic well-being of our community. By providing a safe space for cycling, these lanes encourage regular physical activity, which not only enhances the health of residents but also helps reduce healthcare costs over time by fostering a healthier, more active population.\nBeyond health benefits, bike lanes are essential for reducing traffic-related accidents, offering a safer environment for both cyclists and pedestrians. Bike lanes help establish a predictable flow of traffic that keeps our streets orderly and minimizes the risk of collisions.\nEconomically, bike lanes provide residents with the freedom to opt out of car ownership, avoiding the financial burdens associated with gas, maintenance, and insurance costs. Personally, cycling allows me to manage my finances sustainably and maintain independence from costly car reliance. Removing bike lanes limits this choice, pushing more people toward vehicle dependency, which is neither financially nor environmentally sustainable for our city.\nI urge you to reconsider this decision and recognize the long-term benefits that bike lanes bring to Toronto\u2019s health, safety, and affordability.\n"

        "comment": "The governments proposal for removing existing bike lanes is NOT based on a statistical analysis and many of the comments made by Mr. Ford are blatantly untrue. Those of us who actually live in the City of Toronto use our bikes to get around and are entitled to a safe method of transportation. People who do not live in the city should be using public transit instead of cars unless absolutely necessary except that we have one of the worst public transit systems in the world (I have used public transit all over the world!) I used to live in Vaughan and was forced to take my car into the city because it was almost impossible to get anywhere by TTC. And once in the city you have to be amongst the privileged elite to be able to afford parking. Instead of wasting money pulling out perfectly good and heavily used bike lanes PLEASE use the money to make desperately needed improvements to public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I am incredibly disheartened to hear of the proposal to remove bike lanes in the city of Toronto. First of all, the title of the bill is misleading - in fact, studies from around the world have shown that bike lanes REDUCE congestion and ease gridlock. Providing people with more (safe!) options aside from driving is what will ultimately reduce traffic in our city. A 12-month study on the University Avenue bike lane showed that they had little to no impact on car travel times. In addition, bike lanes reduce emissions, make roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians, increase traffic to local businesses. The addition of bike lanes in Toronto have had a net positive impact, and we should clearly be increasing the cycling infrastructure, not reducing it.\n"

        "comment": "To the legislators considering the removal of bike lanes on this major artery:\nEliminating bike lanes is a step backward in urban planning, public health, and environmental responsibility. Studies from cities worldwide show that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces congestion for all commuters, not just those on bikes. Prioritizing cars alone on this artery will not solve traffic issues; it will only lead to more congestion, pollution, and costly road maintenance.\nBike lanes are a crucial part of making our city accessible, reducing our environmental impact, and ensuring the safety of everyone using our streets. Without them, we limit transportation options, compromise safety, and ultimately make our city less livable. I urge you to focus on forward-thinking solutions that prioritize long-term sustainability and the well-being of all residents\u2014not just short-term convenience for cars.\n"

Or even try and improve the bus/subway/transit system.

        "comment": "The Premier himself has acknowledged the importance of bike safety in the past, remarking on the anxieties of riding without bike lanes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m deeply disturbed by possible legislation that could restrict municipalities from building or maintaining bike lanes. Such a move would severely limit our local government\u2019s ability to address vital issues like reducing traffic injuries, improving air quality, and combating congestion.\nLocal governments have the insight and responsibility to design safer, more accessible streets for their communities. Limiting their capacity to do so undermines their ability to protect residents\u2019 well-being. An Ipsos poll found that while 86% of respondents recognize a congestion crisis, they attribute it primarily to construction delays and excessive vehicle traffic\u2014not to bike lanes, despite frequent attempts to scapegoat them.\nWe can\u2019t let road safety become collateral in political battles. Cyclist safety isn\u2019t a partisan issue\u2014it\u2019s about protecting lives and fostering livable communities. Let\u2019s focus on real solutions, not restrictions that could have devastating consequences.\n"

Especially from Woodbine to Victoria Park Ave. These bike lanes have created gridlock traffic at most hours of the day. I don't think it can be disputed that the cause of gridlock along this stretch was a result of bike lanes removing 50% of the lanes of vehicular traffic. There are quieter residential streets along these entire stretch where it would be safe to ride bikes. People, me included, now avoid Danforth to use these residential streets to bypass all of the gridlock. Instead, bike riders should be encouraged to use these residential streets, instead of the other way around.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto, Ontario since immigrating from the US in 2005.  I do not own a car, nor do I wish to.  I do not wish to contribute to climate change, nor do I wish to sit in gridlocked traffic.  Many studies have shown that no matter how wide roads are, motor vehicle traffic will always increase to use all available capacity until traffic congestion becomes unbearable.  And so it seems quixotic to continuously attempt to relieve gridlock by adding more lanes, since the studies unequivocally show that no number of lanes will ever be enough.  Look no further than my hometown of Houston, TX for evidence of this truism.\nFurthermore, as a non-driver, my preferred mode of transportation is to use a bicycle.  They are speedy, efficient, I get exercise, it's faster than walking and in some cases depending on distance, it's faster than driving.  One might argue that in order to combat climate change, as we are encouraged to do on an individual basis since our governments will not properly regulate major corporate polluters, we should encourage more people to use bicycles to get around instead of motor vehicles, in order to reduce emissions and keep the city's air cleaner for everyone.\nIf major arterial bike lanes like the ones on Bloor, University and Yonge are ripped out, the entire bike network built over many difficult years in Toronto will be gutted at a stroke.  Not to mention the construction snarls it will create on those roads while the work is being done, the cost of ripping out bike lanes which were only completed a matter of weeks ago, and all of the pollution that goes along with yet more construction.  This legislation is a slap in the face of regular Torontonians who would like to see our city become world-class and on-par with other international cities which also offer excellent bike infrastructure.  Instead we'd be losing upward of a decade's progress on providing good alternate modes of transportation to people who cannot afford to drive a car, or merely wish not to since other ways of getting around involve less hassle, danger, expense and pollution.\nPlease do not pass this authoritarian legislation giving the province yet more power to disrupt the will of the people as expressed through their municipal governments.  This is not what most people in the areas served by these bike lanes want; if anything, they want more bike lanes.  Of course, some car-minded people are very loud about their dislike of sharing the road with anyone; they are trained to think this way because of the way cars are marketed to them.\nTaking out bike lanes or blocking the construction of new bike lanes will significantly increase the risk to bicyclists, including the growing bike delivery sector, at a time when people are struggling to house and feed themselves.  These people are not in a position to own a car in order to use infrastructure that their tax money pays for -- so their tax money should pay for infrastructure, like bike lanes, that they _can_ use.\nFord said he was running \"for the people.\"  Let him show it now by retracting this pernicious bill and ceasing to make the people's lives hell by giving public infrastructure over entirely to drivers when it is paid for by drivers and non-drivers alike.\n"
