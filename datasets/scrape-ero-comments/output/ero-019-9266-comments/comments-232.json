        "comment": "This is both flagrant overreach by the provincial government, as well as a just stupid plan. We need to be actively promoting people to stop driving and this is obviously opposite of that. On top of that this will straight up get people killed. Sooner or later a cyclist will get hit by a car they wouldn't have if they had a designated lane.\nBoth the provincial government and cyclists should stay in their lane.\n"

        "comment": "Please don't be foolish. I am giant gearhead and have multiple cars in my family. I love to drive, and do so often, but getting rid of bike lanes will only make everything worse.\nI routinely ride my bike to work 3-5 days a week year round, rain, snow and all. I am only able to do so because Waterloo region has dramatically improved the cycling infrastructure and don't have to dodge cars on the road. 80% of my ride is isolated trail.\nThen think about students in university areas, I rode my bike throughout university as well, and many students do now. I don't want to have to dodge them when I'm driving either. Bikes will not go away, they'll just contend with cars more.\nAnd what is with the removal of bike lanes on university Ave in toronto, it is so illogical it hurts my brain.\nI know the government is getting hammered over gridlocks, roughly so, but this will make things worse, not better, no matter how you name the legislation.\nDo better, improve transit, dig more subways without crazy overregulation and insane clown environmental assessments, make good on high speed rail corridor. There is a million ways to improve traffic, this one is a giant footgun and I am not sure what fever pitch dream even made the government consider this.\nStop, get help.\n"

        "comment": "\"The Government of Ontario ... recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\"\nThe Government is incorrect, that lane closures are the most important factor in determining traffic congestion.\nHere's a somewhat simple example. Blood flows through arteries and veins in the body. If this flow is congested, the body doesn't create new arteries and veins, but relies on a healthy system so that essential blood cells can reach their destination, without superfluous traffic that isn't essential to the healthy operation of the person.\nSimilarly, on the roads, single-occupant vehicle traffic, traffic that cuts through smaller residential roads, and the lack of viable alternatives for those who are either unable to drive, or simply choose not to, are all signs of an \"unhealthy\" array of problems that many cities face when it comes to methods of transportation that are the main causes of unnecessary traffic or congestion on the roads.\nIn a single space a car occupies, you can fit 10 or more pedestrians, or about 6 or more cyclists. It's obvious that to reduce the congestion to make the roads less clogged with cars, there should simply be fewer cars on the road.\nCars are not the enemy, but like all things, moderation is key. If roads are congested, why does the government never consider that there may be too many cars? Road repairs, highway maintenance, vehicle fatalities, etc. . . . Does the government like paying millions per kilometre to maintain roads, to move less people at a slower rate?\nSee Madrid, Paris, Tokyo, or even Montreal, and many other populated first-world cities that treat cyclists with far more knowledge and understanding, that care about multi-modal methods of transportation, and the beauty of their public spaces, for inspiration.\n"

        "comment": "Keep the province out of my municipality. The province has been talking about removing bike lanes in Toronto that actually reduce traffic by taking cars off the road. They are politically motivated to make bad choices for municipalities to placate their voter base. European cities are prime examples of how removing cars from roads can reduce traffic. This is a step in the wrong direction.\nMunicipalities know what\u2019s best for municipal roads. Keep voters from outside my municipality away from municipal roads. If they need to get in, improve provincial infrastructure like the GO line and highways and build more transit with metrolinx. Municipal roads are outside provincial mandates.\n"

        "comment": "The name of this proposed legislation says it all, all being an inversion of the truth reminiscent of Minitrue in 1984. All reasonable people understand that more bikes and fewer cars equal less gridlock. If Premier Ford actually wants to do something constructive about traffic challenges, he should build more public rail. Ripping up existing bike lanes instead is shameful pandering.\n"

I don't care if you're an MPP or the Premier - stop thinking of yourselves as something special; you're just like the rest of us and you were merely elected.  Ditch the gas guzzling, carbon spewing black suburban and get to work like the rest of us.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is retrograde; sliding backwards.  Bike lanes are the future and cars must be relegated to the past.  I own a car and leave it parked most of the time. I walk, cycle and take transit when I can.  Congestion is caused by too many people driving when they should be looking at alternatives.  Most cars contain a single driver. Driving in the city is insane.  Cars do not belong in an urban area especially when there are alternatives that people choose not to use.\nThe world cannot sustain all of these cars and it contributes to environmental devastation which my kids will have to suffer for.  Governments have the obligation to take citizens kicking and screaming into the future.  Nobody wants to give up old habits but our planet is suffering.  When the planet suffers, we suffer.  Driving should no longer be normalized as the natural way to get around.  With increased density in so many places, increased immigration- how can everybody own a car and expect to not experience crazy congestion.  The cars are the problem- not bike lanes.  Congestion has been a problem long before bike lanes.\nFinally, your government complains when the Feds overstep into provincial matters. Now, because it suits your agenda, you overstep into regional and municipal matters. The provincial government has no business over-riding local decisions that local citizens support.  Big brother Ford doesn't know better. But as always, you support your favoured contingent of supporters while ignoring huge numbers of Ontario citizens.  You rule with an authoritarian  iron first, catering to the few while depriving the many.  This is very undemocratic.\nIf you want bike lanes used, then connect them.  The Bloor bike lane is amazing however it is tough to connect to unless you live on Bloor. There are hazardous streets, north and south, which are scary to cycle on in order to access Bloor.  I visualize a trip somewhere and love Bloor but then realize I have no way to get where I want to get north or south without riding in the aggressive, distracted driver traffic of Toronto. I've been hit twice, had many close calls.  This is the reality you subject thousands of cyclists to.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned that the proposed legislation will only add red tape to making the city move better.\nI operate a number of restaurants in Toronto and the majority of my customers arrive without a private motor vehicle. The numbers that arrive by bicycle have grown as new cycle lanes have been added in the area (Richmond/Adelaide, Yonge and Bloor in particular).\nReducing motor vehicle lanes has paradoxically improved gridlock by giving the single lane of traffic full clarity on where to go: the erstwhile curb lane was rarely passable to begin with, but then suddenly it became safe for cyclists and other micro-mobility users.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will generally not improve gridlock as it will push cyclists toward one of two likely outcomes:\n(1) Cyclists will continue to use their bicycles on the road rather than within a dedicated bike lane, thereby slowing traffic and increasing the rate of vehicle-bicycle accidents.\n(2) Cyclists will opt to drive vehicles, thereby increasing traffic and worsening gridlock.  Note that this aligns with the principal of induced demand: as driving a vehicle is made easier, the roadways will fill with traffic until they are saturated.\nMy recommendation is to not proceed with this bill.  Rather, the best long-term strategy for reducing gridlock is to reallocate funding to improve public transit.  By making transit more available and accessible, you will reduce the number of vehicles on the road.\nAn alternative approach which has been employed in some cities around the world is to additionally make driving a car into a congested inner city more expensive; this can be done by charging tolls for vehicles entering/exiting specific zones, and by levying a tax on parking.  This is unlikely to be a popular option, but it has the effect of pushing more people toward taking public transit.  (Perhaps the funds procured in this manner could then be funneled into improving public transit and so forth.)\n"
