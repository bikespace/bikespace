Bikes are an affordable, efficient form of transportation. For every person whom this policy discourages from using a bike, that's one more car on the road - one more car to cause gridlock and accidents and road rage and to spew pollution and noise all over the city. I know that Doug would never propose a backwards policy like this, that hurts the middle class and only helps the inner-city elites, so I'm confused about who has been tricking him into supporting this.\n"

Bikelanes have been repeatedly demonstrated by studies and examples NOT to worsen traffic. Moreover, this money has just been spent, and congestion was caused by construction - let's not remove perfectly good infrastructure which people now rely on.\nBlocking the rollout of new bike lanes is one thing - but the removal of perfectly good infrastructure is the opposite of Doug Ford and the conservative mandate and is unacceptable.\n"

        "comment": "1. Undermines Municipal Autonomy\nThe proposal to mandate provincial approval for changes to local bike lane infrastructure encroaches on the authority and decision-making power of municipalities. Local governments are in a better position to understand the transportation needs, traffic patterns, and unique characteristics of their communities. By centralizing this authority at the provincial level, the policy risks creating delays, bureaucracy, and inefficiencies, as the province may not have the granular, localized knowledge needed to make informed decisions. This top-down approach could erode trust between provincial and local governments.\n2. Contradicts Environmental and Climate Goals\nIn light of the growing climate crisis, prioritizing vehicular traffic over cycling infrastructure is counterproductive to both provincial and global environmental goals. Encouraging cycling, rather than expanding highway infrastructure, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and overall dependence on fossil fuels. Bike lanes offer a sustainable, low-carbon mode of transport, and cities worldwide are investing in them as part of efforts to combat climate change. Ontario should be encouraging, not restricting, the development of bike lanes, which also improve local air quality and the overall health of residents.\n3. Bike Lanes Can Reduce Congestion, Not Increase It\nContrary to the assumption that removing vehicle lanes for bike lanes worsens congestion, research shows that well-designed bike lanes can reduce overall traffic congestion by encouraging more people to cycle, thereby removing cars from the road. Cities that have invested in cycling infrastructure, such as Copenhagen or Amsterdam, have shown that it can reduce car dependency and improve the flow of traffic. Additionally, bike lanes take up far less space than car lanes, meaning they offer a more efficient use of public roads, particularly in urban areas where space is limited.\n4. Misses the Shift Towards Sustainable Urban Development\nThere is a growing global trend towards prioritizing public transportation, cycling, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in cities to create more livable, human-centered spaces. Car-centric urban planning is increasingly seen as outdated and unsustainable, with negative effects on public health, safety, and the environment. By prioritizing highways and vehicle lanes, this proposal aligns Ontario with an old model of urban planning rather than fostering a modern, sustainable transportation network. Prioritizing cycling infrastructure is essential to keeping Ontario\u2019s cities competitive and attractive for future generations.\n5. Restricts Active Transportation and Public Health Benefits\nCycling is a form of active transportation that improves public health by promoting physical activity. The construction of more bike lanes can encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. By potentially stifling the expansion of bike lanes, the province would be undermining public health efforts aimed at encouraging physical activity and combating issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Bike lanes also improve safety for cyclists, and by limiting their creation, the province risks making roads more dangerous for those who do choose to cycle.\n6. Delays Could Stall Important Infrastructure Projects\nRequiring provincial approval for new bike lanes could lead to significant delays in the implementation of critical cycling infrastructure projects. Bureaucratic approval processes could slow down the rollout of bike lanes, even in areas where they are urgently needed. These delays could have a negative impact on both public safety and efforts to promote alternative modes of transport. Municipalities may hesitate to propose new bike lanes if they know that navigating the provincial approval process will be slow, uncertain, or overly complex.\n7. Ignores the Benefits of Reduced Car Dependency\nEncouraging alternative modes of transportation like cycling can reduce the dependency on cars, leading to numerous benefits including reduced traffic accidents, less wear-and-tear on roads, and lower infrastructure maintenance costs. It also makes transportation more accessible for people who cannot afford cars. The proposal to prioritize vehicular lanes over bike lanes overlooks the growing demand for equitable, accessible transportation options, especially as urbanization increases in Ontario's cities.\nConclusion\nRather than implementing a framework that slows down the creation of bike lanes, the Ontario government should focus on promoting sustainable transportation and improving local autonomy over transportation decisions. Prioritizing highway expansion and limiting bike lane infrastructure is an outdated approach that fails to recognize the pressing environmental, public health, and urban development challenges of today.\n"

Prepare for a fight because cycling isn\u2019t going to lessen in the city. Also by attacking bike lanes you attack the right of people on any wheels to get around the city (including mobility devices and wheelchairs). You are leaving a legacy of brutal ignorance and it will be a joyful day when you are gone from office. May that blessed day be soon.

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes from busy roads to improve traffic flow may seem like a straightforward solution to congestion, but it overlooks the critical benefits that bike lanes bring to cities, commuters, and the environment. Removing bike lanes is not the right approach; instead, we should be expanding and improving them for several reasons.\n1. Safety and Accessibility: Bike lanes are essential for protecting cyclists. Removing them would force cyclists to share the road with vehicles, putting them at a much greater risk of accidents. Studies have consistently shown that dedicated bike lanes significantly reduce the risk of collisions and create safer environments not only for cyclists but also for drivers and pedestrians. Accessible bike lanes make it possible for people of all ages and abilities to feel safe commuting by bike. Here's a great link to Toronto's data that supports this: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000145751930658X\n2. Alleviating Traffic, Not Adding to It: The idea that bike lanes increase traffic is a misconception. In fact, promoting cycling as an alternative mode of transportation reduces the number of cars on the road, leading to less congestion overall. When cities invest in infrastructure that encourages cycling, they typically see fewer cars during peak hours, which alleviates gridlock. More bikes and fewer cars equal better traffic flow, not worse. See https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319 for more information.\n3. Environmental Benefits: Encouraging cycling by maintaining and expanding bike lanes is a key part of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. As governments around the world work toward more sustainable urban planning, removing bike lanes would be a step backward. Fewer bike lanes mean fewer cyclists, leading to higher emissions from increased car use. In the face of climate change, it is vital to prioritize low-carbon transportation options like cycling.\n4. Economic and Health Benefits Cycling offers economic advantages for both individuals and cities. It is a cost-effective means of transportation that reduces fuel consumption and wear and tear on roads. Additionally, cycling promotes physical health, reducing healthcare costs over time. Cities with robust cycling infrastructure see economic benefits through reduced congestion, improved public health, and increased local business activity as cyclists tend to support businesses in their neighbourhoods.\n5. A Vision for Future Cities: Forward-thinking cities around the world are investing in cycling infrastructure as a solution to urban mobility challenges. From Copenhagen to Vancouver, city planners are seeing the long-term benefits of designing cities where bikes, cars, and pedestrians can coexist. Removing bike lanes is a short-term fix to a much larger problem and does nothing to advance the vision of a sustainable, modern city.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, we should focus on better integrating them into city planning. Enhancing the infrastructure for cyclists, improving public transportation, and creating more walkable urban spaces are all strategies that reduce congestion without sacrificing safety, sustainability, or quality of life\n"

I have used cycling as my main mode of transportation since the late 90s, and have seen the numbers of cyclists increase as car traffic and transit delays made it often the fastest way to travel. As more lanes have gone in, more people have taken advantage of the safety they provide. By cycling, each of us is potentially taking a motor vehicle off the road and doing our part to reduce gridlock - which I thought was the goal. How is putting more cars, buses and streetcars back on the road going to save us time? This isn't even factoring in how much money it's going to cost us hard working taxpayers to remove already existing infrastructure. This bill is absolute nonsense.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on corridors such as Yonge, University and Bloor is not going to make cyclists disappear and save time. Timid cyclists will switch to driving a car, which will increase traffic on the roads further. Cyclists that don't have the option to switch to a car will just take the entire right hand lane, which doesn't improve traffic either. What it's likely to do is increase the number of cyclist injuries and fatalities in the city, which will increase car insurance rates even higher.\nIf you want to reduce gridlock, leave it to the municipalities to manage. The Ontario government should be focusing on the larger issues that concern the province, ie. Public Healthcare and Housing.\nI would encourage the Premier and Transportation Minister to visit Manhattan for a week and see how the combination of public transit, bike lanes, and smart road planning can make a city amazing to walk, drive, bike, and commute via subway.\n"

        "comment": "I believe the changes proposed in \"PART XII MUNICIPAL BY-LAWS AND BICYCLE LANES\" is  an overreach of provincial jurisdiction and creates additional red tape which the current government has repeatedly campaigned on reducing.\nPremier Ford has stated numerous times that his governments directive is to \"cut red tape\"  and \"get things built faster\". Requiring approval for every bike lane built in the province is a colossal waste of time and resources that can be accomplished at the municipal level. I do not feel in any way that the provincial government is better suited to address the needs of individual municipalities. The Ministry should be addressing provincial issues such as constructing highways and rail, rather than sticking their noses in municipal matters and creating repeat work.\nIn addition, bike lanes save lives and improve mobility for underprivileged people who do not own cars. I personally utilize bike lanes across Bloor to travel to and from work and shopping and have directly felt safer behind a protective barrier. In comparison I do not bike on Dundas at all due to the lack of bike lanes and increased risk to my health. I have also worked downtown and have not seen increased traffic as a result of bike lanes - traffic is worse due to delayed construction on streetcar tracks, water main upgrades, and Ontario Line construction. I feel placing the blame on bike lanes on University, where there are still two to three full lanes each direction for cars, is disingenuous.\n"

Bike lanes will REDUCE congestion during good weather as more people will choose to ride as opposed to driving.  If the routes used for cycling have a large \"ridership\", then these would be good candidates for public transit.\n3.  The province of Ontario should NOT be encouraging commuting by personal passenger vehicle!  This has a huge environmental impact.  Traffic congestion will encourage Ontarians to live closer to their place of work as well as rely on public transit.  Both of these results have environmental benefits.\n"
