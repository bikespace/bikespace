All this will do is create more chaos on the streets, spending tax payers\u2019 money on demolishing existing infrastructure that works, adding more road closures and construction congestion in the city, and creating an unsafe city for cyclists.\nCyclists will not just disappear, they will now be forced to share a lane with cars, blocking car traffic and increasing the potential for car-cyclist collisions.\n"

        "comment": "As a family of four in Toronto with a vehicle, we all travel via bike every single day. Having bike lanes available makes the road safer for both motorists and cyclists by providing a designated space for each type of traffic. The idea that bike lanes are causing the increased congestion by way of removing a lane of traffic is foolish - cyclists will not simply disappear; we will just be taking up space in car lanes, moving slower than a car can move, and with increased risk of danger to everyone.\nAdditionally, the financial cost and logistical disruption of removing extant bike infrastructure is an unnecessary waste of resources that makes the proposal to remove bike lanes a ridiculous notion.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a major overreach and encroachment on a municipality\u2019s ability to develop safe and efficient road networks. The proposal does not consider global evidence on bike lanes and congestion in good faith.\nThe proposed bill actually acts in opposition to provincial policies and plans it has previously championed such as the Provincial Policy Statement, 2024 (PPS 2024) and the Transportation Plan for the Greater Holden Horseshoe, 2022. The PPS 2024 says transportation systems should be provided which are safe, energy efficient and facilitate the movement of people and goods. Prioritizing vehicles over the movement of people generally is misguided. Further, the PPS 2024 says that as part of a multi-modal transportation system, connectivity within and among transportation systems and modes should be planned for, maintained and, where possible, improved. How does the removal of high-quality and safe bike lanes maintain or improve multimodal transportation systems? The answer is it reverses the progress made to establish multimodal transportation systems in our cities.\nIn major Ontario cities, such as Toronto, bike lanes on main street serve as connectors to higher order transit stations, local retail, workplaces, parks, and other key community services. A comprehensive local cycling network enhances the major transit investments made by the Province. First and last mile commutes to transit stations should be well served by safe active transportation options, like bike lanes (as recommended in the PPS 2024 (s3.2 3). Deferring bike lanes to adjacent streets prioritizes single occupancy vehicles on major streets that are high volume pedestrian and cycling corridors. This is a regressive step for Toronto\u2019s urban environment and transportation network.\nIn response to the proposed Bill 212, the City of Toronto estimated that it would cost more than $48 million to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue and lead to minimally faster commutes for drivers. This assumes that the removal of these bike lanes would not induce greater vehicular demand on these streets \u2013 which any transportation study would conclude is inevitable. Many sections of these bike lanes have included curb reconstructions to make cycling safer for users.\nAs an avid biker living in the City of Toronto, I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes by the Province and strongly oppose the Province making deeply impactful local decisions about our local road networks. This is a gross overstep by the Province and one that does not appear to be backed in reputable evidence. This bill builds on a pattern of provincial exertion of power onto municipalities, particularly the City of Toronto. Local decisions should be made by local actors and our City Councils are best suited to study and respond to these issues.\nThis is undeniably a bad faith proposal and should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are incredibly important for providing a safe way for ALL travellers to arrive to their destination. Personal vehicles are NOT something that is affordable and accessible for all of our community and there are numerous gaps in the connectedness and affordability of our public transit systems already. Bike lanes are used by more than just cyclists and help make transportation more equitable for all travellers. So many more micromobility users are going to get injured on the road by drivers due to Bill 212 and Bill 212 will also significantly hinder mobility of care needs for low income household and act as a barrier for employment for many folks who rely on safe cycling infrastructure and bike lanes for transportation to further work environments.\n"

These bike lanes are heavily used from may to October and still have a surprising amount of use in the off season. Bloor street was already so busy before the lanes were added, imagine if all the people who cycle op to drive now. It would be even busier. Let's take the right approach is to encourage more people to walk, bike, and take public transit. Not make it more convenient for cars transporting one passenger through the city.\n"

It's truly perplexing why a government that pride's itself with being small government would stick it's nose into municipal affairs and waste tax payer money to remove perfectly good infrastructure.\nOn infrastructure, this government needs to take back the 407, not waste money on another highway that has been shown to barely impact commute times. Ontario needs more farm land to support farmers and less urban sprawl. Open up zoning to allow for more densifacation so people can afford to live closer to where they work.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to several elements of Bill 212.\nFirst, forcing municipalities to seek provincial approval for constructing bike lanes is an unacceptable overreach. Municipal governments are best positioned to make decisions about local infrastructure projects that serve their communities. The provincial government has no right to interfere in this process.\nSecond, the Building Highways Faster Act 2024\u2019s provisions to bypass environmental protection checks for Highway 413 are deeply concerning. Encouraging more highway construction to accommodate additional cars is already an environmental mistake. Skipping or undermining environmental safeguards compounds this error, threatening our fragile ecosystems and eroding public trust in responsible governance.\nLastly, the expropriation of land for highway construction is unjust. This practice disproportionately harms marginalized communities and further exacerbates the housing crisis. Taking people\u2019s homes to build highways, especially in the current economic climate, is unconscionable.\nI urge you to reconsider these measures and prioritize sustainable, community-focused policies that protect both people and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "To whom this may concern:\nI'm writing to STRONGLY oppose Bill 212. Here are my key points:\n- This bill is inequitable and will exacerbate existing municipal issues.  Our Ontario cities are facing challenges and crises related to climate adaptation, congestion, growth, cost of living, and health and wellbeing. Providing safe, affordable, active, and climate-friendly alternatives to private, single-occupancy vehicles (i.e. biking infrastructure) is the only solution for these crises. Everyone should be a priority, not just drivers.\n- This bill will make road conditions unsafe for all users and lead to more preventable fatalities. By removing bike lanes and imposing restrictions on the creation of new bike lanes, the Province is not considering the safety of all road users. I am a cyclist, driver, pedestrian and transit user. With all of these identities, I always feel much safer on roads where each user has their own place. This is also best practice in every single road safety guideline in North America. Getting rid of bike lanes doesn't get rid of bikes. Instead, when bike lanes do not exist, people cycling are forced into dangerous, life-threatening road conditions where they have to compete for space with vehicles who have greater weight, size and protection. In fact, 6 people cycling this year alone have lost their lives in the City of Toronto. These deaths were preventable and are unacceptable. Deaths and serious injuries will only increase should this bill be passed.\n- Spend money elsewhere to alleviate congestion issues. Should this bill pass, the province will incur costs related to the new division that will need to approve new bike lanes in municipalities as well as the removal of existing bike lanes in the City of Toronto. For a bill aimed at reducing congestion, there are far better uses of public taxpayers dollars than these expenditures. For instance, the government should deliver and invest in other alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, including regional and local transit.\n- Grant self-determination to municipalities. Many of these bike lanes proposed to be removed have been through several rounds of municipal approval processes. They have therefore gone through adequate checks to ensure that local communities are represented in the decision making process, that the designs are appropriate for the roadways and that overall due-process has been followed. Future bikeways should continue this same process. Allow municipalities to make local decisions themselves; this is not a provincial issue. The province should focus on higher-order transit initiatives as mentioned above.\nThank you for taking the time to read and process my comment and opposing position. I look forward to this bill being completely amended or struck down.\n"

The bike lanes haven\u2019t been in long enough for people to resign themselves to using them.\nThe money you plan on spending to remove the bike lanes should be spent on the homeless people who are living in the parks of Toronto or on mental illness, NOT on removing bike lanes that people haven\u2019t gotten used., it takes time for people to change their habits and the younger generation will see that this way of travelling is good for the environment.  People who travel by car have more ways of getting around into the city via the Gardiner Expressway, Lakeshore Blvd. And the Don Valley than cyclists do.\nLeave the bike lanes in for at least a few more years to see if people adapt to using them.\n"

Second, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "What a waste of taxpayer money it would be to spend millions removing bike lanes we already spent millions building. Bike lanes and public transit are far more space-efficient and sustainable modes of transportation than the big cars and SUVs that take up our roads (the majority of which carry a single-occupant). The increase in traffic has more to do with constant construction on major roads and highways than bike lanes. The increase in traffic has more to do with massively increasing population than bike lanes. If you want to ease congestion, convince people to drive less by investing in more bike lanes and public transit. The less cars on the road, the faster the traffic will flow.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, currently under consideration. While the bill superficially addresses transportation concerns through bike lane adjustments, it simultaneously encompasses provisions that raise significant alarm regarding environmental sustainability and social equity.\nFirstly, the plan to expropriate land for highway expansion, particularly Highway 413, is concerning. Historical evidence and numerous studies have shown that expanding highways is not an effective long-term solution for reducing traffic congestion. Instead, it often leads to increased traffic volumes, pollution, and environmental degradation. This approach undermines essential environmental protections and disregards meaningful climate action strategies laid out both nationally and internationally.\nMoreover, the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, who are often the most affected by land expropriation and environmental damage from major infrastructure projects, must be considered. These communities should not bear the burden of infrastructural developments that primarily benefit private developers.\nThe proposed expansion appears to be a maneuver catering to developmental interests at the expense of the public and environmental health. Instead of pursuing outdated transportation models, I urge the government to prioritize sustainable public transit solutions and protect green spaces that align with our environmental commitments and social equity goals.\nI demand that Bill 212 be reconsidered, prioritizing transparency, public input, and a focus on sustainability over short-term development gains. We must ensure that our policies reflect the best interests of all citizens, not just a select few.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"
