        "comment": "Bike lanes in the city of Toronto means a lot in terms of safety to both cyclists and drivers. The bike lanes have been doing a great job to encourage Torontornians to commute by bike, which is good for individuals' physical health, mental health, environmental friendly, easing the load to public traffic (TTC) or private vehicles, which is what a well planed international city should be having. I personally disagree that the \"Saving you time' Act proposed by Ontario would be helpful easing the traffic challenge faced by the city, and strongly believe that removing existing bike lanes in Toronto would be a significant move backward from being an advanced international city (by spending a huge amount of the public fund in doing so).\n"

When I\u2019m driving my car, I  find the bike lanes wonderful in keeping everyone safe in their own lanes.when I\u2019m out walking, I noticed that the traffic congestions are usually due to impatient drivers who block intersections, inconsiderate drivers who park illegally and building & road constructions.\nIn my opinion, the bike lanes do not cause or contribute to traffic congestion\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be policing what and how cities and municipalities allocate bike lanes and transit - more red tape, more money spent when not needed, and the provincial government does not know the nuances of each community and what is needed or would benefit each one.\nAdditionally, relating to the bike lanes on University St, as someone who commutes, these have been fantastic - from a safety perspective of cyclists, keeping cyclists in a specific area and moving separate from traffic vs weaving within traffic.  These bike lanes are well used, and the provincial government shouldn't state statistics and percentages without context (eg 1.2%) relating to cyclists and bike lane usage - very misleading and inaccurate.\nSo much of the car traffic on University both currently and in the last number of years has been lane reductions due to construction, and due to the new Queen Street subway station being built. It has been extremely helpful to have the designated parking / stopping areas in front of the hospitals on university, as before cars would just pull over and block that outside lane anyway, and then cyclists were forced over into traffic, and causing even worse impedance of the flow of cars and bikes along University street.\nLastly, as a healthcare worker who works with the trauma population, bike lanes save lives, and save cyclists from injuries - which in the end just costs the province and tax payers more money when more cyclists come to the hospital requiring care, surgeries, and potentially long hospital stays (nevermind the trickle down effect of that on the economy when missing work etc as a result of injuries and/or disability). The number of cyclists hit by cars that are seen in the trauma population is already astounding and unacceptable\n"

        "comment": "I am submitting comments today on the Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. I have a background in Engineering, work in technology, live in the City of Toronto, own a car and predominantly travel using the bicycle-sharing program in the City of Toronto. I am a survivor of road violence, having been hit by motor vehicles on three separate occasions while cycling and once while walking in a crosswalk. This commentary primarily expresses informed dismay at the proposed framework and planned provincial overreach, presenting information that is backed in studies, real-world data, and current thinking on the matter. Sources are left as an exercise, as I presume many other authors have been far more thorough in their collection and dissemination of evidence to support the very clear and evident facts of the matter. While this is true, I believe it is important that our voices be heard, which is why I have prepared a comment.\n\u2028First, I believe it is a misnomer to refer to the removal of a traffic lane - bicycles are considered vehicles under the Highway Traffic Act, and therefore constitute traffic. Changing a shared lane into a diamond lane does not remove the ability for traffic to flow in the lane; it changes the types of traffic and the volume of traffic.\nSecond, the proposed removal of arterial diamond lanes reserved for bicycle traffic is incredibly short-sighted, dangerous, and will cost lives. It will save a negligible amount of time for the majority of road users, but will imperil the lives of vulnerable road users. Studies conducted by the City of Toronto have acknowledged as much. In fact, the Premier himself commented in a 2017 interview that it feels unsafe to ride without bike lanes. Putting lanes or redirecting bicycle traffic onto side streets disincentivizes riding a bicycle, as it\u2019s inconvenient and unsafe to approach the arterial roads when there is no protection. Most trips taken for the purpose of transportation rather than fitness begin or end on arterial roads. Drivers of automobiles wouldn\u2019t find a side-street approach reasonable for their trips, so why should cyclists have to settle for less?\nThird, from an environmental perspective: creating further induced demand for motor vehicle traffic directly challenges the prevailing understanding presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we must take direct and prompt action against climate change by changing user behaviours to switch from personal motor vehicles to more sustainable modes of travel, such as bicycles, public transportation, and walking. Removing bicycle lanes adds cars without decreasing the volume of traffic.\nThere is much more to be said about the matter than I care to write out, given the charade that this proposal review process is. I will be surprised if anybody actually reads any of this before the shovels are in the ground ripping up safe, well-used, clean, and efficient transportation infrastructure.\nThere are no other jurisdictions globally making this decision. I find it highly suspect that this provincial government knows better than every country, state, and city in the rest of the world when it comes to transportation policy.\nNeedless to say this policy decision will not be looked upon kindly in 5 years, let alone today. History will frown on today\u2019s decision-makers who are allowing this to happen. Shame on the Premier. Shame on the Minister for Transport.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a disservice to and an attack on the people of Ontario. Bike lanes are a municipal issue, and they are built after extensive consultation and study. The provincial government should be focused on issues within its jurisdiction, such as health care, education, transportation, and housing.\nBike lanes are a municipal issue, and are critical to the future of transportation in our cities. Removing them will only increase gridlock in our cities. The single cause of gridlock is cars, and the only way to solve that problem is to provide safe and reliable alternatives, such as cycling and public transit.  The Ford government should be spending time getting the Eglinton Crosstown finished, rather than making our streets deadly and trading lives for votes.\nThe city of Toronto has provided extensive evidence to prove how harmful this bill is. This is backed up by doctors, engineers, researchers, and business owners. There is not a single fact in favour of this bill, and the Ontario government must admit this and focus its energy on the issues that will actually help this province.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill.\nIt has been proven time and again that bike lanes increase the safety of people who cycle as well as people with disabilities. Removing bike lanes will not mean that less people will cycle, it means more people who cycle will be killed and harmed by cars. Driving a car is not accessible to everyone, Ontario has some of the highest costs in the country for owning a car. Not only is it not accessible to everyone from a monetary point of view but also through abilities. Bike lanes not only serve cyclists, they also serve people who have wheelchairs, and reduced mobility.\nI also hope that my government thinks about the future of our cities and planet. Bike lanes are a proven way to get people out of cars and choose a different mode of transportation. Cars are not the future for creating livable and healthy cities. Let's focus on alternative transportation rather than car travel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce noise pollution, reduce air pollution and increase business along streets.\nPlease reconsider this bill.\n"

        "comment": "In study after study it's been demonstrated that building more roads doesn't ease traffic congestion \u2013 rather, it leads to more traffic. I own a car, but only use it to go out of town. Otherwise I bike. In my biking career I've been doored and hospitalized, I've been hit head-on by a car making a left turn who didn't see me, I've been run over by cars turning right who had passed me mere seconds earlier. And still I prefer to bike. My body feels better for it, I can accurately time how long it will take me to get someplace, every mile I travel is pollution-free, and I remain a social part of the world around me, which isn't the case if I'm enclosed in my car.\nThe bike lanes make commuting by bike easier and safer. And I'm well aware that when I'm sharing the road with cars, they are impeded (and sometimes dangerously frustrated) by having to go around me. I wish more people could bike, not fewer. Please don't strip this much needed resource of bike lanes off our roads. It's a shameful proposition.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my strong opposition to Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. As a frequent cyclist commuter in the city of Toronto, I have experienced firsthand, how much safer the roads of Bloor St. and University Ave. are with the installation of bike lanes. One striking fact that I have observed is that more and more people, many of them tourists and visitors to our city are choosing to use Bikeshare bikes since the bike lanes have been installed. The statistic that only 1.2% of Torontonians  bike to work is false. Based on day-to-day experience, I would agree with the figure published by the Toronto Star, of at least 10%.\nThe claim that removing installed bike lanes with save commuters time and reduce gridlock is absurd. The Gridlock that has occurred related to bike lanes is because lanes of traffic had to be closed to construct the lanes. It makes no sense, now that bike lanes have been completed, to then close down those same lanes to vehicular traffic to remove the bike lanes. Removing bike lanes also amounts to an incredible waste of resources that could be used for positive initiatives - affordable housing, school lunch programs, the list goes on.\nThere is no doubt that bike lanes save lives for cyclists. Even if it was true that uninstalling or halting the construction of more bike lanes would shave a few minutes off of the daily commute, shouldn't making the streets safer for all road users, including cyclists, be the priority? I hope everyone considering Bill 212 would agree.\n"

        "comment": "As one of many commuters in Toronto that travels by bike, this proposal is extremely concerning to me. The City of Toronto staff have worked tirelessly to develop protected bike lanes and expand the Cycling Network. This proposal risks removing sections of protected bike lanes, thereby putting cyclists at even greater risk than they already are. This goes directly against the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Plan.\nThis plan disadvantages residents of Toronto who do not have the means to commute via motorized vehicle, puts the lives of cyclists at risk, and peels back years of hard work on the behalf of the City of Toronto staff, and cyclist advocacy groups like Advocacy for Respect for Cyclists.\nRather than clearing congestion downtown, this proposal would force more cyclists to take up space in one-person vehicles on the road, effectively worsening gridlock.\nRather than putting money into removing bike lanes, Ontario should be funding the creation of more protected bike lanes, reinforcing laws that will make it safer for cyclists to commute, and improving the network and accessibility of other modes of transportation. Encouraging the people of Toronto to use these alternative means of transportation will clear up congestion in the long term far more effectively than another lane (this is a well known phenomenon that has been proven over and over again: https://www.nrdc.org/bio/carter-rubin/new-calculator-shows-bigger-highw\u2026).\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a frequent user of bike lanes, as are many of my friends and family members. Bike lanes make travel by alternative means than combustion engines more accessible and safe.\nIt is despicable that the Province of Ontario is prioritizing inefficient, dangerous, and high-carbon emitting transportation means rather than supporting transit options that are faster, promote health, promote environmental action, and overall create a stronger sense of community.\nWho do you think wins in a situation where is it a person on a bike vs a one tonne vehicle? By removing bike lanes, and making it harder for municipalities to add bike lanes, and are directly impacting the safety of Ontarians.\nHow many more lanes and roads do you think will solve traffic? The answer is none. Doug Ford needs to prioritize rapid public transit and alternative means such as bike lanes.\nSome key questions:\n- If bike lanes are causing so much traffic, than why do highways such as the 401 (where there are no bike lanes), experience so much traffic? (I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s not the bikes causing traffic)\n- What type of studies or scientific information is being used to make these decisions? (A quick google search offers a wide variety of academic articles that provide evidence that bike lanes only increase delays slightly)\n- how is induced demand being taken into account? (The proposal to add more room for cars, will in fact, just make sure there are more cars and more congestion in the area).\nThanks!\n"

I travel by bicycle every single day and in such risk my life as well. Travel my bicycle is inherently dangerous due to many factors but most significantly due to the presence of rolling death machines. These machines have the ability kill me like a bug if their driver has as little a moment of distraction. The least that my province can do is not to mandate the one thing that is trying to protect me by placing a barrier between motor vehicles and myself and all of the other cyclist risking their lives. We ride our bike to make a difference: because it's good for the environment, it's good for our health, it creates community, it's efficient, and its a outlet for metal health. For the sake of getting a few thousand people to work 5 minutes faster in the morning, please don't go an jeopardize the safety and the life of thousands of people. Look at the research, one more lane isn't going to solve the transit crisis. Do better.\n"
