        "comment": "This bill is an attack on traditional modes of transportation and endangers the lives of children as well as pedestrians.\nRequiring extra hoops for cities to jump through prevents bike lanes from being approved at a reasonable rate. This will not only push children and youth to choose between biking on exposed streets with vehicles, endangering their safety, or biking on the side walk, endangering the safety of pedestrians.\nThe prevention of bike lanes also makes children want to stay inside more, resulting in a more seditary lifestyle, preventing them from participating in the economy in the form of outings and errands, as well as creating a barrier to socializing resulting in a more isolated generation as we have seen with generations starting in 2000 and going forward.\nThis will only create problems in the future as this generation won't grow up feeling safe in their community, they won't be active in their community, and they won't get in much practice supporting themselves, creating a more overly reliant citizens.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill would be a clear overreach of provincial power and constitutes direct meddling in municipal affairs. Bike lanes are an obvious and clear area of municipal jurisdiction and the province should not step in to determine what it views is in the best interest of municipal constituents. The municipality has a much clearer picture of the needs of it's population in this regard and should be trusted to make its own decisions with the agency given to it by the voter base of the city.\nBeyond the fact that the proposed bill aims to meddle in municipal affairs, the proposed changes are a net negative on all fronts. Bike lanes are desperately needed in the city as they provide a much more organized and safer experience for riders in the city. This leads to less accidents and harm to cyclists, and encourages more people to cycle, which is good for their health, is cost-effective, and is one of the most efficient ways to commute through the city. The removal of bike lanes will not reduce car gridlock, and in fact bike lanes reduce traffic and congestion in urban areas (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319). Moreover, cyclists count as commuters themselves, and bike lanes obviously improve their commute. The recently completed university avenue bike lane is one of very few north-south protected bike lanes in the city and its removal would directly endanger cyclists in the city.The removal of bike lanes in the city will also not stop dedicated cyclists from commuting on major roadways, and they will instead be forced to share the road and 'take the lane' as a matter of safety as they are legally entitled to do. Cyclists are also good for business, and many Toronto BIAs have already spoken out against this bill and the harmful impacts it would have.\nI also understand the main purpose of this bill is to free the province from having to conduct environmental impact surveys on the new 413 freeway, and the addition of the bike lane segment is primarily a distraction tactic to draw attention away from this reckless clause. This is egregiously irresponsible from an ecological perspective in a world where climate change and natural habitat destruction are becoming larger and larger problems. It is also incredibly callous and disappointing that the province would use such a damaging tactic that directly endangers the lives of so many just to distract from another harmful action they intend to commit.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly oppose Bill 212. Removing bike lanes to address gridlock is a misguided approach that prioritizes short-term convenience over long-term safety, sustainability, and effective urban planning. While I share the goal of reducing congestion, this bill overlooks the essential role of bike lanes in fostering a balanced and efficient transportation system.\nFrom the Perspective of a Biker:\nSafety is Essential: Dedicated bike lanes provide a safer space for cyclists, reducing the risk of collisions with vehicles. Removing bike lanes forces cyclists into mixed traffic, which can discourage active transportation or put lives at risk.\nCycling Alleviates Gridlock: Biking reduces the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes might push people back into cars, worsening traffic congestion rather than alleviating it. Investing in cycling infrastructure encourages more people to use bikes for short trips, which is essential in urban areas.\nSustainability and Livability: Promoting cycling is a key component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building healthier, more sustainable cities. Removing bike lanes sends the wrong message about Ontario\u2019s priorities in addressing climate change and fostering livable communities.\nFrom the Perspective of a Driver:\nGridlock is Complex: Traffic congestion is influenced by factors like poor public transit, urban sprawl, and insufficient transportation alternatives. Simply removing bike lanes won\u2019t solve these issues and might make congestion worse as fewer people bike.\nRoad Design Should Be Inclusive: Roads are public spaces that need to accommodate all users\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. Removing bike lanes prioritizes cars at the expense of a balanced transportation network.\nShared Benefits of Bike Lanes: Bike lanes can reduce vehicle delays by ensuring predictable, separated traffic flow. Removing them could lead to unpredictable interactions between cars and bikes, slowing traffic and increasing frustration for everyone.\nConstructive Alternatives:\nRather than removing bike lanes, I encourage exploring solutions that genuinely address gridlock while preserving safety and inclusivity:\nInvest in Public Transit: Improved transit options reduce car dependency, easing congestion.\nOptimize Traffic Flow: Implement smarter traffic signal systems and better road design.\nPromote Active Transportation: Expanding\u2014not removing\u2014cycling infrastructure encourages sustainable travel and decreases reliance on cars.\nBill 212 reflects a real concern, but the solution lies in creating a transportation system that works for everyone\u2014not one that pits drivers against cyclists. Removing bike lanes will only undermine safety and progress while failing to meaningfully reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently oppose the proposed framework for bike lanes that require the removal of a traffic lane, and the proposed removal of cycling infrastructure on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street.\nThe proposed policy will place lives in danger, go against the environmental and sustainability goals of the Province, cause significant interference in a municipal matter, and waste our tax dollars.\nMultiple people have died this year on our streets including cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Common causes including high speeds, poor visibility, and aggressive driving. Cycling infrastructure on Bloor Street and Yonge Street have effectively reduced the risk of conflicts between cyclists and motorists, while also effectively lowering the speeds of traffic on our main streets. As a pedestrian, this traffic calming effect has made it safer for me and others who shop, dine, and use our main streets as something other than a high-speed thoroughfare for vehicles.\nAs our cities grow and more people cycle, walk, or take transit, our streets need to reflect the need of increasing demand for transportation methods other than the automobile. Many major residential and commercial development projects in the City of Toronto today have significant numbers of bike parking while reducing the number of automobile parking spots. We need to foster a culture where cycling is a viable method of transportation within our urban areas, and removing cycling infrastructure on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street fails to do so.\nFinally, removing cycling infrastructure is a poor use of our tax dollars and a major interference with a matter of municipal jurisdiction. As a resident of the City of Toronto, I elected my city councillor and mayor to make decisions pertaining to the road and cycling infrastructure within the city - I did not elect a Provincial government to make these decisions for me.\n"

        "comment": "We've already made it abundantly easy to drive. Almost to the point where we're forcing Canadians to buy a car because there's no other way to reasonably get around. Every plaza, every mall, every house - all have parking minimums. Netherlands doesn't have this. Neither does Japan. It's no surprise that we have so much traffic. Yet Ford and Sarkaria's solution to this problem is pushing a bill that will add even more cars to the grid.\nThis is bad for mobility - not everyone can afford a car. Not everyone can drive, particularly younger kids. Now they can't even bike in parts of Toronto where they once used to.\nThis is bad for the environment - Highway 417 will pave over precious farmland, wetlands and habitats of endangered species. This bill will ultimately bring more cars to the roads that will release more carbon emissions, particulate matter and toxic byproducts into the environment. Maybe we don't care about the environment - do we care about the air we breathe? Do we care about our agricultural capacity? About species on the verge of extinction that all play a part in an interdependent ecosystem? About the wetlands that act as environment's sponge? About the exacerbated natural disasters? About rising home insurance premiums?\nThis is bad for safety and public health - More cars mean more chance for accidents. Those who still choose to bike will now have to share the road with motorized vehicles and their lives will be in constant danger. Additionally, biking improves mental and physical health. Sitting in a car doesn't.\nThis is bad for local democracy - it sets a precedent where the premier can use provincial power to strongarm decisions made for the city, by the city. Especially given most Torontonians didn't even vote for PCP this is a case of unparalleled jurisdictional overreach.\nThis is bad for public finances - Bike lane removal is expected to cost at least $48M. Highway 417 between $4B and $10B depending on who you ask. The highway will be tolled. And more people will be spending thousands of dollars on car ownership every year because there are no other reasonable ways to move around.\nThis is bad for the housing crisis - the city is building condos near bike lanes with 4-5 car parking spots while they have dozens of bike parking spots. Car parking spots add $50-$100k of construction cost each. Many of these projects would not be viable if they were forced to include more car parking. These condos are being built on the backs of the biking infrastructure that Ford and Sarkaria want to destroy. Ontario is already well behind housing targets. Our housing starts are down >40% y/y compared to 2023. Shouldn't the premiere be working to fix the housing crisis rather than actively making it worse?\nThis is bad for traffic congestion - The very thing they claim to be solving. There's a wealth of research on induced demand. There's a wealth of documentation about how much space car riders require vs bikes or bus riders require. As a driver, wouldn't you want fewer drivers? Shouldn't we be asking city planners and researchers about what will fix traffic? Shouldn't we be taking notes from cities that have figured out congestion like Tokyo and Amseterdam? Is a city like Toronto really equipped to accomodate so many people driving?\nThis is a bad bill no matter how you choose to look at it. There are speculations that Ford is building highway 413 for a handful of well connected developers who own parcels of land in the greenbelt. Regardless of that claim - this bill is clearly not being pushed in good faith. It will hurt the environment and make life worse for all Ontarians. It is reprehensible that the bill has made it this far. Given the bill in its current state - it's absolutely imperative that the bill is stopped from being passed.\nThank you for reading this far and I hope you have a wonderful day.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes may be a good thing in the downtown core where most people either walk or take the TTC, but they are a very bad mistake outside of the core, for ex., in the Bloor West Village or in the Kingsway, where all they do is create congestion and lead to interminable queues at traffic lights (leading drivers to wait two or three light changes in order to cross an intersection), and to a much greater amount of fossil fuel exhausts.\nThe way I see it, if I have to wait 2 or 3 lights to cross an intersection, that is 4-5 minutes more  of burning fossil fuels ... not a great thing for the environment!\nIf we really need bike lanes in Etobicoke, let them run along residential streets where there is no car traffic.\nPLEASE, Mr Premier, get the city of Toronto to see the error of its ways and remove this incredible negative impact on the environment and on people's lives. What is good for the downtown core is not necessarily good for the suburbs, or, to put it another way, what works in the downtown core does not necessarily work in the suburbs.

Since the bike lanes have been installed my commute time has doubled. Not just during rush hour but at all  times throughout the day. My mom is disabled and I have to drive her to appointments. I have never seen more than one or two bicycles using the bike lanes on Bloor during all of my trips. Vehicular traffic is often backed up from one light to the next, with nowhere to go.\n"

They\u2019re struggling to find an affordable place to call home.\nYet you want to spend $50 million dollars ripping up bike lanes in downtown Toronto and plan to spend billions on Highway 413?\nNot only is this a massive waste of money when healthcare and housing resources are stretched thin, but it will make traffic and climate pollution even worse.\nWhile the number of people who commute by bike might sound relevant to you, focus on the research that adding more car lanes and eliminating alternative modes of transportation will end up causing more traffic. Search up \"Downs-Thomson Paradox\".\nImagine if that money went to hiring frontline healthcare workers and family doctors, building affordable homes, hiring education staff, and improving the services we all rely on in our communities?\nWe need investments that truly support families and communities across Ontario. Not wasteful highways.\nI\u2019m asking you to reverse course on Bill 212 and cancel Highway 413 once and for all.\nSincerely, a newly-registered voter/taxpayer\n"

        "comment": "The wholesale foisting of bike lanes across the entire city pursuant to a dysfunctional discriminatory agenda is at long last being challenged.  The so called community consultations that preceded these installations were even more abhorrent than the usual city statutory consultations.  The city consistently misdirects misleads and blatantly lies to support this fixed agenda.  The egregious misbehaviour continues with statist Al information slanted by design and hidden by policy despite proclamations to the contrary.  Busy traffic lanes should never be destroyed to build seldom used bike lanes.  The block beaded decisionmaking behind this agenda is perfectly illustrated by councils recent intention to install another horrendous lane on Parkside drive in the face of this legislation and despite having an extremely viable alternative. This must end.  The effective closing of high park must likewise be ended.  Ultimately the government should consider a supervisor, bankruptcy or dissolution to ameliorate this horrendous situation.

I use the Bloor bike lane throughout Etobicoke to get to work.\nSure, currently it does not appear that many people use the lanes (would have to be measured to quantify this statement) in the suburbs of Toronto, but downtown Toronto the bike lanes are filled and busy.\nKeeping bike lanes provides safe infrastructure for residents to ride bikes and stay healthy. Density keeps being added in all of Ontario's downtown cores; with that density we definitely need alternative transportation methods besides cars. The gridlock problems do NOT get solved by adding cars lanes (check examples of this throughout major North American cities).\nLikewise, the province should let municipalities govern their own affairs, and let them decide about bike lanes. Installation of bike lanes should be supported and funded by the province.\n"

        "comment": "I support bike lanes in the city that are properly assessed in the context of all types of commuters. Unfortunately, it seems a lack of planning has been done to deal with traffic flow. Traffic flow in the city of Toronto is broken.\nIn particular, what is being done along Avenue Road and Davenport Road has completely stalled traffic in and out of the downtown core. It\u2019s further aggravated by the bike lanes on Young Street, as drivers are detouring from that road.\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that anyone in the city has done a proper cost benefit analysis of these bike lines. There are very few bikers using them as compared to the amount of cars and buses on city streets. Antidotally, I generally see less than a handful of bikers on Avenue and Davenport as I sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\nIt would be interesting to know how many people are no longer going into the office for work given awful commutes. I imagine this has a negative impact on revenue generation in the downtown area. Toronto already had a poor reputation for commute time, which is now significantly worse given the number of bike lanes that have been rolled out throughout the city.\nGiven Toronto city council has made a mess of city road planning, I support the Ontario government removing the majority of Toronto bike lanes.\n"
