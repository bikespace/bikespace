        "comment": "I respectfully ask that the Ontario government withdraw Bill 212 that would block municipality's (including the city of Ottawa's) ability to make the best decisions for their people.\nMy family regularly uses the bike lanes that the Premier Ford has just promised to tear up. We use them to go to school, to work, to shop, to visit friends, and for every part of our lives. They may not be perfect, but the bike lanes we have make our travel safer, and we appreciate them. There are many aspects of this change that is very disturbing.\nFor starters, there\u2019s the waste of tens of millions of dollars and months of construction disruption, and now the promise of repeating all those same costs again, just to move backwards.\nThis is and has always been the responsibility of the mayor and city council. Premier Ford doesn\u2019t represent us, and he never has. Because of outdated constitutional rules, he has the power to overrule the people who are responsible for making these decisions.\nPremier Ford has overreached and violated norms of provincial conduct and respect for municipal autonomy.\nAs a cycling family, we are keeping our car off the roads. Be thankful - one less car.\n"

        "comment": "Making it more difficult to create bike lanes affects pedestrians, cyclists AND drivers. I'm not a cyclist, but I believe that the province of Ontario has so many great cities that love bike lanes because they already know about their scientifically proven benefits of increasing safety, boosting economic growth, and Reducing traffic. I've seen the sea of traffic, and I know that many of these people would not be driving if they had better access to other options, transit would run smoother as well. Canada is on the world stage, but when it comes to our level of urban planning Ontario cities are regularly upstaged, not just by cities in Europe (easily dismissed) but other cities in Canada and north America. Keep the red tape out of our province and allow our city planners to do their jobs, bike lanes should be managed on a city by city basis, so that the city itself can make a comprehensive and effective plan of where the lanes will go.\n"

        "comment": "I am a daily biker in Toronto and a car owner. I regularly take congestion off the road. I would like to bike to work and outings without fear of injury or death. Bike lanes are the BARE MINIMUM for keeping cyclists safe - whose tax dollars are equal to car drivers - and they do not contribute to congestion and environmental emissions. When I do occasionally drive, I drive along routes with bike lanes because I also feel safer as a driver when bikes aren\u2019t so close to my car in traffic. Please do not pass this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 22-year-old cyclist and I rely on bike lanes to safely get myself to and from work, school, the grocery store, my friends' houses, family, appointments, etc. Last May, I was hit by the driver of a pickup truck on a road that was supposed to have bike lanes installed, but where that promise fell through due to anti-cycling lobbying. I was left with a fractured pelvis and was unable to walk for 3 months. I lost my job while my sleep and performance in school have been significantly affected.\nIf we strip our roads of what little infrastructure we have, cyclists will die as a direct result. The survival of Ontario citizens on bikes is in the hands of our policymakers. Please, make the right decision.\n"

        "comment": "I am not in favor at all of the Provincial government making decisions for municipalities. We elect our councilors to make local decisions such as bike lanes. Hamilton councilors have listened to cyclists and car users when it comes to installing bike lines.\nThe provincial government seems to be deciding what is best for cities eg LRT going nowhere when electric buses and dedicated bus lanes would be much better. To make these improvements in transit  local municipalities need cash help from the Province so that roads are designed to allow for all types of traffic to use the road space.\nWe need better transit to reduce grid lock if you do not get cars off the road then nobody will go anywhere no matter what the type of travel they decide to use.\nRemoving bike lanes is not going to change city transit, listen to  transit experts not the folks who drive cars.\nI do drive a car and I will admit every trip takes longer than it used to at certain times of the day, but removing or not adding bike lanes has very little impact on travel time.\nIn fact cyclist move faster than cars, promote cycling.\n"

        "comment": "I'm concerned that removal of bike lanes will have a negative affect on the health and safety of citizens. Removal of lanes means much higher risk to cyclist some of which must bike as their only affordable option while others may forgo cycling because of the risk of being hit by a vehicle causing a negative affect on their health because of the loss of physical activity. More people being forced to use cars also causes increased pollution. Environmental protections should also not be bypassed for short term gain to build a highway faster our environment must be protected for future generations.\n"

It makes roads safer for car drivers!  Some of the scariest moments driving, is when you have no idea where the bikes will be coming from, in between cars, cutting through. It Is so much better now!! Save University Bike lanes!\nYou want to know what makes traffic slower, cars pulling over to drop people off or picking people up. There should be no stopping on University Ave, enforce that!!  Ticket those idiots make more money.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m recommending the author of this proposal or those evaluating it to consider the following points:\n1.\tHigh Rates of Cycling and Walking: Toronto has one of the highest rates of active transportation (cycling, walking) in Canada. According to a 2019 report, around 1.4 million trips are made by bicycle each week in Toronto. Restricting the development of bike lanes could discourage this growing preference for active transportation.\n\t2.\tReducing Congestion Through Multimodal Transportation: Toronto ranks among the most congested cities in North America. Encouraging cycling by expanding bike lanes can reduce car dependency, helping alleviate gridlock. A 2020 study found that when cities invest in biking infrastructure, they see reductions in car traffic, as more people opt for biking over driving.\n\t3.\tEnvironmental and Public Health Goals: Toronto has ambitious environmental goals, including a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. Shifting more trips from cars to bicycles is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Bike lanes also support Toronto Public Health\u2019s objectives by encouraging physical activity and reducing pollution-related health risks.\n\t4.\tImproving Road Safety: Toronto has adopted Vision Zero, a commitment to eliminate all traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries. Expanding safe cycling infrastructure like bike lanes is key to achieving this goal, as it protects cyclists and reduces the risk of collisions with vehicles. As a driver, bike lanes yield an additional benefit in reducing traffic stress; cyclists using a separate lane means they are not weaving in and out of one\u2019s blind spots.\n\t5.\tEconomic Benefits of Bike Lanes: Studies in Toronto have shown that bike lanes can increase local economic activity by making streets more accessible to people shopping, dining, and commuting by bike. On Bloor Street, for example, bike lane implementation was associated with a 4.5% increase in local spending.\n       6. Unnecessary bureaucracy: Municipalities are typically best positioned to understand and address local transportation needs, including bike lanes. Requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes, especially when it involves removing existing vehicle lanes, undermines municipal autonomy and adds unnecessary bureaucratic layers. This diverts resources away from other projects of significance.  Please dedicate resources to finishing transit projects instead.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives, keep bikes off of sidewalks and help traffic move.  If anything we need more bike lanes especially in the central city.  I live 2 minutes from a Toronto subway station on Yonge St and the youth and even some adults here have to ride on the sidewalk.  No one gets too mad about it because we all understand that there are no bike lanes here and the traffic is too aggressive and inattentive for a cyclist that is not very confident.  I am a confident cyclist and will confidently take the lane as needed wherever adequate cycling infrastructure is not provided - and will do so everywhere such infrastructure is taken away, except on the Etobicoke portion of the Bloor bike lanes.  My sense is that the Bloor bike lanes in Etobicoke need to be rethought.  There is nothing wrong with healthy discussion and consideration of alternatives where infrastructure is clearly not working.  But this does not mean simply ripping a thing out and not replacing it with a well considered alternative.  You are responsible for te transportation needs of all citizens, even if you hate bicycles, besides, the future is only going to mean more bicycles and less cars so consider being part of the future vs clinging to a past that is no longer the reality of our quickly growing city.  As for locating future lanes on side streets, I think that should be the preference if direct side streets also exist.  For instance on Yonge St north of Eglington it makes great sense to locate the future cycling infrastructure on Duplex and Jedburgh Avenues vs Yonge St.\n"

Nit remove them and throw away my money.\nCorrupt acts like this are pushing my family and I, both born and raised in Ontario, want to leave.
