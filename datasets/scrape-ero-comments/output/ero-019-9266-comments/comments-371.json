        "comment": "Cars create traffic.\nThis piece of proposed legislation that will only accomplish the opposite of its stated aim. This proposal ignores a significant body of research showing that bike lanes do not create traffic congestion and, in fact, improve it by giving people choice in the transportation they will use. The end result of bike lanes is fewer cars on the road taking up space on the road and less traffic.\nIt is well-established through legitimate evidence-based research that bike lanes remove cars from the road by offering people additional options for transit, which reduces traffic congestion, improves public safety, and has positive impacts for the environment. Bike lanes, when left clear of obstruction, can also be used as bypass lanes for emergency vehicles as they are often significantly less crowded than lanes for vehicles.\nIf Premier Ford were actually interested in \"getting Toronto moving\" then he would listen to what experts have to say on this subject and would be investing in a variety of transportation infrastructure. This would include not only bike lanes but also significant public transit infrastructure improvements and expansions that can be implemented in the short term, such as improved bus service and dedicated bus lanes, alongside longer-term projects like subway extensions.\nThe proposal to remove existing infrastructure that is in good condition and does not need to be replaced is a partisan waste of taxpayer money and unnecessary interference with the City of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I understand that Toronto\u2019s traffic is terrible. I drive, both in the city and out of it. But, this proposal will not help with traffic. The data is in -  bike lanes do not make traffic worse.  Bike lanes help reduce congestion. Remove bike lanes and you will have tens of thousands more cars on the roads every day.\nAnd more dead cyclists. Cyclists are not the enemy. Cyclists help keep our province cleaner and healthier. Bike lanes make us safer. We don\u2019t worry about getting doored or hit by cars. As a driver, I prefer separated bike lanes because I feel more comfortable sharing the road this way.\nRemoving completed bike lanes is financially irresponsible. Please do not remove existing bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge and force cars and cyclists to share the lane.\nAnd finally, these are municipal issues. Please focus on broader Ontario wide issues that you have jurisdiction over, like investing in regional and mass transit.\nThis policy proposal is shortsighted, politically motivated, not in the interest of Toronto, and contrary to the evidence.\nThank you.\n"

Putting side that he is only in office owing to low voter turnout / apathy and not a true will of the democratic majority, Mr. Ford continues to display his ignorance and lack of critical thinking skills on this and too many other issues that impact a wide representation of Ontarians. Though not surprisingly, he is laser focused on ensuring the needs of his family, friends, business associates and donors are met. I state unequivocally that I am against the removal of these bike lanes as well as investing his administration with the superior decision making authority on this subject matter.

        "comment": "This is quite possibly one of the stupidest proposals from the Ford government so far. Rip out bike lanes which reduce the number of cars on the road and overall decrease traffic congestion? There should be more bike lanes installed, not removed. If congestion is the issue improving public transit, having more buses run during rush hour, and reducing the number of cars on the road is the way to go. Not removing an incredibly important mode of transportation for so many people.\nAlso, more unnecessary closures (eve in only temporary) on roads that already experience a high amount of traffic is the exact opposite of what your plan proposes to help with.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is phenomenally short sighted. Streets are overcrowded with cars because there are too many cars. A smart, forward thinking government would be looking for ways to decrease car traffic and improve infrastructure for cyclists, pedestrians and public transportation. The actions of this government are making Toronto less livable, less walkable and increasing pollution. This government should be ashamed of their inability to plan an infrastructure for Toronto that will carry the city forward and allow it to compete with world class cities. Instead we are becoming a city incapable of embracing intelligent change. Removing bike lanes won't remove cyclists from roads nor will it improve traffic congestion.  Please read actual studies into the impact of bike lanes on the life of a city.\nMake  Toronto a city for everyone not just wealthy car owners.\n"

Please just run for mayor again so we can have a premier who cares about the whole of Ontario and isn't planning on wasting a bunch of money, time, and resources on a personal whim. Toronto traffic is bad. Toronto traffic has always been bad. It will continue to be bad the more cars are on the road. When I see the congestion, I don't think more car lanes, I think more, better public transit and maybe that will get cars off the road, reducing congestion. Maybe he can focus on agencies like Metrolinx which are actually under the province's jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike infrastructure on Yonge, Bloor and University represents an absurd overreach, based on out of date statistics and \"gut feelings\" rather than evidence.\nThe Bloor bike lanes in particular are extremely well-used, particularly in the Annex and Koreatown, where they have been in place for a long time. I struggle to see how removing them will have any meaningful impact on congestion, which in this part of the city is caused mainly by neverending and poorly managed construction, not bikes.\nMoreover, every cyclist who decides to drive because of a lack of safe options once the lanes are removed will -- guess what? -- contribute to congestion. And of those who continue cycling on Bloor, some will inevitably be injured or even killed.\nThe proposed policy is illogical and should be abandoned. If the province is serious about reducing traffic, opening the Eglinton Crosstown would be a good place to start. So would implementing merciless penalties for behaviors like blocking the box, which occurs constantly in central Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is a complete blunder.\nThe province has no place removing bike lanes, period. It should be adding more bike lanes, if anything.\nAs population increases, density will increase too, whether the powers that currently be care to plan for it or not.\nMore people will continue to pack into the city centre, and yet the roads are already at capacity - these people will have to find SOME way to move around the city.\nThe government should be encouraging people to explore alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling.\nInstead, the government is punishing people for daring not to step outside its' preferred status quo of car ownership.\nRemoving bike lanes discourages cycling, which is a very important method of transportation due to it's low environmental impact and high spacial efficiency.\nI would wager that the road space saved by removing the bike lanes would be replaced by increased traffic from the cyclists who will be forced to drive instead.\nThis will lead to an overall INCREASE in traffic and congestion for all Ontarians, not to mention an inconvenience to the hundreds of thousands of cyclists in Toronto who use these bike lanes daily.\nDo not remove these bike lanes.\nCyclists aren't going anywhere, and removing those lanes will lead to inconvenience for cyclists that detour, increased danger of accidents for cyclists that don't, and an increase in traffic and gridlock due to the addition of new traffic lanes without any meaningful contribution to infrastructure to support this new traffic.\nAnd while I'm here, I think it's hilarious that the proposal mentioned Highway 413, the useless highway that absolutely nobody asked for, which leads to communities with insufficient infrastructure or population to justify the expense and environmental impact of the project.\nIt's almost as if somebody in the provincial government has a financial interest in promoting the sale of cars, and highways to drive them on, and houses at the end of these highways where there's currently Greenbelt protected land or otherwise undeveloped land.... definitely no conflicts of interest here, right?\n"

        "comment": "This is genuinely one of the dumbest decisions to make. The fact that we're currently even having the conversation about removing bike lanes, of all things, seems incredibly unbelievable. Bike lanes have been shown by many sources, including CBC, TVO, and sharetheroad.org, *not* to increase traffic congestion as Ford is claiming. They're also shown to keep people safe, when they have a designated lane in the road in which to ride their bicycles. By proposing to remove bike lanes, especially in a traffic-heavy city like Toronto, it would be putting countless people at risk for zero reason. There's no situation in which any person with sense could actually see this being a good way to spend our tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "In a recent Toronto Star Op-Ed, the Minister of Transportation contends that \"what we need is a common sense, evidence-based bike lane policy\".\nI agree with the Minister; fortunately, that's what we already have right now.\nThere is ample evidence, both from Toronto itself and from around the world, that the complaints regularly levelled against bike lanes are overblown (at best), or completely bogus (at worst).\nThe linked fact-checks from CBC, and the linked study, cover all the main points, but in summary:\n(a) Bike lanes do not cause gridlock - in fact, a safe, well-connected and well-maintained bike lane network can actually reduce it, by encouraging people out of their cars\n(b) In general, building more lanes *anywhere* does not reduce gridlock, due to induced demand - more lanes encourages more cars, which fill the available space\n(c) Bike lanes do not negatively impact emergency services, and the first responders themselves are bemused by these repeated claims\n(d) Bike lanes are well-used - cyclists make up around 30% of vehicles entering/leaving Downtown along Richmond & Adelaide, but it doesn't always look that way as they're so much more space-efficient.\n(e) Bike lanes are a boon to business - far from harming the local economy, businesses along bike lanes tend to report more customers, staying longer, and spending more.\nThis legislation is ill-thought-out, ideologically driven, an appalling overreach of Provincial authority, and a massive step backwards for our City. I oppose it thoroughly.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply frustrated and angered by the release of the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving you Time Act,\" as the government moves to remove bike lanes in Toronto.\nAlready much has been written in regards to the reasons why the legislation aimed at stopping the implementation of and removing bike lanes is deeply flawed.  I am appalled that senior leaders of the government have no qualms about playing games with traffic safety, misrepresenting facts about bike lanes and bike lane usage in the city all in the name of a few votes. The stat of \"1.2% of commuters using bikes\" is from an outdated 2011 StatsCan survey, and has little bearing on life for citizens in downtown Toronto in 2024.\nTo illustrate, I would like to share my story of how bike lanes markedly improved my quality of life in the city, and why I strongly advocate against this legislation.\nI moved to Toronto in 2005. I was always very conscious of trying to design my life to minimize any commuting.  For years I lived within either a short subway ride or a 10 minute walk to my office.  In 2021, my wife and I moved to Cabbagetown. My office is on Richmond St W near Bathurst St.  I tried walking, transit, and driving to work, but it always seemed to take 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete the journey, and many times often much longer.\nIn September 2022, I tried using Bike Share Toronto to bike to and from work, and it was a revelation.  Now, I get to and from work in 20 minutes, consistently and always, no matter the weather.  I was amazed at how easy and safe it was to bike to my office, and because of the bike lanes on Wellesley St, Harbord St, College St, University Ave, Richmond St, and Sherbourne Ave, I have many ways of getting to and from work, and running errands in between without ever having to use my car. I love how cost-effective Bike Share Toronto is, and I am happy to bike in the protected bike lanes, because I feel safe.\nPrior to 2022 I never owned a bike, and never made use of the cycling infrastructure in the city. Now I use it every day.  I only chose to try biking because I was frustrated by driving and by being delayed on public transit. I was worried about the safety of biking, but the bike lanes in the city keep me safe, giving me the chance to remove my car from the roads, directly contributing to easing congestion in the city.\nThe bike lanes dramatically improve my quality of life in the city.  My wife observed that when I come home from work, I am no longer frustrated, irritable, or angry because I haven't spent hours fighting traffic.  Road rage is endemic in Toronto, but as a commuting cyclist, I actually enjoy my commute, so much so that I actually commute year-round regardless of the weather.  I made a nominal investment into clothing to keep me warm and dry on rainy or cold days, and have found it very easy to commute to work year round.  From January to April 2024, there were only 3 non-consecutive days where I was unable to commute to work via biking because of adverse weather. I found the City always made rapid and conscientious efforts to keep bike lanes safe for travel.\nEspecially in the winter when cycling, the separated bike lanes keep me much safer.  They allow me  to maintain my own pace, safely separated from cars.\nIf the bike lanes are removed, as is threatened, the government threatens to materially worsen my quality of life in the city, as I will be forced back into my car.  This will take time away from my family, and add to road congestion.  Removing the bike lanes will not improve traffic congestion, and it appears neither will anything else in the proposed Act.\nThe purpose of this Act appears to be to win political points with certain groups of people, but it is not doing things that will improve their lives. Instead, it will take actions to worsen other people\u2019s quality of life, like mine. The threats to remove bike lanes are not grounded in any set of facts, but are certain to make my commute to work more hazardous. I urge the government to consider my request and drop the proposed laws regarding bike lanes.  If the government continues down this path, these decisions will materially worsen my quality of life in Toronto, and make me less safe.  Please reconsider your legislation and withdraw the sections affecting bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Hon. Doug Ford and Hon. Prabmeet Singh Sarkaria.\nPlease stop this insanity. I am an emergency physician in downtown Toronto. I am a driver and a cyclist. While gridlock is a problem in Toronto, adding more roads is not the answer. The current population of Toronto and the GTA is such that there are more drivers and potential drivers than roads available. Adding a few lanes on Bloor and University may reduce gridlock for a few minutes, but Waze will be sure to fill them up again within weeks. More options, not more roads.\nBy reducing bike lanes, all you do is take safety away from cyclists. Or turn them back into drivers, to add further congestion.\nLet me be clear. By taking bicycle lanes away, you will literally have blood on your hands. The blood of open fractures, crushed skulls and ruptured organs of cyclists on unprotected lanes of road.\nMy kids use these lanes. You can be sure that if these lanes are removed, my family will be leaving the city. It just won't be safe.\n"
