        "comment": "Premier Doug Ford and the PC party should truly \"stay in their lane\" when it comes to transportation planning in the city of Toronto. Ripping out existing bike lanes is not only counterproductive, but it also ignores extensive research showing that bike lanes can significantly improve overall traffic flow.\nStudies indicate that bike lanes reduce congestion by encouraging more people to cycle, which decreases the number of cars on the road. Successful cities like London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Stockholm have demonstrated that well-designed cycling infrastructure leads to smoother traffic conditions and shorter travel times for all users.\nInstead of dismantling bike lanes, Toronto should invest in sustainable public transit options and enhance its cycling infrastructure. This strategy not only encourages residents to leave their cars behind but also promotes cleaner air and a healthier urban environment.\nA forward-thinking approach to transportation that embraces biking and public transit will make Toronto a more livable, vibrant city for everyone. Let's focus on investments that benefit all residents rather than reverting to outdated car-centric policies.\n"

        "comment": "Bikes lanes are important and reduce the number of cars on the road. They also increase the number of people shopping at local businesses. Encouraging active transportation is another way to help reduce illness. Getting rid of bike lanes will not reduce gridlock. We need alternatives to get people out of cars and limit cars from increasingly being the only transportation option for commuters. The Taylor Swift concert is a great example of how important having options is to reduce traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Hello. I ride bikes and also drive cars. In order to drive on the road I had to have training and attain a license. I believe all adult riders on bicycles (electric or human powered) should have some sort of license and training (unless they already have an automotive license). This way we can increase safety on our roads (especially with high speed electric vehicles).\nI support the provinces initiative to manage where bike lanes can be placed and  believe that poorly planned bike lanes definitely can increase congestion if they remove a lane that was previously there for cars. I think an elementary school student could see this from a logical perspective.\nGreat job by the provincial government on addressing this .\n"

        "comment": "This is a stupid and very dangerous proposal. People will die because of it their deaths will be at the hands of this government. Lets used fact based decision making and not some finger in the air politically driven decision. Mixing cyclists and cars will not speed up congestion - it will create more. A bicycle in a lane of traffic will slow down the traffic behind while making them susceptible to accidents. This is a horrible proposal from the government to try to gain a few votes from suburban commuters? They ain\u2019t winning a Toronto seat anyway so what\u2019s the point? If Ford wants to be mayor of Toronto so bad he should run for that job. For now maybe he should focus on actual problems in Ontario, like the housing crisis, instead of bike lanes and sending $200 cheques to billionaires!\n"

        "comment": "I have many concerns about the effects of this bill. I am both a driver and a regular commuter cyclist. There is no doubt that there are congestion problems in Toronto however reducing bike lanes is not a solution and will certainly have negative consequences.\nThe addition of bike lanes in my neighbourhood has had a clear effect of increasing the number of bike commuters over the years since installation. This is something that happens gradually as people change their habits, so it is not surprising that initially these lanes may appear underutilized. Every bike in the lane represents potentially one less car on the road, which should be the goal for legislators, to reduce congestion for those who need to use motor vehicles. As winters become milder, this is an increasingly viable year round option for people and needs to be considered as part of a transportation plan.\nRemoving bike lanes also makes roads less safe for all users. For some, this will force them back into a vehicle, worsening congestion, for others they will continue but face increased risk of serious collision with cars. The province pays for health care too- shouldn't this be a concern?\nBicycles use less space, cause less wear and tear on roadways and require less costly parking infrastructure. Many new developments in the city don't even have car parking spaces. The province pays for roads, why would they actively deter people from choosing transportation options that save them money?\nThis is to say nothing of the importance of the importance of supporting the use of emission-free/low emission transportation options as part of the larger picture of addressing the climate crisis. We need to create more opportunities for this, not take them away.\nThis bill is shortsighted, penny-wise and pound foolish. Address congestion by investing in public transit as a viable option, managing construction projects and proper road use, not by eliminating safe use of alternative methods of transportation that, in and of themselves, actually do reduce car congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I am very disappointed that the provincial government is planning such a regressive policy.\nIt is very clear that the density of our urban centres demands space-efficient modes of transportation. Individual private automobiles are extremely inefficient in this regard. On the other hand, public transit, walking and cycling are very space-efficient.\nFurther, the promotion of ongoing use of individual automobiles will continue to drive to environmental degradation. Internal combustion engines produce CO2. Electric cars require large resource intensive batteries. More motor traffic requires more road maintenance which is also extremely resource intensive (natural and economic resources).\nPromoting cycling, for those who are physically able, will increase population physical and mental health.\nIt saddens and frustrates me to know that my provincial government, understanding the above full well, decides to mandate against bike lanes and promote automobile travel.\n"

        "comment": "The Minister must ban bikes along the selected corridors where bike lanes are scheduled to be removed. If bike lanes are removed, bikers will simply continue to use the entire lane of traffic, continuing to cause traffic slowdown, gridlock, and ultimately safety issues. Making bikers use the side roads is reasonable, but then that only works if there is a proper ban (and enforcement thereof) on bikes using any of the lanes at all on these critical main roads.\n"

        "comment": "I live close to Bloor and Dovercourt and strongly oppose the removal of the existing bike lanes. I drive and bike every day in the city, and I go out of my way to take Bloor both with my bike and my car. The bike lanes have made getting to business on Bloor EASIER by bike AND by car. When I take my kids to see their doctor on Bloor, I can feel safe biking when them in the trailer on the protected bike lane, and we often go out to dinner or shopping around the area when we go. When we need to we also drive and it is quick and traffic flows well (as opposed to other streets nearby like Dupont which albeit has two lanes, is always way more congested than Bloor).  I don\u2019t understand who thinks that the bike lane removal would reduce traffic and reduce the access to businesses when in fact it is the complete opposite. Driving is easier and biking is easier and safer with these bike lanes in place. The province should not be able to decide to remove vital infrastructure, it should be the people of the city who live and use the space. Please please do not take out our bike lanes. Not only for the safety of my children whom I would like to have grow up in a space where we can feel comfortable being outside, but also for our community, which is thriving in a space where access to business has improved, and for the sake of driving in my neighbourhood, which I do confidently on Bloor where the flow of traffic is vastly better than on nearby streets. Please listen to your people, Mr. Ford.\n"

We don't need more roads, we need more bikes, transit, and active ways to get around. Think how busy your roads are going to get when all these people on bikes start buying cars to feel safe. Go look at any major city that works well, and you'll see that more cars is not what they've done. London, Dublin, New York. All move millions of people daily and do it with a mixed model that frankly is miles ahead of us. Stepping backwards so Joe on Bloor can drive his giant pickup is not helpful. No offence Joe, but I don't like your pickup truck either.\n4. The university bike lanes are beautiful. We spent how freaking long ripping that whole stretch up and now.. let's do it again.

        "comment": "I strongly urge the provincial government to end its war on Toronto bike lanes. Toronto is a complex major city of many millions, with its own local government that's responsible for running the city in ways that serves the residents best, including making decisions such as how to improve transportation safety.\nThe city has spent years studying how to improve transportation safety, with cycling infrastructure being a necessary mode for a city this size. I would like to see what studies the province is basing its decision on to dictate that the city undo all this work. Arbitrary top-down dictation of commands by the province is not healthy for a thriving mega city such as Toronto.\nWhy is the provincial government overreaching and antagonizing the residents of Toronto, particularly those who bike regularly. As a major city, public transit, walk-ability, and biking infrastructure are the best options for people who live here to move around. Just like in all major cities world over, transport by car should compliment but not supersede the other safer modes of transport for various reasons. I will highlight a few reasons why bike lanes are great for Toronto.\n1). Safety: Dedicated bike lanes ensure drivers and bikers alike are aware of their zones, hence reducing the likelihood of accidents. Deaths of bikers in Toronto have been a sad statistic over the years and the city's efforts to reverse this trend by focusing on bike safety through bike lanes has made a huge difference.\n2). Health and environmental benefits: No pollutants are left behind with biking. Biking is also keeps people active physically, which is good for health and that indirectly trickles down to lower stresses on our already overburdened health care system.\n3). Reduced congestion: Local residents seeking to move around the city by bike ensures fewer cars on the roads and the associated benefits of that shift: reduced congestion, reduced pollution, etc.\n4). Community and business cohesion: Moving around by bike makes it easier to connect city neighborhoods and businesses. Be it kids visiting friends by bike or folks going about they weekend activities such as shopping at farmer's markets or other local businesses.\nPlease don't divide us by trying to solve something that needs no solving. The optics of this entire charade sound scream 'politics'. Stay in your lane (pan intended).\n"
