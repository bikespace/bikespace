        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nAs a daily cyclist commuting along University Avenue from the Queen St. W. and Spadina Ave. area, I want to express how essential this bike lane is. University Ave serves as a critical route for students and workers traveling from the west side of Toronto to the Yonge-Dundas area. Removing these bike lanes could have serious consequences, potentially pushing cyclists to drive instead, leading to increased traffic congestion, more gridlock, and higher environmental impact.\nBike lanes are not merely an alternative but a practical solution that reduces road congestion and environmental harm. Every morning, I see dozens of cyclists on University Ave, all contributing to a more efficient and cleaner city. Removing bike lanes could risk increasing traffic without guaranteeing a resolution. If it doesn\u2019t work out, reinstating them would come at a further cost, ultimately paid by taxpayers.\nI urge you to maintain the University Ave bike lanes for a sustainable and effective transportation option for Torontonians.\nSincerely,\nChi\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is short sighted, a waste of money utterly fails to properly protect cyclists. There are already too many cycling injuries and deaths on Toronto Roads and as a driver, I like the separated lanes because I worry less about hitting someone.\nThe province should also focus its efforts on getting the Crosstown operating. Where have they been for the last ten plus years when that construction created traffic and congestion havoc. It\u2019s badly managed with no end in site!  And getting it operational will help with gridlock across the city.\nIf  province were serious about reducing gridlock in Toronto it would change legislation to prevent condo and other building construction projects from blocking lanes on major arteries. For example, there is a condo being built on Balliol at Avenue road that is blocking the curb lane and during rush hour creates long backlogs all the way to Bloor (see attached video). Condo construction on Yonge Street creates similar backlogs but it\u2019s a shame that the province is only interested making life more dangerous for cyclists instead of doing something meaningful that might actually minimize gridlock\n"

        "comment": "Generally, I do not care enough about proposed bills to submit a comment; but bill 212 poses a real risk to traffic safety. Tearing up completed bike lanes will endanger cyclists and pedestrians while wasting taxpayer money. Traffic safety in Ontario is already second class compared to cities in Europe. Bill 212 will endanger lives and waste taxpayer money. It should not be passed.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Members of the Public and Esteemed Policymakers,\nI urge you to reconsider the proposal to remove bike lanes in Ontario. Recent studies and local events demonstrate that such actions will not improve traffic flow; instead, they will likely lead to increased injuries and fatalities on our streets.\nResearch consistently shows that the presence of dedicated bike lanes reduces the likelihood of accidents involving cyclists and vehicles. In fact, the removal of these lanes can create dangerous environments where cyclists and motorists are forced to share the same narrow space, increasing the risk of collisions.\nTragically, recent deaths on Bloor Street serve as stark reminders of the potential consequences of inadequate cycling infrastructure. These incidents highlight not only the immediate danger cyclists face when bike lanes are blocked or removed, but also the broader impact on community safety. Every fatality is a loss that affects families, friends, and the very fabric of our neighbourhoods.\nMoreover, it is essential to recognize the myriad benefits that cycling brings to our cities. Beyond promoting healthier lifestyles, bike lanes contribute to reduced congestion, lower emissions, and vibrant, economically prosperous communities. When we prioritize cycling infrastructure, we invest in safer streets for everyone\u2014cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\nAs we navigate the challenges of urban mobility, let us focus on solutions that enhance safety and accessibility. Retaining and improving bike lanes is not merely a matter of transportation policy; it is a commitment to protecting lives and fostering thriving, inclusive communities.\nLet us choose progress and safety over outdated notions of traffic management. Together, we can build a future where all road users coexist harmoniously.\nSincerely,\nYour fellow citizen.\n"

Cyclists will still use the roads, and cars will be forced to slow down to match their speed. Will this improve congestion?\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this Bill.  As someone who lives in this area of Toronto, I am directly affected by this proposed Bill.   I should note that I both drive and am a pedestrian in this area.  I rarely ride a bike. While it may be the case that traffic is slowed by the bike lanes, it is indisputable, in my opinion, that these streets are now safer for everyone as a consequence of the separate bike lanes.  Bad drivers, whether of bikes or of cars, are constrained by the new system and we are all safer with the separation of traffic that the lanes create.  I have lived in several American cities where there are no bike lanes.  I can say that expanding roads at the expense of other modes of transportation does not decrease traffic or gridlock.  The only solution to traffic is a balanced one, which encourages multiple modes of transportation, including safe biking and public transport.  Please allow the City of Toronto to deal with its problems without the interference of Provincial politicians who don't care about our well-being.\n"

Do they not think that will make everything more dangerous?\n"

Removing these bike lanes would also likely cause even more congestion in these arterial roads because by removing bike lanes, it would force cyclists to move onto main traffic lanes which would result in major slowdowns.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, who also lives next to one of the bike lanes proposed to be removed and who both drives and bikes in the city, I am heavily opposed to the removal of the bike lanes.\nFirst off this is a waste of money. The bike lanes are already in place. What a waste of tax payer dollars. Something this provincial government should feel is against their tax payer respecting ethos.\nSecondly, this seems like a provincial overreach. This was voted on in a municipal context and should be decided by those who pay taxes and live in this city. I understand that constituents from the transportation minister may have frustrations, but they don\u2019t live here nor should their opinion and cycling as a mode of transportation be weighed since no one in their right mind would commute to Toronto from Brampton. But they definitely do within my community.\nI\u2019m tired of the culture wars being fought out over this while people feel unsafe, die and feel like they can\u2019t get from point a to point b in an acceptable way. If we can come up with creative forward thinking ways to solve gridlock, great! But this is regressive and ultimately based on data and how lots of other big cities internationally solve their gridlock, won\u2019t work to solve the problem!\n"

Removing any portion of any of them - let alone the entirety of all the lanes - would dramatically increase my risk of injury and death on the road, as there simply aren't suitable or timely side street routes available to replace the journies I rely upon these lanes for. While commuting along these lanes I also make use of a wide range of businesses, restaurants and city services that are significant easier to access by simply hopping off my bike and patronizing than I would if I had to instead rely upon transit to make these same journies. These bike lanes are essential, irreplaceable and hugely necessary.\n"
