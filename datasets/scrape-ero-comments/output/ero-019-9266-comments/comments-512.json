        "comment": "This is such a backwards law! Ontario was finally moving in the right direction to try to catch up with other developed countries. Bike lanes are necessary! They reduce gridlock, are good for business and are good for personal health. That they sometimes result in cutting car lanes is not a problem- and is not what slows down traffic. What slows down traffic is all the unnecessary and inefficient construction. Please consider dropping this proposal which is only meant to distract from the government\u2019s previous failures in selling out the green belt to corrupt construction companies\n"

        "comment": "1. The province should not be interfering with the city of Toronto\u2019s decisions on how to manage traffic especially when considering Toronto spent their budget to construct the lanes. The city of Toronto\u2019s planning and budget is also spent on alternatives to cycling - including transit. Should the province interfere and make it more difficult for people to get around the city (via bike) there should be funding for transit as well.\n2. More cars create more traffic. Single occupancy vehicles are the root of the cause of traffic. More people should be using more efficient ways to safely get around the city. This is via transit and cycling.\n3. Cycling is very dangerous in the city. The bike lanes (when cars and companies do not block them) help ensure safety of cyclists.\n4. If you are worried about more lanes - specifically on Bloor - another suggestion would be to remove street parking on this stretch of road. Lots of side streets, green P.\n5. Stop spending tax payer money redundantly and inefficiently. The province should focus on healthcare and education resources. I am fairly certain the people of Ottawa do not care about the bike lanes on Bloor but would benefit from access to a family doctor.\n"

        "comment": "It is critical that municipalities have the ability to take action that will help the people living in their boundaries. This proposal from the provincial government is overreach and has negative consequences for basic governance. Equally troubling is the provincial government incorrectly citing \"facts\" to support its position on bike lanes (e.g., that only 1.2% of people commute  by bike) and conflating issues to buttress their position. Doug Ford is actively promoting misinformation.\nAs a resident of downtown Toronto who owns and drives a vehicle, I am 100% supportive of expanding the existing cycling infrastructure. Eliminating bike lanes will not reduce congestion. It will reduce safety for cyclists and slow traffic even more.\nPlease stay in your own lane and stop meddling in what is rightfully under municipal jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "I think that this proposal is a move in the wrong direction. In order to combat gridlock and climate change Toronto, and Ontario in general, should be promoting and creating more bike lanes. Not removing existing ones. Bike lanes have been proven to increase bike traffic, as well as visitors and profits for local businesses and storefronts. Biking and bike culture has been effectively implemented into many city centers around the world, Copenhagen being the poster child. Increasing bike traffic has yielded socio-economic benefits in the near eight hundred million euros for an investment of three hundred million. In addition,it has helped to eliminate hundreds of tons of Co2 output into our atmosphere, by reducing the number of cars on the road. Naturally this reduction in cars also leads to a reduction in gridlock. Also less people driving means less accidents, and bike lanes act as natural buffers for pedestrians.Taking away people's safe transportation options is only going to make people more reliable on their cars instead of looking for alternatives, and will lead to an increase in traffic accidents with more cars on the road, as well as more deadly accidents for those who choose to continue to bike without safe spaces. Pedestrians will also likely face an increase in fatal accidents as their natural walking space is now closer and less protected from traffic. In addition, many new developments in Toronto are opening with many more bike parking spaces than spaces for cars. Toronto should embrace this trend and look to become one of the most bike friendly cities in the world. It will make the city healthier, safer, and more enjoyable to visit in a live. Cities where people get out to enjoy the air and move their bodies are cities where people want to live. This proposal would put the city behind the curve and decrease its competitiveness as a top choice to live by decreasing people's options for safe transportation. Make the air less clean, decrease local business profits and make the city more dangerous for pedestrians, bikers and drivers alike.\n"

        "comment": "The Government of Ontario (GoO)'s plan to remove bike lanes in Toronto, ostensibly in the name of improving traffic flow, is shortsighted and wasteful. Not only would the funds required to remove the lanes be better spent on priority issues impacting all Ontarians, like health care, housing, and education, but also the literature makes it clear that removing bike lanes will not improve the speed of traffic and, if anything, is likely to lead to more congestion.\nStudies on Toronto's traffic woes, as well as studies conducted on the flow of traffic in other major metropolitan cities, agree that the key to reducing vehicular congestion is more transportation options, not fewer. Any contemplated changes to bike lanes should be paused until the completion of other public transportation initiatives, such as the construction of the Ontario Line, so that changes to traffic flow can be taken into account when determining the best way forward in order to meaningfully address the needs of all stakeholders.\nNot only will removing major Toronto bikes lanes, such as those along University, Bloor, and Yonge, put cyclists, and by extension drivers, at risk of increased collisions, but it will create endless construction along three of the busiest streets in Toronto. The last thing Toronto drivers need is more construction, the actual culprit of massive traffic delays in downtown.\nFurthermore, by keeping major bike lane arteries open to cyclists, it reduces the number of downtown riders on the TTC, leaving more room on public transportation for those commuting from outside of the downtown core and decreasing the number of vehicles on the road. A recent study by a team of researchers from the Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering in the University of Toronto\u2019s Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering looking at the optimal protected biking infrastructure for Toronto found that certain protected bike lanes, specifically Bloor Street West, are essential no matter what strategy was pursued.\nBeyond subjecting Torontonians to needless construction and more dangerous roads, removing the bike lanes is also a redundant waste of taxpayer funds that is offensive to all Ontarians. The money has already been concretely spent to build the bike lanes. Spending more money to undo what has, in some cases, just been finished is a negligent use of taxpayer money that deserves to spent ensuring all Ontarians have access to family doctors, stable and affordable housing, affordable childcare, and other fundamental services. Toronto-centric initiatives, such as the proposed bike lane removal, read as an attempt to address the personal grievances of a select group of individuals, rather than a provincial issue that boosts Ontario's standard of living as a whole.\nMoreover, the GoO touts its commitment to green energy initiatives when courting international partners but if it were serious about being a forward leaning business environment, it would invest in initiatives that move more people, and not more single passenger cars, across the province.\nToronto has the potential to be one of the best metropolitan cities in the world but it continues to be hampered by antiquated urban planning policies that refuse to accept that modern cities cannot be car dependent. Rather than making ad hoc transit decisions, the GoO should work with Toronto's Director of Traffic Management, engineers and urban design professionals that contemplate a long term strategy to address long term issues.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist and a pedestrian, and I live in downtown Toronto. I\u2019m strongly opposed to this bill. There is no research showing that bike lanes cause gridlock. There is ample research showing that adding car lanes causes more gridlock. Many cyclists and pedestrians were killed by cars in Toronto this year. Removing designated bike lanes will result in more deaths. Adding car lanes will increase the number of cars in the city and will worsen the gridlock and the environmental pollution which is already pretty bad.\nI am also opposed to the government using my tax dollars for this purpose.\nResident of Toronto\n"

With cars getting bigger with larger blind spots, this is of raising concern.\nA dad that travels by car and bikes with his kids.\nPS.

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important aspect of transitioning to a green climate! Whether or not there are bike lanes, there will still be cyclists. I'm sick of Toronto making headlines because of the number of cyclists who are KILLED due to a lack of safe infrastructure. Removing already established bike lanes will increase danger for current cyclists and will not reduce bumper to bumper traffic. What will reduce traffic is more frequent busses, streetcars and subways - the money that could be spent ripping out bike lanes should instead be used to improve current public transit across the province.\n"

        "comment": "The amendment to remove bike lanes in Toronto and to require provincial review of new bike lanes across Ontario is a mistake. There is no legitimate evidence (Provincially, Federally or even Globally) that proves adding bike lanes decreases traffic flow. This would be a complete waste of taxpayer money, especially since the City of Toronto has already spent the money to add bike lanes where they were clearly needed to begin with. Removal of bike lanes, particularly in a metro area such as Toronto, has massive safety risks.  Removing bike lanes does NOT remove the cyclists themselves. It simply dumps them onto a dangerous shared road with cars/trucks trying to squeeze past the cyclists, which is extremely dangerous to the cyclists. The cyclists will have no option but to take up the entire lane in order to protect themselves from being sideswiped, which will SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC EVEN MORE. This is a terrible proposal, doomed to fail and will needlessly cost money and potentially lives. Moving on to the portions of the proposal requiring provincial oversight of new bike lanes in all municipalities. Why would the province spend time, resources and money to review something that can be decided by the highly qualified staff and city councillors? This level of government overreach is a waste of provincial funds and potentially very detrimental to local developments that should remain in the hands of those most qualified: local residents, city staff and councillors. Please, please reconsider this proposal. It is going to be dangerous, costly, and is a big step backwards in progress towards providing citizens with options on how they choose to get around their cities.\n"

        "comment": "As many of us living in Toronto, I have many concerns with the new Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. Just to list a few:\nOnce again, the provincial government overstepping in municipal matters.\nOnce again, the provincial government bringing legislation that has no intention of resolving the issue at hand (as can be confirmed by any subject matter expert); it is only intended to win the votes of people across Ontario that live too far from our city to understand what we need here.\nCycling infrastructure is not the root of the problem, increasing car volumes is. The provisional government continues to meddle with the municipal development approval process to impose new development in areas lacking sufficient transit, which will just add more and more cars to the streets. Cycling infrastructure is being used as a smoke screen to cover deeper issues on how growth and mobility is planned in the region.\nThe provincial government current \"new\" need to approve bike infrastructure is a fallacy. Until February this year, the provincially-regulated Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA) process established the necessary steps that municipalities had to follow to prove the viability of cycling infrastructure. Then in February the provincial government introduced ERO number 019-7891 to delegitimize that process. So the Province had always had a say on how cycling infrastructure was approved, until they chose not to. It is disappointing if not suspicious that the Province removed a clearly articulated mechanism for technical decision making to now introduce a new mechanism that has no identified process whatsoever\nAny policy that prioritizes the convenience of car drivers over the safety of all other street users is creating a two-tier society. Not everyone can drive a car, both due to ability and affordability reasons. The lives of all persons should always be more important than the travel time of some.\n"

        "comment": "There are a few problems with this bill. The climate emergency is getting worse and we need to work toward lowering emissions. That means we need to work to increase choices for travel. That includes making it safe to travel by bicycle. In my 20s, I rode a bicycle in traffic in Toronto on Avenue road, University and Yonge Streets. Now that I am older, I do not feel safe riding my bicycle on busy roads. Nor did I want my children to ride in danger. California has shown that gridlock is not easily fixed. Building more roads just leads to more cars on the road until there is gridlock again. Everyone benefits, including car drivers, when there is good public transportation and bicycle lanes to give people choices on how they travel.\n"
