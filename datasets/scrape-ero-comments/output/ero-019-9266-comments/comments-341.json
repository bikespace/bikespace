        "comment": "I fully support the Provincial Government engaging in this type of review. Too many policy activists have gained influence at the Municipal level, with the goal of punishing commuter traffic and making it increasingly difficult to access urban centers or downtown cores across the Province. Under the guise of active transportation meeting climate targets, they are promoting an agenda of \"transit for thee\" and nimbyism in urban areas. It has also slowed project implementation and driven up costs for Municipalities when they have self prescribed the requirement of adding bike lanes when undertaking capital works in their respective Cities, which is a total farce. Bridge rehabilitation and water and sewer main replacements should not be bogged down with inflated costs to support lifestyle choices and activism.\n"

What if all the money that was going to be spent to do all this, was spent on the TTC and getting better coverage and more reliable public transit?\nAlso, why is thr Ontario government trying to run the city of Toronto? Stay in your lane.\n"

I will be sharing with all of my conservative-voting friends and family so that they do the same.\nThere is no evidence this would help with congestion. Ontario has high housing targets that rely on downtown condos currently being built, most of which aren't being built with much parking anyways, to reduce car traffic downtown. Removing bike lanes goes against the provinces own housing policy goals.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled at the stance of this government has taken towards bike lanes with this act. Time and again research has shown that bike lines only contribute to the reduction of traffic and increase the safety of cyclists.\nI was proud of the new bike lanes that have been installed in my city. Congestion has not increased at all since the bike lanes were installed and in fact, in my experience, it has decreased.\nThe GTA is in a very unique position in Ontario, at the junction of many major highways. When there are accidents on these highways and the traffic inevitably spills onto the streets, it is only the bike lanes that provide residents the relief to get around safely and in a timely manner. Expanding these bike lanes would demonstrate to your constituents that you actually care for their safety and time.\nI really hope you reconsider this piece of legislation and make an informed decision using research and data. Please show your constituents that you care more about them then anyone else.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is an enormous mismanagement of priorities from the province lead by the Ford government. The cities in Ontario are suffering from a huge deficit of transportation availability, rather than focusing on increasing public transit and giving people of large cities more options of transportation this bill cripples many who do not have access to a car. This bill grossly favours people who have access to cars. Bike lanes provide a safe infrastructure for alternative transportation for people who don't drive or don't want to drive. Every bicycle on the street is a car not on the road, there are only benefits of increasing bicycle infrastructure, it is better for the environment, it is an active method of transportation that is better for the citizens of Ontario.\nIn Toronto just this year there have been 6 cyclists death and 12 pedestrian deaths, increasing car density will only increase the casualties. The province should be more focused on delivering mass transit to reach large urban centers like Toronto. Time after time it has been scientifically proven that adding more lanes in cars doesn't decrease traffic, if that were the case then 401 would be the most efficient highway in the world. This bill is very ill informed and it has no benefits to any road users, it definitely won't reduce gridlock nor will it save anyone time. It will do the opposite of that and the cost will be bore by the vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians with their lives. The roads aren't exclusive to just cars. It should be thought of it as being useful for everyone.\nSupporting links provided below.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes will only add more cars to the roads, increasing traffic and congestion. Biking is a healthy mode of transportation that saves Ontarians money on gas, gets us places faster, and reduces our environmental impact. People who live in Toronto (not just drive through it) walk, bike, and take public transportation; an increase of cars will lead to more accidents and deaths. This feels like a short-sighted decision aimed at getting votes rather than improving the commutability of the city. As a resident of Toronto and a taxpayer, I am not interested in infrastructure changes that do not benefit the people who actually live here.\nAlso, hire an editor. This draft legislation is an embarrassment.\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely horrifying that the province thinks this is in any way a good idea. The removal of bike lanes will undoubtedly cause life-altering injuries and deaths to cyclists. Bike lanes reduce congestion. That is a fact. By removing bike lanes, cyclists will drive or take rideshares and add to the already terrible traffic in our downtown core. To frame it any other way is being willfully obtuse. You are single-handedly causing the deaths of your constituents. This is wrong in so many ways and needs to be blocked.\n"

        "comment": "I am a citizen of Toronto and strongly disagree with the Bill's contents in a number of ways:\n1. I strongly disagree with any exemptions to the Environmental Assessment Act for activities related to the building of highways in Ontario. We have the Environmental Assessment Act for good reasons, and must safeguard our natural resources, especially in the Green Belt and surrounding areas that include environmentally significant regions and wetlands.\n2.  I strongly believe (and the data show) that increasing available modes of transportation is absolutely critical to addressing gridlock. The government should spend more time finishing mass transportation projects (like the Eglinton Crosstown) rather than building more highways that will simply fill up due to induced demand.\n3. I strongly disagree with using provincial tax dollars to rip up existing bike lanes that municipal governments have approved, designed, and built after broad and quantitative assessment of usage and impact. The Ontario government should base their decisions on data, not ideology. Bike lanes keep people safe. As a cyclist, without bike lanes, I will slow down traffic by taking the full lane that I am allowed, to keep myself safe.\n4. I strongly disagree with the Ontario government taking on the level of oversight and micromanagement of municipal bike lanes that this Bill entails. It is completely ridiculous. The Ontario government should have higher priorities than micromanaging municipal bike lanes. Finish mass transit, address the family doctor shortage, fund schools so that they can actually address the massive backlog in repairs for our aging schools.\n"

Certain intersections were backed up before the bike lanes, are still backed up with bike lanes, and will continue to be backed up if bike lanes are removed. Removing the lanes will only cause more construction headache for the people that live and work in the areas. Incentive people to take transit and there won't be so many cars.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontarian driver and a cyclist, this bill is perhaps the worst possible use of our province\u2019s limited transportation resources. There is no legitimate evidence that bike lanes meaningfully contribute to the significant congestion problem faced by our province. The fact is that consistent infrastructure failures by all level of government have forced all too many Ontarians to rely on cars to get where they need to go. Especially in Ontario\u2019s cities, there are simply too many of us living together for us to try to solve this problem by building more road infrastructure, at least if we hope that our communities will remain places where Ontarians want to live and grow together. We need more public transport, more walkable hubs, and more cycling infrastructure, not more ways to let people sit alone in their metal boxes. Besides hurting our communities, putting our chips on road infrastructure will only make congestion worse and will hamper Ontario\u2019s economic competitiveness in many ways\u2014wasting hours of our time as we sit on the road when we could have been working or spending time with our families, and making our communities less attractive places to live for international talent.\nIt is mind-boggling that the provincial government\u2019s response to Ontario\u2019s very real transportation crisis is to insert more bureaucratic obstacles for communities seeking to improve their transportation networks. The province does not have the expertise or any business interfering in intensely local street-by-street transportation decisions. If this bill is passed, planning will be more expensive, and the outcomes will be worse for those who have to live with the results. For similar reasons, both because it is unlikely to materially, sustainably improve the congestion issue, and because it will make the city a worse place to live, the provincial government should not usurp local decision-making and waste resources money tearing up existing cycling infrastructure in Toronto.\n"

Removing bike lanes will put cyclists who came out of their cars thanks to the safe bike lanes, back into cars. This proposal will likely cause cyclists to get catastrophically injured and possibly die. It is not evidence based, and is the wrong move in the face of climate emergency. It is shocking that we are even discussing removal of bike lanes in the year 2024. This is absolutely wrong and must be stopped. This is not a partisan issue, stop making it to be one\n"

It's a complete WASTE of TAXPAYER MONEY to rip up brand new bike lanes without researching their effectiveness.  There are many more areas such as health care that could use the money.  This seems to be a knee jerk reaction to a difficult problem to garner votes.  It's a  surprising move for a government that likes to claim fiscal responsibility.

        "comment": "I am someone who has worked who studied transport economics as a student, worked as a transport economist for several areas, and continued to follow and be involved in transit and urban planning issues. This is an absolutely insane proposal, smacking of the worst kind of petty politics. Any body who has studied transit and urban mobility knows that adding more lanes in cities as they become denser in population does not solve anything. They are soon filled with the same gridlock. And if the lanes come at the expense of public transit, walking or cycling they make urban mobility worse and especially gridlock. This bill is a non-solution to a real problem -- something and grade-school child would be able to tell you, but apparently not this government. The problems of Toronto traffic is common to other parts of the province and other problems of mobility. The massive failure to develop and extend public transit in cities and between cities is the most direct cause of gridlock. There are few other options to get around but by car. More cars, more lanes, more people in urban areas is vicious circle that this bill and this government are encouraging. It will be a failure as soon as it is implemented. Other cities around the world, even in Canada  such  as Montreal, are doing the opposite. Massively encouraging walking  and cycling, and developing the latest in public transit technologies within cities and between cities. This is a major generational failure, indeed over many generations in Ontario, in failing  to realize that cars are the worst means to get around cities. This bill is another step backwards for Ontario.\n"

Why shouldn\u2019t we have safe options of commute for everyone based on their chosen mode of transportation. It is absolutely ludicrous to undo decades of advocacy, city planning, and work, not to mention a huge waste of taxpayers money. To reduce gridlock, let\u2019s get more people on bikes and on the TTC and introduce more incentives for NOT DRIVING. In order to have less traffic, WE NEED FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD. City planners and politicians focus should be on making our roads safer for everyone (pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers) rather than FASTER for just the drivers. This bill is a terrible idea and it should not be passed.\n"
