        "comment": "These proposed regulations are an insult to cyclists and motorists alike. Want to improve congestion? Fund more rapid and urban public transit to disincentivize car use. The Ford government's contempt for people's health, safety and environmentally sustainable future couldn't be more clear. This is of the same spirit as selling booze in Circle Ks: all about supposed \"convenience\" and nothing about wisdom or good government. Ford with this proposal is not only pandering to drivers who don't even live in Toronto or other big cities on his run up to an early election; he is wilfully endangering all sorts of people, youth included, who cycle regularly. More terrifying than his spiteful and contemptuous policy is the knee-jerk support of impatient electors who think the only point of government is to facilite their immediate convenience on the road behind the wheel.\n"

        "comment": "As both a driver and a cyclist, I navigate the city using various modes of transportation. When possible, I choose to bike, which has significantly reduced my emissions and costs while providing an efficient means of travel. The expansion of bike lanes throughout the city has enabled me to use my bicycle more frequently, contributing to decreased traffic congestion and lower CO2 emissions.\nHowever, in areas lacking designated bike lanes, I do not feel safe cycling, which necessitates increased reliance on my vehicle. Therefore, I urge the government to reevaluate the proposed legislation and consider allowing local communities to determine the most effective transportation solutions for their neighborhoods.\nTraffic congestion on the Ontario 400 series highways has significantly affected my experiences, often resulting in prolonged periods of idling with no bike lanes in sight. Improving travel between cities in Ontario could alleviate major inconveniences for drivers. Minor issues such as traffic congestion around bike lanes in areas where people live, work, and shop would be a negligible trade-off for all of the benefit's they offer the local community.\n"

What happened to ending hallway healthcare?\nNot only are bike lanes proven to reduce congestion, now we're spending even more money to undo decisions that democratically elected officials have made and construction workers have already built.\nComplete waste of time and money. Please spend that effort on things that still remain broken six years into Doug Ford's office.\n"

        "comment": "I have grave concerns with provincial overreach into municipal matters here\u2014municipalities have different needs and should be able to address them. Beyond this concern, all relevant data show that safe bike lanes encourage cycling and thus lead to fewer people in cars and reduction in traffic. Adding lanes simply creates more traffic due to induced demand. Finally, I fear that bike lanes would just turn into on street parking which is not what we need for communities to thrive when there are lots nearby, and safe accessible transit.\n"

        "comment": "This is a garbage bill that seeks to cater to automobile drivers that live outside Toronto at the expense of Torontonians. The party of \"small government\" and \"cutting red tape\" wants to increase government overreach and add red tape to the process of creating bike lanes? This bill seeks to reduce gridlock by adding cars to the road? Nonsense. This bill will contribute to greater death in Toronto due to increased exhaust pollution and people getting rolled under and crushed by cars.\n"

        "comment": "To reduce traffic, complete streets must be built. The current legislation will increase traffic.\nComplete streets are multimodal and have higher capacity, because they accommodate more types of higher capacity transportation. This include wide sidewalks, safe protected bike-lanes connecting to a complete network to increase usage, and bus/streetcar/transit priority/only lanes. Whenever these options are removed for an extra car lane, traffic goes up. This is because cars are inherently inefficient. Streets reach a capacity that they can handle, and then drivers choose not to drive to avoid the traffic other drivers have created. By adding lanes, you encourage more driving trips, which increases traffic. Because cars are inefficient, a few extra trips will dramatically increase gridlock until the street is clogged again.\nThis legislation seeks to masquerade as evidence based while obviously ignoring the evidence for good street design, and seeks to use a ignorance about the causes of traffic to win suburban votes. Due to the associated cost of infrastructure damage and repair, injury, healthcare, death, etc caused by cars (noise pollution, tire particulates, speeding, accidents, crashes), it is fiscally irresponsible to subsidize a costly mode of transport which directly correlates to a decreased quality of life for the miserable residents forced to live with its consequences.\nPlease consider doing the uncharacteristic thing, and heeding the well established evidence regarding cycling lanes and their benefits to communities over the decision to kill people who don't have enough money for a car or a driveway. Especially when they, who live in denser areas and use transportation methods that are a benefit to the environment and economy see their tax revenue going to subsidize modes of transport that are inherently destructive to people and the planet. Please visit a trauma ward in a hospital regularly to see whether those pedestrians and cyclists deserved the cars that hurt them.\n"

I very strongly disagree with this bill and feel the need to emphasize that all the science points towards bike lanes reducing gridlock, not the opposite. Even the name of this bill is misleading and wrong. Shame on this bill and shame on this provincial government.\n"

Municipalities are best equipped to decide when bike lanes are an appropriate addition to a road. I don't understand why the provincial government wants to add additional bureaucracy and red tape to this process as it would hinder a municipalities abilities to be as responsible as possible to the needs of its residents. Please do not add additional regulations and further government interference.\n"

I walk because our streets are vibrant and filled with life and because it\u2019s how I like to experience the city. I bike for fun on trails and along the waterfront. When I\u2019m trying to get somewhere on time, I bike on the city\u2019s protected lanes.  I only started doing that once the lanes were protected and I didn\u2019t have to find myself squeezed between streetcars, trucks and cars. I feel safe in the bike lanes, I feel like I\u2019m not taking my life into my hands like I used to on many of the city streets. When I take my bike, I\u2019m one less driver on the road, one less person contributing to congestion. I want to continue to feel safe and have more OPTIONS to get around this city. I want my kids to feel safe getting around by bike. That\u2019s why I live in a city like Toronto, for the types of transportation options that work in dense urban areas.\nDon\u2019t force everyone to drive! And stay in YOUR lane!\n"

Traffic causes traffic. This will not ease traffic, this will only make cycling more dangerous and discourage people from doing anything but driving.\nThis is a massive waste of time and money. For a government that ran on efficiencies, this is anything but efficient.\nDoesn't the government have more meaningful things to tackle like housing, homelessness, healthcare and education?\n"

        "comment": "Restricting or removing bicycle lanes in the province at this point in the climate crisis is sheer folly and political pandering. The science is clear that we must do everything we can to encourage people to get out of their cars and on to public transit, bicycles, and on foot. Studies have also shown that more lanes for cars do not in fact reduce congestion, all they do is attract more traffic. The planet and our cities cannot sustain 1950s and 60s commuter patterns. Someone's personal choice to commute to work alone in a private automobile in downtown Toronto should not come at the cost of my safety as a committed bicyclist living downtown. Cyclists pay taxes and vote too. And each daily cyclist contributes more then their share to actually doing something about the climate crisis. More bike lanes, not fewer.\n"

If the bike lanes are removed, I will drive since the public transit has been consistently  unreliable. There will be one more car on the road and much more CO2 emission. Imagine people who opt for the same, commuting during peak hour will be longer than what it is now, the GHE can get even higher.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212's provision allowing the province to approve or reject municipal decisions regarding bike lanes is inappropriate and unnecessary. Municipal governments are directly accountable to their residents and have a clearer understanding of local needs. By intervening in municipal decisions, the province risks delaying important infrastructure projects and limiting local governments' ability to encourage safe, active transportation. This type of overreach could stifle innovation in urban planning, which should be a key priority as we work toward more sustainable and livable cities.\n"
