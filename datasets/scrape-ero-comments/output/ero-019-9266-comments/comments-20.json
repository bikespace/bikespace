It is extremely sad that this government has such careless disregard for safety and the lives of it's people all in the name of saving drivers a few minutes.  When, not if, people are injured and killed how do we calculate the minutes they have lost?\nAdditionally this government campaogned on not wasting tax payer money and removing red tape. This legislation is an absolute waste of tax payer money and adds red tape. It's extremely hard to comprehend how or why this government is proposing this other than a way to actively meddle in democratically elected municipal politics.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is an enormous mismanagement of priorities from the province lead by the Ford government. The cities in Ontario are suffering from a huge deficit of transportation availability, rather than focusing on increasing public transit and giving people of large cities more options of transportation this bill cripples many who do not have access to a car. This bill grossly favours people who have access to cars. Bike lanes provide a safe infrastructure for alternative transportation for people who don't drive or don't want to drive. Every bicycle on the street is a car not on the road, there are only benefits of increasing bicycle infrastructure, it is better for the environment, it is an active method of transportation that is better for the citizens of Ontario.\nIn Toronto just this year there have been 6 cyclists death and 12 pedestrian deaths, increasing car density will only increase the casualties. The province should be more focused on delivering mass transit to reach large urban centers like Toronto. Time after time it has been scientifically proven that adding more lanes in cars doesn't decrease traffic, if that were the case then 401 would be the most efficient highway in the world. This bill is very ill informed and it has no benefits to any road users, it definitely won't reduce gridlock nor will it save anyone time. It will do the opposite of that and the cost will be bore by the vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians with their lives. The roads aren't exclusive to just cars. It should be thought of it as being useful for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This is unfairly targeted at the larger cities wishing to have safer and quicker routes for cyclists. This will result in needless bloodshed and lives lost due to requiring provincial bureaucracy to approve much needed bike lanes. When more people use bike lanes, less people will take up the road, giving up much needed space for essential road users and allowing Ontario\u2019s citizens to get to destinations quicker. The Minister of Transportation and the Premier must reconsider.\n"

I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant and I absolutely do not feel as safe on roads without bike lanes. I don\u2019t own a car and being pregnant makes walking difficult\u2014riding my bike allows me to still be engaged in my community and shop at local businesses. Bike lanes mean I can do that and come home safely to my family. I don\u2019t know that I even understand the purpose behind this bill\u2014is the intent that cyclists should take the lane (as we are allowed to) and be merged with car traffic, rather than travel safely in our own lanes? I don\u2019t see how that would reduce gridlock or improve traffic\u2014bikes can\u2019t accelerate as quickly as cars, and drivers tend to get annoyed if they are behind a cyclist in a lane. But that seems to be the alternative to bike lanes\u2014it\u2019s not always safe or advisable for cyclists to squeeze between a row of parked cars or the curb and traffic, so taking the lane is often the best option for safety but certainly doesn\u2019t improve the flow of traffic and is still less safe for cyclists than biking in a protected lane.\nI plan my routes to shop, volunteer, work, and visit with friends based on where I know there are safe bike lanes. This often means longer-than-necessary travel times or inefficient routes, but I would rather keep my and my baby safe than take a risk on a wide, busy road. I just want to be able to get home safely to my family, and this bill makes me scared for the future.\n"

        "comment": "This is a complete waste of taxpayers money and a major step backwards for the city of Toronto and province of Ontario. Cyclist deserve a safe place to bike. How many cycling deaths before the Ford government cares? Evidently more than 6 given that's how many have died this year alone. Take a look at the corner of Avenue and Bloor, notice all of the ghost bikes within 500m? That is just a short walk from Queens Park, if the sun were low enough the building would cast a shadow on the memorials of fallen cyclists. So many of these death could have been prevented if proper infrastructure had been in place.\nDo not touch our bike lanes. We voted for a pro-cycling mayor. Rather than interfering in municipal affairs, focus on the multi-billion dollar transit projects that will seemingly never open (e.g. Eglington LRT).  That will actually have a positive impact.\nRemoving bike lanes will not decrease commuting times in the long run, anyone with a basic understanding of induced demand can see that plain as day. The only way to reduce gridlock is to remove cars (via biking, public transit, etc..). When cyclists don't feel comfortable biking what do you think they'll do? Drive. All that will do is cause more gridlock\nLeave are bike lanes alone. We like them.\n"

Not only will reducing bike lanes NOT decrease congestion (to the contrary in most cases it will only increase congestion due to discouraging commuters from cycling), it does not represent, in any way, a savings of money. This bill is part of a strategy from the provincial government to engage in a meaningless culture war, fuelled by misinformation, as a means of distraction from numerous scandals and from the real problems of governance which have been neglected in the years of Doug Ford\u2019s service. This is shameful and short-sighted; if implemented Ontario tax payers will pay for the costs of such irresponsible legislation for many years to come, while not even coming close to addressing the REAL causes of traffic congestion, which can only be addressed by increasing funding to public transportation and to alternative, low cost options such as cycling\n"

        "comment": "This proposal makes very little sense to me. I do not understand how replacing lanes on local roads to provide a safe, reliable, and fast form of non-automobile transit could in any way increase traffic. The roads on which bike lanes are being implemented are not effective arterials in the first place.\nFurther, bike lanes are shown to take cars off the road as people switch to biking for more trips. The only way to reduce congestion is to take people from cars to other modes of transit. It is well established that adding lanes or roads induces demand, providing at best a 3 year respite from traffic. Bike infrastructure and transit can reduce demand. If the bike lanes around me were removed, I would start driving more regularly\u2014increasing traffic.\nI understand that the goal of this proposal is not to help mobility in urban or inner-suburban communities where bikes make sense for local trips, but rather for deep suburban commuters. However, even if removing bike lanes could increase traffic flow into the downtown core, where would the cars park? There simply is no space in the downtown core for more cars. Increasing car traffic into the downtown will make traffic worse, decrease quality of life, make the downtown far more dangerous, and make driving far less pleasant forcing drivers to spend hours searching for parking or paying out of their nose.\nI urge the government to consider fact-based policies which can actually increase commute speeds. This means getting\npeople out of cars and onto other modes of transport. Consider projects like elevated rail along the 401 with regularly spaced park-and-rides, or a direct rail connection between Mississauga and Toronto downtowns. Building more roads simply creates more traffic, people need to switch modes if we want to reduce traffic. It also is well demonstrated that fewer lanes frequently have faster traffic flow than more lanes\u2014consider the massive success of reducing arterial roads to one lane each way in Paris.\nI hope the government reconsiders this poorly thought through proposal.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford Government\u2019s proposal to limit and remove bike lanes will actively cost people\u2019s lives and increase congestion. Cars are the most inefficient means of travel because of the space they require to move what is most often just a single person. There are plenty of studies showing that bike lanes do not increase congestion and often lower it. This does not even consider the benefits of a more active society and lessened climate impact that bike lanes contribute to. Cars are also incredibly dangerous and are the cause of the destruction of many downtowns across the world due to their incessant and unjustified demand for more space.

There are 2 transportation lines that are about ready to start moving people so they won't have to be in cars that should be the focus.\nNever mind the \"Ontario Line\" that's already shut down quite a few areas in downtown and causes cars to have to go around alternative ways.\nCurrently you can't drive on Queen Street West over Yonge Street cause of the Ontario Line, and that's just one example.\nBike lanes aren't the problem.\nThe amount of people who use them aren't the problem.\nHaving them is part of a healthy transit system.\nPlease please do not add provincial oversight into building more bike lanes, nor remove current bike lanes. This is completely unnecessary.\nI'm linking to the construction notices for the \"ontario line\" below, it's pretty extensive and hasn't *really* even started so that would be more of a main focus in my opinion.

Thank goodness we have safe accessible bike lanes just north and south, so we can get around quickly, efficiently, and without entering the danger that cars present.\nModern, smart cities worldwide, like Paris and many others, are creating an interconnected bike lane system so people have a safe, comfortable, and practical alternative to costly, dangerous, polluting automobiles, which after all are the root cause of congestion!!\nBike lanes *reduce* congestion. Ironically, the Ontario government's plan will spend money to worsen congestion and make streets deadlier. I understand the bike lanes targetted are along public transit routes like Yonge and Eglinton...people need to bike to and from stations to tackle the \"last mile\" problem.\nThe idea of a government spending so many millions of dollars just to destroy the popular bike lanes that were put in place under the same government is baffling. It strikes me and many as an extremely anti-democratic waste of money that will only make the city and traffic itself worse.\nWhy squander the time, money, and political capital by going back and shredding what is already working for people? If you can find a single study that suggests bike lanes cause traffic please, base your proposal on it. I can't find one and neither can anybody else.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Evidence-Based Counterarguments to this act:\nBike Lanes Reduce Congestion\nContrary to the premise of this bill, research shows that bike lanes actually help ease traffic congestion, not worsen it. Studies from around the world demonstrate that implementing bike lanes leads to reduced traffic and improved flow for all road users. For example:\n\t\u2022\tIn New York City, after installing bike lanes on a major thoroughfare, travel times for cars decreased by 35%.\n\t\u2022\tCopenhagen reported that their extensive bike lane network makes it easier for necessary motor vehicles like buses and delivery trucks to move through the city.\nInduced Demand\nThe bill\u2019s focus on expanding road capacity for cars ignores the well-established concept of induced demand. Research shows that building more roads and lanes for cars actually increases congestion in the long run by encouraging more people to drive. Conversely, providing safe cycling infrastructure induces demand for cycling, taking cars off the road.\nSafety and Efficiency\nBike lanes significantly improve safety for all road users. They provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing accidents and injuries. Additionally, bike lanes are far more efficient at moving people than car lanes due to the smaller space requirements of bicycles.\nEconomic and Environmental Benefits\nBusiness Boost\nContrary to concerns about negative impacts on businesses, bike lanes have been shown to boost sales in areas where they are installed. They attract higher-spending clientele and can even increase property values.\nEnvironmental Impact\nBy encouraging cycling over driving, bike lanes help reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable mode of transportation. This aligns with broader environmental goals and helps create more livable urban environments.\nAlternative Solutions\nInstead of removing bike lanes, the government should consider:\n\t1.\tInvesting in connected, protected bike lane networks to encourage more cycling and reduce car dependence.\n\t2.\tImproving public transit options to provide alternatives to driving.\n\t3.\tImplementing smart traffic management systems to optimize existing road capacity.\n\t4.\tEncouraging flexible work hours and remote work to reduce peak hour congestion.\nConclusion\nThe proposed legislation is based on flawed assumptions about the relationship between bike lanes and traffic congestion. By removing bike lanes, the government risks worsening congestion, reducing safety, and missing out on the numerous economic and environmental benefits that cycling infrastructure provides. A more effective approach to reducing gridlock would involve embracing multi-modal transportation solutions, including expanded and improved cycling infrastructure.\n"
