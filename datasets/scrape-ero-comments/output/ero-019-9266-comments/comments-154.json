If there are no bike lanes then the cyclists will be in the car lane blocking traffic even more. Removing bike lanes will cause deaths that will be on the government.\nThis is also huge amount of provincial overreach. The province should have bigger things to deal with such as healthcare and education instead of focusing on bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I completely disagree with the provincial government attempting to have any input on bike lanes in municipal right of ways. It is an absurd overreach of the provincial government and is a waste of tax dollars. Bike lanes are proven to reduce congestion and improve safety. And the removal of existing bike lanes is a disgusting waste as well. The government's efforts should be focused on improvement of public transport and other types of mass transit with the goal of reducing the number of drivers on the roads. More lanes does not reduce traffic congestion. There are many sources for this, yet the provincial government choose to ignore them for their own political gains.\nI also completely disagree with the language herein relating to excemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act as it relates to the 413. There is no reason that established environmental protocols should be end run for this highway.\n"

        "comment": "I drive across Toronto from the East end to Etobicoke and back for my commute and understand the challenges and frustrations around gridlock and traffic. Seeking to remedy this is certainly a worthwhile goal.\nHaving said that, the sole reason I drive to work is that it takes 3 times as long to travel the 20km by transit and there is inadequate bicycling infrastructure to allow me to safely use my bike to do the same. Every day I wish I wasn't driving.\nI am forced to be on the roads due to inadequate alternatives - I would happily not drive and save the money, time and traffic headaches I encounter on a daily basis. Taking me and people like me off the road is a tangible way to fix traffic. Save the traffic space I occupy for those commuting from afar.\nI know that many in the city of Toronto are in the same boat. The fewer options apart from driving that exist, the more cars are on the road. There is no end in sight - we have more people arriving every year who encounter the same choice - it simply makes no sense to choose either of the non-car alternatives right now. Until or unless that changes, traffic will never, ever get better no matter how many lanes you try and add. This seems to have been proven time and again around the world.\nIt is a profound waste of time and money to remove bike lanes in municipalities. Trying to improve my drive is pointless - help me get off the road! Put funding into transit and leave the bike lanes alone.\nOn the latter point, when I am driving in the city, it's far better for me to have bikers on their own dedicated pathway than weaving in and out of live traffic. Why waste money putting them back in my way? They're not going to go away, it's just going to become less safe for all.\nOn an entirely different point, exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act sounds like a profoundly bad idea. I'm all for cutting red tape but that's not the sort of red tape the province needs to work on. Building for the future means considering the future, not just today's convenience.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a hugely important part of urban infrastructure, especially in densely populated areas like the GTA. Making room for cyclists has multiple benefits not just for individuals, but for the whole community by reducing the number of cars on the road, lowering air pollution and making for an overall healthier, cleaner city. Making more space for cars doesnt reduce traffic congestion in the long-term. Reducing traffic requires getting people out of cars and into alternate forms of transportation like bikes and mass public transit. There are decades of research and expertise in urban planning that support the necessity of alternatives to car travel for healthy functioning cities. And thats without even mentioning the potential impact on CO2 emissions and the urgent need for countries like Canada to do our part in facing the undeniable climate crisis currently making itself known in devastating ways across the globe. The way forward for our cities and our province is not overbearing micromanagment and useless red tape that serves nothing but a political vendetta.\n"

        "comment": "We have known since congestion first started becoming an issue in the 1930s that more lanes would not ease congestion. As Robert Moses built more bridges in NYC, the earliest example of this issue and pseudo-resolution, more vehicles flooded the streets and all new lanes/bridges remain congested. Urban planning, geography and public health data over the last 40+ years consistently demonstrates that active transportation (e.g., cycling) and transit are effective methods in addressing traffic congestion. Provincial reports show that the 413 will save at most 30 seconds. More car lanes in Ontario cities at the expense of lost bike lanes will fail to resolve congestion issues. The loss of bike lanes will result in injuries and fatalities which will add further costs and strain to emergency services, healthcare and the judicial system.\nNot only is this legislation a gross overstepping of municipal policies and expertise, it is a dangerous and costly maneuver designed only to overshadow Ford's own corruption and incompetence.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the following proposal, as it adds unnecessary overhead to municipal operations and represents provincial overreach into local governance. Municipalities are better suited to manage their own transportation infrastructure without interference, unless they specifically request assistance. Additionally, there is little evidence to suggest that bike lanes cause gridlock. The real issue is the lack of investment in public transit by the Ontario government, which would be a far more effective solution to reducing traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This doesn't seem like the best way to tackle gridlock and Ontario's congestion problem, it feels that there are just too many cars on the road   along with the problem of them entering an intersection without room for them. I know there is increased enforcement and penalty for this but I think if an automated ticketing camera was introduced it could enforce it more consistently.\nAdditionally removing bike lanes would also cause slowdown in traffic as cyclists will either feel unsafe and switch to car commuting adding more cars to contribute to congestion, or they will have to take the lane which results in the whole lane being slowed. Sidewalk cycling also doesn't seem like a good idea as it will in turn make the sidewalk dangerous for pedestrians, meanwhile an outright ban on bicycles is really missing out on what could be a very efficient way to move people around without too much noise or space taken.\nI believe that promoting viable alternatives to driving is really the best way to solve this traffic problem. Many trips could be taken with biking or public transit instead of driving but the people don't feel they can depend on it to get them to their destination quickly or safely, even though in other cities, these alternate methods are often the preferred choice getting them to their destination faster than driving. Getting people off the road also allows people who actually need to drive like emergency response vehicles, delivery drivers, people carrying lots of large items and those physically unable to use any other methods to get to their destination faster as well.\nA large part of drivers going into the city also happen to be from the suburbs where the infrastructure for the other methods are much more rare resulting in them driving, I feel a good way to tackle this problem could be large park and ride garages around the outskirts of cities with reliable public transit and bike share stations so they can easily get to their destination while keeping their car from contributing to congestion and gridlock.\nI hope the province could take a look at these other ideas on tackling gridlock instead of ripping out the bike lanes and undoing years of progress that could have contributed to an Ontario that chooses to move more people as efficiently as possible.\n"

One of the best things about bike lanes in Toronto is they seem the be the only infrastructure that can actually be implemented quickly. Bike lanes save lives. We do NOT need to be prioritizing cars in ANY way. Not in this economy, not in this environment, not in this year. This is truly a shameful proposal.\n"

Municipal governments make careful, researched and planned decisions in accordance with the needs of their constituents -- the provincial government should not be spending tax payer time or resources adding an unnecessary level of bureaucracy to these matters.\nFurthermore, this is incredibly wasteful. Bike lanes are generally put in following extensives studies that evaluate their costs, impacts and value. The studies, and subsequent implementation, cost money. That money -- and more required for removal -- will all be wasted.\nFinally, this is not evidence based. Study after study has shown that implementing bike lanes does not increase gridlock. When we make it easier and more convenient to drive, guess what? That's when gridlock increases. Cyclists are drivers, too. And tax payers.\nI wish my provincial government would turn it's efforts to improving public transit --- THAT would effectively reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposed legislation. Whether to install a local bike lane should be firmly within the jurisdiction of municipalities, without provincial interference. Whether to prioritize car lanes or bike lanes or sidewalks or other ways of getting places is similarly a matter for the government of a municipality to decide. The province has no particular expertise in this area and the needs of municipalities across the province vary greatly. I also have serious concerns with the costs associated with provincial review of existing bike lanes in municipalities. This seems an unnecessarily costly and interventionist form of government.\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible on many levels.\nFirst off this is an overreach of government.  I believe cities have the best plans for what will work best in their own area.  Bike lanes, good transit and the like REDUCE gridlock as it gives people more options to avoid cars.  This is better for everyone, especially the environment!\nSecond this seems underhanded and disingenuous.  We should NEVER EVER build roads or public works of any kind without an environmental assessment.  It feels like the bike lanes are in part a distraction to this part of the act.\nThere is nothing redeeming about this Act.  There is nothing that benefits the province as a whole in it, only harms.  It seems aimed at putting more money in the pockets of a few developers at the cost of us all.\nJust no.\n"

        "comment": "I am disappointed that on Bill 212, the government is not being conservative. Instead of making prudent, thoughtful, evidence decisions in collaboration with local stakeholders to solve the very real problems that exist with congestion, it mostly reads like a political ploy.\nSchedule 2/3:\nThe bill shouldn\u2019t be providing an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act. If there\u2019s an issue with the act, update the act. Otherwise, follow the rules as they exist.\nSimilarly, the Building Highways faster project seems like another short term and short sighted solution to a long term problem. Highway 401 is the clear example of how building new highways or widening existing ones doesn\u2019t solve congestion problems, even after decades of trying to do so. Alternative ways are needed to get people and goods to places they need to go.  For example, building and expanding rail networks to shift the transportation burden of goods away from highways.  This legislation just promises to make the existing problems worse and more expensive in the future.\nSchedule 4:\nThere\u2019s nothing in the bill that explains to me why the province should interfere or overwrite municipalities and local stakeholders on what are the best places or methods to put in bike lanes. The assumption that any effort \u201cdiminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d is automatically bad is equally flawed.\nFor example: What if a municipality want to reduce speeding in a school zone and by removing a traffic line and adding in a bicycle lane? What if a university wants to\n"

I, and tens of thousands of others, daily use bike lanes to get to work, which means we are one less car on the road, reducing congestion. I've never felt so safe cycling in this city now that we have so many protected bike lines.\nI am proud of this cycling infrastructure, and it makes the city far safer and more livable (and more \"world class,\" if you care about that stuff).\nBikes and bike lines aren't slowing down traffic. It's the tens of thousands of cars being added to the city each year. It's the construction. It's the cars blocking entire intersections trying to squeeze through on a yellow light.\nBikes are an important part of the solution to urban congestion, so just because Doug Ford doesn't ride a bike doesn't mean the rest of us should be endangered because we've chosen a healthier mode with a smaller carbon footprint.\nThe safer people feel riding on the streets, the more they will ditch their cars and commute by bike.\nPLEASE LEAVE THE CURRENT BICYCLE LANES IN PLACE AND KEEP BUILDING MORE!\nThank you.\nRobert B.\n"
