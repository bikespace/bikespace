        "comment": "I use the Toronto bike lanes almost every single day. I put my trust in them to keep me safe on the road. I use them to get to work, doctors appointments, groceries, meet my friends, and enjoy everything the province and city has to offer. Without separated bike lanes, the roads are not always safe. We hear too often of cyclists being injured or killed by cars. Every cyclist I know has had close calls, cars who are not paying attention, cut too close, change lanes without looking, opening doors into the road. Without being able to take bike lanes in a direct route across the city, I would not be able to get around and it would take away so much I love about being an Ontarien and living in this province. I don\u2019t want to feel less safe in my city. I don\u2019t want to have to choose between my safety and another mode of transportation. I don\u2019t want to have to risk my life to get to work or get groceries. Good infrastructure saves lives. Spending taxpayer dollars to take them away will cost lives, and more taxpayer dollars in medical and public safety costs. The bike lanes make the roads usable, streamline traffic for cars and allow us all to share the road and get to where we need to go. Every day I am grateful they were installed to help protect my life, and the lives of everyone around me.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to the removal of removal of bike lanes in Toronto and the construction of Highway 413. The provincial government should consult with people about the issue of the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and the construction of Highway 413. Bike lanes are safe and are intended for people to ride their bicycles to their location which include work or school. There should be more bike lanes in Toronto. Removing bike lanes can negatively affect cyclists and it will be increasingly expensive to remove bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "If this Act were to be passed, expect to see a lot more headlines of cyclist deaths in the news. As an individual who uses a bike for commuting and has already been hospitalized in the past due to being struck by a driver who was not paying attention to the flow of traffic, passing this act would result in many more accidents and deaths for cyclists. The province should be supporting municipalities in building better, safer cycling infrastructure, as it benefits everyone - it's a sustainable, green way of getting around, more people are able to move around quicker from one place to another, cyclists are more likely to stop at different businesses as there is no need to look for parking, it keeps people physically healthy, among other reasons. If these bike lanes are being stripped, millions of dollars more would be spent to remove them, adding on to the millions that were already spent to build them. Let's not waste taxpayers money.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not proceed with the plan to destroy bike lanes in Toronto and elsewhere.\nI am a retired person who uses my ebike for almost all errands. Yes, including shopping because I have spacious panniers that hold a significant amount of goods. If I don't feel safe on roadways, it will use my car instead, resulting in more vehicle traffic on the road.\nIt is also true for other users of bike lanes, such as wheelchair users and mobility scooters.  Removing bike lanes will only INCREASE congestion, as well as reducing the health and environmental benefits that accrue to cycling.\nRemoving bike lanes will not solve the  vehicle congestion. Only increased funding for transit and other modes will do that, as people will find other modes more convenient and cheaper than driving a car.\nAll major cities in the world are grappling with problems of congestion. New York City has just introduced a congestion tax (fee), and London has had a tax for years. Paris is reducing unnecessary vehicle access to the inner city and others are following suit. If Toronto truly wants to be considered world class city, the only way for success is ensure other travel modes are given priority. This applies to other cities in Ontario as well.\nDo not send the Provincial cities on a retrograde path back to the 1950s. That will not solve our current problems.\n"

        "comment": "I submit this comment as a Toronto road user who routinely both drives and cycles on the streets of Toronto.\nThis proposal is an absurd overreach of provincial authority into municipal jurisdiction. Municipalities, not the province, are best suited to determine the needs for bicycle lanes within their jurisdiction. This extension of provincial oversight into municipal matters is nothing more than a heavy-handed power grab intended to appease a small number of voters.\nFurthermore, it will be counterproductive. Bicycles are entitled to use provincial highways, per the highway traffic act. Removing bicycle lanes where provided will require cyclists to use the highway lane they are entitled to use. There is thus no net benefit to removing these bicycle lanes, as traffic in that lane will be limited to speed of the bicycle.\nFinally, this proposal will almost certainly cost lives, as motorists will continue to drive with a level of arrogance and entitlement that does not respect non-motorist road users. People will die, mostly cyclists, and probably also some pedestrians. Their blood will be on this government\u2019s hands.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto's \"bike lanes\" are not the bike lanes of the past, where health and environmental-conscious commuters could go to and from work in the city. Instead, they have become highways for e-bikes, scooters, and motorcycles that frequently do not obey municipal laws, are unlicensed and uninsured, and travel at or above the speed of licensed and insured vehicle traffic (on busy Bloor, Yonge, etc.).\nThe province should absolutely have a role in making more intelligent decisions about implementing and removing bike lanes in and around the commercial cores of Toronto and other cities, where the time and business interests of employees, companies, stakeholders, and shareholders are much more vast than those of the municipality of Toronto.\nI am a small business owner employing residents of the GTA and Ontario, and I support Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "It's so strange that you would call a bill such a silly name when it clearly has no impact on gridlock. Do you think people will ignore facts and just believe a catchy title? is that why you spend so much tax payers money on marketing? because no one believes the present Ontario government is actually helping them. Or are you just helping a select few who thought it would be fun to spend tax payers money and the government thought why not - we screw schools and hosptitals but happy to waste money cancelling beer contracts, cancelling wind turbine contracts, did cancelling your bleak deal for the Green Belt cost tax payers money? Bringing gambling to my son has been a nightmare but you decided that our young people need that. Or is just about making money and greed? In terms of the bike lanes - I am a Torontonian and I was born here. My parents cycled and I cycle. I live downtown and I use the bike lanes. I rode from Bloor and Bathurst to the Distillery down the University bike lane at night and felt the safest I have felt cycling in this city. BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME DRIVING ANOTHER CAR? I have been hit by a car door and it is pretty terrifying. So that's the first and main reason for bike lanes. Safety. But, the research is clear - more car lanes do not solve traffic issues. You know what slows traffic - giving up lanes for construction allowing multiple enormous construction projects at the same time. Who is making money here?\nAnd to respond as a driver (I do occasionally drive), I prefer the bike lanes so I am not driving behind a slow cyclist or wondering when a cyclist will weave into traffic. The bike lanes keep the cars flowing with no disruption of a bike in front of them.\nAnd lastly, what are you doing about the climate crisis? Where is your leadership? Do you go outside? it's November and my tomatoes are still growing. Kids are suffering now from eco-anxiety and you are just throwing them on the bonfire to suffer with terrible weather in our future. If we have bike lanes - we could have fewer cars polluting the city. I am horrified to see you selling our children's future for your gain from Highway 413, to a private Spa at Ontario Place where my son loved being and all you can think of is killing green space for profit, to no Science Centre. Do you want the children of Ontario to grow up in this future? Or is your short term gain enough?\nI will get a 3 wheeler bike so I feel safe and ride in traffic for the rest of my life if this goes through to really slow down traffic. I just do not understand how helping developers helps the people of Ontario. Its not affordable housing you are building. Ontario was a place to grow and now I want my son to work anywhere but here.  No to 413, keep the Ontario Science Centre and keep the bike lanes. Have you looked at what Paris is doing - how about no cars in the city? that would ease congestion. The future is in green energy and any policy that stops bike lanes just shows that this Ontario government is stuck in some wierd lost world. Your profit seeking willful blindness to reality will make all our kids live in a backward place in 50 years. Get a green climate policy going now, please. Bike lanes help us, help the planet and help our children.\n"

        "comment": "I started riding regularly during the pandemic because of the introduction of bike lanes. Every route I take is based on bike lanes and side streets so that I can bike in relative safety. It\u2019s scary out there as a cyclist and pedestrian and I\u2019d like to move around my city without fearing for my life. Removing bike lanes will do little to ease traffic congestion and a lot to make Torontonians less safe.\nFor transportation to work effectively in a large city it needs to accommodate diverse modes of transportation. Let\u2019s not be regressive instead let\u2019s be progressive.\nPlease keep bike lanes to ensure that I (and countless others) remain safe.\n"

I use my bike most of the year to get around, save money, get exercise, and reduce my carbon footprint. I particularly use the Bloor bike lanes but also many others, including the Yonge and University ones. I don't feel safe riding in traffic but do feel safe using bike lanes and do not understand why the Ontario government would prioritize a few minutes of commuters' time over the lives of cyclists like me. Bike lanes have made a huge difference to my quality of life.\nFrom what I've read, research does not support the contention that bike lanes significantly slow traffic or reduce business for business owners along their routes. Bicyclists have a right to use major streets and to do so safely.\nWhy, when reducing carbon emissions is necessary for all future life, would the Ontario government penalize those whose transportation choices don't contribute to climate change over drivers who do? Why not facilitate ride-sharing, car-pooling, and use of public transit instead? Please do not encourage even more driving, particularly when most cars have only one occupant per vehicle.\n"
