        "comment": "I do not want this. I want MORE bike lanes. Stop forcing more bikers onto the road, it's dangerous for them, and it does nothing but slow me down while driving. Bike lanes are significantly cheaper on a yearly maintenance basis than adding extra lanes to our road. Please scrap this bill and do the exact opposite.\nAlso: Please read a study or two on ACTUAL traffic reduction techniques. This doesn't make any sense and will only cost everyone else in Ontario more (both in time and money).\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide efficient and most importantly, safe paths of travel for cyclists. Municipalities have had too many cycling-related accidents and deaths this year, and this Bill completely minimizes and endangers the lives of cyclists at the cost of \"improving traffic for drivers\", which there is little evidence to suggest that bicycle lanes are the ones causing congestion. It's good to know that the Ontario Government values vehicles over the safety of their citizens (sarcasm). Bike lanes also have numerous benefits (beyond easing traffic by reducing the number of drivers on the road), and this Bill fails to take that into consideration. I am vehemently against this Bill and extremely disappointed in the fact that the Provincial Government even chose to propose this.\n"

        "comment": "First and foremost, investing in bike lanes encourages a shift away from car dependency, which is vital in combating traffic congestion. By reallocating space to cyclists, we can create safer, more efficient roadways that promote active transportation. This is not only beneficial for reducing gridlock but also aligns with environmental goals to decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality in our urban centers.\nFurthermore, bike lanes significantly enhance safety for all road users. Studies consistently show that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces accidents and fatalities for cyclists and motorists alike. By creating protected spaces for cyclists, we foster a culture of safety that encourages more people to choose biking as a viable mode of transportation.\nWe need more bike lanes not less, and spending time and money getting rid of the ones that have already been built is counterintuitive.\n"

        "comment": "If bike lanes are removed, I would hope that the police, in my case the Ottawa Police Service, would monitor on continuous basis that drivers do not encroach on biker, that is allow one metre clearance. Secondly, if bikes and cars are on the same road drivers do not hassle bikers, bikers should be allowed to travel along the highway at the speed they prefer and not be rushed by motorists. Lastly, I don't know what the offence or sentence is for\"dooring,\" but I suggest that if the biker is injured in any way, it should be considered assault with a deadly weapon.\n"

Well let's blame bike lanes for the fact there are too many cars an no effective trains to move people around. Every study done show's how once bike lanes are put in they become well used over a few years and traffic time stabilizes to where is was before bike lanes. Stop lying to the public and stop people being killed on our roads\n"

Bicycle lanes reduce dependency on cars, lower traffic and carbon emissions, all while promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. The conception of this bill is incredibly shortsighted and only serves to add red tape and pander to a minority of the population. For a province that has a Ministry of Red Tape Reduction, the irony of this bill is deafening. The provincial government has no place in telling cities what to do with their public spaces. Let citizens decide what is best for themselves.\n"

It is a clear overreach of the provincial government's authority, which will cause the overhead for creating much needed bike lanes (of which we do not have enough).\nThis goes completely against what we should be striving for, considering the current state of the planet and the necessity of adopting greener alternatives.\nI reiterate my support for bike lanes and I do not believe the bill will be productive or beneficial for their existence; instead, this feels like a targeted attack to allow big government to disrupt progress.\n"

        "comment": "It is deeply concerning that Doug Ford is attempting to shut down our bike lanes, an essential public asset that serves as a lifeline for thousands of cyclists, families, and commuters. This move not only threatens the safety of residents but undermines the progress we\u2019ve made toward building greener, more sustainable cities that work for everyone\u2014not just cars.\nBike lanes are not a luxury; they are a critical part of urban infrastructure. They provide safe, accessible, and affordable transportation options for people of all ages and economic backgrounds. Removing them will force more cyclists onto dangerous roads, increasing the risk of accidents and fatalities. Cities around the world\u2014from Amsterdam to New York\u2014are expanding their bike networks, recognizing that protected cycling infrastructure reduces traffic congestion, lowers emissions, and promotes public health.\nThe benefits of bike lanes go beyond transportation. They contribute to cleaner air and quieter neighborhoods. They help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, playing a key role in combating the climate crisis. Bike lanes also encourage active living, making our streets more welcoming and inclusive for all residents\u2014whether they are cycling, walking, or driving. To remove these lanes is to turn our backs on the future of urban living and on the health and well-being of our communities.\nShutting down bike lanes is a regressive step that prioritizes short-term political gains over long-term benefits for the environment, safety, and livability of our cities. We cannot allow decisions that put lives at risk and hinder our collective responsibility to protect the planet for future generations. It\u2019s time to stand together, reject this shortsighted proposal, and advocate for the expansion\u2014rather than reduction\u2014of bike lanes. Let\u2019s build a future where safe, sustainable, and equitable transportation options are accessible to all.\nWe urge Doug Ford to reconsider and work with community leaders, urban planners, and environmental experts to support a city that puts people first.\n"

        "comment": "I live downtown, and bike instead of driving as often as I can. It's the fastest way to get around. I only use roads with bike lanes because of how unsafe it is to share the road with cars. As a driver myself, I much prefer when bikes have their own lane instead of having to trail behind or squeeze by. We cannot remove the few bike lanes we have; we need to add more.\nAs someone who has always voted Conservative provincially (until perhaps now), I am shocked that tax dollars are being use over and over because a certain political family keeps ripping up the lanes Toronto pays for. What a waste of money.\n"

        "comment": "My comment on this bill is twofold:\nFirst, it's a massive overreach for the provincial government to override municipalities who better understand the transportation needs of those municipalities. I support collaboration between municipalities and the province, but I resent the province dictating to municipalities.\nSecond, the 413 will not \"get drivers where they need to go faster\" if their destinations are high density areas. This speed is an illusion. Getting faster to a slow place reduces the average speed for the trip and doesn't provide the benefit claimed. Many motorists have 5 seats and one occupant. This geometric inefficiency makes car travel impractical, and the taxation needed to support this inefficient infrastructure will only put Ontarians into debt.\nI support the reduction of gridlock, and having a balanced budget. There is no method of transportation more expensive than driving (both in direct and indirect costs).\nI want Ontario to be \"open for business\", and that level of competitiveness requires reducing these inefficiencies wherever possible.\n"

Cyclists will continue to bike in Toronto, and they will do so by taking up more space in your car lanes. Your congestion in Toronto will only get worse. If you want to save lives and lower congestion to keep traffic flowing, bike lanes are how you do that. Everyone has a right to life, liberty and security - cyclists and vulnerable road users are no different.\n"

I also own a car and would like to note that if I am on my bike I am not driving, the lanes have made me bike more, thus reducing gridlock.  I am also a resident of Toronto who is growing very tired of the province seizing control of my municipal government which has installed these lanes based on evidence, careful study and community consultation.  The Province, meanwhile, has offered no empirical data to support this policy.  The entire situation is absurd, and I am very tired of the Premier governing the province based entirely on things he sees out the window of his escalade that make him mad and the profits of Vaughan property developers.  The bike lanes have receipts and evidence supporting their efficacy, I would hope the same would be required for their removal or \"review\".\n"
