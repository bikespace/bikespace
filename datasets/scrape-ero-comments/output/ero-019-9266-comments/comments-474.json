        "comment": "I was alarmed to learn of this proposed legislation. Removal of the three bike lanes is wasteful and illogical, and removes choices from Toronto commuters. Congestion has been awful for decades, and the only effect of these bike lanes was to provide a safe alternative to sitting in gridlock. Perhaps if bike infrastructure and transit received more attention, congestion could be alleviated further by getting many more cars off the street. Instead, this government prefers the crab in boiling water approach to transportation - we must all be forced to sit in traffic with our premier.\nFurthermore, the provincial legislature should not be interfering in urban planning decisions made at a municipal level. This kind of massive government overreach is grossly hypocritical on the part of a \"conservative\" government.\nI have voted conservative in the past but this is the straw that broke the camel's back, and I will not make the same mistake again.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. The proposed legislation to remove bike lanes on key streets in Toronto, including Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, is deeply concerning for several reasons.\nFirstly, the removal of bike lanes undermines the progress we have made towards creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system. Cycling is a vital component of reducing traffic congestion and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating these bike lanes, we risk increasing reliance on motor vehicles, which exacerbates air pollution and contributes to climate change\u2014issues that we should be actively addressing, not reversing.\nFurthermore, the proposal to allow provincial approval for existing bike lanes could lead to the systematic dismantling of cycling infrastructure that has been carefully planned and implemented to enhance urban mobility. The criteria for review, while they may consider environmental implications, seem to prioritize the convenience of motor vehicle traffic over the safety and accessibility of cyclists and pedestrians. This is contrary to the principles of sustainable urban development, which advocate for balanced transportation options that prioritize the safety and well-being of all road users.\nThe notion that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate gridlock and enhance the flow of traffic overlooks the realities of urban transport dynamics. Studies have shown that integrating cycling into the transportation mix reduces congestion and encourages healthier, more active lifestyles. Instead of dismantling existing infrastructure, we should be investing in expanding and improving it, fostering a culture of cycling that benefits the community as a whole.\nI am also concerned about the implications of exempting these actions from the Environmental Assessment Act. This exemption undermines the democratic process of community consultation and environmental review, which are essential for informed decision-making. We must ensure that the voices of residents and stakeholders are heard when it comes to changes that impact our urban landscape and quality of life.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to oppose Bill 212 and advocate for policies that support, rather than dismantle, cycling infrastructure in Ontario. We should prioritize the development of safe, sustainable transportation options that benefit all citizens, not just a select few.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who now commutes by bike most days, I find this this Bill completely out of touch with reality and threatening to every citizen\u2019s ability to choose their preferred mode of transportation in this province. I have made the choice to not own a car because Toronto does offer me other alternatives. After studying and traveling across Europe and Japan, I can attest that there can and there should always be more than less traveling alternatives. At the very least, it is possible to travel around without a car in Toronto. The situation could be far better though.\nBikes offer the opportunity to travel without a car but with the same time flexibility that a car procures, in addition to help protecting the environment by limiting the use of fossil fuels. Plus, the more cyclist there are on the roads, the less drivers there will be (therefore limiting the number of vehicles on the roads and congestion). It\u2019s that simple. Furthermore, car infrastructure has for decades occupied a vast majority of the public space in Toronto\u2019s streets and a lot of North American cities. And traffic has shown no signs of slowing down in recent years.\nOne only needs to look at the map on the Bike Share Toronto application to realize that a vast majority of streets don\u2019t yet have bike infrastructure. One must be creative to find a route that will allow them to get to their destination quickly and safely. On the main biking routes targeted by the Ontario government and Bill 212 (Bloor Street, Yonge Street, University Avenue), the bike lanes have given citizens like me the option to travel by bike in a quicker and safer way. Every day, on my way to work, I see dozens of cyclists on these paths. The more interconnected the biking network becomes, the more regular people like me will want to use it, as proven by the rising number of people biking since their implementation (from 665,000 in 2015 up to 5.7 million trips in 2023 - statistics from Bike Share Toronto).\nFeeling safe whilst cycling is one of the key elements that will convince people to bike or not. This bill is not only going to bring out city backwards - it will force bikers (including food delivery workers) to travel in dangerous conditions and in an environment that is unwelcoming to anything but motorized vehicles. Please reconsider any decision in regards to the dismantlement of these bike lanes and the implementation of new bike lanes in our cities, which we desperately need to reduce our car dependency.\n"

        "comment": "I have travelled through most of the major European cities and without exception they maintain arterial roads of at least 4 lanes right to the city center. Bike riders are exceptionally courteous and almost always follow the rules of the road. Most citizens are also keenly aware of the damage nitrogen emissions, not carbon emissions, caused by gridlock and approve of measures taken to improve traffic flow. What I see in Ontario is at odds with this and more closely resembles myopic and self serving activism.\n"

        "comment": "I am  deeply troubled about BILL 212 which if enacted would be a huge step backward in the transition to Green transportation at this critical time when climate change, and global warming are an ever increasing threat to our very survival on planet Earth. Livable cities demand that we reduce our dependence on fossil fuel powered cars, and encourage alternative means of transportation, bicycles being a major part of the solution to gridlock and pollution from too many cars. I am a Toronto resident, homeowner, taxpayer and avid cyclist, who has been encouraged by the number of bike lanes installed in recent years. It has made a tremendous difference to biking safety, and rider confidence, and the number of cyclists has increased dramatically as a result. This change will certainly continue as more people get fedup with gridlock, and  the hassle and expense of owning and driving a car in the city.\nIn conclusion, I STRONGLY OPPOSE BILL 212, and the meddling of the provincial\ngovernment in municipal affairs. I support the maintenance of existing bike lanes, and the installation of more bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock, and pollution, getting to your destination faster,  and getting excercise as well. It\u2019s a win, win, win, solution.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nRemoving bike lanes seams like a silly decision based on no actual evidence or studies. People rely on bike lanes to commute and explore the city. The reason they look so empty is because they are so efficient. All modern cities should be pushing for better cycling infrastructure so future generations will have a save and affordable way to travel to work or friends etc. other cities around the world have embraced cycling with positive results. We should do the same. Let's not get stuck in the past because of a small and very vocal group of negative citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to express my strong support for maintaining Ontario's existing bike infrastructure and to advocate for its further development. Removing bike lanes that are already in place would be a significant setback for urban mobility, safety, and transportation efficiency.\nEfficient, Low-Bureaucracy Solution: Bike lanes provide a straightforward, effective transportation solution without the need for excessive red tape or bureaucracy. Let citys be automous as they know and see exactly what their constituents need and would like to see.\nEssential Infrastructure: Just like sidewalks, bike lanes serve as essential infrastructure, offering a safe and convenient option for people who rely on them daily.\nSafety for Cyclists and Drivers: On my 19.2 km commute, bike lanes make the journey much safer. When I drive, seeing cyclists in protected lanes gives me peace of mind, knowing we\u2019re all safeguarded against potential accidents.\nBetter City and Regional Connectivity: Bike lanes simplify both local and regional travel. I appreciate being able to bike to a transit station, avoiding the stress and time cost of highways, then relaxing on public transit.\nEfficient Use of Tax Dollars: Dismantling current bike lanes is not only costly but also a poor use of taxpayer dollars. The time, money, and effort to build these lanes would be wasted if they are removed.\nFreedom of Choice in Transportation: Cities should offer residents a choice in how they commute. People deserve the option to choose safe, environmentally friendly, and efficient transportation alternatives to car-centric travel.\nTime and Cost Savings: I find driving to be inefficient and expensive, whereas biking is cost-effective and allows me to enjoy the cityscape. The commute becomes part of my day rather than a task I dread.\nPreserving and expanding bike infrastructure is a forward-thinking decision that aligns with the needs of urban and suburban commuters alike. I urge you to consider these points and protect Ontario\u2019s bike infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I believe what the province is doing is actually correct. I also believe that kids under 16 should be  riding there bicycles on the side walk for safety reasons anyone over that age should have a safety coarse certificate to ride in the streets and designated bike lanes the reason I mention this is because as a driver of vehicles I\u2019m constantly avoiding cyclists that are all over the road and impeding traffic with no regards to the other people on the road. Common curtesy goes a long way and unfortunately the cyclists don\u2019t have any  I\u2019ve witnessed them rolling through stop signs with no disregard for other drivers but as a driver I\u2019m at fault which is totally unfair because of their actions we should all abide by the rules of the road that is why they should get permits and the police should stop and ticket them more often especially when you are over 18-21 years of age. They should know better I\u2019ve seen to many near accidents and I cringe every time I see a cyclist because they believe the own the road. As for myself 49 years old male I will stick to sidewalks and trails because as safe as I may be drivers of cars or trucks don\u2019t always see you and it\u2019s not there fault they are looking for other drivers making mistakes it\u2019s only human nature we are always in a rush now to get no where\n"

        "comment": "I find this proposal extremely baffling. Not only will it fail to accomplish its stated goals, but it will be a waste of tax payer dollars likely serving to exacerbate current congestion levels. We should be expanding the options for commuting around the city, not prioritizing infrastructure for what amount to 2+ tonne, 100+ horse-powered, personal mobility devices much of the time. There are many reasons why this is a terrible bill, including some of the following:\n-There is overwhelming evidence that increasing capacity for cars does not reduce congestion.\n-Bike lanes increase safety for those to who opt to commute by bike.\n-As an active form of transportation, bikes have many health benefits for the rider.\n-Bikes are better for the environment than both personal motor vehicles and transit.\n-Bikes offer a less expensive option for many who cannot afford other forms of transportation.\nWe need to encourage more people to drive less and this bill will have the opposite effect. It's frustrating knowing my comments will likely fall on deaf ears; I recognize when a policy decision is politically motivated and not evidence based. But please let Toronto decide for itself.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario resident, I am deeply concerned about the potential consequences of reducing bike infrastructure under Bill 212. Bike lanes are a proven, effective solution for reducing urban traffic congestion, improving air quality, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Cities that prioritize safe and accessible bike infrastructure consistently report fewer cars on the road, less strain on public transit, and reduced commute times for everyone, including drivers.\nRemoving or restricting bike lanes would undermine these benefits and force more Ontarians back into cars, ultimately worsening congestion and pollution. For those who rely on biking as an affordable, sustainable, and time-efficient way to get around, removing these lanes makes daily commutes longer, more dangerous, and more expensive. It also discourages others from choosing active, green transportation options, pushing our communities further away from environmental goals and healthier, safer streets.\nOntario's cities are growing rapidly, and we need transportation solutions that help people move around safely and sustainably. I urge the government to recognize the value of bike infrastructure as part of a holistic, data-driven approach to reducing gridlock. We should be working to expand, not limit, transportation options that benefit everyone in our communities.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI visited Toronto and Niagara Falls in August for the first time, hailing from BC. I must say, the shear number of cars in both communities felt overwhelming and made each place much less nice to visit and spend time in. The car centricity of downtown Toronto felt apparent compared to Montreal and Vancouver (though Vancouver still has a lot of work to do itself), along with Quebec City and my own hometown Victoria.\nMy experience was also that Toronto has some of the most aggressive drivers in the country. Removing the city's ability to make roads safer and more pleasant for people outside of cars will result in deaths and overall reduce the general health of the population.\nMontreal and Victoria both show how successful urban cycling infrastructure can be at successfully shifting people out of cars. It's a shame the Ontario government is planning on knee capping Toronto and other municipality's abilities to do the same. There's a reason most cities across Canada including ones like Edmonton and Halifax are making significant investments in bike infrastructure. Even car centric US cities like Miami are doing it. It just makes sense. Please don't prevent Ontario communities from doing the same.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disapprove of this bill. Research both locally and globally consistently shows benefits from protected biking infrastructure among central routes for both drivers and bicyclists in many ways, including safety for all road users, no increase to or even reduced congestion for drivers, benefits for local businesses, and allowing accessibility and options for everyone to choose their preferred mode of transportation - or even use the only option(s) that might be possible for them. The provincial government would be adding \"red tape\" and bureaucracy to local government efforts to increase transportation options. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure for myself and others - including those who are unable to drive for physical, financial, or other reasons; driving is not an option for everyone and non-drivers should not be deprioritized. Research consistently shows that protected bike lane infrastructure improves safety for both bicyclists and drivers, by limiting their chances of interaction; this also benefits drivers by keeping bicyclists from sharing car lanes - removing bike lanes will not reduce bicycle trips, it will force them to share lanes. Focusing only on benefits for drivers, which are unfounded, would be a choice that objectively sees non-car drivers as less important - including devaluing their safety - an absolutely appalling choice even if it were to improve travel time for drivers, which is incorrect. Improved biking infrastructure also supports other transit projects by helping to connect more people to subway stations, for one example. The proposal to move bicycle infrastructure away from main streets is similarly a poor decision that lacks insight and goes against established research findings. Side streets in Toronto and other areas of the province are poorly connected and/or would significantly increase the travel time for cyclists which would negatively impact the amount of cyclists and their trips they can, or are willing, to take - due to time, physical capabilities, among other factors. Additionally, cycling infrastructure on side streets distances cyclists from where the majority of destinations are (e.g.: shops and restaurants) by requiring additional distance/time, sometimes substantially so, for cyclists to travel on foot or bicycle to the main street, further reducing their use - a negative impact for both cyclists and local businesses. Many residents on side streets would arguably also object to cycling infrastructure in front of their residences rather than on main streets. Research consistently shows that reduced street parking in front of businesses does not lead to less patronage, and often increases it as they become more accessible to local residents who don't or don't want to drive (which also benefits car traffic by removing drivers who would otherwise have to drive to the businesses without good cycling/walking/public transit means). Induced demand is a well established concept which shows that more space for drivers does not improve congestion and may even worsen it - the more space for driving, the more people that will drive from outside the area that would have previously taken alternate routes or not gone at all - remembering that the majority of drivers will not be supporting local businesses to the extent that local residents using other modes of transportation would - they often drive straight through the area rather than stopping. Overall, this proposed bill is without question disparaging to non-drivers, is strikingly in contrast to research findings, and importantly it will not at all lead to the purported results. See the links attached for only a small sample of research findings and articles which speak to the comments I've made here.\n"
