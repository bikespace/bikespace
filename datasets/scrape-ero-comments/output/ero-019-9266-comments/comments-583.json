        "comment": "I have kids who ride bikes and I fear for their safety all the time. How is removing protected bike lanes going to help them? When I drive, I feel it's much safer for everyone when cyclists have their own lane. I can't believe you would advocate removing bike lanes and having cyclists riding dangerously close and inter-mixed with cars. There has been much more aggressive and dangerous driving over the past few years. Routinely there are driver's uttering death threats. Two of my kids have been hit by cars while riding around Mississauga? One of the locations was at a school zone (Brookemede) to boot. Both cases were a hit and run, one reported to police with no action taken. We really need more safety. In just one month\u2019s time, we have seen cyclists killed in Belleville, Toronto, Guelph, Elora area, and Niagara. This is to say nothing of the many pedestrians and motorists killed and injured across the province each week.\nRe-locating major cycling infrastructure to side streets generally does not work. When I bike to work in Mississauga from the west to the east, it would be mind boggling to take 30-40 winding side streets to get there. I need a major straight road like Burnhamthorpe to get there. Biking into Toronto I really only have one option: Bloor Street. By car I have over 20 options. Removing bike lanes would not only make my commute longer, but chaotic and totally unsafe. I would challenge those who proposed this law to try commuting to work by bike and see why the bike lanes are there. This is not ideological dogma. I bike year-round so winter lanes are necessary too.\nYou can fit 18 cars in a lane in a city block, but you can fit 200 bikes in that same space. Bike lanes are not empty, but they are much more space efficient so they obviously don't seem as congested. Common sense would say bikes are very well suited to city streets. In fact, the consensus is that bike lanes are a critical tool for reducing congestion and increasing mobility. So, no, they don\u2019t cause congestion - cars cause congestion. Bikes have been around since the early 1800's and in cities where bikes are dominant, there is no congestion. Bikes are a great means to get around and are not going away. So using common sense, I would argue ALL city streets are appropriate for bikes. What's not? Really only the 400-series highways.\nYou should be very cautious toward people complaining about underutilized bike routes. Many of the routes are new so cyclists are unaware of them. It takes time for people to change their ways and realize that cycling is an option. Many of the routes are incomplete and not safe since they tend to suddenly end. A less than confident cyclist is not going to use that kind of route until it is completed. How many cars drive on roads that suddenly end?\nI would expect a protected bike lane would also protect the sidewalk along Yonge St. Do you not recall Alek Minassian who drove over and killed 10 pedestrians and injured 15 more in Apr 2018? We don't need more of that please.\nThe city has master plans for roads, bike lanes, sidewalks, and vision zero which has been a huge effort, many years in the making. It takes input from city officials as well as residents. Why would you be undermining all this planning and put in a law that takes in no consideration for the needs of the city? Why are you adding an extra layer of \"oversight\"? In Premier Ford's platform he promised to reduce red tape, not add more.\nI bike for exercise and as a means to help reduce stress, anxiety, and tension. I am a productive part of society and work as an Engineer, but that job requires many hours sitting at a computer. Cycling to work is a great way to keep me functioning at my best.\nMy message is this - back off and let the mayors do their job! Again, this not ideological dogma as quite frankly, this bill could leave me and my family dead.\n"

A recent study on injury prevention in New York City found that \"...bicycle lanes come with an exceptionally good value because they simultaneously address multiple public health problems. Investments in bike lanes are more cost-effective than the majority of preventive approaches used today.\"\nhttps://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/4/239\nThe benefits of bike lanes to any city, including Toronto, are well known and well documented. Removing bike lanes is damaging and expensive. The $48 Million it will cost to remove bike lanes should be spent on the Province's shameful and inadequate health care system, its understaffed schools, or it's inadequate public transit system.

It removes the infrastructure that makes cycling an agent of traffic reduction in the downtown core, and instead of expanding this to the rest of the city to help reduce the car congestion there, it proposes a waste of taxpayer funding on a regression of the interests of the city and the province.\nThe bill was conceived as a Toronto centric idea yet will jeopardize the other cities of Ontario by adding absurd amounts of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy and drive up urban improvement costs everywhere.\nThe people of Ontario don't want a more expensive life than we already have, and we want our taxes used wisely and effectively. This is a waste and an obstacle to the improvements and projects we actually want built.\nThis bill will increase gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Please keep our bike lanes on major streets and expand them!\nWhy would we make bicycles use side streets when we all know that everyone chooses the fastest and most convenient way to get from point A to point B? Just the same way cars want to take Bloor St W, so too do bicycles. If I can't ride my bike safely on major roads, I'll just drive. Because using side streets takes longer and involves more hills. For.example, getting across the Humber on Bloor St W: Not using Bloor in my area would make biking totally unviable because I'd have to tackle huge hills around Old Mill and my route would go from being almost as fast as driving to far slower.\nI rely on Bloor St W bike lanes to stay safe on my commute and keep my son safe as we travel around the neighborhood. Bike lanes save lives, promote active, environmentally friendly transportation, and give many people a viable option to get around without their car.\nI would be clogging Bloor St W in my SUV about 80% more often if we didn't have the Bloor St bike lanes.\nWhat city on earth is moving backwards to promote car centric transportation? This does not align with the City's plan nor with the Sustainable Development Goals. The province is seriously overstepping.\nPlease save our bike lanes!\n"

I strongly disagree with the removal of bike lanes unless the dedicated bike lanes are replaced with an alternative prior to removal (I.e. an underground cycling network or dedicated bike lanes on a nearby parallel street). With the bixibike network and cycle couriers, bicycle is currently one of the fastest ways to get around the city and, unless we are trying to discourage active transport, cyclists sharing a lane with cars seems to slow traffic further and makes me far less confident when driving in the city.\n"

Just to undo what\u2019s already been done, and contribute to WORSENING traffic flow, as per countless studies\u2019 justification of bike infrastructure. More car infrastructure is proven, time and time again, to bring more cars on the road, only furthering the traffic problem and wasting even more tax payer money. Bike infrastructure takes people off the road and makes transportation better for both bikers and drivers! It makes so much sense and is also cheaper than overhauling roads and creating more car based infrastructure. It is a joke that the provincial government wants to go against facts and figures to worsen a problem for people who didn\u2019t even vote them into power. The city has a government for a reason. If people who don\u2019t live in Toronto want the government that doesn\u2019t preside over Toronto to make decision for Toronto, they can keep these opinions to themselves.\n"

More fundamentally, I am concerned about provincial reach into municipal affairs and the continued specific hyper focus on Toronto.\nI commute into downtown by bicycle multiple times and have increased my use of this mode of travel specifically in line with the safety of the infrastructure. My health is better for it. Even with the new infrastructure a car almost hits me almost every journey - and I am extremely well lit and visible.\nI will not stop riding without the lanes, but I do become exponentially more likely to need the province to pay for expensive and long term emergency health care and disability costs.\nI fear for my safety and those of the families, small children, seniors, and delivery workers all using the lanes. Over the past year - year round - we are frequently 20+ ppl waiting at a light - and yet taking the space of about three cars.\nIs it safe to assume that by removing lanes, against all data to the contrary, you will also be banning parking, directing all police services to prioritize traffic enforcement, paying for municipalities to increase bylaw enforcement and ticketing of those who stop illegally and slow traffic.\nHow will you respond when a driver uses their vehicle as a bowling ball and decides that people on bicycles are inconveniences and purposefully drives into them. This will happen.\nYou know this will save no one any time - it will slow everything down - and that ridership is significantly above 1% in the neighbourhoods served by the lanes. Even if not, shall we create a list of things only 1% of the city uses and also stop them?\nIf you proceed, I will be taking my lane, ignoring all horns, and using the road space I pay for with taxes, and hoping I make it to work and back home alive.\n"

Their message was clear: \"Bike lanes could have saved our daughter.\"\nThe Amaros recounted how Alex was struck by three cars while riding home on Dufferin Street in December 2020, after a quick trip to the mall. Their courage in reliving this tragedy is inspiring, and their story highlights the human cost of inadequate cycling infrastructure.\nPremier Ford, they said they appealed to you directly to stop Bill 212\u2014have you responded?\nAs grieving parents, George and Karen Amaro cannot understand how your government can consider legislation that would remove or block new bike lanes on streets like Bloor, University, and Yonge. George Amaro said, \"It\u2019s about safety. Politics should not be involved when it comes to somebody\u2019s life.\"\nPremier Ford, six people riding bikes have been killed on Toronto\u2019s streets in 2024 alone\u2014more than in the previous three years combined. Every death is a family\u2019s unbearable loss, and each new tragedy reopens old wounds for those who have already suffered. As Karen Amaro expressed: \"For the rest of our life, having to deal with the grief that we know personally, that all of these families and their friends are going through. And we don\u2019t wish that on anyone. It is horrific.\"\nPremier Ford, please reconsider Bill 212. Our roads should be safe for everyone, not just people driving. Please work with municipalities to implement data-driven solutions that can address both traffic safety and congestion. As George Amaro poignantly stated: \"We don\u2019t want just motorists to get home to their families faster, we want everybody to get home to their families... we never had that with our daughter. She never got home to us.\"\nI urge you to tell George and Karen: \"I\u2019m stopping Bill 212.\"\nSincerely,\n"

Extending the bikelane to my area would allow me to commute safely, or bike to shops and grocers more frequently and I would not have to add to congestion on the road or the overburdened Yonge subway. It is a bonus for both new and local businesses.\nThis is the opposite of what this bill proposes.

And people U-turning. And garbage trucks that pick up garbage along Bloor. That's way worse. All those bikes on the roadway will not help and people that also have cars will change to driving.

        "comment": "I am very much opposed. For one thing, taking out all these bike lanes will mean shutting down large sections of the major roads in question, for months and months, AGAIN. How is that supposed to help with congestion, exactly? Additionally, the city has found that removing the lanes would cost almost twice as much as it did to install them.\n It's obvious that the province is making this unilateral decision in an attempt to appeal to voters who think their right to drive everywhere in their own cars is more important than, say, health care. They are doing this at the expense of the quality of life and personal safety of so many people, based on essentially no evidence. No data has been produced to prove that separated bike lanes are causing congestion. I've read, though, that as biking in the city has become safer, more and more people have been choosing to bike. Surely that means at least some cars are on the road less often. Can I just add that the province's own website encourages us to \"Choose cleaner travel choices, such as public transit or bicycle\". The Ford government is apparently saying 1.2% of people commute by bike in the Toronto area, based on numbers from 2011. However, there's also a study from the City of Toronto from 2019, which says 70% of Toronto residents reported cycling in general; 26% cycled recreationally, and 44% were \"utilitarian cyclists\". Whatever the actual numbers are currently, I believe it's safe to say this decision would impact more than 1.2 % of residents.\nAs for Highway 413, its exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act will lead to irreversible environmental harm. Environmental Defence has shown that this highway will destroy over 400 acres of critical natural habitat. It's been proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. Transportation is already the largest source of emissions in Ontario. At this time, it should be a priority for any government to reduce emissions. Instead, our provincial government chooses to destroy wetlands crucial to flood prevention and carbon storage, as well as our farmlands.\n"

Bill 212 would also remove the existing bicycle lanes on portions of Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto.\nGiven the limited time for submission of comments on this proposed bill, the KNTC would like to provide some concerns raised by our members. We would note that more time would allow for a more detailed examination of the impact of Bill 212 on cycling infrastructure in our community.\nSome of the points raised by our committee are as follows:\nNumerous studies ([2], [3]) have shown that adding lanes for motor vehicles does not actually improve traffic congestion, due to induced demand.\nBicycle lanes have been shown to improve safety for all road users, while increasing the number of cyclists using the road ([4], [5]).\nBicycle lanes provide economic benefits; they have been shown to increase the number of customers, as well as the amount spent, at businesses nearby ([6], [7]).\nBicycle lanes can help reduce congestion, by taking single-occupant vehicles off the road.\nThe eastern section of Campeau Drive is an example of a major arterial road in Kanata North that is slated for upgrading to accommodate increased use by vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. There is plenty of room in existing road allowance to build safe cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. The province would be a welcome partner in the planning and funding of this project.\nBy allowing the provincial government to overrule elected Councillors and Mayors, the bill denies citizens the right to representation in decisions involving their own local road networks.\nIn cases where the Province has concerns about the impact on traffic flow resulting from a proposed cycling infrastructure on a major road, the Province should be prepared to work with the City to develop a solution that supports vehicular and cycling traffic. This should include a funding contribution from the Province.\nKNTC urges the Ontario government to reconsider this legislation, and to look for ways to collaborate with municipalities to find solutions in high volume traffic corridors.\nYour consideration in this matter is much appreciated.\nSincerely\nJacques Rochon\nChair,\nKanata North Transportation Committee\n"

        "comment": "The proposal compromises a crucial piece of safety infrastructure that benefits all road users. Studies consistently show that bike lanes enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers by organizing traffic flow, reducing collisions, and increasing predictability on the road. By clearly separating lanes, the risk of accidents caused by sudden maneuvers from drivers or cyclists is minimized. Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists may be forced onto sidewalks, endangering pedestrian safety, particularly for individuals with disabilities, or onto busy roads, where they face increased risk and further congestion. Vision Zero data underscores the significance of bike lanes, as injuries and fatalities are most common on busy arterials lacking adequate active transportation infrastructure. Protecting and expanding bike lanes is key to building a safer, more sustainable transportation system in Toronto.\nFurthermore, bike lanes help calm traffic by narrowing roads, which encourages slower, safer driving speeds. Alternatives like unprotected shared bike lanes, or \"sharrows,\" fall short and are unsafe on busy streets, making the preservation of protected bike lanes critical for a safer, more efficient transportation network.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes disregards the important concept of induced demand, which significantly influences congestion. While reallocating vehicle lanes to bike lanes may initially increase traffic, evidence from cities like New York City and San Francisco shows that well-developed cycling networks lead to higher cycling rates and even a reduction in car traffic over time. For example, in New York City, a major midtown street experienced a 35 percent reduction in average vehicle travel times a few years after bike lanes were introduced.\nToronto is similarly positioned, with conditions becoming more favorable for using bike infrastructure to reduce car dependency and ease congestion. A connected cycling network is vital for this transition, and removing bike lanes on key East-West and North-South corridors weakens the city's ability to realize these benefits. The growing demand for cycling in Toronto is clear from Bike Share Toronto\u2019s data: annual trips surged from 665,000 in 2015 to 5.7 million in 2023, with over 6 million expected in 2024. Preserving and expanding bike lanes is essential to accommodate this demand and lessen car reliance.\n"
