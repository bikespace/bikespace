We keep on talking about improving public transportation and all these routes are fully supported by the TTC, so why do people have to drive on the main routes in a car all by themselves spewing out smoke and fumes, yet we close down our roads! Take a look at what is happening in places like Amsterdam where it truly is all about the bikes. Why not have days like in Greece where odd license plates come in three days one week and two the next \u2026\u2026.public transit is the answer just clean it up and get these up and running. What is happening with the Eglinton LRT and why have not people been FIRED?\n"

These lanes allow people with different abilities and incomes to transit throughout the city effectively and safely. Looking at any large city in the US, and Europe bike lanes are an integral part of their transportation plan. Tourists are also encouraged to explore the city, stop at small businesses, and buy.\nRemoving bike lanes is taking a step backward and will create a bigger problem down the line. We should expand our bike lanes to build a more connected city that gives residents and visitors multiple ways of moving around.\n"

        "comment": "I have been an avid cyclist in Toronto for over 30 years, commuting downtown by bike before the Bloor/Yonge/University bike lanes existed. Having been hit/nearly hit by cars multiple times, I can confidently say that bike lanes save lives. Further, having commuted by car downtown in the late 1980's and early 1990's I can attest that car traffic was horrendous even back then. Thus, if the Ford government removes bike lanes now - they clearly value cars over lives. Based on personal experience \"side streets\" without bike friendly architecture are not much safer than main streets. Therefore if the Ford government removes bike lanes before putting in place alternate routes - they again clearly value cars over lives. My last comment is that I would love Premier Ford to tell me what \"side streets\" cross the Don Valley (Bloor), the Humber Valley ( Bloor), and the rail corridor at Yonge & Summerhill without having to travel kilometers out of the way and/or over difficult terrain,  to access businesses and destinations on the main streets.\n"

With no data to prove these bike lanes cause delays, this is an irresponsible decision. The removal of bike lanes at a cost of 48 million dollars will not improve the health and safety of city dwellers.  One death of a cyclist is one too many.  We need a Government that is forward thinking and will work for all citizens, not just a loud minority.  Adding more cars to an already congested, polluted city makes no common sense.  A livable city should be for everyone.\n"

We need to get people out of cars and onto alternative forms of transport such as public transit and bikes and walking. People can not do these things if the infrastructure does not exist. The question should not be what percentage of people bike or drive to work\u2014 the question the Minister of Transport should be asking is\u2014 how do we decrease the number of people who need to take their car to work? Well thought out and well protected bike lanes are one important answer to that question. Please focus your energy on that and on building public transit. Get cars off the roads!\n"

With the bicycle lanes torn out, I'll be  back to being able to risk main roads only when the cars and trucks are at a crawl or a standstill.  That's still more dangerous that it should be for pedestrians and bicyclists, but it's not actually life-threatening.\nGiven that, I should probably encourage more congestion, as it would be safer for me.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against Bill 212, as I think multi-modal transportation will benefit more people, is sustainable in the longterm, and will be more affordable in the long run. This bill pushes for highway development, which will mean worse traffic, slower commutes, and more pollution. A lot of people rely on bikes in the downtown area, helping to alleviate traffic and reduces carbon emissions. I rely on public transit and find that it is underfunded. By allocating more resources to public transit we can improve the efficiency of transit and reduce our carbon emissions. Engineers, city planners, and other professionals agree that public transit is the most efficient way to transport people, is more environmentally friendly, and is safer (refer to the link to the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers statement against Bill 212). Climate change is costing everyone a lot of money (as we've seen during the summer in Toronto with the costs of damage caused by flooding), so we should be prioritizing sustainable, long-term infrastructure that will benefit everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bicycle lanes does not improve traffic. If you want to decrease traffic, you need to give commuters options that aren't cars. Increase TTC efficiency, add more bicycle lanes. Get people out of cars and using other forms of transportation. There have been several studies done on this topic that all show that bicycle lanes do not contribute to traffic congestion and increasing the number of bicycle lanes does help improve traffic congestion. Oil isn't forever, we will run out. We will also eventually run out of the rare earth metals needed to make rechargeable batteries.  We need better, more sustainable forms of transportation.  Bicycles are a form of that.\nInstead of taking away bike lanes, add more and Improve and increase TTC service. It shouldn't take someone unable to drive more than 45 minutes to get somewhere in this city.\n"

        "comment": "This is a very disturbing policy. How many people will die because cycling in the city becomes dramatically less safe? As a driver, I feel better knowing cyclists are at a safe distance from my car.\nEveryone who lives and drives in downtown Toronto sees how it is actually construction that causes lane closures, and on-street parking that blocks drivers by blocking whole lanes. Why not abolish on street parking if this is really about \"moving\" traffic?\nThis is a spectacular waste of public money, especially as the next government will need to reinstall cycle lanes because this is a basic road safety issue, and a basic infrastructure issue. The Ontario government needs to come into the 21st century.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes in downtown Toronto is allowing the instant gratification of suburban wants to completely override the safety needs of thousands of cyclists that actually live in these downtown areas and use bikes to commute.\nRemoving bike lanes, which would be a needless waste of taxpayer money, would not remove cyclists. Instead it would force cyclists to be in the same lanes on these roads as drivers, causing road safety issues on both sides. Additionally, adding another lane for cars isn\u2019t going to miraculously fix traffic problems. Any time a lane is added to a corridor whether a road or highway, the traffic problem is not solved or improved. If you care about fixing traffic, make proper provincial investments in the expansion of multimodal transportation options, including more subways, BRT lanes, and bike lanes, in order to get cars off the road so that the people who need to drive cars can drive cars with minimal traffic.\nAdding more lanes, adding more highways, or building billion dollar underground highway tunnels, are not ever going to fix the problem of traffic in Toronto. Multimodal and public transportation options providing consistent connectivity across the city will.\n"

        "comment": "The Provincial government should not be adding more regulations and red tape to Cities across Ontario. The added process of Provincial oversight for new and existing bike lanes WASTES TAXPAYERS DOLLARS. My family uses bike lanes daily to commute to work, get to local stores and enjoy different parts of Toronto without the need for a personal vehicle. At the end of the day, bike lanes provide safety to more road users than just cars. As a Driver, I much prefer cyclists to have their own designated lane because it significantly reduces the mixing of the two modes of transportation and I feel better knowing that I won't accidentally cut off or hit someone. If bike lanes are taken out, people will feel unsafe and will need to rely on driving personal vehicles and Ubers to get around the City, therefore, making traffic WORSE.\n"

As the changing of the lanes back and forth is a large waste of taxpayer dollars, I request that the bike lanes stay as they are and this legislation be applied only to FUTURE infrastructure projects -- both for personal reasons and because I value responsible fiscal behaviour in the government of Ontario.

I remember what the city was like before the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor, and it was extremely dangerous. Pre-bike lanes, i was doored several times on Bloor, and seriously injured one of those times, and I can't imagine a world where we willingly go back to that system, let alone pay $48m to do so. I also own a car, and imagine I will drive more often once my commute becomes so much more dangerous, and assume a lot of other cyclists will drive more as well if that is an option for them. According to all of the writing I've seen on the topic, this will make traffic congestion worse, not better. As most major cities across the globe are expanding their bike infrastructure, it's embarrassing that we are considering reducing ours. Please do not do this, it will cost our province a lot of money, and cost our city lives, all for this weird attempt at stirring up 'culture war' conflict so Doug Ford can have people focus on this instead of his failure to create the affordable housing he promised us when he entered office. This is transparent and gross, and I assumed it would be beneath the PC party to attempt this, but here we are. Do not rip out bike lanes in Toronto, it would represent a major step backwards and is not what the people of Toronto want.\n"

My wife rides to work along Bloor and down University. I am retired and ride daily for recreation and doing errands. Our guests and visiting family cycle in the city when they come to our home. We have many bikes available for them. Bike lanes save lives and the demolition of safe cycling in Toronto will undoubtedly lead to more deaths and injury in Toronto. The solution is not a reduction of bike lanes, but the addition of safe cycling infrastructure which will benefit everyone. This is not a zero sum game. Bill 212 is madness. Removing the bike lanes will not decrease traffic congestion. We also do not support Ford's half baked ideas regarding the 413 and the super tunnel under the 401.

However, I feel that the vast amount of drivers currently on the road and the ensuing traffic is in large part due to the failure of the city to provide reasonable alternative options. If we had ttc systems that were rapid, accessible and reliable we would have less drivers. If we had safer biking options, including the expansion of bike lanes not the reduction of them, we would have less drivers. If we prioritized walkable neighbourhoods with many smaller grocers, pharmacies, ect\u2026 we would have less drivers.\nI think that reducing bike lanes is a step backwards for the citizens of the city as well as the environment.\n"

I think it isn't evidence based, and is born out of spite, cruelty, or at least to garner some short-sighted political points while core services like transit, healthcare and education fester.\nThis is over-reach. This is ignorant. I fear for our shared future.\nAccelerating the highway 413 project is taking Ontario in the wrong direction. You can't 'one more lane bro, pls' your way out of traffic congestion. Adding another highway is just going to add more vehicles to the system. China is the king of highways, and they made one so long and wide, that when it jammed, it tied up people for 12 days. I'm just saying that more lanes don't mean less traffic. Finding more space efficient modes is the key. Transit, Transit, Transit. This was true 70 years ago, and it's true today. All major cities design for this, and places like Toronto need to be able to do the same. I live in Peterborough, and there in't even and Express Go bus to Oshawa station....and the Province is talking about another highway. shake my head.\nThen, the idea that bike lanes cause congestion. There isn't a place on earth where this has been proven - even it Toronto.\nWhen the GTA is stuck in one big perpetual traffic jam, unable to take transit because it doesn't exist, with no bike lanes to remove...what will happen then. What to remove then? Driving bans based on license plates? Look a the end game. Look to Paris, London, Chicago, Bogota (Barrios Vitales) etc.\nPlease, for our future, don't do this.\n"
