This includes pedestrians who benefit from a buffer from cars.\nAll this achieves is violent hostility towards cyclists.\nThe cyclists who do brave the traffic will slow existing traffic. The ones that convert to driving will slow existing traffic. This bill does not improve traffic.\nBloor Street has similar cycling ridership during rush hour as cars. This bill does not aim to improve conditions for any share of the actual users of the roads. This bill is just a sadistic political stunt to drum up a culture war.\nPlease grow a conscience before family members are lost.\n"

If we invest in other methods of transportation like the TTC, making cities more pedestrian friendly, adding bike lanes, all such things would reduce the amount of people who rely on cars as their main form of transportation. The problem is there are too many cars on the road, get them off by investing in literally any other method of transportation.\n"

The main \u201cbenefit\u201d of eliminating bike lanes is to provide additional vehicle lanes. Yet that benefits such a small population of people. Why don\u2019t those driving these vehicles take transit if it\u2019s a long distance or bike or walk if it\u2019s a short distance? Why are only those traveling by private car prioritized? Shouldn\u2019t we promote methods of travel that are healthy and environmentally friendly? And as a bonus they can move a lot of people very efficiently.\nI do not support the province taking this stance that they should control a municipalities bike infrastructure.\n"

Cyclists will now have to take the full lane for safety for roads which arguably will slow motor traffic down. Mandating municipalities which already complete assessments to get further approval from the provincial government is adding red tape and processes that is further wasting tax payers money that could be used for better causes to make Ontario residents\u2019 lives arguably better.\n"

        "comment": "Even considering this is completely regressive, and flies against its own stated purpose. You can ease congestion by making it safer to use other modes of transportation that take up significantly less road space than single occupancy vehicles. If you continue to build a comprehensive cycling lane network, you\u2019ll have more and more people who feel comfortable and safe using them. I am not anti car, but when people who would like to cycle, or take public transportation choose to take a car because the other aren\u2019t viable, then we\u2019re not working towards building a more livable city.\nThe fact that the province is stepping in on what should exclusively be Toronto municipal policy and strategy is undemocratic. The province is playing identity politics, pandering to those with an irrational hatred for cyclists. The priority is moving people within the city most effectively and sustainably, not making it easiest for lazy suburbanites who are too lazy to use public transportation free passage in their giant SUVs.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto is a short-sighted approach that fails to address the city\u2019s real transportation challenges. As someone who commutes daily by bike, I can attest to the vital role these lanes play in ensuring safety. Without them, cyclists will be forced onto the roads, increasing the risk of accidents and fatalities\u2014tragically, there have already been several deaths this year. Bike lanes serve not only cyclists but also those using other forms of micro-transportation, such as scooters and e-bikes, offering an environmentally friendly and efficient way to navigate the city. Furthermore, removing these lanes would be a misuse of taxpayer funds and would not alleviate the core issue of traffic congestion. Instead, Toronto should explore more effective solutions, such as implementing a congestion charge similar to London\u2019s, which has proven to reduce traffic and improve overall mobility. It is imperative that provincial leadership focuses on real issues affecting the city and the broader province, rather than undermining essential urban infrastructure like bike lanes.\n"

Unfortunately with our current premier, decisions like this made for Toronto by the provincial government have created huge issues in the city. I can't imagine a situation where this would benefit anybody but certain commercial interests. It certainly has not benefited drivers in Toronto or elsewhere to have the province in charge of roads or transit work. Decisions are not being made in the best interest of citizens but rather to benefit certain other commercial interests, and in the course of this, citizens are actually being harmed. Let municipalities decide how to use their roads, NOT THE PROVINCE. We do not want this.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of pre-existing infrastructure is a waste of our resources and time. I am a commuter both by car and bicycle within the core of Toronto and can confidently say the bike lanes have been a positive addition to the city \u2014 the bike lanes encourage people to travel without dependence on a car or public transport, which further encourages local businesses and healthy lifestyles of the local population. The problem with traffic IS NOT THE FAULT OF BICYCLES. The problem of traffic within Toronto is poor driving etiquette and straight-up law-breaking behaviours that are not met with their respective consequences. Address these problems first before removing newly installed infrastructure and wasting our money on back-and-forth action that ultimately gets us no-where.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is preposterous, we can't have the province deciding on bike lanes in the city. I'm both an avid driver and a cyclist in Toronto, the bike lanes have been a Godsend to me getting around faster, more affordably, and it has had substantial improvements to my physical and mental health. I use it to travel to work multiple days a week in all seasons, as well as around the city. If anything, this takes me away from using my car and adding to the traffic and congestion.\nI am very much against this proposal, for the following reasons:\n- Local control is essential: City planning decisions, like bike lane placement, should be made by Toronto's local government, which understands the unique needs and challenges of its streets.\n- Undermines local democracy: Removing authority from Toronto City Council disempowers elected officials accountable to residents, reducing public input and transparency.\n- One-size-fits-all doesn't work: Provincial oversight risks blanket policies that may not suit Toronto's complex, congested roadways, resulting in inefficiencies and poor outcomes.\n- Stifles progress: Toronto has made significant strides in active transportation planning. Provincial interference could slow these efforts, leading to delays in crucial bike-friendly infrastructure.\n- Local priorities matter: Toronto\u2019s vision for its streets\u2014balancing cars, bikes, and pedestrians\u2014may clash with provincial goals that prioritize reducing gridlock at the expense of cyclist safety and environmental benefits.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lane infrastructure from the major downtown Toronto arteries of Bloor, Yonge and University is a step backwards that is totally nonsensical. The great cities of Europe where transportation is leaps and bounds ahead of ours, all utilize bike lanes and dedicated right-of-ways on their busiest streets for public transport to \"Reduce Gridlock\" and \"Save people time\". Only these modes of transport can effectively move hundreds of thousands of people throughout the city - prioritizing cars on downtown streets is extremely backwards-thinking. See the attached photo of the great Ring Road of Vienna (Ringstra\u00dfe), a street around as wide as University Ave with dedicated right-of-ways for trams, substantial and wide bike lanes, and cars. Why can our city not do as well as this, and instead move backwards to reinstate 1 car lane each direction? The increased capacity would be so minimal as cars can only move a fraction of the number of people down a road, per minute compared to bicycles and public transit.\nI suggest to truly \"reduce gridlock\" in the city of Toronto, the province ought to propose solutions such as drastically speeding up the existing streetcar network by giving them dedicated right-of-way something that has been common place in truly world-class cities like Vienna, Amsterdam, Zurich, Berlin etc. The fact that streetcars must wait in a line of cars on streets like College St or King St makes them move at snails pace, discouraging people from even using them. If getting around the city was easier, fewer people would drive anyways, as the flexibility of driving is something that cannot be achieved with extremely slow public transit.\nMany drivers also need to commute in from far distances if public transit is not serving them reliably and quickly - another reason to put money and scrutiny on Metrolinx and its inability to deliver a single new public transit expansion in the city that would at least contribute to serving the suburbs (Eglinton LRT, Finch LRT). Where is the progress on all-day 15 minute GO train service on the multiple promised rail lines? This would be the correct use of time and resources from the Ontario government's jurisdiction...\nThe Bill 212 being presented here is not addressing the fundamental root causes of the congestion in the City of Toronto, and is a waste of parliamentary time, resources and energy that could be better spent on more aggressive provincial policy on people-moving-efficiency. Cars simply are not efficient, and only provide users comfort, luxury and flexibility in travel. Better public transit that is frequent, fast, and has priority on the road is all it takes to move a step towards reducing gridlock, by moving people by the hundreds per vehicle instead of 1 or 2 per vehicle, a ~10000% improved efficiency.\n"
