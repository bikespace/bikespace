        "comment": "Introduction\nThe comments set out below stem not only from my views on such matters, but also from over 30 years professional experience working on the planning and design of transportation systems (of all types) for towns and cities. This experience gives me huge insight into the need to holistically consider all forms of transportation, and their interactions with land use, the built form of the city and economic development. It is imperative that transportation analysis and development considers the merits of ALL forms of transportation and how each is best placed to contribute in each circumstance. There should not be a sole focus on a single form of transportation to the detriment of all else. And to be clear, this is reflected in my personal life where I walk, cycle, drive or take transit depending on the trip being made. Better decisions are made when one has personal experience of all the possible options.\nSchedule 3 \u2013 Highway 413 Act \u2013 Exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\nI am opposed to Schedule 3 of the Bill. The Environmental Assessment Act is there to ensure a robust, transparent and credible analysis of all the environmental impacts of major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed Highway 413. Given the contentious nature of Highway 413, it is imperative to set out the environmental impacts fully, alongside the broader case for the project. To simply pick and choose what projects the Act applies to is wrong.\nOf course, this exemption is for a project that itself should not be built. Aside from the obvious adverse environmental impacts, in the long term it will do little to alleviate congestion. Empirical evidence over decades has shown that induced demand, that well known phenomenon whereby traffic in urban and suburban areas simply expands to fill the available space, will return congestion to the same level. Even the MTO\u2019s own modelling is showing this (see https://www.thetrillium.ca/news/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026). Experts at the Bill\u2019s public committee hearing on Monday September 18, 2024 were of this view. Overall, Highway 413 simply locks us further into the failed 1950s car dependent planning paradigm.\nSchedule 4 \u2013 Highway Traffic Act Part XII Municipal By-Laws and Bicycle Lanes\nI am opposed to Schedule 4 of the Bill.\nFirstly, it is egregious overreach and anti-democratic for the Provincial Government to interfere in matters best left to local municipalities. The local municipalities are best placed to consider the needs and interests of the local populace for local matters such as bicycle lanes. They will take a holistic view of all the competing demands for road space, alongside wider policy objectives around safety, improving transportation options (not just cars), equity, business impacts and environmental considerations (from micro to macro). Of note, bicycle lanes are often an integral part of complete streets that aim to recognize and accommodate the needs of all users of public space, not just those in cars. In short, bicycle lanes should be a matter for local municipalities ONLY.\nSecondly, the proposal to waste taxpayers money to REMOVE existing bicycle lanes in the City of Toronto (on Bloor, Yonge and University) is counter to all contemporary thinking around city building and placemaking. Not a single credible organization has supported this proposal, with the Ontario Traffic Council, the Ontario Professional Planning Institute, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Bloor Annex BIA, and 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto against this proposal. To date, the Province has provided no data or evidence to support it\u2019s assertion that these bicycle lanes are materially impacting motor vehicle congestion; only anecdotal and misleading evidence has been provided. To state that only 1.2 % of people commute by bicycle and 70% by car as justification is disingenuous and frankly fraudulent when these numbers relate to the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), an area that stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe and includes places like Richmond Hill, Oakville and Vaughan. When considering the case for bike lanes, a much more focused area or corridor analysis is the appropriate level for data analysis and these show much higher levels of bicycle usage on these corridors with the bike lanes. Even if the bike lanes are removed, most of these corridors will have some level of parking, such that there will still only be 2 lanes for traffic for most of the time, thus achieving no material benefit. And any material benefit will quickly be nullified by induced traffic, that will known phenomenon whereby traffic simply expands to fill the available space, thus returning congestion to the same level. In short, the proposal to remove these bicycle lanes is simply not supported by policy or evidence and they should be left in place.\n"

        "comment": "Having strong biking infrastructure means less traffic and less pollution. I would bike everywhere if I wasn\u2019t afraid of being hit by a car, because only some roads have proper bike lanes. Cars are already constantly parking in bike lanes, or they\u2019re blocked with construction, making it unsafe. Spending our tax dollars to remove existing bike lanes is a waste and a huge step backwards. Other countries like the Netherlands have incredible biking infrastructure, it\u2019s so easy to get around, roads feel much safer for both bikers and pedestrians, and it\u2019s so much better for the environment. Why is Ontario so behind and outdated? Here, the city is clearly built to prioritize drivers even over pedestrians, I\u2019m constantly afraid of getting hit crossing intersections because cars don\u2019t want to wait even though pedestrians have the right of way. The city should prioritize those of us who live here and need to get around within the city. The province clearly just wants control so they can continue to prioritize those who drive through the city from other parts of the province. The province is prioritizing their convenience over the safety of Torontonians, and over the sustainability of our infrastructure. This bill will only increase traffic (less people biking means more people driving, and the de-construction will take forever) and it will move this city backwards. Invest in bike lanes, invest in public transit, invest in the environment, not in oil companies. Thank you!\n"

        "comment": "The passing of Bill 212, specifically the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 (RGSYTA) and the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (BHFA), is not just a misguided step toward ineffective transportation solutions; it represents an alarming overreach of provincial power and a total lack of accountability to the people of Ontario. Any MPP who votes in favor of this bill would be misusing their position and disregarding the principles of democracy and responsible governance.\n1. Breach of Trust and Accountability\nThe provincial government\u2019s push for this bill reflects a complete disregard for transparency, accountability, and the public\u2019s trust. By granting the Minister of Transportation unchecked powers to override municipal bylaws, control property rights, and expedite projects without proper consultation or oversight, the government is effectively sidelining local communities and bypassing the voices of Ontarians. This is a blatant attempt to undermine democratic processes for the benefit of a few corporate interests, rather than the people who actually live and work in Ontario.\n2. Disrespect for Municipal Democracy\nMunicipalities have the right to make decisions that affect their own communities. The Building Highways Faster Act strips municipalities of their power to protect local interests, creating a top-down, authoritarian approach to decision-making that disrespects the principles of local governance. This kind of provincial interference undermines the very foundation of democratic processes at the municipal level. The fact that this bill would bypass local bylaws, community planning, and citizen input shows an utter contempt for the role of municipalities in the democratic fabric of our province.\n3. Misuse of Power and Potential Corruption\nThe powers granted to the Minister of Transportation under this bill are alarmingly broad and unchecked. The ability to expedite projects without due process, override local laws, and fast-track expropriation without judicial review opens the door to potential corruption and favoritism. Any MPP who supports this bill is complicit in a government that has shown no regard for the rule of law or public accountability. This bill does not just grant new powers; it creates an environment ripe for cronyism and backroom deals that undermine the interests of the taxpayers who fund these projects.\n4. A Betrayal of Ontario Taxpayers\nThis bill is an outright betrayal of Ontario\u2019s taxpayers. It sacrifices the public interest to line the pockets of private developers and corporate backers, all while sidestepping the needs of ordinary Ontarians. The claim that this will \"reduce gridlock\" is nothing more than a distraction\u2014more highways will only lead to more congestion, increased emissions, and the further erosion of our natural landscapes. The people of Ontario deserve better than to have their tax dollars spent on projects that benefit only a few while harming the many.\n5. A Violation of Property Rights\nThe proposal to remove property owners' ability to challenge expropriation under this bill is a direct attack on individual property rights. By removing the ability of citizens to seek justice through the courts, the government is setting a dangerous precedent that allows for the forced seizure of property without due process. This could set a chilling precedent for future government overreach, where the rights of ordinary people are trampled in favor of political or corporate agendas.\n6. Unacceptable Economic and Environmental Risks\nThis bill prioritizes highway expansion over the real needs of Ontarians\u2014sustainable infrastructure, public transit, and environmental protection. The government\u2019s claim that these highways will reduce gridlock is an outdated and discredited myth. Expanding roads leads to increased traffic, more pollution, and greater sprawl. The environmental costs of these highways\u2014destroying green spaces, increasing carbon emissions, and exacerbating climate change\u2014are unacceptable. These projects are a step backward, not forward, and they represent a catastrophic waste of public resources.\nConclusion\nThis bill must not pass. The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act is a gross overreach of provincial power that disrespects the democratic rights of local communities, undermines accountability, and allows for the abuse of public office. A vote in favor of this bill is not just a misuse of power; it is an act of betrayal against the people of Ontario. It is a potential violation of taxpayer rights, a rejection of municipal democracy, and an invitation for corruption and cronyism in the government. Any MPP who supports this bill should be held accountable for this breach of trust and an outright disservice to the people they were elected to represent.\nWe, the people of Ontario, demand a government that listens to our voices, respects our rights, and prioritizes our long-term wellbeing\u2014not one that pushes through harmful projects that benefit only a few at the expense of the many. This bill cannot pass\u2014for the sake of our communities, our environment, and our democracy.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes makes no sense in a city. If everyone drive their car, we would have infinite traffic. Providing viable alternatives like public transit and safe cycling infrastructure reduces car traffic, reduces air pollution, and increases health and safety.\nSeparated/protected bike lanes especially prevent death, injuries and accidents.\nKids and families should be able to safely bike to school, parks, and activities without fear of being doored by a parked car or being run over by increasingly large vehicles.\nThis government seems only to be able to sympathize with drivers, and forgets that cyclists, pedestrians, and public transit users live here too. Taking away bike lanes takes away their freedom of choice of transportation and their safety.\nBike lanes have proven time and time ageing to increase profits of local businesses, and it\u2019s obvious to anyone that the most traffic congested places are not those with bike lanes.\nInstead of wasting money ripping out existing cycling infrastructure, this government should focus on finishing Metrolinx transit projects, expanding and improving public transit, and perhaps safety education for drivers and cyclists.\nI\u2019m a driver, a cyclist, pedestrian, and a public transit rider. It\u2019s ridiculous to try and pit one form of transportation against another, as they all have their time and place.

If cyclists don't have safe lanes on major roads, they will use the sidewalks where they are a menace to pedestrians.\nOthers have provided the facts about traffic and cyclist volumes.  I would just like to note a couple of things about University Avenue.  Firstly, staff at the many hospitals requested bike lanes for their safety in getting to and from work, partly because they work shifts and may be out during the hours of darkness. Secopndly, there used to be on-street parking on the east side norht of Queen Street, so a lane was previously taken away from moving traffic there.\nUnder our constitution, cities are \"creatures of the provinces\".

        "comment": "While the intention behind Bill 212 may be to create more sustainable transportation options, the approach of removing critical traffic lanes to install bike lanes is misguided, and risks exacerbating the very issues it seeks to resolve. We must consider the broader human toll, mobility challenges, and the profound negative effects cars have on public health and the environment before enacting such a policy.\n1. Human Toll and the Health of Citizens\nCars are the leading cause of traffic-related fatalities and injuries, but it\u2019s important to recognize that their impact on human health extends beyond the immediate accidents. Air pollution caused by car emissions is a silent killer, contributing to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and even cancer. The World Health Organization has linked poor air quality to millions of premature deaths each year. By prioritizing bike lanes at the expense of car lanes, Bill 212 risks pushing more people into cars due to reduced road capacity, inadvertently worsening air pollution and public health outcomes.\nFurthermore, while cycling has benefits for physical health, the transition can be dangerous for many, especially in cities with insufficient infrastructure. Without a comprehensive safety strategy, replacing traffic lanes could expose cyclists to greater risk in a complex urban environment.\n2. Mobility Challenges and Inefficiencies\nThe fundamental purpose of a transportation system is to enable people to move efficiently from one place to another. By removing traffic lanes to make room for bike lanes, we are effectively reducing overall capacity, leading to more congestion. This doesn\u2019t just waste time; it also places additional stress on people\u2019s lives. In an already gridlocked system, adding more obstacles for drivers may seem counterproductive, particularly for individuals who rely on their vehicles for daily activities, including essential workers, families with children, and those with mobility impairments.\nCongestion doesn\u2019t just lead to longer travel times; it leads to increased stress, anxiety, and ultimately reduced quality of life. The human toll of these factors is significant: more time stuck in traffic means less time spent with family, at work, or participating in community life. The psychological and emotional strain that comes with spending hours in traffic can lead to long-term health consequences, such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues.\n3. Cars Are Detrimental to the Human Race\nIt\u2019s true that cars have transformed modern society, but their long-term effects are overwhelmingly negative. Cars are major contributors to climate change, emitting vast amounts of carbon dioxide that are altering our planet\u2019s ecosystem. In addition to their environmental toll, car dependence has reshaped cities in ways that diminish the overall human experience.\nConsider the urban sprawl facilitated by car infrastructure. Suburbs have expanded at the cost of community and human connection, leaving many people isolated and disconnected. In places designed around cars, walkability and social interaction are often an afterthought, contributing to feelings of loneliness and alienation. This is a direct result of prioritizing vehicles over human-centric urban design.\nMoreover, the automobile industry has deep ties to environmental degradation, from the extraction of raw materials to the pollution created by manufacturing and fuel consumption. If we are serious about the health and future of humanity, we must reduce our reliance on cars, not just rearrange traffic lanes.\n4. A Call for Balanced Transportation Solutions\nRather than removing car lanes and creating unnecessary conflict between cyclists and drivers, we should be advocating for a balanced transportation policy that incorporates more sustainable options without negatively impacting the majority of people who rely on cars. Public transit, improved cycling infrastructure that doesn\u2019t require lane removal, and better pedestrian pathways can all coexist in a well-planned urban landscape. These options will help reduce congestion, promote sustainability, and improve health outcomes without sacrificing the mobility of those who depend on cars.\nWe need to focus on systemic solutions, such as the expansion of public transit networks and the integration of green spaces for walking and cycling. Addressing the root causes of gridlock\u2014over-reliance on automobiles and the lack of viable alternatives\u2014will bring about lasting, positive change.\n"

From an economic perspective, I can say that I will not be supporting downtown businesses as much if bike lanes are removed as it continues to be the most efficient way to get around the city. From an equity and environmental perspective, it is obvious the benefits of having bike lanes throughout the city. I lived in Waterloo, ON for years and am impressed with their effort to build bike lanes and routes throughout the city and makes me want to leave Toronto to go back there because of this kind of action. My wife and I are contributing members to the city and if you keep pulling these shenanigans you will lose another family doctor in the city as we will be gone.
