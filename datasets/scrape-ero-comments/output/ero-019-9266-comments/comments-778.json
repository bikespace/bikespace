        "comment": "I live in the area and travel on Bloor frequently. I fully support the removal of the bike lanes.  Not only are they seldom used but it makes no sense to severely negatively impact the 99%+ of the population that travels by car and bus, just to make it easier for the less than 1% of the population that would like to travel by bike...and at that, even their use would be limited to only better weather days and probably VERY low usage in the winter.  Encouraging healthier, safer and more environmental travel is a great idea on its face, but crippling vehicular travel and essentially grinding it to a halt can't be the only and better choice.  Higher level oversight (Provincial) sounds like it might allow cooler heads to prevail and drive a better solution that BALANCES the needs of ALL, instead of sacrificing the needs of the many in order to satisfy the needs of the few (or the one).\n"

        "comment": "I support this bill wholeheartedly, in particular, removing the bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, near where I live.  I have rarely seen any cyclists using the lanes on Bloor Street.  There is simply no demand or need for them--and this during the warmer months.  There will be even fewer cyclists on them during winter.\nThe lanes are an eyesore and ruin the appearance of Bloor Street.\nThey impede access for emergency services--given the congestion on them, and the centre median on the street, emergency vehicles would be delayed reaching their destination.  They could not pass, and would be stuck like everyone else.\nIf the aim is to encourage cycling to reduce car pollution, the opposite is happening.  Because of the traffic congestion, cars are idling and causing far more pollution than if they could move freely without stopping and idling.\nThe cost of leaving them is far greater than of removing them.\nSo please remove the lanes as soon as possible.  Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely concerned that the premier seems to be acting out of animosity toward people who ride bicycles, when meanwhile bicycle-riding reduces congestion and air pollution. Toronto needs safe and interconnected bike lanes to move forward into a clean and safe future, and the city also needs to be able to make decisions based on what will be best for its residents. Digging up bike lanes is not only costly, but will lead to increased fatalities. We can't allow this regressive and dangerous move!\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the Ontario government's proposal to rip out existing bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto as well as put in place significant obstacles to the construction of new bicycle facilities where a lane of traffic is to be removed. The proposal is misguided and mean-spirited, ignores the abundance of technical evidence on the efficacy of bicycles lanes and the actual causes of traffic congestion, and represents a completely inappropriate encroachment of the Province into what should rightfully be an area of exclusively municipal jurisdiction.\nThe proposal also ignores the government's own policies, namely the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 that came into effect barely a month ago and states, \"Healthy, active, and inclusive communities should be promoted by... planning public streets, spaces, and facilities to be safe, meet the needs of persons of all ages and abilities, including pedestrians, foster social interaction and facilitate active transportation and community connectivity\".\nFollowing through on this proposal will incur entirely unnecessary costs while doing little to relieve congestion for automobile drivers. This waste may be compounded in the future as there is very much a non-zero chance that these actions will be undone by future governments, resulting in the need to spend even more scarce public funds to reinstate the removed bicycle facilities.\nFinally, it should be recognized there is a considerable health and safety dimension to this proposal. Currently, there are already an unacceptable number of dangerous interactions between automobiles and bicycles in Ontario communities, in part due to a lack of adequate bicycle infrastructure. The facilities constructed along Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue in Toronto, as well as in other locations across the province, have begun to address this need. Is the government prepared for the inevitable finger pointing when significant injuries or fatalities occur in locations that previously had separated bicycle lanes in place?\n"

        "comment": "Please protect bike lanes, as they reduce gridlock by existing! Having less cars on the road by providing alternative means of transportation is the best way to reduce gridlock.\nMany Ontarians use bikes for work because they cannot afford a vehicle. Taking away this option makes it more expensive and difficult for them to get to work. Further, many use bikes to stay healthy. There are also less emissions, therefore less illness when there are less vehicles on the road causing air pollution, especially in dense, urban areas. Decreased emissions means less strain on the healthcare system and less spending.\nPlease protect our bike lanes; removing them will only create another lane for gridlock to fill.\n"

It took years to recover fully and then a difficult time getting hired back into my industry given the gap in my resume, which I will have to explain in every interview going forward.\nHad there been a bike lane at that  location (there still isn\u2019t), I would not have been hit.\nAs a driver, bikes make city driving vastly safer and more efficient. I feel safer as a driver knowing my fellow citizens on bikes are protected, instead of them fighting for space in a car lane.\nRemoving our wonderful bike lanes is a harm and disservice to our communities. It is asinine, regressive use of our tax dollars and directly harmful to all citizens.\nShame on you. And shame on you for the rest of this bill and for using bike lanes as a smokescreen for your corruption.\n"

        "comment": "I live in a condo on Bloor St and find it dangerous to enter and exit our driveway.  I have to look for cyclists, pedestrians on the sidewalk and hold up the one lane of traffic to do this.  It now takes me at least 20 minutes to get from Thompson to Jane St along with other drivers sitting still and polluting the environment.  This stretch of Bloor St has the subway system and doesn\u2019t need other alternative transportation like bikes.  The white sticks pollute the visual environment of what used a charming neighbourhood.  I attended the info meeting about 3 yrs ago when these bike lanes were proposed.  The turnout was overwhelming with residents leaving their concerns with post it notes.  Our councilor, Morley, just stood on the sidelines with her bottle of water in hand, not interested in opinions.  It was obvious at that meeting that residents didn\u2019t want this yet our concerns were overridden.  As taxpayers, city council should be respecting our views.\n"

        "comment": "My experience  Sunday November 10. I drove along Bloor from High Park to Islington around 12:30PM. and returned around 7:15PM. It was light rain both times. Subway was closed, busses on Bloor. Traffic was backed up eastbound from Jane to Aberfoyle. Sitting idling. On my way back I was caught in it. Both times; No cyclists. None. Zero. Zilch. If we had another lane, like previously, we could have had more room to maneuvre around the busses and those waiting to make a right onto South Kingsway to get to the Gardiner. No cyclists would be affected because there were none. So I would say bike lanes contribute to congestion, and going back to two car lanes would help alleviate congestion. PS it is not unusual to see that lane backed up to Aberfoyle.\n"

        "comment": "Bike Lanes are More Than Infrastructure\nA Family's Perspective\nA few times a week, I ride with my kids to school using protected bike lanes, which is a great start to the morning. These lanes aren't just painted lines on pavement; they're lifelines that allow families to choose active, healthy transportation. Without them, each short trip becomes a car journey, adding to traffic and reducing our connection to the community. When safe bike lanes exist, families bike to local shops, parks, and schools. When they don't, we drive \u2013 even for trips under a kilometre.\nThe Evidence is Clear: Bike Lanes Work\nSafety Improvements\n- 56% decrease in cyclist injuries on Bloor Street after bike lane installation\n- Pedestrian injuries dropped from 13 to 5 per year\n- Overall motorist injuries reduced by 27% [Source: Toronto City Council Report, 2024]\nIncreased Adoption\n- Bike Share Toronto: 665,000 trips (2015) \u2192 5.7 million trips (2023)\n- 40-90% increase in cycling volume on protected routes\n- 2.57 times more cyclists on streets with separated lanes [Source: CBC News: Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion? Here's what the research says, 2024]\nTraffic Impact Myths Debunked\n- Travel times actually decreased on Adelaide St. and University Ave.\n- Minimal impact on other major routes\n- Bike lanes can move more people using less space than car lanes [Source: Toronto Metropolitan University Study, 2024]\nBroader Benefits\n- 4% reduction in traffic congestion where bike sharing introduced (Washington DC study)\n- 56% reduction in sidewalk cycling after protected lane installation\n- Up to 52% reduction in pedestrian injuries (NYC protected bike lanes) [Source: People for Bikes, 2024]\nBill 212's\nThis legislation would:\n- Force removal of crucial bike lanes\n- Strip local communities of transportation planning control\n- Ignore evidence-based safety benefits\n- Push families back into cars for short trips\nWhy This Matters\nToday's children will inherit the cities we design. When we remove bike lanes, we're not just removing infrastructure \u2013 we're removing choices. We're telling families that their safety matters less than saving a few minutes of driving time (which data shows isn't actually saved). We're forcing parents to choose between their children's independence and their safety.\nCall to Action\nThe evidence is overwhelming: bike lanes make our communities safer, healthier, and more vibrant. Bill 212 isn't just about removing bike lanes \u2013 it's about removing our ability to build the kind of communities where children can grow up healthy and independent.\nBefore making changes that affect our communities' safety and future, we urge decision-makers to:\n- Review the compelling safety data\n- Consider the impact on families and communities\n- Respect local decision-making\n- Prioritize evidence over ideology\nWhen I see children biking to school, I see the future of our cities. Let's not take a step backward. Keep our bike lanes. Keep our communities safe. Keep our future bright.\n"

        "comment": "I support the framework that would enable provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads requiring the removal of a traffic lane and for existing bike lanes where a traffic lane was removed. This framework also provides for the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in the City of Toronto, allowing these streets to return to a lane of traffic. This approach acknowledges the need for balance between various modes of transportation in our city.\nIt is disconcerting that the implementation of bike lanes appears to have been driven largely by sentiments rather than a comprehensive analysis of our city\u2019s transportation needs. As we strive to position Toronto as a world-class city akin to Paris or New York, it is essential to examine how these cities design their infrastructure. They often place bike lanes on one-way streets, or on roads that don\u2019t parallel subway lines, which seems a more logical approach given our unique urban landscape.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to recognize that the number of cyclists decreases significantly during winter months. Designing bike lanes on Bloor Street, which does not cater to the existing demand, raises questions about the wisdom of this decision. Perhaps a more effective solution would have been to allocate bike lanes on one side of the street or consider alternative routes entirely.\nThe idea that parents would rely on cycling for activities such as grocery shopping in Etobicoke or attending medical appointments is unrealistic. This notion reflects a misunderstanding of the demographic and practical realities faced by many residents in our city. A careful study of demographic information and an understanding of how people navigate their daily lives are crucial to informed urban planning.\nWith these concerns in mind, I urge city officials to reconsider the current approach to bike lane implementation on Bloor Street. Going forward, it would be beneficial to prioritize thorough consultations and evidence-based planning to ensure that the needs of all Toronto residents are adequately met.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I hope for a thoughtful and constructive dialogue regarding our city's transportation planning moving forward.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m happy to see the Ontario government forging ahead with this. There has been such terrible consultation on the part of the city with the public, and a complete disregard to what their citizens/taxpayers actually want. There has been no accountability or real transparency on the metrics used to justify the expansion of the bike lanes on bloor, and councillors like Gord Perks are openly stating they will discount/ignore any dissenting views. It pains me to watch the city spend so much money on ill planned initiatives, only to have to spend more when the new bike lanes make no sense to anyone including cyclists, drivers and pedestrians, only to have to spend more to fix the original bad idea.\nWhen a municipality fails as badly as our Toronto City council, there is no other choice but to turn to the province to make things right.\n"

Traffic will not be ameliorated through this change as there will still be large amounts of cyclists who will need to take up space safely.  There have been enough cyclist deaths over the years prior to the Bloor bike lane to prove that bike lanes save lives.

I am born and raised in Swansea and even my friends who are cyclists acknowledge that it was a bad idea (one of which was seriously injured in the lane heading East near Runnymede due to poor planning and visibility). I work in the Bloor West Village and Etobicoke and there are days that it has taken me almost a half hour to get from Royal York to Jane St and forget it if the Subway is down and TTC buses on on Bloor.\nEmergency vehicles can not get through at certain times, between the No right turns on red lights that have been put in and the planter boxes there is no where to pull over to the side to let the fire truck go by until the light turns green and the front car can move. Also it has hurt business including my own as the bike lanes have taken over the parking spaces which have been removed.\nJust yesterday it took me almost 15 minutes to find a spot in the Green P parking at Armadale and Bloor as they are always full. This was a very bad plan and not only were parking spaces removed but the city decided to up the price of a parking ticket. I am all for bike lanes if the street was 6 lanes wide then it would have worked,\nThe should be pulled back to at least Lansdowne from Islington.\nI have spoke to Councillor Perks office numerous times very cordially and the response and the attitude is that they just don't care and that was proven the other night when Mr Perks went on TV to talk about the radar camera on Parkside Dr being vandalized and he right away talked about putting the bike lanes onto Parkside.\nI am a very frustrated constituent that wishes that Doug Ford would not have changed the City of Toronto foot prints for councilors as i believe this never would have happened if Gord Perks riding would have not been extended west of Keele.\nThank You\n"
