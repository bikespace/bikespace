By creating more bike lanes (and NOT less) you encourage more people to ride a bike rather than drive because bike lanes make our streets so much safer.  I often ride with my small child in a bike trailer, without bike lanes I don't feel safe having him out on the road, which limits our opportunities.\nPlease protect our bike lanes!\n"

It takes away land rights for property owners that deserve fair compensation when their land is expropriated. It also takes away bike infrastructure that helps relieve congestion since more bikes on the road means less people driving which reduces traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This bill 212 is terrible and does the opposite of what it proposes.\nBIKE LANES ARE GOOD!\n- Bike lanes REDUCE traffic and every study ever conducted on them proves this.\n- Bike lanes are good for business. After foot traffic, the number one source of customers to Toronto storefronts are cyclists. This is because it's easy for them to hop off and buy something as they're riding past. Cars account for the least amount of business.\n- Protected bike lanes are some of the most affordable infrastructure. Installing them can be done overnight and, since bikes aren't heavy, they don't need to be maintained anywhere near as much as roads.\n- Bike lanes save lives. Protected bike lanes not only protect cyclists, they protect pedestrians from cars that would have otherwise hopped the curb onto the sidewalk.\n- Properly designed bike lanes provide a route for emergency vehicles to take even during heavy traffic. This means an ambulance can get a patient to the hospital even during rush hour.\n- Cycling is an incredibly popular way to get around the city. Ride share bike stations are plentiful and see lots of usage. The fastest Uber Eats deliveries downtown are made on bicycles.\nTHIS BILL IS BAD!\n- Without safe bike lanes, more people will choose to drive and the streets will remain congested. This has a huge impact on people who need to drive for their job; delivery vehicles, taxies and ubers, transit busses, etc. They will be slowed by all the single occupant vehicles that could have been bikes instead.\n- This is extreme over reach and does not respect municipal governments. It's also clearly only targets Toronto.\n- This is a smoke screen to jam through bill 413 without environmental reviews, giving the province increased expropriation powers so they can take homes without argument, notice, or appeal.\n- It shifting tow truck regulations back to the wild west.\n- It's naked cronyism, which is illegal.\n- It pisses off everyone in Toronto. Even people who drive (but live in the city) understand the benefits of better bike, transit and pedestrian infrastructure on soothing traffic issues.\n"

        "comment": "Dear sir or madam. I am a civil engineer. As a professional working in transportation, I strongly disagree with this governments approach to transportation infrastructure. There are several reasons why the approach is flawed.\n1. It will not address congestion. If we want to address congestion on our roads, we needs to provide transportation options. Giving people the freedom to choose how they move through their community should be a value we can all support. Much of the infrastructure we have built in the past 50+ years has removed options, creating neighbourhoods that are completely dependent on cars. This is not about going to war with cars. They have their place in our transportation toolbox. But living with car dependency creates enormous burdens on individuals and forces everyone onto our roads in a car, thus making congestion an inevitability.\n2. It is fiscally irresponsible. The cost to the public to support car dependency is enormous and financially unsustainable. In older areas, like Toronto, Hamilton or Peterborough, there is the possibility of creating transportation options and lowering the cost to the public and the individual of our infrastructure. The expansion of bike lanes has been a low cost and effective way of reducing congestion and providing safe alternatives.\n3. Safety. There are many parts of the city that do not have safe cycling routes, and people still use them at extreme personal risk. Look at Dupont St. While placing bike lane on calm residential streets is preferable (e.g., Shaw St, Palmerston, Wellington), the layout of our streets doesn't alway afford this. Show me an alternative north-south path that would stand in for Yonge St's bike lanes. So we have to work with what we have and make safety a priority on these streets.\nThis government's politicization of infrastructure is disappointing. No body wins. Not drivers. Not cyclists. Not pedestrians. Not Torontonians. Not folks in the 905.\n"

Bikes are among the most efficient forms of transportation in urban environments and undermining bike infrastructure will only lead to more cars and more congestion.  Why does the Minister insist on using outdated numbers to try to garner support for this bill?  Is it because more up to date numbers point in the opposite direction, and that more people are biking as better infrastructure is added?  Why does one need to own a car to live in Ontario?\n"

Before that, a teacher at a school in my neighbourhood was killed while cycling in the West End.\nEach of these people left behind families and friends. Each of them should still be alive today.\nSix other cyclists have been struck dead by traffic in Toronto in 2024 alone. Six people with grieving families.\nIt is easy, discussing legislation, to speak in abstractions. But I hope that every member of provincial parliament thinks carefully about the actual and specific consequences of this bill.\nEvery day thousands of Torontonians get on their bikes and go to work, go get groceries, go take their kids to school. For every bike lane this province removes, the odds that any of them never come home get higher.\nI will leave it to others to comment on what this government could do with the tens of millions of dollars it intends to spend ripping out bike lanes, or to talk about how bike lanes improve local businesses, or to talk about the environmental benefits of biking, or to talk about induced demand, or all other ways that this bill is misguided.\nBut I hope that, just for a moment, this province\u2019s legislators can put aside the platitudes and think about the actual lives that bike lanes can save \u2014 and could have saved. And then, I hope they think about the lives that this bill could cost.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the measures removing and preventing the addition of cycling infrastructure. There\u2019s been no sign of any plan to make a non arterial cycling network that connects up, and I have had a lot of experience with trying to make that work, and I\u2019ve done my homework. It sounds great until you look at a map, basically. And where it does work, we\u2019re already doing it. These provisions aren\u2019t going to help drivers in the long run. They\u2019re just going to lead to more congestion. You could do a bunch of property expropriation and build a bunch of special bridges and tunnels to make a side street network happen, like we did when putting together the driving network, but I doubt that any of that is the plan. The plan seems to be to keep referencing a connected network of side streets that doesn\u2019t exist. Awhile ago I put together who I called a \u201chybrid\u201d network concept for connecting our suburban side streets, minimizing changes to driving space and arterial roads, basically by running cycletracks through our arterial crossings of rail lines, ravines, highways etc, all the choke points where the main arterials are the only route. It\u2019s only viable in the suburbs, it only works in some places, and the places that it would allow us to not put cycletracks are places where the arterials have lots of extra capacity anyway. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that you\u2019d consider. There\u2019s lots of reasons not to build cycling infrastructure and it\u2019s all bad faith arguments. They\u2019re simple common sense sounding things but they\u2019re lies, in the end, which are quicker to say than the corresponding truths that debunk them. But the important piece is, our slow build out of cycling infrastructure has given us an awkward transitional phase where every new piece is underused until it gets connected up, and drivers have less space to work with even as they\u2019re going past bits of cycletrack that don\u2019t take them all the way they need to go. That\u2019s what my coworker is dealing with. He\u2019s ready to switch from driving to cycling, and just needs the remaining ten percent of his commuting route to be fixed. It\u2019s totally congested, without cycling infrastructure, and that congestion is going to continue to be used as an excuse not to build that infrastructure. Meanwhile the only benefit in the situation goes to the car and oil companies. And that\u2019s who this act is designed to benefit, in my opinion. It\u2019s not about helping drivers, it\u2019s about using our road system as an auto industry marketing tool. And that\u2019s a shameful practice that has endured long enough now. Cars are great and driving is great, except when it\u2019s compulsory. And people are sick of being forced to drive. That\u2019s the only thing I really hated about owning a car. All the trips that would have been better as bike rides, but that I had to use my car for. It made me hate being a driver. Because I was either one of the extra drivers who\u2019d rather be cycling, or I was stuck in traffic with a bunch of the other extra drivers, or both. Anyway, I\u2019ve linked the video I made about the hybrid network concept, so you can see why the city decided not to pursue it. Or maybe you\u2019ll go for it and do flyovers and bridges in place of the cycletracks. But that\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll see to something that avoids removing driving space from arterials. Good luck.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives in Toronto, and walks, bikes and drives weekly I understand that there will always be competing demands for limited space when it comes to transportation. Having experience with all forms of transit there is still no comparison in time spent, safety and ease when it comes to driving.  Drivers are the most privileged and catered to group on our roads.\nThe majority of gridlock is caused by commuters from outside of the city driving (alone) to work. I have chosen to live in a walkable, cycling friendly city and that is reflected in the policies of my elected municipal council.  The Ontario Government is overreaching with Bill 212 and by-passing the will of Torontonians, to enact the will of those who do not live here, therefore bypassing democracy. It is unreasonable that those who do not live in Toronto are able to dictate how Torontonians are able to get around their city.\nI am not in support of removing or limiting the expansion of bike lanes as outlined in Bill 212, and I would ask that this comment is considered in the decision making process by the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO).\n"

When I moved to Toronto over twenty years ago, I was stunned by how few people rode their bikes to work; downtown Toronto is made for a fast commute on a bicycle. When I asked people why they were not riding their bikes, a frequent answer was safety. I was thrilled when more and more bike lanes were installed, and I saw more and more people riding bicycles. Removing bike lanes is a step backward from a more environmental way of commuting and endangers the lives of many. It will not solve the gridlock problem caused by too many cars driving into Toronto (see downtown exists from the Gardiner into streets without bike lanes). I find it irresponsible to play with the lives of cyclists by having drivers of cars arrive 2 minutes earlier at work. Increase the frequency of GoTrains and GoBusses during the day and at night so people don't have to drive downtown. Keep the bike lanes to keep people alive!\n"

As a mental health expert working at the intersection of climate change, I deeply know the importance of promoting low carbon transportation that connects us to our cities and communities. Our governments should be prioritizing our health and the health of our environment - promoting cycling is one of those simple and crucial actions that get us there. A few years ago I had a bike accident on a street with no bike lane that led me to break my elbow and get surgery. I had to go on short term disability and my life was really affected as this happened during the pandemic. These bike lanes save lives and prevent further costs to our healthcare system.
