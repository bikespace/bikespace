        "comment": "If you care about safety in municipalities across the province of Ontario, and are actually committed to reducing congestion in our cities and towns, you will not remove bike lanes, nor reduce the opportunity to build more.  Bike lanes are an essential part of efficient transportation infrastructure, and they save lives.  All the research - around the world - shows that bike lanes alleviate gridlock.   There is zero evidence to show that bike lanes contribute to gridlock.   As elected policy-makers, you have been entrusted to make decisions that are well-informed, and that reduce harm, not increase harm.   If partisan ideologies rather than research are behind your decisions, then you are not acting in the public interest, and your legacy will reflect that.  Please do not be the government that caused more deaths on our streets.\nIt's not clear that you are familiar with \"induced demand,\" but it means \"if you build it, they will come.\"  Bike lanes in Toronto have gotten people out of cars (including ride-share vehicles like Uber and Lyft), thereby reducing gridlock:   \"Bike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\" from https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nPlease note the research links below.\n"

Study after study has shown not only the POSITIVE economic effects of bike lanes on local neighborhoods but that it REDUCES overall traffic congestion, and improves emergency response times. Not too mention that cyclists deserve to have safe infrastructure to ride in.\nBill 212 ignores all this evidence supporting bike lanes while touting it's goal of reducing traffic congestion. This is absurd.\nFurther, this is a vast over reach of municipal jurisdiction to govern their own affairs. Local planning decisions must be left to their elected officials at the municipality level, and not at the provincial level. I demand the withdrawal of this Bill. We will remember your actions and that of others come next provincial election.\n"

Removing lanes of car traffic for bike lanes has brought Toronto into the 21st century. Preventing further opportunities for bike lanes to replace traffic or parking lanes will only lead to increased cyclists deaths/injuries and is hypocritical to the entire Ontario Traffic Council Vision Zero Guide.\nBiking is the most efficient mode of transit in Toronto all year round.

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nThe title of Bill 212 proposes that this bill is about \"reducing gridlock\" and \"saving you time\". Don't be fooled. This is about forcing people into cars and pandering to special interests, all the while interfering with municipal affairs to settle scores and make life miserable for local politicians and activists.\nMost of us have experienced the frustration of being stuck in traffic, inching forward bit by bit while cyclists zip by in the bike lane. This is not the vision of freedom that car commercials promise. We're supposed to be conquering steep hills in the woods and burning rubber on the open road, right? Well, obviously the solution is to build a few more lanes and take more space away from cyclists and pedestrians, isn't it? NOPE.\nBuilding more car infrastructure quickly bumps up against the problem of \"induced demand\" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). The fact is, the more car infrastructure we build, the more car trips people are going to make, leading to more vehicle traffic. After a road widening, gridlock is only lessened for a short time at best, and traffic ends up being just as terrible, or potentially even worse than before within a short time (after significant cost to the taxpayer, one might add). In addition, the resulting multi-lane roadways end up being hostile to anyone outside of a vehicle, essentially forcing everyone to use a car even for short trips, which is one of the reasons for congestion in the first place.\nBill 212 aims to remove bike lanes that have already been installed in Toronto while slowing the construction of bike lanes in all of Ontario by requiring review by the Province whenever a bike lane takes any space away from cars. Cars just so happen to be one of the least space efficient means of transportation ever devised. If I were to bike up a main street with a 2 meter by 4 meter wooden frame attached to my bike, car drivers would be incensed. Why is it that we don't bat an eye when a massive SUV zips by with only one person in it, taking up excessive space on our roads? Trying to \"fix\" motor vehicle traffic by building one more lane (or by taking back lanes given over to more space-efficient alternatives) is a fool's errand.\nThe good news is that induced demand can be harnessed to promote other forms of transportation as well. If we build bike lanes, more people will feel safe leaving the car at home for their commute or to do errands around town. And in effect, this actually leads to less congestion in the vehicle lanes because every person cycling means there is ONE LESS CAR taking up space on the road.\nIn fact, our cities should be taking more motor vehicle lanes away from cars in favour of more space efficient forms of transportation such as cycling and public transit (dedicated buses can move up to about five times the number of people per hour in the same space as personal motor vehicles can, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_per_hour_per_direction). Bill 212 would tie the hands of our Ontario municipalities and require them to lobby the provincial government for permission to do such things (which could rightly be considered government overreach, a concept that the provincial government claims to despise).\nIn the fight against gridlock, a wondrous corollary to induced demand is the idea that TRAFFIC FLOWS ONLY AS FAST AS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION (this is known as the Downs-Thomson paradox, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQY6WGOoYis). For example, if buses are given dedicated lanes and end up moving people faster than driving, then some (but not all) drivers will choose to take the bus, leading to freer flowing traffic for everyone. This equilibrium effect can be harnessed to improve the average speed of transportation around our cities when these more space efficient means of transportation are emphasized!\nSo, what should we do instead of enacting Bill 212? We should STOP this government overreach and let cities decide when and where to build their bike lanes. We should base our transportation planning on the best available science and prioritize the most space efficient modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit. We should reassure business owners that bike lanes and transit routes can actually INCREASE SALES, even when paired with the removal of vehicle lanes or on-street parking. And we should stop trying to pander to crony capitalists in Toronto, as well as the auto and fossil fuel industries by forcing everyone who wants to move around our cities to buy a car and fill it up with gas.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this misguided proposal.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is deeply disappointing on multiple levels, and I strongly oppose this legislation. Having grown up in Toronto, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative benefits of increased bike lanes\u2014particularly on University Avenue, Bloor Street, and Yonge Street. These bike lanes have not only improved transportation but have also enhanced the quality of life in our city. My opposition to the proposed legislation is based on the following reasons:\n1. Removing bike lanes will increase traffic congestion.\nIf the intent of this legislation is to combat gridlock, removing bike lanes will have the opposite effect. Studies consistently show that eliminating bike infrastructure leads to increased traffic due to induced demand, as more cars fill the space previously occupied by cyclists. [1]\n2. Bike lanes boost local economic activity.\nResearch demonstrates that bike lanes contribute positively to businesses by increasing foot and bike traffic. The Bloor Street Economic Impact Study is a clear example of how bike lanes can revitalize local economies. [2]\n3. Bike lanes save lives.\nSafety should be a priority. Tragically, two students lost their lives on the route I used to cycle daily\u2014a stark reminder of the need for dedicated cycling infrastructure to prevent such needless loss of life.\n4. Bike lanes improve public and personal health.\nThey encourage active transportation, reducing reliance on cars and promoting healthier lifestyles. The benefits extend to mental well-being, cleaner air, and lower healthcare costs.\n5. Bike lanes are environmentally friendly.\nBy providing a sustainable alternative to driving, bike lanes help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a greener, more resilient city.\n6. Bike lanes offer freedom and mobility.\nPrioritizing one mode of transit\u2014cars\u2014over others is inequitable and discriminatory. Bike lanes give residents a safe and accessible way to travel, regardless of income or physical ability.\nWhenever someone asks me what I love most about Toronto, the bike lanes are among the first things I mention. As a year-round cyclist, I experience their benefits every day. They make our city more livable, connected, and inclusive.\nFinally, I am appalled by the decision to bypass environmental procedures for the proposed highway construction. This highway will only worsen urban sprawl around Toronto, perpetuating car-centric infrastructure at a time when we should be moving towards sustainable urban planning. I cannot support this.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation and to prioritize policies that create a safer, healthier, and more equitable Toronto for all.\n[1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\n[2] https://tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bloor-Economic-Impact-Study-\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, while well-intentioned, will not effectively address congestion in Toronto and could ultimately put lives at risk. The bill focuses on quick fixes, such as streamlining infrastructure projects and reducing delays, but it fails to address the root causes of congestion, like over-reliance on cars, inadequate public transportation, and urban sprawl. By prioritizing speed over safety, the bill risks pushing through development projects without sufficient planning or oversight, leading to more accidents, poorly designed streets, and insufficient support for vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and cyclists. Without a comprehensive strategy that integrates better transit, sustainable urban design, and traffic safety measures, Bill 212 risks exacerbating the very issues it aims to resolve, making our roads more dangerous and leaving long-term solutions unaddressed.\n"

        "comment": "The people who use bike lanes will be forced to take other modes of transit, most likely cars, if there are not safe bike lanes for them to ride in. This will increase car traffic and will make congestion worse, neither of which will save anyone any time.\nRemoving bike lanes that are already in place ensures that congestion will increase, because of the construction labour required to remove them, as well as all the displaced cyclists who must convert to other modes of transportation. This increases congestion in the short term and long term.\nAs someone who has ridden my bike for pleasure, for transit, and for work, bike lanes make me feel safe out on roads. Vehicle drivers go too fast, drive too closely, and too dangerously to feel safe cycling on many roads. Their behaviour endangers my life, both as a pedestrian and cyclist.\nRiding on roads next to parked cars is dangerous, too, because drivers exiting their vehicles can door cyclists going by if the cycle lane isn't separated. This can, and has, led to serious injuries for both parties, and death for the cyclist in some cases. The only way to tackle these problems is to increase bike lanes across the province so that cyclists and anyone with mobility aids such as scooters or wheelchairs can freely get around, unharmed.\n"

Cycling is good exercise and exercise benefits physical and mental health. Moreover, unlike driving, cycling does not pollute or contribute to green house gas emissions. Pollution leads to health-related illnesses such as asthma, and green house gas emissions are responsible for climate change, which in turn increases catastrophic events such as flooding and forest fires.\nMoreover, cycling makes our spaces friendlier. People can see each other's faces and smile at each other.\nI am happy to share the bike lane with many bicycle couriers/ food deliverers, which shows that bike lanes are good for employment, business, and customers.\nThere are so many benefits of bike lanes, it does not make any sense to get rid of them.
