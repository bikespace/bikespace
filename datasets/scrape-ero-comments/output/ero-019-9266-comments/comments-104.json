I need more affordable housing and the money you are using for this stupid bill shows me how much you actually care for the hard working people of ontario\n"

Taking away bike lanes will force cyclists into live lanes of traffic making vehicular traffic WORSE than with bike lanes as cyclists take up the lanes for themselves. Do your research Doug Ford. Making petty decisions because you and your friends perceive bike lanes to be an issue is moronic. Keep your hands off the City of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Many of the places where traffic is the worst in my city is where large capacity roads (ex. 4 lanes) turn into low capacity roads (ex. two lane), and there's no room to expand the low capacity road. Ensuring more car capacity where possible doesn't reduce traffic, it just adds more potential vehicles to get stuck at the bottlenecks. So I don't understand how it's a useful thing to make it harder for municipalities, who know their cities best, to provide more options for people to keep their cars off the road and lessen traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycle lanes can reduce traffic more than another car lane ever could. They also increase pedestrian safety and make cities more comfortable to walk in. Extra lanes induce demand and soon the traffic is just as bad as before, or worse! It's more dangerous than ever to be a pedestrian in a car-centric city, and wider streets with more lanes will only exacerbate the issue. As a citizen of Ontario I am strongly opposed to the reduction of bicycle lanes. I am a strong supporter of alternative forms of transportation which reduce the need for a car and increase the safety, comfort, and quality of life for pedestrians.\n"

Please, for once back up these motions with actual evidence, present your reasoning in clear, well established terminology so the everyday person can understand, and convince us that this makes sense.  Right now, you are piling an endless heap of corruption and neglect\nIn what world do you want your children to live? Where people who choose a sustainable form of travel are persecuted,  threatened with harm by the drivers of vehicles, or where our government shun sustainable progress for momentary convenience?\nYou may take the lanes away, but please know;  I will still ride, everyday. Everyday I will take a whole lane, as is my right as a vehicle on Ontario road ways, I will stop at every light, and sign. I will wear a camera so every violent comment, gesture and action is recorded.  God forbid more cyclists get injured, but they will;  this will cause more violence on your streets.  Without a doubt. You sre activating your citizens: the little amount of nurses you have left, ride bikes.  The chefs, servers, and bartenders who cater to your ridiculous whims, ride bikes.  The teachers, librarians,  caregivers, the students. They all ride bikes.\nWhat an absolute corrupt, inept, yawning void of a government.\n"

Please stop demonizing other methods of commuting than single occupancy vehicles. I am absolutely furious that this is what the province is prioritizing over issue like health care, specifically finding family doctors. You will absolutely lose my vote if you pursue this further and I will reluctantly vote left. This is a waste of time and my hard earned money. I've paid over $200k in taxes in the last two years and THIS IS YOUR FOCUS? This is complete provincial overreach and not conservativism, you folks have lost the plot and I am embarrassed to be in this party if impinging on municipal road design that keeps people safe is your newfound interest. FOCUS ON THE PROVINCE, NOT SOME RANDOM TORONTO STREETS.\n"

        "comment": "Preventing bike lane construction to preserve lanes for car traffic is an absurd idea if the intent is to prevent gridlocked traffic. Traffic is made of cars and can't be resolved by eliminating or sabotaging every possible alternative to driving.\nIt is astonishing that anyone with any level of responsibility for making policy decisions thinks this is a good idea. It's genuinely hard to believe that this was proposed in good faith.\nTraffic lanes support more traffic. Bikes lanes support bikes. Traffic lanes induce demand for cars. Every extra car is more traffic. Bikes in separated lanes do not contribute to car traffic. Roads with fewer lanes have a lower maximum throughout, but all roads lead to congestion when there are no realistic alternatives to driving.\nCars take an enormous amount of space and infrastructure. Even with Ontario's considerable resources, we can't have everyone using the absolute least efficient mode of transportation at all times and expect to compete with places in the world that are less pathologically addicted to driving.\n"

We seem to be adding layer upon layer of provincial red tape, and to no actual effect, since bike lanes reduce traffic on major arteries, and Toronto has no \"secondary\" roads that offer actual direct routes. Everyone involved in bringing this bill forward should be ashamed of themselves, for so crassly overlook a duty to provide good governance for the people of Ontario.\n"

The province should be focusing on improving existing bike lanes instead of tearing out existing infrastructure (especially infrastructure that was JUST FINISHED).\nMultiple cyclists have been killed this year by being forced to share the road with cars. Every death from this point on is on the hands of the people supporting this bill.\nEnforcement for existing laws protecting cyclists is lacking to a degree that reveals the province's disdain for them. I'd be ashamed to live in a province that continues this attitude to cyclists.\n"

Municipalities should be able to build infrastructure that meets their comminities' needs without the province impeding progress.\nMore bike lanes across the province would be a great improvement. By the province forcing upon us additional red tape, there will be greater congestion. Bikes need safe lanes separate from drivers. Currently many areas with bike lanes have reasonable traffic flow for cars as well.\nThe provincial government's attempt to slow progress is disturbing. Let's build up towns and communities that encourage bikes over cars. Less parking means more land available. Less cars mean quieter and healthier environment.\nIn addition, we should not be building more highways to reduce congestion. We should be building rail infrastructure. Europe and Asia have both shown the significant value of having a strong rail system that's accessible by all.\n"
