Making safer and more accessible bikeways (and improving public transit) will go much further in reducing the city's traffic issue than removing bikelanes. Above that, you are putting people's lives at risk. People choose to bike for a myriad of reasons (environmentally friendly, good for health, faster than driving walking or taking public transit in many cases, etc, etc, etc). The lack of bike infrastructure in this city is costing lives, and is detrimental to the city as a whole.\n"

Of these, I only know of one of them who has not been in an accident with a vehicle. I cannot imagine what would happen to these injury rates if bike lanes were to be removed. What a waste of time and resources to process this proposal in a city already suffering from the effects of too many cars on the road. Everyone I have spoken with in my community agrees that the bike lanes should remain as they are.\n"

        "comment": "I lived in Toronto when there were no bike lanes, and I often cycled around the city to business meetings and to social engagements. It was much more dangerous to cycle then. Now, when I go back to visit Toronto, I feel much safer and more willing to cycle, particularly as I age. Cycling is good for aging people because of the balance, cardio-vascular and general health benefits, so it helps decrease costs for our public health care system. And, bike lanes encourage more cycling, thereby decreasing congestion on the roads and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\nNow, I live on a farm near the small town of Campbellford and I still enjoy cycling. Our local municipal government of Trent Hills has marked some bike lanes on some of the major roads, and it's a great safety improvement. It has also encouraged more people to cycle because they feel safer.\nThe Provincial government should stay out of these kinds of decisions, that are better left to municipal governments. We need more investment in health care, education and the environment. The cost of planning, designing and building the bike lanes, and now having the Ontario Government wanting to mandate their removal is an irresponsible use of taxpayers' money. We should all be encouraging active transportation like walking and cycling.\n"

The LAST thing we need is more highways. What we NEED instead is better public transportation funding and better infrastructure so said public transit can get around easier. And WHY would you want to scrap bike lanes? Have you not seen Wall-E??? Don't you see the dangers of becoming overdependant on automobiles? Sure, you can argue its just speculative fiction all you want. But you CANNOT deny that the future is in our hands and we need to stop making the rich richer and destroy our environment for these silly gains. Because there will be NOTHING to gain if we don't have a sustainable planet to live in. Thank you.\n"

The bike lanes are essential to maintaining my safety as a cyclist and helping me keep cyclists safe as a driver. When I cycle, I do so to reduce my impact on the environment, reduce my contribution to motor vehicle traffic, to make my commute more enjoyable and to stay healthy when I have a busy and demanding work schedule. Cycling is good for the city and cyclists need to be kept safe, through bike lanes and other means, in order for the city and Toronto traffic to benefit from their actions Removing bike lanes puts my life at risk when I choose to cycle. It also puts me in a position where it\u2019s better for me to drive in many cases than to cycle. Removing bike lanes puts more traffic on the road and puts more people\u2019s lives at risk.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed legislation that would require municipalities to seek provincial approval before implementing new bicycle lanes that remove existing traffic lanes. While I understand the intent of this proposal is to address gridlock and improve traffic flow for drivers, I believe it fails to consider the broader, long-term benefits of cycling infrastructure, public health, and sustainability, which are essential for the future of Ontario\u2019s urban environments. I urge you to reconsider or modify aspects of this framework in order to ensure that Ontario\u2019s transportation future is both equitable and sustainable.\n1. Striking a Balance Between All Modes of Transportation\nThe premise that removing bike lanes to make room for more car lanes will alleviate gridlock and improve travel times is short-sighted. It overlooks the fact that gridlock is often a result of an over-reliance on single-occupancy vehicles, which contribute to traffic congestion, air pollution, and reduced quality of life for all residents. Cars will always be a part of transportation infrastructure but other modes of transport such as cycling are also essential and can work in tandem with cars to best serve our communities. Each of these modes of infrastructure transport deserve their own and by investing in things such as bike lanes, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, improve overall traffic flow, and make our cities more livable for everyone. Prioritizing cars over cycling infrastructure sends the wrong message at a time when many Ontarians are looking for cleaner, more efficient alternatives to driving.\n2. Prioritizing Road Safety for All Users\nThe removal of bike lanes, especially on busy streets like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, would undermine road safety for all users\u2014cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. Bike lanes are essential in reducing the risk of accidents by providing dedicated, protected spaces for cyclists. Without these lanes, cyclists are forced to share the road with motor vehicles, which increases the likelihood of dangerous interactions. Studies show that cities with well-designed cycling infrastructure, including protected bike lanes, experience fewer cyclist injuries and fatalities.\nRemoving bike lanes would not only make cycling more dangerous, but it could also compromise the safety of pedestrians and drivers. When cyclists are forced to ride in vehicle lanes, both cyclists and drivers must navigate around each other, leading to increased tensions and a higher risk of collisions. By keeping and expanding bike lanes, we create safer streets for everyone, including drivers who are less likely to encounter cyclists in the same lanes of traffic, and pedestrians who benefit from fewer vehicles on the road.\nRather than removing bike lanes, the focus should be on creating more safe, integrated transportation networks that prioritize safety for all road users. This includes adding infrastructure that accommodates cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers, rather than favoring one group at the expense of others. By improving road safety through bike lanes, we encourage active transportation while also reducing the strain on emergency services, hospitals, and the healthcare system.\n3. Impact on Local Communities and Businesses\nBike lanes are not only an asset for cyclists\u2014they are an economic driver for local communities. Studies have shown that areas with well-designed cycling infrastructure see increased foot traffic and higher sales for businesses as highlighted by the Bloor-Annex BIA data around increased customers and revenue since the bike lane installation. Removing bike lanes from streets like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue could harm these local economies by reducing accessibility for cyclists, many of whom stop at shops and cafes along the way. Encouraging more people to cycle rather than drive also helps reduce the need for expensive parking infrastructure, which is often a significant burden for businesses and municipalities alike.\n4. The Importance of Long-Term Planning\nThe proposed framework fails to recognize the long-term, strategic benefits of cycling infrastructure. In cities around the world, from Copenhagen to Portland, investment in cycling infrastructure has not only improved mobility but has also helped cities become more resilient to climate change, reduced urban heat island effects, and supported a higher quality of life. Rather than dismantling bike lanes, Ontario should be looking for ways to expand and improve them to support a growing population that will require more sustainable transportation options. This is especially true in Toronto, which continues to see population growth and increased density. We must invest in future-proof infrastructure that encourages people to use public transportation, walk, and bike, rather than maintaining an over-reliance on cars.\n5. Local Autonomy and Consultation\nThe decision to remove bike lanes should not rest with the province and overstepping into municipal jurisdiction only serves to add red tape and bureaucracy to an already complicated process. Municipalities are best positioned to assess local needs and determine the most effective solutions for their unique transportation challenges. Local consultation, including input from cyclists, residents, and businesses, should be at the heart of decisions about cycling infrastructure. By imposing top-down regulations without robust local consultation, the province risks undermining trust in the decision-making process and ignoring the needs of those who rely on these bike lanes as an integral part of their daily lives.\n6. Lack of Consideration for the Future of Transportation\nThis legislation overlooks emerging trends in transportation and urban planning. Many cities worldwide are moving toward \"15-minute neighborhoods\" where essential services, including transportation options, are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. In Ontario, expanding bike lanes is part of a broader vision for more connected, sustainable, and resilient cities. By discouraging the development of bike infrastructure, this legislation could limit Ontario\u2019s ability to modernize its transportation systems and meet the mobility needs of future generations.\nConclusion\nWhile the intent behind the proposed legislation to remove bike lanes may be to reduce traffic congestion, I believe that a more comprehensive and forward-thinking approach is needed. Rather than dismantling bike lanes, Ontario should be looking at ways to integrate cycling infrastructure into a multi-modal transportation system that provides residents with more sustainable, affordable, and healthy options for getting around. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and focus on solutions that will benefit all Ontarians, both today and in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposal - the waste of money on the construction, the negative impact to the environment of encouraging private vehicles instead of bike( which is a much more sustainable alternative ), and the fact that no research has proven the removal of bike lane would lead to better traffic in the downtown area.

        "comment": "I'm against this bill and I sincerely hope it does not pass. Removing bike lanes anywhere is not going to stop people from biking, it will end up with people who commute via cycling getting injured or killed. Before the construction of the bike lanes along lakeshore, I was the victim of multiple injuries from car drivers. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists onto the road with cars who, at this point, are less accustomed to them than before bike lanes were introduced and will result in injuries and fatalities.\nIt will cost money, create more construction which will lead to congestion and cyclists that now use the road will also slow down traffic. The removal of bike lanes and slower approval process to get new ones put in is clearly just an act by someone with a personal grudge against them and financial motive for their own self gain.\nThis can also be said for the approval of Highway 413, which is not necessary. It is another solution that will be far more costly in the short run than its benefits will be in the future. There are better ways to reduce traffic congestion; support local business' and infrastructure for the surrounding areas and introduce better mobile and internet coverage so commuting for work is reduced. The destruction of green space and farming for this area would be a major loss and seems like a huge step backwards after the forest fires Ontario faced in recent summers. Again, this seems like something being pushed forward by someone with personal financial gain at the expense of tax payers, local communities where the highway is proposed to be built and the environment\n"

        "comment": "I urge you strongly not to follow through with this Bill. Cycling is an important form of transportation that has the potential to alleviate gridlock. Removing bike lanes, and not building new ones, however, effectively makes cycling dangerous and wastes the potential of this form of transportation.\nCities in countries around the world are making cities more, not less bike friendly. They introduce alternate forms of transportation (including public transit) to encourage less, rather than more traffic. Ontario (and Toronto) consider themselves places at the forefront of innovation. This is the opposite.\n"

Countless studies have proven that creating more roads and highways does not reduce traffic congestion. It just encourages \u201cinduced demand.\u201d Making driving easier and quicker (initially), by adding lanes or highways or reconfiguring intersections, you encourage more people to use cars, until it reaches capacity and then you are back at square one again (see Los Angeles.)\nNot EVERYone can get around by car. It is just not possible to accommodate every citizen in a single occupancy car. We don\u2019t have the space! Bill 212 is so transparently short-sighted and detrimental to future prosperity.\nNot only is spending $50 million to rip up bike lanes a massive waste of money, but it will endanger the lives of cyclists while also making traffic and climate pollution even worse.\nImagine if that money went to hiring frontline healthcare workers and family doctors, building affordable homes, hiring education staff, and improving the services we all rely on in our communities?\nWe need investments that truly support sustainable, alternative travel options across Ontario. Not wasteful highways and additional barriers to green municipal planning iniaitiatives. Please stop these shortsighted smoke-and-mirror tactics to distract the public from the real issues. And STOP conveniently changing the rules to suit your own political goals. It\u2019s blatantly corrupt and history will not be kind. Environmental assessments are required for a reason and are required for ALL projects.\nI\u2019m asking you to reverse course on Bill 212. Support the construction of MORE bike lanes and cancel Highway 413 once and for all. If we don\u2019t come up with sustainable options soon, we won\u2019t have anywhere to go. Period.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes in Toronto are an incredibly important piece of infrastructure. They are beneficial for a number of reasons including the following:\n- They help economic activity for businesses in the local area\n- They are substantially more effective at moving a high volume of people\n- They help ensures cyclists are safe and separated from motorized traffic so they are not contributing to additional traffic\n- They are an important factor in maintaining a healthy mixed transportation infrastructure\n- Cycles take up far less space than cars, and therefore help reduce congestion\nThe cost of removing the bike lanes is tremendous and a poor use of Ontario taxpayer funds, this would be better invested in public transportation and congestion taxation on drivers who are the people actually contributing to gridlock in the city. By reallocating infrastructure from cars we can continue improving the quality and speed of transportation for the maximum number of Torontonians, the city is for the people who live IN it, not for those driving THROUGH it.\n"

There is no justification for spending money to remove bike lanes, and especially in the areas identified. Provincial policies should focus on provincial jurisdictions.

I am appalled that Premier Ford and his ministers are willing to trade literal lives in order to accomplish this wrongheaded effort.

We have attached the Ontario Public Health Association's submission, as well as those of OPPI and OTC.\nThis legislation would be a setback for municipalities\u2019 efforts to plan for and develop safe and efficient multi-modal transportation systems. Municipalities know their communities and use the best information ad evidence available to them to integrate active transportation into their transportation networks. There is documented evidence that bike lanes do not contribute to traffic congestion.\nProviding more infrastructure for people to cycle safely will benefit the environment, local economies, and public health. It will help ensure that more people can get to where they need to go safely, regardless of age, ability or income. We urge you to review the evidence and information presented in the attached letters and amend Bill 212.\nYours truly,\nThe Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA)\n"

        "comment": "I am a student living in the downtown area near Bloor, and as both a cyclist and a driver, I strongly oppose this proposal. While I have a car, I have greatly benefitted from the added bike lanes along Bloor St West and University, as they have allowed me to bike to school and work quickly and safely. Their additions have encouraged me to use the City Bike program rather driving, walking, or even taking the TTC. This has allowed me to do my part in lowering my carbon footprint, has positively benefitted my mental and physical health, and has reduced the costs I pay for gas (important on a student budget!), all while still contributing to the city's economy.\nAs a driver, I also regularly drive on Bloor St. West and University to visit family in the west end, and the added bike lanes have not added extra time to my commute. In fact, at certain times of day, my commute has become quicker, as there are less cyclists weaving in and out of traffic, and many drivers (including myself, at times) have opted to take alternate, equally-efficient routes such as Davenport, Dupont, Harbord, or the Gardiner Expressway. Since the bike lanes have been added, I have felt safer driving down Bloor St. West, and less fearful of an accident occurring with a cyclist.\nIndeed, bike lanes save lives. A 24-year old cyclist using the very same City Bike program I use was recently killed at Bloor St. W & Avenue Rd, on the very same path I take everyday -- in the one spot where the Bloor St. West bike lane was blocked due to construction. This was a tragic and preventable accident.\nAs such, I strongly believe that adding further construction to roads while also reducing public safety and sustainability -- all amid a climate crisis and a struggling healthcare system-- is an irresponsible and illogical use of provincial funds.\n"
