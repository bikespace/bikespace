        "comment": "I'm a resident of York-South Weston, a car driver, and someone who uses a bike to get around the city, including to work. Please do not remove all bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University.\nIf you must remove some bike lanes, only remove those that are underused (e.g. those west of High Park on Bloor). I certainly can see how they can disrupt traffic and I understand that few people in Etobicoke or even Bloor West Village may need them.\nBut other bike lanes are heavily used, particularly the Bloor Street bike lane from High Park to Yonge street. This bike lane can get so busy that there will sometimes be long lines of bikes running along this corridor. These bikes will simply move into regular traffic if the bike lane is removed, which will itself slow down car traffic. Removing these bike lanes will force me into regular traffic, and I worry, will put my life at risk.\nI'm also strongly opposed to the provincial government interfering with local decision making. Doug Ford has publicly said that \"municipalities know best\". Did he mean that? Unlike other areas that used to be the responsibility of municipalities (like some portions of regional highways, subway construction or even some housing-related zoning rules), I don't see any regional dimension to bike lanes that requires that the province interfere with Toronto's decision making about how to build transportation infrastructure. Why should people in northern Ontario get to tell people living in Toronto how to get around their city? I understand the opposition to bike lane construction in Toronto, but Torontonians should decide whether they should be removed through the decisions of their elected local representatives.\nIf the province is going to force the city (and us) to remove bike lanes, and effectively, push them somewhere else, than the province should reimburse the city for the cost of installing those bike lanes, removing the bike lanes, and installing them somewhere else. That is the true cost of a decision to interfere in local decision making. It also comes at a time when the city is severely strapped for cash. Without this reimbursement, the province's decision could further impact the city's service delivery. The province's ultimate approach to this issue will without question affect my vote in the upcoming election.\n"

First post, still learning about Reddit peculiarities. Forgive me if I sound like a weirdo, for I am.\nAs the title says, in light of the cyclist killed a couple of weeks ago at Avenue and Bloor, I decided to count cars and bikes there last Monday at around dinnertime.\nSpoilers, final count: 519 people on bike (and other micro-mobility) + 839 cars (and other larger motor vehicles) on Bloor, crossing the area just east of Avenue where the cyclist was killed.\nBefore 2019, Bloor St east of Avenue was still 4 lanes for cars, 2 each way, much like how Bloor/Danforth was from end to end years ago (with cars using the right lane for parking/stopping, regardless of if it was allowed at that time of day or not).\nToday, it\u2019s (more or less) 1 lane for car traffic each way. 1 lane is used for parking, where appropriate. And the final lane was more or less divided into the two bike lanes, one on each side.\nSome thoughts:\n-In terms of (very roughly calculated) efficiency, 1 lane divided into 2 bike lanes transported 519 people, while 2 lanes for cars transported 839 cars, or only 419.5 cars per lane. Meaning that at least about a quarter of the cars need to have double occupancy to match the efficiency of the bike lanes at transporting people.\n-My initial impression was that far fewer bikes were passing than cars, but was surprised to count so many bikes in the end. Perhaps cars simply take up more space and idle around longer, making it seem like there were more of them.\n-That part in front of the church is no bueno. Some cyclists go right of the right-turning cars, others go left. It needs the same treatment as what\u2019s happening west of Avenue: Raised and separated bike lanes.\n-While the eastbound bike count is about the same as the westbound count, it seems that significantly more cars head west at this section. Westbound Bloor thus widens into left-turn, straight, and right-turn lanes for cars.\n-There are some really cool-looking bikes out there. :)\n"

        "comment": "I am a senior citizen living on Bloor street, on the Etobicoke side of the Humber bridge. The new bike lanes go right by my building. I enjoy using them, and do so frequently, but I also drive on Bloor and am well aware of the traffic situation there. I\u2019ll comment on the latter below.\nWhile I generally feel much safer biking since the lanes went in, the most important point I want to emphasize is how the bike lanes on the Humber bridge have vastly improved the local Bloor street environment.\nPrior to the installation of the bike lanes, that stretch of Bloor had a major problem with traffic speeding, consistently well over the limit. The police would regularly set up there and ticket drivers, but this had no effect other than when police were actually present. No sane biker would risk their life on the bridge, with two lanes of speeding traffic in each direction. It was even worrisome being a pedestrian on the bridge, with traffic whizzing by right next to you, not to mention pedestrians dodging the bikes that had moved to the sidewalk there because the roads felt unsafe. Also, the constant noise from speeding cars was genuinely oppressive, whenever I would try to sit out on my balcony.\nSince the bike lanes went in, traffic now goes at a reasonable (and much less noisy) speed, walking over the bridge feels much safer, and bikers aren\u2019t taking their lives in their hands crossing the Humber river. And of course, Bloor is really the only place bikes can cross the river, so diverting bikes off Bloor isn\u2019t feasible.\nAs a driver, I\u2019m also well aware that eastbound traffic now backs up at rush hour from South Kingsway to the Humber Bridge. This certainly adds to the time it takes me to drive to Bloor West Village. Going downtown though, I actually find that commute times haven\u2019t significantly changed \u2013 congestion seems to have simply moved west to my neighbourhood from the High Park and Bloor West neighbourhoods, where traffic now runs more freely.\nBut to blame this all on the bike lanes is simplistic. One part of the problem is that we\u2019ve temporarily lost a lane due to condo construction on Bloor, west of Jane. But the real issue is that there is now a very short turning lane for traffic turning right onto South Kingsway. And when that lane fills up because of cars pausing for pedestrians, all eastbound traffic stops. There is surely room to greatly improve the design of that intersection, without eliminating the bike lanes. For example, the left turn lane (which gets little use) on Bloor for eastbound traffic services several streets to the west of South Kingsway. All those streets connect, so prohibiting left turns onto one of them and taking out that part of the left turn lane wouldn\u2019t stop residents turning into another of the streets. This would create room to lengthen the turning lane on Bloor leading to South Kingsway. Probably there are other ways to improve that intersection as well \u2013 my point is that the real problem is a single poorly designed intersection, that creates a bottleneck.\n"

        "comment": "Hey, this is really dumb.\nThe fundamental problem, setting aside the issues of safety and accessibility for cyclists, e-cyclists, scooter users, etc., is that there is an abundance of evidence that demonstrates that more vehicle lanes results in more traffic and more congestion.\nI could quote peer-reviewed articles here but that isn't even necessary. It's a matter of simple geometry:\nRoads are divided into lanes. Vehicles must remain within these lanes. The number of vehicles that will travel down a road is always orders of magnitude greater than the number of lanes on that road.\nNow, when you go from a 1 lane road to a 2-lane road, then you are in a sense doubling the capacity of that road. But every subsequent lane addition adds a rapidly decreasing quantity of capacity to a road.\nBut it's even worse than that. Road lanes in the same direction of travel are generally not discrete. Vehicles can change lanes. The more lanes there are, the more reasons there will be for vehicles to change lanes. Each act of changing lane creates the possibility of a disruption to the traffic flow. Each disruption to traffic flow will have a possibility to reduce the maximal speed at which traffic can flow.\nEven small, momentary speed reductions on roads can have huge overall consequences for congestion, as the speed reduction propagates backwards from the location of that reduction at a rate that is a function of the overall volume of traffic flow. If the volume is high, and the distance between vehicles is low as a result, then this can create huge knock-on effects that snowball dramatically.\nThe problem is that this event only needs to happen once per lane for the effect to be global to the road, and as soon as one lane becomes congested, cars will switch lanes, creating an increasing number of opportunities for the same thing to happen in all other lanes.\nAs lanes act as a multiplier to the overall volume of traffic possible on a road, and also act as a hard limit to the number of parallel flows of traffic on that road, then the severity of any congestion event grows exponentially with the total number of lanes. On a single lane road, congestion can only grow linearly.\nMulti-lane roads can create the illusion of congestion reduction while there are no events that impede traffic flow, but they possess the potential to create far greater congestion events when the conditions are met, while also increasing the number of opportunities for a congestion event to occur.\nBy removing cycle lanes to prioritize car lanes, while also removing agency from municipalities and burdening them with the cost of this loss of agency, you will make traffic and congestion exponentially worse across the province while also removing access for a form of transport that is far far more resilient to this kind of congestion. Bicycles, and other self-powered or e-powered forms of personal transportation are not required to move within given lanes for a direction of travel because these vehicles can safely and efficiently navigate obstacles and speed variations with minimal impact on the overall flow capability of a road.\nThe link is provided because you require one, and it provides another valid take on why more lanes are bad. but the above is intended to provide hopefully a clear explanation based on simple mathematical principles and common sense.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed changes regarding the removal or reduction of bike lanes in Ontario. As a citizen who both drives and bikes and is deeply concerned about traffic congestion and the economy, I urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead give the current bike lane infrastructure at least one more year to demonstrate its benefits. This investment is crucial for the safety of all Ontarians and aligns with the broader goals of promoting businesses and more efficient transportation.\n1. **Support from Local Businesses:**\nIt\u2019s important to recognize the positive impact that bike lanes can have on local businesses. On streets like Bloor, where bike lanes have already been implemented, there has been significant support from local businesses and the Bloor Business Improvement Area (BIA). Studies show that bike lanes increase foot traffic, which directly benefits retailers, restaurants, and service providers by bringing more customers into their stores. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop along bike-friendly routes, contributing to the local economy. Local business owners and associations such as the Bloor BIA have expressed strong support for bike lanes, recognizing that they help create vibrant, accessible, and economically thriving streetscapes. Removing bike lanes now would disregard the clear economic benefits that bike lanes offer to the businesses that rely on foot traffic and accessibility.\n2. **Cost of Removal and Financial Responsibility:**\nRemoving bike lanes that have only recently been installed represents a significant financial burden. The infrastructure and resources that have already been committed to creating these bike lanes \u2013 including planning, construction, and public outreach \u2013 would result in considerable costs if dismantled prematurely. Given the recent investments, it is both fiscally irresponsible and counterproductive to remove these lanes before they have had an opportunity to prove their worth. A more sensible approach would be to allow for at least one more year of operation to gather data, assess their impact, and make necessary adjustments based on feedback from the community. Bike lanes are a relatively new feature in many Ontario cities, and like any new infrastructure, they require time to adapt to evolving transportation patterns. It is essential that we allow these bike lanes a fair chance to succeed before making drastic changes.\n3. **Traffic Congestion:**\nWhile it is true that traffic congestion remains a significant issue in Ontario\u2019s urban centers, the reality is that traffic exists regardless of the presence of bike lanes. The growing volume of vehicles on our roads, combined with limited space for new infrastructure, makes it increasingly difficult to address congestion through traditional means such as widening roads or adding new lanes. Bike lanes provide an effective alternative that helps reduce the number of short car trips, freeing up space on the roads for drivers and reducing overall congestion. Instead of eliminating bike lanes, we should be focusing on making our roads more efficient for all modes of transportation, allowing drivers, cyclists, and transit riders to share the roads more safely and effectively.\n4. **Safety and Quality of Life:**\n   The primary concern when it comes to transportation policy should always be public safety. Bike lanes play an essential role in protecting cyclists from motor vehicles, reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities. Ontario has seen a rise in cycling activity, particularly in urban areas, and providing dedicated lanes is critical to ensuring these cyclists can travel safely. Without bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share lanes with vehicles, leading to dangerous situations for everyone on the road. For all Ontarians \u2013 whether they are drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians \u2013 prioritizing safety is fundamental to improving quality of life, reducing injuries, and creating communities where people can feel secure in their daily activities.\nIn conclusion, removing or reducing bike lanes in Ontario would be a step backward in terms of traffic management, fiscal responsibility, and safety. I urge you to allow these bike lanes to remain in place for at least one more year, giving them a fair opportunity to demonstrate their value. This approach is in the best interest of public safety, local communities, and the long-term sustainability of Ontario's transportation infrastructure.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

This was further solidified in the 2023 municipal election, where candidates that pledged to remove the bicycle lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University received a combined total of less than 15% of the vote.\nMeanwhile, the Province has not performed any analysis whatsoever to demonstrate that Bill 212 will decrease travel times by car. In fact, travel times by car may increase due to cyclists switching to driving (either by Uber or their personal vehicle), and drivers switching from transit due to the perception of increased road capacity downtown.\nMoreover, this legislation is in contradiction with previously approved legislation such as the Provincial Policy Statement and Places to Grow Act, both of which encourage the development of \"Complete Streets\" that provide residents with safe alternatives to driving.\nAdditionally, this legislation attempts to remove all environmental impact analysis from the 413, which at a cost of billions will provide minimal time savings, especially after the recent 401 widening in Mississauga. These billions could be better spent on actually reducing congestion, by expanding transit, such as the subway into Vaughan and Mississauga.\nThis act will be detrimental to cyclist safety while, without any study performed, will almost certainly increase  traffic congestion downtown. For all of the above stated reasons, I strongly oppose this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "I think the part of Bill 212 to relieve traffic congestion by restricting bike lane infrastructure and removing existing bike lanes is misguided and will actually lead to more traffic gridlock. Multiple studies in both North American and European cities have shown that well designed and well connected cycling infrastructure made up of dedicated protected bike lanes make people feel safer to cycle to work, school, or do errands. The same studies show that \u2018induced demand\u2019 is created by more traffic lanes as more people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive are now creating more automobile congestion by driving instead of using more environmental modes of transportation such as public transit or cycling. After spending a week in Montreal this past September both driving and cycling it was evident that it\u2019s extensive (over 1,800 kms), well connected and protected cycling infrastructure is very well used by many cyclists in every part of the island. These protected bike lanes have not only shown to reduce cyclist fatalities but slow drivers making right hand turns at intersections thus reducing pedestrian accidents and fatalities. (Journal of Urban Mobility)\nI\u2019m a renovation contractor who needs to drive for work, and recreational cyclist who lives in the north part of the city of Toronto near Yonge St. and Hwy 401. I would definitely take more trips by bicycle especially for errands if there were protected bicycle lanes in my area especially because cars coming off the highway tend to travel at much higher speeds than the posted 50km/hr. I appreciate the investment the Ontario Provincial Government is doing to create more public transportation infrastructure in Toronto such as the Crosstown LRT, Finch LRT,  and subway expansions in Scarborough, Yonge north and the Ontario Line. As these projects are still not operating and still under construction, leading to further lane reductions, we have not yet seen the reduction in automobile congestion that will happen once these projects come on line.  The provincial government needs to be more collaborative and work with and not against municipal governments and understand that a mix of transportation modes other than the automobile such as public transportation and bicycles relieve pressure on roadways so that goods and service vehicles can move around the city more efficiently and keep the economy moving.\n"

As an international student and regular cyclist in the city, I have serious concerns about the safety and accessibility implications of this proposal.\nFirst, as someone who relies on cycling for daily transportation due to financial constraints, the removal of dedicated bike lanes would force me to share regular traffic lanes with vehicles. This creates an unacceptable safety risk, particularly given the documented increase in aggressive driving incidents in Toronto. Recently, I witnessed a near-miss collision between a cyclist and a vehicle, highlighting the very real dangers cyclists face even with existing infrastructure.\nThe economic impact of this decision should not be overlooked. Many students and low-income residents depend on cycling as an affordable transportation option. Removing bike lanes effectively discriminates against those who cannot afford other modes of transport, myself included.\nFurthermore, Toronto's cycling network is still developing, and removing existing infrastructure is counterproductive to building a comprehensive, sustainable transportation system. The current bike lanes have demonstrated their value through regular usage, and their removal would be a significant step backward in Toronto's progression toward becoming a more sustainable and accessible city.\nIt is particularly concerning that this bill proposes to remove infrastructure that was only recently implemented. This represents not only a waste of previously invested public resources but also undermines the city's commitment to sustainable urban planning and climate action.\nI strongly urge the government to reconsider this aspect of Bill 212 and instead focus on expanding and improving cycling infrastructure. This would better serve the diverse transportation needs of Toronto's residents while promoting safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability.\nRemoving bike lanes will not effectively address gridlock; it will only make our roads more dangerous and less accessible for vulnerable road users while discouraging sustainable transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "This is a despicable bad-faith bill. It is a clear attempt at provincial overreach into municipal matters that is simultaneously trying to capitalize on a controversial transportation issue (bike lanes) to disguise a stab at funding for the 400-series highway expansion through the Greenbelt. Everything in this bill goes against all common sense for transportation and environmental sustainability.\nStudy after study shows that road widening does not solve congestion \u2014 the only solution is to provide MULTIPLE OPTIONS for people so that they have the FREEDOM OF CHOICE for how they choose to travel. Regarding the bike lane portion of the bill, blocking and/or removing new bike lanes on major roads will not change traffic congestion because:\n1) Many people will still bike\u2026 their safety will just be compromised. Since most shops and businesses are primarily located on major streets, cyclists will still need to travel on those streets to access these important destinations, with or without bike lanes. Since riding on the sidewalk is illegal, those who choose to bike will be forced into the traffic lanes, slowing traffic and endangering their own safety. Of course, some cyclists will avoid the areas altogether, which will ultimately add up to lost revenue for small businesses. Doug Ford claims to be for the working class and small businesses but his actions fly right in the face of that while he lines the pockets of major corporations and developers.\n2) Because of fear for their safety, some cyclists will choose to travel by car instead. This has the obvious effect of adding cars to the road, WORSENING congestion, increasing travel times, and causing more wear on our streets (i.e., ballooning infrastructure maintenance costs, which are already astronomically higher than the cost of any bike lane project). Plus, without the alternative routes/space provided by bike lanes, emergency vehicles will be stuck behind hundreds/thousands of idling cars and response times will continue to skyrocket.\nA similar argument can be made against the expansion of the 400-series highways, including the idiotic tunnel idea under the 401 and the extremely environmentally harmful 413. The cost of projects like these would be absurd and they wouldn\u2019t solve anything. The concept of induced demand has been proven time and time again, meaning after a year or so of slightly reduced travel times (at the cost of wildlife habitats and the provincial budget) drivers on a hypothetical sub-401 tunnel or the environmentally disruptive 413 will find themselves just as stuck as they already are on the existing 401 (already the widest highway in North America). The \u201cone more lane\u201d approach to transportation planning does not work. It\u2019s time to stop pandering to a car-dominant mentality wherein the movement of single-occupant vehicles is treated as more important than the movement of people. Ironically, no one wins in this design \u2014 even drivers lose. A FAR better use of that money would be to invest in high speed rail with regular service along the Windsor-Montr\u00e9al corridor and expansion of GO service to GTA-adjacent municipalities. This would take cars off the roads and free up travel space for those who still choose or need to drive. Transportation is about MOVING PEOPLE, NOT CARS, and the prioritization of alternative modes, like public and active transportation, makes that better for everyone \u2014 including those who to drive.\nThe direction that this government has chosen to take on these issues is disgusting, and Doug Ford\u2019s misguided obsession with governing Toronto (instead of Ontario) is obvious. He and his cronies should stay their proverbial lanes and leave municipal issues to the local governments who are best-positioned to enact transportation policies according to the specific needs of their constituents. I stand vehemently against this bill and hope we can throw it out along with the current provincial administration.\n"
