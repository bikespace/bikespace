As does frustration of drivers, leading to more road rage and erratic driving.\nThe new lanes on Yonge, Bloor, University and Eglinton are hard to navigate, have made the streets ugly with black and yellow warning signs, and are particularly treacherous for the mobility challenged when exiting a car to a car lane or bike lane. Those with walkers have to be so careful to walk from parked car to sidewalk, carrying heavy walker over medians.\nLastly, if bike lanes are meant to lead to safety, why have there been more bike deaths this year (6) than any prior year since records kept?\n"

        "comment": "This is a very strange piece of legislation. There are streets without bike lanes (like Dufferin Street, mostly at least) where the congestion is still terrible (even in off-peak hours). So, it seems that bike lanes are not to blame for congestion, rather the excessive amount of cars is to blame. That's why this legislation is so strange... As well, it would make much more sense to encourage people to use alternative forms of transportation. It would make more sense to improve the quality of public transportation so that there can be fewer cars on the road, which would improve traffic conditions, and this literally helps everyone (drivers, people who use public transportation, and cyclists). It's a win-win-win situation, instead of this legislation, which would end up making things worse for everyone in the long run. You are allowing more cars on the road in the long run, which will increase congestion. More car lanes don't fix congestion, they simply induce more cars to use the road, which will eventually just make traffic worse. There has to be more thought for the long-term gains for everyone rather than getting short-term gains for cars. I'm not sure why this legislation is being considered, because it is very poor legislation.\n"

The government should be funding more alternatives. We should be funding bike lanes expansion, bus lanes and other forms of transit. This will make our cities more liveable, enjoyable and help build a better sense of community. We need to make the cities in this province the envy of others in North America and not regress to post-war thinking.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Yonge St and Bloor St. (and anywhere where a lane is removed to accommodate for a bike lane) are causing nothing but traffic problems.  I live on Jackes Ave. and to turn either way on Yonge St. or to go straight through is very difficult and dangerous.  The majority of the people using the bike lanes are the food delivery people.  They all have electric scooters or e-bikes and they go very fast. I've witnessed 2 accidents. One was a scooter smashing into the door of a car as it slowly moved up to look for on-coming traffic before proceeding.  The other was a person walking across a bike lane from a sidewalk on Yonge St. and the e-bike was going too fast, slammed on his brakes but still hit the pedestrian.  The bike lanes must be removed, e-scooters should be regulated so that a motorcycle license and plates be required to use them, and then they cause regular car lanes instead of endangering themselves and others.\n"

        "comment": "Two points on this bill:\n1. There is no evidence that bike lanes increase traffic; in fact, most global evidence suggests that bike lanes ease traffic.\nThis bill is trying to punish cities which are trying to ease congestion and pollution + encourage public transportation.  Spend the public/taxpayers' money on supporting these sorts of initiatives not on blocking them -- yes, there will be short term pain, but much long term gain... look at the larger (and smaller) European cities which encourage biking, and many even have pedestrian only zones in their cores -- or a \"toll\" for cars to enter.  City car tolls make a lot of sense from a congestion perspective.\nFEWER CARS IN CITIES' CORES ALSO LEADS TO FEWER ACCIDENTS.\n2. This bill also exempts Highway 413 from all environmental assessment regulations and requirements.\nTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WE EXPECT BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, PROTECTION AND ACTION from this government FOR/ON A PROVEN WATERSHED AND PROTECTED ECOSYSTEM.  If you continue to proceed with all the clearcutting and building as it has been over the past few years we will continue to see an increase in major damage to the some of the province's treasured publicly stewarded ecosystems and all the badly planned building -- with no regard for the environment and ecosystems, let alone proper infrastructure supports/capacities -- will not only  affect nature but also damage the newly poorly constructed buildings.  The illegal clearcutting this government is doing is abominable and a blow to the beauty of our province.  We need to build up and ensure that the all public infrastructure is sufficiently funded to support the proper and safe delivery of public utilities and other services.\n"

However not university.\nSide streets should be bicycle highways, for example Harbord Street should be a bicycle highway.\nCyclists use Shaw Street for example. It\u2019s more pleasurable to bike on.\nFocus on making bike highways on side streets if you\u2019re removing them from main driving arteries.\nAlso keep boring the ontario line and turn it north towards dufferin, one of the busiest bus routes in the city. Connect it north. Would help immeasurable.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is extremely regressive. Not only does it represent a significant overreach by the province into an area that should be left to municipalities, but it also directly contradicts the consensus among academics and planning professionals regarding bike infrastructure. Quality, separated bike lanes are widely recognized as part of the solution to congestion, not a cause. Additionally, the idea that major streets should be reserved for motorists is misguided. Major streets\u2014particularly those with numerous amenities\u2014generate high transportation demand, hence the higher congestion on those streets. Cycling lanes, which can move high volumes of people more efficiently in terms of space than car lanes, are especially effective at reducing congestion in these corridors.\n"

        "comment": "Thanks for looking into this. Not everyone wants to live in a skyscraper and ride their bike or take transit. Not everyone can.\nPeople who are averse to transit, some also rely heavily on couriers and taxis for their shopping, takeout food, and convenience of travel when they want. That\u2019s a lot of extra vehicles on the road too!\nThere may be a need for things to change in terms of traffic, but it\u2019s being done too fast. Canada has ice and snow, and it just can\u2019t all get cleared or salted soon enough to make alternate affordable transit possible for many. Public transit coverage is terrible in some outlying areas, where lots of taxpaying citizens live too.\nNeed to wake up and realize that squeezing out vehicles is damaging to many people.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am both a driver and a cyclist. I regularly use the bicycle lanes year-round in my city. As a cyclist, these lanes provide me with a safe separation from vehicles, and have allowed me to cycle to and from work much more regularly, particularly in poor weather (thereby removing my own vehicle from traffic). As a driver, I MUCH prefer to drive next to a separated bike lane, than to drive next to cyclists where there is no bike lane. As a driver, it is quite stressful to drive next to cyclists where they are not protected by a lane.\nHere\u2019s the thing the government does not understand: cyclists will still be using these roads even if there is no bike lane. It will simply be more dangerous for them, and for drivers. My friend was very recently struck while cycling on a road where there was no bike lane. I myself am regularly cut off or nearly killed by ignorant drivers. Bike lanes increase safety and help get people\u2019s cars off the roads.\nI find it disgusting that the government values my life so little. I believe these kinds of bills and this kind of rhetoric amplifies the views and encourages the dangerous actions of those who aggressively drive around cyclists.\nI find it disgusting that the provincial government wants to interfere in municipal matters that are not within its purview or jurisdiction. Let cities and municipalities decide what they want to do with their own roads.\nThis bills should not be passed. The provincial government has no business telling cities what to do.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes won't remove the gridlock. This will exasperate the problem not solve it.\nBuilding up the protection designs for those bike lanes to make them safer so more people will feel comfortable using them will reduce the traffic problem.\nWaterloo Region has some great safe bike lane designs that other cities, such as Toronto, should embrace. There are many countries that have used alternative vehicle usage to solve their gridlock issues. Additional bike lanes are a solution that also stops cars and trucks from speeding in these areas of shared roads.\nGetting people out of their cars and into public transit or on their bikes will reduce the gridlock.\nAlso we don't need nor want the 413 highway. This will not save time. The damage that it will cause to this precious environment will be irreversible. Roads, non-agricultural businesses, and housing should not be built on these lands. The Province should not be enriching pockets of the builders to the detriment of our Ontario lands.\n"
