        "comment": "To begin with, this is a serious overreach by the provincial government.\nOn the topic of the bill itself, I do not support this.  There is no reason to believe that removing bike lanes will improve traffic congestion in Toronto.  Cities that have less of a congestion issue also have better public transit and active transit infrastructure - including bicycle lanes.  In order for us to be a world class city, we need more bike lanes, not fewer.\n"

        "comment": "How could someone look at the bike lanes and think taking them out would reduce traffic? The whole point of these lanes is to reduce the number of people driving, and giving them an alternative way to getting around the city. If these lanes are removed, it will do nothing but congest the roads and put bikers AND drivers in more dangerous situations. That's not even mentioning how absurd it is to rip these fresh lanes out, and repaving the roads all on the taxpayers dollar. All this before proper funding for Ontario healthcare? This is such a non issue, and lately I feel ashamed to be an Ontario resident with Doug Ford pulling these insane passion projects out of his behind. Do better Doug.\n"

Wasting millions of dollars and years over the wet dream of the premier on Ontario. The best way for Doug and his cronies to learn about why bike lanes are so important for the city of Toronto, is to take their car away and see how safe it feels to bike right next to trucks everyday as a way to commute. That is if they even have the physical capability of biking that far since most of them just sit around all day.\n"

        "comment": "We must save our bike lanes and invest more in bike lanes on main city arteries. Healthy cities are built around people, not cars. Instead of potentially ripping up existing bike infrastructure and forcing city planning to focus bike lanes on side streets ignores the very serious issue of road safety and congestion in the city. Biking is healthier, more friendly, better for the environment, better for the surrounding economy, more affordable, takes up less space, is quieter. The list goes on and on. Let\u2019s not make one of the biggest mistakes in our province\u2019s history by empowering leaders to approach city planning from a car centric point of view. World class European cities de-prioritize cars, and focus on walkable and billable cities. As a young professional living in the city I do not support this bill.\n"

Public transit and Bike Lanes Should be the main priority downtown toronto and in other major cities, not Private cars and trucks.\nThe People of Ontario do not want highway 413 its a poorly planned route. Put more effort into fixing congestion by opening up space at major highway cross roads like 401 and dvp or 401 and 401 or 401 west of 400.\n"

More cars = More gridlock.\nIn the future, there will only be more people and the roads in the city can only get so wide.  You need to offer options i.e. bikes.\nSince biking is so prominent in advanced countries, people come her as tourists Because they can bike around safely.\nIf you build it, they will come.  This is no more true than with bike lanes.  If it is unsafe to go around on your bike, you won't.  If it is safe, and people feel safe, they will go out on their bikes more often and further.\nNot everyone can afford a car.\nBiking is healthier and therefore saves on OHIP (unless there are no bike lanes and the bikers get hurt!!).\nRefuse this bill as it just Make No Sense.\nThanks!\n"

        "comment": "Taking away bike lanes is only going to add more cars to the road (for cyclists that return to driving), further endanger cyclists that continue to want to ride, and add more pollution.\nThis doesn't solve congestion problems, it just causes more problems.\nLook at models in European cities where bicycles can be a strong compliment to commuter options, and don't cause additional congestion for drivers.\nInvesting in better transit would also further reduce the need for as many cars on the roads.\nLastly, using tax dollars from the entire province to fund removal of existing infrastructure in Toronto takes money away from many municipalities that have lacking public transit infrastructure\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this proposal because removing bike lanes, especially on busy streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University, will likely lead to more cars on the road, not less, worsening gridlock. Research consistently shows that dedicated bike lanes reduce congestion by encouraging people to bike instead of drive. For example, a study from Transportation Research (2020) found that cities with more bike infrastructure see a measurable decrease in car traffic and associated gridlock. Similarly, a Journal of Urban Planning (2019) article reported that bike lanes keep cyclists separate from vehicle lanes, which leads to smoother traffic flow and fewer disruptions for drivers.\nAs a driver myself, I prefer to bike when possible, but if these bike lanes are removed, I\u2019ll be forced to drive, adding another car to the road. Maintaining bike lanes supports those who choose alternatives to driving, which in turn reduces traffic volume, parking demand, and air pollution\u2014all of which are beneficial to Toronto\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n"

        "comment": "I can\u2019t understand why the Ford government would remove existing bike lanes. So much waste. All this government does is waste money removing new/existing infrastructure like bike lanes, EV chargers and paying millions to get out of existing contracts & projects. The government seems to love to waste taxpayer money:\n\u201cThe Ford government's alcohol expansion policies cost Ontario taxpayers $225 million to end an exclusivity contract, for beer and wine to be sold in corner stores.\u201d\n\u201cProvincial documents show the Ford government spent more than $230 million to cancel renewable energy projects that included a partially-built wind farm in a cabinet minister's riding.\u201d\nThere are so many examples, and that\u2019s not even mentioning the Greenbelt scandal or the attempts to buy votes for the next election.\n\u201cOntario government says it will send a $200 rebate cheque to roughly 15 million people in the province. The announcement Tuesday comes as Premier Doug Ford has hinted he could call an early election in 2025\u201d\nThis government is nothing but a buck-a-beer party making things up as they go along. Flamboyant Ford needs to go.\nFamed economist Thomas Sowell had a great line about how politicians try to con the public into voting for them. \u201cFirst you take the people\u2019s money quietly,\u201d he said, \u201cand then you give some of it back to them flamboyantly.\u201d\n"

To use city money to destroy biking infrastructure is unconscionable and endangers the lives of so many, negatively impacting the daily quality of life of for thousands more. Doug Ford will be complicit for the harm/deaths of many if this legislation is passed. The ideology behind the proposal is NOT rooted in science or principles of civil engineering, those in politics will have to deduce the true motivations behind this legislation. As a Torontonian who loves this city and works every day to try to help people within Ontario please do not harm our city please do not take away our beloved bike lanes.\n"

Rather than micromanaging bike lanes, the Ministry of Transportation could focus on accelerating its own approval processes to help support new housing.\nThere have been recent examples of unintended consequences when the province has tried to take over local decision-making. We urge the province to respect local decision-making when considering transportation improvements, and not repeat its mistakes of the past\n"
