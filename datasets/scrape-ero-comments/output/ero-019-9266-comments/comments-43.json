        "comment": "Hello!\nWe support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nI feel quite embarrassed and sad for the policy designers who have to write bad policy, based on emotion, hatred and jealousy - all in order to distract the voters from the real problems (i.e. the province inability to actually get people moving by investing in regional transportation solutions, and not being able to actually get a project completed in time or in budget! yuck!).\nM4J\n"

        "comment": "There are so many reasons why this is a massively bad idea. First of all, the evidence does not support the notion that bike lanes cause congestion. We know they don\u2019t. Bike lanes support reduced congestion, they make our streets safer for everyone, they improve public health outcomes, they reduce health care costs, and they spur economic growth. I\u2019m guessing that the policy analysts reading this know all of that already and are just as frustrated as the rest of us. To the Ford staffers coming up with these idiotic notions: stop playing politics with the health and safety of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycle Lane Removal is Not a Provincial Issue & Will Not Solve Traffic Woes:\nWe should not allow the province to meddle in affairs pertaining to bicycle lanes, as it is an inherently local issue. If the municipality where a bicycle lane is installed is negatively affected by a bicycle lane then it will be in its own best interest to remove said bicycle lane. This bill only serves to take power away from residents from affecting their direct community, and give it to out-of-towners who will treat their neighbourhood as a pass-through. Residents have elected municipal leaders answer the question whether or not a bicycle lane should be built, why give this power to the province.\nFurthermore, if the question is whether removing bicycle lanes will solve congestion in our province, there is no evidence that it will. We must wake up to the fact that you cannot fit millions of Ontarians in their own personal vehicles, if we want to build dense, world-class cities. They are simply not space efficient. The only way to improve commute times and congestion is to give viable alternatives to driving.\nI hope that we do not waste any more time squabbling about the removal of bike lanes to fix congestion when we really need to be investing in building a stronger public transit network. Bike lanes, when built in a complete network (which they are not at the moment, even in Toronto) will reduce the load on roads coming from local travel.\nCheers!\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is counter to the credible research on bike lanes, traffic congestion management, road safety, and overall livability and systemic health impacts of additional motor vehicles in cities. In short, it is bad policy.\nAs a voter, I would campaign against any government that puts our health at risk for politics. As a city dweller, I support research based policy that improves the health, ease of mobility, and environment of its citizens. Please do not enact this bill - there are many better ways to improve traffic congestion, from investing in transit, building more bike lanes, investing in intensification, and very simple traffic grid and regulation measures that are much more cost efficient and have positive side effects.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to give the provincial government both future and retroactive decision making powers over the installation of new or removal of existing bicycle lanes is an egregious overstep of provincial authority. Not only does it fly in the face of the conversation governments more typical ideals of not overextending government reach, it puts the provincial government into a position where they are not the most properly equipped authority to make these decisions.\nLocal roads and how they are constructed, maintained, and adjusted should fall in the hands of the municipal government alone. This is where the most on the ground knowledge about the workings, traffic flow, and needs of a municipality's citizens exists.\nNot only that, but as a resident of a municipality this provincial oversight takes what should be an issue for localized debate and discussion and makes it out of reach for the average citizen to engage in due process when it comes to matters that directly affect their lived experience in their municipality. In situations where the installation of a bicycle lanes becomes particularly contentious, it now becomes an election issue at the provincial level rather than the municipal - a change that effectively makes voting on the issue a moot point by giving the power to alter these decisions mostly to representatives who live outside and know nothing about a municipality.\nAside from all these issues that affect citizens power regardless of their view on bicycle lanes, as a daily user and someone who has read about and experienced cycling infrastructure around the world, I find the negative view of bicycle lanes  these bill takes to be particularly offensive. There is endless data both here in Ontario and from cities around the world that shows taking away bicycle lanes will not improve traffic flow for more than a couple years at best. We all know this from highway building as well, the more lanes you build, the more cars will appear to fill them in. In fact there are cases even where adding bicycle lanes has improved drive times by allowing space to be created for left turn lanes so that through traffic is no longer blocked. Bicycle lanes also help calm traffic in city areas where cars are moving too fast in areas shared by pedestrians. Removing lanes will almost certainly result in increased fatalities.\nPlease, I implore you, put this effort, money, and focus into changes that will improve traffic. Get out mass transit projects finished and start more of them! Figure out how to encourage less car use rather than more! Bicycle lanes are not a provincial matter, but Intercity transit is. Build ways to get people moving, not just creating more spaces to eventually be clogged with more cars. This is 1950's era thinking, and the decades since have long proved the promise of highways to be a falsehood.\n"

        "comment": "I'm an avid urban cycling commuter and in my family, we mostly travel by bike, public transportation and the occasional carshare and having the infrastructure in place can mean life or death.\nWhile it is well-intentioned for the Ford government to reduce gridlock, I find this proposal to be disingenuous because bike lanes are not the cause of gridlock. Too many cars and spaces for parked cars is the root cause of traffic. The busiest highways in Toronto - the 401, the Gardener, and the Don valley - none of them have bike lanes but they are extremely backed up because cars are space inefficient and too many of them in one place will cause gridlock.\nTo truly reduce gridlock, we need to provide viable alternatives to driving - like safe infrastructure for bikes on main roads, like public transit and options to WFH. The fact that none of this is mentioned in this proposed bill means that traffic issues will continue and what this bill does will be to further sprawl, reduce the number of cyclists, and potentially increase cycling deaths and injuries due to lack of safe infrastructure.\nBill 212 exists to boost driving and cars, even if they are electric, cause a great deal of environmental damage. Air pollution, noise pollution, and microplastic pollution are all increased when car use is boosted.  Therefore, Bill 212 must be amended because we all want to keep Ontario moving and that means that we need true alternatives to driving - like the current system where bike infrastructure is decided by municipalities and free from red tape from the provincial government.\n"

The creation of bike lanes has been very important at improving the safety on the roads for my children who use their bikes to go school. In fact I am hoping that the further creation of more bike lanes will continue to improve the safety. Municipalities are best placed to determine which roads would best support bike lanes. Not the provincial government. Please allow the cities to continue to be able to make this important decision that can save lives in addition to the other benefits including with the environment and reducing car traffic on the roads.

I have a car that I use it for errands, and when necessary, but getting around the city is most efficient by bike. Traffic is not caused by bike lanes. It is caused by cars.\nI have used bike lanes in every corner of the city and they have provided me the ability to enjoy the city without contributing to gridlock. Removing these lanes is short sighted and will do nothing to improve gridlock. Forcing me to get into my car to enjoy my city will only make gridlock worse. All people deserve to enjoy the city.\nCyclists like me are already second class citizens, having to face the dangerous drivers in this city even with the relative safety of the meagre bike lanes. Removing them will only put us in more danger and increase the likelihood of collisions. If we want to be a world class city, we should be building more not fewer bike lanes.\nPlease do something better with your time and money and scrap this legislation.

It should be constitutionally entrenched so that future governments cannot rescind it without 2/3 super majority of Ontarians via referendum.\nThis piece of legislation does need more strength though. My commute is now 95-100 minutes each way for a 50km commute here in Ottawa. That is, a 100km round trip to work each day taking me over a combined 3 hours. It used to be 40-45 minutes each way. Since 2020 the number of bike lanes has exploded. Furthermore, the other big issue is all the varying speed limits. It\u2019s insane. Municipalities should not be allowed to lower speed limits below 50kmh without provincial consent. All other speed limits should be increased above that number in order to keep commerce and people moving. This province is a train wreck and needs to end the war on the car being waged by municipalities and NGOs.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation will Kill People. People need to get places, be that by car, or bike, or transit or walking. But just one of these travel options is killing hundreds and injuring tens of thousands of people in Ontario every year.\nMotor vehicles make our streets dangerous to people walking and cycling. If people are to be able to use the public streets, as is their right, something needs to be done about this danger. Bike lanes provide that protection to allow people to bike places. That means fewer cars on the road and fewer deaths caused by drivers.\nYou can't simply push cyclists onto side streets and expect that they won't still need to use the main roads. The main roads are main roads for a reason. They are often the only way to travel longer distances, as side streets are meandering, or dead ends, or don't have bridges to cross rivers, highways, train tracks etc. They need to be used to go places. And speaking of places, many main roads are where the places (shops, restaurants, etc) that people want to go to are located. They're also where new zoning by-laws are pushing the most density. So you've got the highest concentration of people living without cars, and all the destinations they would like to go to on these streets, but they cannot safely use them unless they use a car?\nPeople will still bike on these main roads even without bike lanes (albeit far fewer people than if there were bike lanes), and many of them will be killed because they were not given a safe way to do so. And in addition to that, even more people will decide not to bike, because it is not safe, and they will instead drive. More cars on the road will not \"solve traffic\" - you need to get people out of their cars - you need to give them ways to do that. It's the only way to actually reduce traffic congestion, not more lanes, not more cars.\n"

        "comment": "The Bill212 Reducing Gridlock Act seems under developed, not fact based, and encroaches on the power of the municipalities to make their own decisions about their own transportation needs. Experts in the field of sustainable transportation and traffic, in Canada and around the world agree that bike lanes reduce gridlock. They add downtown business revenue, increase a healthier lifestyle, reduce noise, pollution, as well as congestion in cities. Why would the On government take a different stance? This act is not in the best interest of Ontarians. It doesn't take the climate crisis into account. Public transportation and reducing car centric modality in cities in Ontario are helpful towards a healthier population, and a healthier future.\n"

Adding another car lane is never the solution and if we want to prioritize green living and reducing emmissions, we should be building as many bike lanes as we can and prioritizing that mode of transportation. It's clean, it takes up less space than driving, and it has a much lighter impact on the roads than cars do, leading to reduced surface degradation, longer lasting roads, and less plastic tire wear on the ground and in the air.\nThis bill will not do anything that it sets out to do and it will only harm the standards of living and the environment around. We should be building better safer cycling infrastructure quicker, not hamstringing it in political red-tape.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment\nThe EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\n- Urban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\n  * Air quality at street level where people walk and bike\n  * Noise levels that affect mental and physical health\n  * Safe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\n  * Access to sustainable transportation options\n  * Street-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\n  * Overall quality of life in our communities\n- Bike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\n  * Creating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\n  * Reducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\n  * Decreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\n  * Enabling active transportation that improves public health\n  * Building more livable, human-scaled urban environments\n  * Supporting sustainable urban development patterns\n  * Providing equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\n1. Contradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals\nYour SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\n- Contradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\n- Creates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\n- Prioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\n- Undermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\n- Contradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\n- Places an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\n2. Environmental Assessment Concerns\nWhile the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n- \"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n- \"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n- \"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n- \"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\n- Air quality impacts\n- Stormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\n  * Oil and gasoline leaks\n  * Tire particles and microplastics\n  * Brake dust and heavy metals\n  * Road salt and de-icing chemicals\n  * Sediment and debris\n- The cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\n- The relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\n3. Climate Change Obligations\nYour SEV specifically commits to:\n- \"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n- \"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n- \"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\"\nThe proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\n4. Evidence-Based Decision Making\nThe proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\n- Ignores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\n- Creates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\n  * Only bike lanes must be justified with data\n  * No similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\n  * Municipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\n  * The default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\n- Overlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\n  * Reduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\n  * Significantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\n    - Cardiovascular disease\n    - Sleep disturbance\n    - Cognitive impairment in children\n    - Mental health impacts\n    - Reduced property values\n  * Improved public health outcomes through active transportation\n  * Enhanced road safety for all users\n  * Economic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\n    - Increased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\n    - Higher property values on calmer, more livable streets\n    - Reduced road maintenance costs\n    - Greater neighborhood desirability\n  * More equitable transportation access\n5. Municipal Planning Integration\nYour SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\n- Undermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\n- Creates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\n- May discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\n- Could delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\n1. Revise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\n   - Environmental benefits (both natural and urban)\n   - Public health impacts\n   - Safety improvements\n   - Economic effects on local businesses and communities\n   - Accessibility enhancements\n   - Climate change mitigation potential\n   - Integration with existing transportation networks\n2. Ensure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\n   - Reflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\n   - Consider both immediate and long-term impacts\n   - Account for municipal transportation master plans\n   - Include environmental and health metrics\n   - Support the achievement of provincial climate targets\n   - Recognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\n3. Modify the data collection requirements to:\n   - Include metrics beyond just traffic flow\n   - Consider seasonal variations in cycling usage\n   - Account for induced demand in both driving and cycling\n   - Measure safety improvements and public health outcomes\n   - Evaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\n"

Better, more frequent and inexpensive transit would also reduce traffic congestion.\nActual enforcement of traffic laws for cars (blocking intersections at lights), speeding, unsafe lanes changes, these would help more than banning bike lanes.\nLook at the actual data of cities that embrace active transportation (bikes, walking).
