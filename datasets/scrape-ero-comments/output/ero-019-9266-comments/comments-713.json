        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. While it claims to improve transportation, it neglects the reality that 44% of Toronto residents are utility cyclists (City of Toronto, 2019). With the increasing costs of living, fewer and fewer people can afford to drive a car. By not going into debt to drive cars we can't afford, we are more able to contribute back to the local economy. Additionally, traffic congestion in Toronto has been a problem pre-dating bike lanes, and with cuts to TTC service, cycling is one of the easiest, most reliable ways to commute around the city.\nBill 212 treats cyclists like second class citizens who are undeserving of a reasonable amount of safety. This infrastructure puts in place the legally required 1 meter distance that cars have to give cyclists. Without these partitions, cars regularly encroach on cyclists causing frequent accidents. As a cyclist who has been hit by cars twice, I would know. Both of these accidents happened on streets with no bike lane when a car swerved into me.\nBike lanes provide critical infrastructure that enable people to commute around Toronto in an effective, safe, and cost effective way\u2014and they cost taxpayers nothing to leave in place, but $48 million dollars to remove. Leave them alone.\n"

        "comment": "the proposed changes to the highway traffic act would restrict the ability of a municipality to regulate the flow of traffic within a neighbourhood in their town/city, which deprives local citizens of a right to be heard at the local level about movement of traffic in their community.\nIn a town as densely populated as Toronto (where I live, in the core at Sherbourne St & Bloor St East) this change to the highway traffic act, unfairly prioritizes one type of traffic over all the other surging types of traffic in my neighbourhood, at a time when we desperately need complete streets that deal with the reality that we have surging traffic of all types, and sometimes, on an urgent basis to respond to emerging issues as they arise.\nAmple bike lanes and ample pedestrian walkways, together with transit helps to ensure that we are enabling the most traffic flow while also prioritizing motorways for emergency services etc. In order to further prioritize motorways for emergency services while prioritizing all traffic types, an increase and re-prioritizing of non-motorized traffic should be the focus. The proposed changes which blatantly prioritize motorized traffic do not take into account the needs of local residents, and appear unconstitutional or unfair which may give rise to a charter challenge (e.g. section 7 - security of person perhaps, if the prioritization of motor vehicle traffic at the municipal level, and the restriction of municipalities' ability to respond nimbly to traffic planning issues results in safety issues to the individual residents).\n"

        "comment": "That we citizens of Toronto are at risk of loosing our bike lanes on account of Ontario's policy is deeply disturbing. In addition to the abundance of readily available data challenging the provincial government's statistics linking bike lanes to gridlock, I get no sense that tearing out bike lanes contributes to building a city for the future \u2013 a healthy city that offers alternatives aligned with environmentally responsible decisions.  And frankly, I get no sense that this vision serves my personal interests in any way. It is a blow to what has been for a few short years, a benefit of living in Toronto.  I'm a taxpaying citizen, i.e., a contributor to the building of those bike lanes. I want my money back!\nI drive when I have to but first consider walking, public transit, and best of all, my bicycle. Because of the bike lanes, I can safely ride to work and to most of my local destinations. That's my idea of progressive development! Without the bike lanes, the fatality rate of cyclists will only increase as our city's population increases.  I too want to live my senior years as my husband's parents did when they were 80+ years \u2013 and able to safely cycle throughout their small city in Germany.\nIt's embarrassing that as the majority of the developed world focuses on how to mitigate damage to the environment, the opposite is being done with Bill 212. Shame, it is the 3rd item of value [Ontario Place, the Science Centre] that the current Conservative government in Ontario is taking away from me. My tax dollars at work? Nope, not for me.\n"

        "comment": "I don't support this Bill as I believe this change will be detrimental to traffic, increasing likelihood of accidents involving cyclists and vehicles and/ or pedestrians as, A) there could be confusion on the roads and sidewalks from cyclists having to ride alongside and against traffic flow on the street, causing collisions. B) In the winter months, where there is an increased likelihood of accidents on the road due to snow and ice, cyclists would be more at risk of accidents involving cars if there are no designated bike lanes. C) The removal of bike lanes will cause more traffic rather than less traffic as cars AND bikes will have to share the same lane, and drivers will need to adhere to traffic laws involving cyclists. In addition, the removal of bike lanes may deter people from choosing cycling as a way to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential part of the city. Any and ALL bike lanes offer accessibility to all Torontonians and visitors to the city. To remove any single bike line is to reinforce that one must be wealthy in order to travel the city freely and with ease. The TTC is limited in its operations (and needs to be addressed), but bike lanes offer a more equal approach to transit for many. Bikes are relatively inexpensive, easy to store, have lower maintenance costs, and take up far less space than cars, trucks, and busses on the road. Not to mention the obvious: bikes aren\u2019t puffing out chemicals that we can\u2019t avoid inhaling when they are around.\nThe province\u2019s fight against congestion is not with cyclists but with cars and trucks. Restricting vehicle access and increasing pedestrian access has been proven to increase economic growth. Read the studies, listen to consumers and business owners.\nIn addition to increasing movement within the city, bike lanes offer a near-zero emission method of transportation. As this current government continues to outright ignore and increase the speed at which our environment and planet are deteriorating, Ontarians are being offered less and less, and often restricted from using, daily methods of existing that can reduce our environmental impact.\nNot to mention the massive waste of money that this will cost to remove bike lanes and the additional congestion the the construction will create is irresponsible and an attack on the livelihood of Ontarians. The Ford government has been embarrassingly proud of its work stripping social services and the healthcare system literally killing Ontarians. The cost of removing these bike lanes shouldn\u2019t even be considered something that WE can afford. We need housing, healthcare, public transportation, and so many more well-funded social services. Bike lanes are a social service. Bike lanes are part of public health. Bike lanes are one of the great connections and equalizers for Ontarians.\nTo paraphrase a quote from a former Colombian mayor: A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It\u2019s where the rich use public transportation.\nIn this economic hellscape where the rich are getting richer at the cost of the destruction of the middle class and the punishment of the poor, bike lanes are one of the few public spaces where all are welcome regardless of their socio-economic status.\nOntarians deserve a government that cares. And unfortunately we haven\u2019t had that in a long time. But to see this government intentionally punish Ontarians to favour cars and trucks is an insult.\nDoug Ford isn\u2019t even trying to hide the fact that he\u2019s in the pocket of corporate interests and that he doesn\u2019t know how to act in the interest of Ontarians. He\u2019s is negligent and a danger to the province of Ontario and to the evolution of this province and this country. He and his party members should be ashamed of themselves and should actually speak to their constituents to see what we want. The man is a fool \u2014 no question about it \u2014 and his decision to remove bike lanes is just another bingo stamp on the \u2018our premier doesn\u2019t care about us, just his rich friends\u2019 bingo card that we Ontarians have had the misfortune of carrying around with us since 2018.\n"

The Ford government is ignoring that the bike lanes that  they want to rip out were put there to SAVE LIVES. It\u2019s simply a proven fact that putting bicycles in a separate bike lane keeps people safer.\u201cStudies in Montr\u00e9al, Toronto and Vancouver have found that bike lanes and cycle tracks reduce the risk of bicycle accidents by 14% to 31%.\u201d (CAA: Breaking the Bottlenecks). When I walk past the highschool in my neighborhood, which is very close to where Ford wants to rip out bike lanes, the bike racks are full. If this bill is to pass, these kids will be put at risk, or forced off the roads. Additionally, there are scores of delivery drivers who need those bike lanes to do their job safely. As well, when I drive, I DO NOT WANT bikes in the same lane as me. Just because I am in a car doesn\u2019t mean I want bikers to feel and be unsafe. Apparently Ford does not share this same sentiment. However, being Premier doesn\u2019t mean you squash the wants and needs of the citizens you are supposed to represent in favor of your personal desires.\nWhich leads to my next point being, removing bike lanes WILL NOT solve congestion problems. It has been shown time and time again that expanding roadways does not improve congestion. In fact \u201cunder certain conditions road capacity expansions may induce growth in traffic volumes.\u201d(Science Direct) Induced demand from expanded roadways is in no way a new concept. The provincial Government ignoring these facts is willful ignorance at best. However, with how readily available the literature is, I\u2019m inclined to think this is malicious intent. Further, according to the CAA\u2019s Congestion Solutions for Canada, separate bike lanes are actually one of the recommended solutions!\nI will not have the provincial government wasting my tax dollars to rip out the infrastructure that makes my life better. It\u2019s a massive waste of money for something that WILL NOT FIX CONGESTION. Ford has done nothing to prove that this is any sort of actual solution, and the actual research done in this area opposes him.\n"

It shows wanton disregard\u00a0for the people of Ontario and the millions of tourists who visit Toronto every year.\n\u00a0\nQuestions for Premier\u00a0Ford:\n- *Why is the provincial government\u00a0proposing to step on the mandate of a municipality?* Mayor Chow and Toronto City Council, who represent\u00a0the residents of Toronto, have formally expressed\u00a0opposition to Bill 212:\u00a0https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2024.CC23.1 How do you respond to their\u00a0formal opposition?\n- 120 physicians\u00a0 and researchers at the University\u00a0of Toronto have opposed Bill 212. These include emergency medicine , trauma, surgery, anesthesiology, intensive care, rehabilitation, psychiatry, pediatrics and family medicine doctors, all \u00a0who bear witness to the trauma inflicted on pedestrians, cyclists and the drivers of motor vehicles due to traffic-related injuries. I.e., 120 experts in human health and safety. *How have you taken the health and safety of Ontario's residents, including cyclists and pedestrians, into consideration with the \" Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time \" Act?*\n- As physicians have stated, \"among survivors [of road collisions and accidents] the horrific consequences of motor vehicles hitting pedestrians, cyclists and people in other vehicles are difficult to imagine.\u00a0Brain injuries that fundamentally change personalities, memories and cognition; torn spinal cords\u00a0that commit people to\u00a0lifelong ventilatory support; scars from surgeries;\u00a0post-traumatic stress disorder\u00a0from both the trauma and the care required to help people survive.\u00a0These patients spend weeks and months in hospital, and often never return to work or school.\u00a0https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\n- So far in 2024, 14 motorists, 3 motorcyclists, 6 cyclists and 18 pedestrians\u00a0 are dead, never to be seen by their friends\u00a0and family again, due to traffic related\u00a0 trauma. (source: https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation\u2026\u00a0 ) Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act states that \"accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\" - yes, they can also lead to the loss of life of Ontarians, such as was the tragic fate of the 24 year old woman killed on July 25, 2024 \u00a0when a\u00a0construction bin blocked the bike lane at Bloor Street, near Avenue Road, forcing her to merge into traffic whereby she was hit by a large commerical vehicle.

With bikes in a separate lane, drivers are less likely to have to deal with problems navigating around people, and a more predictable flow of traffic can go forward. It makes no sense for the province to need to have a say on bike lanes for a particular city or town, as it's an issue of local traffic, unless they're being put on highways.

While I myself predominantly commute by car, both of my sons use the Bloor bike lanes in their daily commute to school, and I am deeply concerned about the potential impact of Bill 212.\nFirst and foremost, my concern is for the safety of cyclists. The existing bike lanes provide an essential buffer between cyclists and the heavy traffic that we know can be dangerous. For many cyclists, especially children and teenagers, these protected lanes are not just a convenience but a vital safety feature. Without these lanes, they will be forced to share narrow roads with speeding cars, trucks, and buses, which increases the risk of accidents and injuries. I don't want my sons to become another grim statistic.\nI am also concerned about the costs of removing already-established bike infrastructure. The resources invested in creating these bike lanes, both financially and in terms of urban planning, would be wasted if they are dismantled. More importantly, there is the cost of reversing progress \u2014 removing bike lanes would not only disrupt commuting patterns for many residents but also discourage future investments in alternative transportation options. In a city as congested as Toronto, it is counterproductive to dismantle infrastructure that encourages sustainable mobility.\nWhile I support many aspects of the government's policies, this particular move seems to ignore the long-term benefits of cycling infrastructure, both in terms of safety and environmental impact. I urge the decision-makers to reconsider this plan, as it risks compromising both the safety of cyclists and the city's progress toward more sustainable, livable streets.\n"

Use of omnibus bills makes it extremely difficult to debate all aspects of the proposed legislation so that flaws never come to light to be rectified. It suggests that the government is afraid of being questioned on the legislation proposed and demonstrates their cowardice. It is an insult to our traditions and all the members of the House.\nI also oppose this Bill on its merits. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and the Ontario Traffic Council all oppose this Bill; 120 physicians and researchers have written a letter opposing this Bill; and the Bill is predicated on false premises. It is false that inly 1.2% of people bike to work in Toronto. What is worse, the government knows this is false, but continues to lie to the people of Ontario about the actual and growing use of bike lanes. If you have to lie to present your cause then you are acting like bullies. Is this the role model the Premier and the Transportation Minister should present to the citizens of this province?\nFinally I oppose this legislation for personal reasons. The Bill exclude highway 413\u2019s environmental impact process and assessment. in so doing, it attempts to fast track the highway's construction.  y limiting bike lane installation and removing existing bile lanes you continue maintaining  the status quo of car-dominated roadways. These are yesterday's solutions and are wholly inadequate to resolving today's problems. What is proposed will only increase pollution and the emission of green house gases when it is abundantly clear that this has to stop. I have grand nieces and nephews who are under seven years of age and who are counting on us to reverse the continued trajectory to climate catastrophe. This Bill continues practices that have led us to the horrible situation we are  in now, and does nothing to address one of the principle causes of the problem we are now grappling with, i.e. continued use of fossil-fuel powered personal use vehicles.

As someone who uses bike lanes daily, these bike lanes have increased my ability to navigate the city further than I have done in the past due to the increase in safety that they provide. I use bike lanes to commute to work, to visit family and friends, go out to restaurants and shows, and to go shopping. I frequent more of these places now that I can move around the city more easily without zigzagging or having to merge on to busy roads such as University Avenue and Bloor Avenue with heavy traffic. The reality is, is that people will still ride these same routes but will risk their lives in the process. There are destinations that can not be reached without riding on these streets. Because they are main streets it is where many of us still need to go to shop and work. Building multifunctional/complete streets that support pedestrians, cyclists, public transit vehicles and cars is what high density, high class cities around the world do. New York City has bike lanes on major streets along with older cities like  Barcelona, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Removing essential cycling infrastructure and impeding the development of more bike lanes will put Toronto and other Ontario cities behind and perpetuate transit issues into the future.\n"

They should not have to seek provincial approval to try to improve road safety for their residents. What\u2019s next, forcing municipalities to ask permission from the province to widen sidewalks?\nIf more people cycle, there will be less traffic on the roads. But people do not cycle in large enough numbers, because there are not enough safe, separated bike lanes to keep them from being killed by cars. As someone who both drives and rides a bicycle, I support measures to keep cyclists safe and separated.\nAs the climate crisis worsens, governments should be working on ways to encourage citizens to reduce emissions. They should be making it easier for people to walk, cycle, or take transit, instead of driving everywhere.\nThe assertion that this legislation will result in reduced traffic and gridlock is naive. The best way to reduce gridlock is to offer convenient, safe, and affordable alternatives to driving. Efficient public transit helps, and so do separated bike lanes!\n"
