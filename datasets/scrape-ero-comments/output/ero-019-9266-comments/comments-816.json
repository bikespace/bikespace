Had the road he\u2019d been had a bike a lane, it\u2019s likely the affects would have been a lot less severe. By removing these important safety protections, lives are being put at risk. All to save 5 minutes of travel time. This is narrow minded and one sided \u2018solution\u2019 to a situation that will only end up hurting people who are unable to travel in vehicles.\nAdditionally, by skipping the proper environmental assessment for Highway 413, this bill is destroying vital wetlands without necessary diligence. It\u2019s a slap in the face to any environmental achievements this province has made over decades.\n"

        "comment": "It is disingenuous to say this bill is about reducing gridlock when research shows that bike lanes do just that, and when the proposal itself recognizes other factors causing the traffic congestion. Removing bike lanes will incentivize more cyclists to drive and lead to more traffic and, eventually, the same gridlock as before.\nWorse than the bill's utter failure to achieve its purported goal will be the long-term public health and environmental consequences of its promotion of motor vehicle traffic over alternative transportation modes. If the goal really is for cities to have less traffic gridlock, please don't destroy our alternatives to being in traffic.\n"

We need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and encouraging people to bike is an important part of this reduction. As ever, the present government is ignoring the the climate crisis.\n2. Removing bike lanes will endanger my life and those of my loved ones.  Bike lanes save lives.\n3. Research has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse.\n4. Removing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money, and businesses will also suffer from reduced traffic\n5. The Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities.\nI live in Ottawa. Ottawa\u2019s Official Plan commits to a major shift in transportation, such that by 2046, over half of all trips are by sustainable transportation modes\u2014that is, walking, biking, public transit, and so on. For that to occur, we need to make it safer and more convenient for people to bike. Ford\u2019s legislation obviously does precisely the opposite. The Ford  government approved our Official Plan. Why is he making the Plan harder to implement?\n"

By removing bike lanes, it will encourage cyclist to go back to driving and increase the number of vehicles on the road.\nIf the Province really wanted to reduce gridlock, they would make sure transit projects are completed on time. The government needs to stop gaslighting people by saying only 1% of people commute by bike, when the number is closer to 10% within areas serviced by the bike lanes targeted to be ripped out.\nIf people were really concerned about their slow commute \u201cbecause of the bike lane\u201d, they would take the subway provided right under them on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street.\n"

But because life in the city is expanding. The bike lanes provide a great deal of safety for motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Removing them would be careless. Keep the bike lanes !!!\n"

        "comment": "I am fully against the removal of mobility lanes as cycling this is the most efficient and quickest mode of transportation along these highly traveled lanes. Bike lanes give people the option to travel safely through any method of transportation and the data proves that cycling has increased significantly. The fire chief also recently said response times on Bloor West went down after the bike lanes were installed. All these lanes also have public transportation options for anyone who is unable to cycle. Removing these costs is an obtuse waste of my tax money as well as everyone\u2019s in Ontario. The BIA\u2019s are in full support of these bike lanes as they have proven time and time again to increase foot traffic to these stores and increase revenue for small businesses.\n"

        "comment": "I believe the province is wrong to interfere with bike lanes in Toronto. I live in Etobicoke very close to Bloor Street. This is a community that is growing at an enormous rate. Expecting cars to have priority is unsustainable because of the population surge. Removing bike lanes is costly and will only increase traffic congestion.  It may sometimes take an extra 5 minutes to drive through the Kingsway on Bloor Street but we just need to allow ourselves a little more time. Life and communities must adapt to changing times.\nAlso it is inappropriate for the province to make rulings on issues that are a municipal responsibility. The changes the province is proposing are not for the greater good of the community but are pandering to political interests. This approach damages our communities.\nDo the right thing!\n"

We should also require an identifying number or license plate on adult\u2019s bikes so they can be identified and ticketed if they do anything unsafe or illegal, like all other vehicles. Also, bike lanes should be for bikes that don\u2019t use a motor or engine to propel. Any motorized bike should be on the road like a car or motorcycle.\n"

        "comment": "I am an Ontario resident and am strongly opposed to proposed Bill 212 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, until the provisions regarding removing the bike lanes from Toronto\u2019s Yonge Street, Bloor Street, and University Avenue, are deleted from the bill.\nThere are many reasons why this bill should not proceed as written. It is a gross overstep of jurisdiction into municipal affairs, setting the stage for the handicapping of cities and communities everywhere to be subject to the whims of the Province. It is laughably in opposition to this administration's purported goal of slashing red tape: now, every time any city throughout Ontario wants to make a decision about their own transportation infrastructure, it needs to be studied at taxpayer expense by the Province. It defies proven data about congestion, with cycling actually proven to reduce congestion, emergency services wait times, and vehicle maintenance. It is against the Province\u2019s own planning goals - with no safe bike lanes, how are we to increase housing density when none of those new tenants can get around the downtown?\nBut the most crucial and obvious argument against this portion of this bill, is that cycle lanes save lives.\nToronto invested in saving those lives with a visionary planning and installation project that saw continuous bike lanes on the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, and now not only would this bill undo millions of dollars of studied municipal infrastructure, it would spend even more untold millions of Ontario taxpayer dollars to do so. There hasn't even been a cost published by the Province for this work, and yet the bill is being rushed through.\nThe provision proposing the removal of the Yonge, Bloor, and University cycle lanes was snuck in ten days after the full bill was released and the 30 day comment period opened, leaving less time for study and comment by both Ontarians and their representatives. This underhanded is par for the course with Doug Ford\u2019s leadership, demonstrating abhorrence for due process, but also his disrespect and contempt for the citizens he's supposed to be working for, and his colleagues in the legislature debating this bill today.\nNot to mention even more costs when injuries happen, but we all know that one death is one too many. I beg you to remove these two clauses from this legislation, and prevent further deaths and catastrophic injuries.\nSincerely,\nDeeply Concerned Ontario resident\n"

They just will have to either a) drive, adding further vehicles to the road and increasing congestion, or b) exercise their right to take up an entire lane, again, slowing traffic and putting them at much greater risk of harm.\nMany people rely on bikes to get around Toronto and this proposal is effectively proposing to remove the equivalent of the 401 for bikes.\nI implore you to research induced demand. Removing these lanes would devastate millions living in Toronto who rely on this crucial piece of the bike network and only exacerbate Toronto\u2019s traffic problem.\nPlease leave decisions about Toronto\u2019s bike infrastructure up to Toronto; this is not a provincial matter.\n"

        "comment": "There are so many reasons to keep bike lanes in Toronto but I will just mention three. The first is that if people are on their bikes, they are not in their cars. So it keeps cars off of the roads, which will help decrease gridlock. Second, since people are on their bikes and there are less cars on the road, there will be less air pollution, which is much better for the environment. Third, keeping the bike lanes will help encourage people to bike, which is a healthier choice. There are so many health issues that stem from people being overweight and we know that our healthcare system is already overburdened. So I think our governments should be encouraging every kind of physical activity they can. And having bike lanes encourages people to bike since they feel safer. My husband and I use our bikes almost every single day from early April til early December, and even sometimes in the winter when it's not snowy or too wet. Since the bike lanes came into existence, we feel safer and more encouraged to bike. We have been trying to encourage our daughter to use her bike and safety on the roads is her (and our) main concern. When there are no bike lanes, cars are more likely to take up all of the room and push bikers to the side of the road, causing more accidents and making bikers feel less safe. I urge you, please do not get rid of the bike lanes that are helping us decrease traffic, decrease harm to the environment, and decrease health issues.\n"

Further, there are multiple times during the day when traffic does not move and vehicles are idling and producing pollution. I have also noticed an increase of bicycle use on the sidewalks since the bike lanes were put in. The degree of reckless cycling has also increased with the installation of the bike lanes. There is also no attempt by the city to enforce any of the laws pertaining to cycling. There is clearly no cost benefit to the city when it comes to the number of residents using the bike lanes.\n"

Conservatives are supposed to favour efficiency and practicality, both of which characteristics of bicycles. Imagine how much more space will be taken up on the roads if every bicyclist is forced to use a car.  I strongly suggest that this short-sighted proposal be withdrawn. The more so since most studies show that traffic moves better when there are well-marked and controlled bicycle lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 as it represents an overreach of provincial powers into municipal responsibilities. As a concerned citizen, I believe that any decision regarding bike lanes should be left to local governments who have a better understanding of their communities' needs and priorities. Focusing solely on removing bike lanes as a solution to urban congestion is a scapegoat for other more pressing issues, such as inadequate infrastructure planning and lack of investment in public transit.\nA poll from Ipsos in July 2024 clearly identifies what residents think the causes of traffic and congestion are:\nhttps://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/majority-residents-say-there-is-traffic-and\u2026\nThere are solutions to our traffic woes, but restrictions on building bike lanes and where they should be built will not solve them. Will I now need to take the car to commute to work downtown, adding to the increasing amount of cars on the road? I urge you to reject this bill and instead work collaboratively with cities to find comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of urban challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, insufficient investment in sustainable transportation alternatives, and bad construction management.\nFast-tracking the construction of Highway 413 through an omnibus highway bill without proper environmental assessments is unacceptable and poses significant risks to our environment and public health.\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong Torontonian and someone who once believed that cars were the most efficient way to get around, my perspective changed when I moved downtown and began commuting daily by bike. Toronto\u2019s bike lanes have not only become an integral part of my routine, allowing me to travel safely and efficiently to work, but they\u2019ve also enriched my weekends, providing an affordable and enjoyable way to explore the city. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of how critical bike lanes are to creating a livable, vibrant, and sustainable urban environment.\nBill 212 threatens to undo the progress Toronto has made in prioritizing the safety, health, and well-being of its residents. Removing bike lanes would turn our streets into highways, catering to suburban motorists at the expense of those who live, work, and contribute to the fabric of our downtown neighborhoods. Toronto\u2019s urban planning should center on its residents\u2019 needs, not the convenience of car-dependent suburbanites who already have access to expansive car-centric infrastructure.\nBike lanes are not just a safety measure; they address pressing issues like the rising cost of living and environmental degradation. As the cost of gasoline, car ownership, and insurance soars, cycling offers an affordable alternative. By investing in bike infrastructure, we provide people with viable transportation options, reducing dependence on cars and encouraging a healthier, greener city.\nThe claim that removing bike lanes will reduce traffic is short-sighted. Toronto\u2019s traffic woes worsened for decades because we kept adding more cars to the roads without diversifying transportation options. Since the installation of bike lanes, we\u2019ve seen how offering alternatives can alleviate congestion while fostering a more inclusive and equitable city.\nBill 212 represents a step backward. We must resist policies that reinforce car dependency and prioritize short-term convenience over long-term livability. Let\u2019s protect and expand bike lanes, ensuring Toronto remains a forward-thinking city that values safety, sustainability, and the quality of life of its residents.\n"
