        "comment": "As a driver and resident close to Bloor street, I prefer having bike lanes on Bloor. My neighbourhood is more vibrant, the cars no longer race down the street, passing cyclists is easy because they have their own lane, and the street is safer for families.\nWith all the developments taking place along Bloor, we have to expand our transportation options, not limit them to driving. Encouraging more cars is not a solution to easing gridlock. Providing alternative options is the way to go.\n"

Not to mention the amount of construction we had to deal with with the installation of these lanes in the first place and the amount of money this costed the city.  If the provincial government is so concerned with the improvement of gridlock, perhaps they should be focusing their efforts on the completion of the Eglinton Crosstown.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this new legislation. I am primarily a driver but have changed many of my trips to downtown to cycling because of the safe and efficient bike routes added. It's also becoming obvious that electric bikes are becoming a greater mode of travel and makes this accessible for more people. This can be easily seen watching the users of most bike lanes. As these bikes are significantly cheaper than cars, they will become an ever increasing mode of transportation going forward, especially for lower income people.\nThe removal of these lanes will add traffic back to the streets and clog up not just the streets where bike lanes are removed but others as more cars fill up this space. It will also increase the hazard to cyclist, and increase the amount of conflicts between drivers and cyclists as they both try to navigate a shared space.\nLegislation wise, this proposal represents an abuse of power and extreme overreach by the Ontario government. Tiers of government exist for a reason, and taking powers away from freely elected individuals and moving the power for municipal decisions to those with limited knowledge of the local issues sets a dangerous precedent, and frankly errodes the roots of our democracy. This also adds significant bureaucracy to a government that claims they are out to reduce this.\nSincerely a frustrated Ontario voter,\nTyler\n"

        "comment": "As a senior citizen in Etobicoke with a disability I am not able to use the bike lanes where I live.  I am 78 years old and am a primary caregiver for my husband who has Parkinsons Disease.   We are no longer able to ride a bike and live amongst many older persons who have needs that are similar to ours.  It is very difficult for us to navigate Bloor Street West between Islington and Prince Edward Drive, and off load to reach our Pharmacy and fresh food shopping.  The newly constructed bike lanes make shopping, getting many of our prescriptions, accessing our doctor etc very difficult.  Also, the condition of the sidewalks is not great either for seniors.\nI would like someone to take a hard look at the accessibility of the Bloor Wst area for seniors and those with a disability. To my knowledge, this is not a place for us to shop or live safely anymore.  We have to go elsewhere to do our shopping and unfortunately we now need to go by car. Have you fully considered those of us who are living longer and the quality of our life in this community?\n"

        "comment": "Anyone who lives in Toronto knows that Bike lanes are not the cause of the traffic congestion.  Bike lanes actually ease congestion.  I can travel to downtown Toronto in a safe and faster way as a result of the bike lanes.  I have seen up to 12 bikes in a row at a light, that would be replaced by 12 cars if the bike lanes are removed.\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is due to the following:\n- Ongoing construction on Queen street and University and other streets due to the Ontario line.\n- Construction at Bloor and Spadina and other major intersections this past summer.\n- There has been so much construction in the downtown core that it is even difficult getting around on a bike as well as being a pedestrian on sidewalks.\n- The number of Ubers, cars and delivery trucks stopping on the side of the road for \"just a minute\" completely blocking a lane of traffic.  We need much better enforcement with cars illegally stopped towed away immediately.  Cars and trucks are even driving and stopping on sidewalks - how dangerous is that!\nBike lanes currently in place should not be removed.  This is a waste of money and won't improve traffic in anyway!\n"

        "comment": "Resolving car congestion requires a holistic approach which addresses education, public transport ease of use and broader city planning issues as to why do drivers (frequently solo drivers) feel the necessity to drive their car downtown in the first place. The Provincial gvt is overstepping it's mandate by arbitrarily picking on cycling lane removal as a 'solution to congestion' in a blatantly political move to appeal to its voter base. In doing so, Doug Ford comes off looking like a populist fool and Toronto will be left a less appealing city to live in at a time when enlightened cities are reducing car dependency, not increasing it.\nShame on Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "These bike lanes are essential in reducing drivers on the road and are critical safety infrastructure!\nThese lanes keep me and my family safe when biking through the city and commuting. How many people will be injured or killed as a result of removing them? How much additional noise and air pollution will be created in these vibrant and walkable neighbourhoods as a result of having 4 lanes of traffic instead of two? What will the province do when these lanes of traffic inevitably become gridlocked again? This will hurt local buisness along these roadways, decrease quality of life for those in the neighbourhood, make our streets less safe to walk along, and people will die as a result of these decisions.\nPlease let Toronto manage itself. There is no reason for the province to step in to remove lanes, when this is a matter for city governance, NOT provincial. Gridlock in the city will be solved when we have real alternative forms of transportation and commuting. Please just fund our public transit and let us do the rest!\n"

        "comment": "I use bike lanes in Toronto to get around safely and efficiently. I often have my kids with me. It will not be safe without the bike lanes so I will go back to driving my car and add to vehicle traffic. This is disappointing as it will cost me more, contribute to pollution, and be less healthy as I miss out on some daily exercise.\nLet Toronto make its own decisions. The bike lanes you\u2019re proposing to remove were the result of long consultations, debate, study, and votes. The Yonge bike lanes were a 22-1 vote in favour. This clearly reflects the democratic will of our residents. Of course some opponents are upset but isn\u2019t this always the case in politics? You can\u2019t please everyone. Let the system work.  Stop mucking around and micromanaging a single municipality. Be more professional and mature.\n"

It minimizes opportunity for healthy exercise which benefits physical and mental wellbeing and reduces health care costs. And if we don\u2019t step back from cars we face a dangerous climate change future.\nToronto is still under serviced in terms of bike lanes compared to Montreal, Vancouver and also cities like Berlin, Paris and New York.\nBloor Street bike lane has become a vital artery and has reduced dangerously high levels of bike traffic on Harbord and Wellesley bike routes. It appeared that Toronto and Ontario was going to join a better future. This bill takes us 20 years back.\n"

I don't own a car and have been able to afford an amazing biking lifestyle including personal travel to other regions with the consequence to other of one less moving pedestrian struck box on the roads. This isn't a one-off and with the support of my regions municipal policies many of my co-workers are able to use bike infrastructure as one part of their transportation. This is in leu of poor lighting, road/pedestrian separation, and connectivity of bike infrastructure.\nWith how many people with less experience using micro mobility want to start experiencing the benefits it has, it would be nice if the cities that want to support this could without the province making it a unneeded and exponentially greater risk to the lives of individuals through bureaucratic red tape.\n"

With the expansion of the population of the Province and the City of Toronto, alternative routes for transportation are needed over the motor vehicle. This Bill will make the City and Province more difficult to move in and is regressive. It must be removed in its entirety from consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Hi!\nI\u2019m reaching out to ask that we preserve our bike lanes for the safety and benefit they bring to our community. Bike lanes don\u2019t add to traffic; in fact, they help ease congestion by giving cyclists a dedicated space, which keeps them separate from cars. This reduces accidents and keeps traffic moving smoothly for everyone. Encouraging cycling also means fewer cars on the road, which is especially important in densely populated areas. With more people opting for bikes, we can all enjoy a safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly commute. Toronto is very different than other suburban areas. It doesn\u2019t make sense for less dense cities and towns to have them. But in Toronto, it does.\nI\u2019d ask you to clarify what will be put there as an alternative. My guess is parking, which will make congestion worse. Why not start with adding NO PARKING ANYTIME signs on key roads in Toronto? Why is one lane always used for parking?\nIf bike lanes are removed, the lack of safety and deaths that will arise will be on Doug Ford and your Ministry\u2019s hands.\nPlease be smarter.\n"
