        "comment": "Removing bike lanes without proposing viable alternatives is a shortsighted decision that puts cyclists and drivers at greater risk. For example, north of Bloor lacks a safe alternative to Yonge Street for cyclists traveling north-south.\nEliminating bike lanes here doesn't mean cyclists will disappear; they'll still use the road, now without the protection of designated lanes. This creates a dangerous situation for everyone\u2014cyclists face increased risk, and drivers must contend with slower-moving traffic. It's a lose-lose outcome for both groups.\nMoreover, the recent growth in Bike Share memberships and usage highlights how cycling is becoming an increasingly popular mode of transportation in the downtown core. These changes appear to contradict efforts to reduce gridlock by encouraging more people to bike. Are we promoting cycling as a solution to traffic congestion, or are we discouraging it by making it less safe and convenient?\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal. We should be moving on initiatives to reduce personal cars rather than removing bike lanes. Removing bike lanes will not improve traffic - it will make it harder for cars and bikes to share the roads which will lead to more collisions, which also increases gridlock. The reality is that we need to make motions to motivate MORE people to cycle (or use public transit) and by investing in those alternatives we will in turn see an automatic reduction in gridlock. Invest in services to serve people rather than punishing those who are already doing the thing that will improve gridlock. Absolutely ridiculous proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Hello there,\nI am adamantly opposed to the provincial government dictating what happens in a municipality when it comes to city planning.\nWhy should someone in Brampton weigh in on the city planning in Toronto?\nWhy would a legislator in Kingston know anything about what is needed in Windsor?\nHow would an official from Etobicoke have any sense about what downtown residents and business owners want?\n1) Evidence\nThere is no evidence that bike lanes have affected car transit times in Toronto. In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite as stated by Emergency Services and Toronto Fire. City of Toronto streets are congested due to more cars than they are built to support. For evidence that demonstrates bike lanes are not the cause of backups on Yonge St, see Yonge St. north of Lawrence, a portion of Yonge St. without bike lanes, is constantly backed up (I have pictures).\n2) Local residents and businesses support the lanes\nLocal businesses, community members, local politicians and urban planners support these bike lanes. They were implemented after MANY years of community consultation and study. There are literally thousands of hours of direct consultation that have informed these plans. The lanes are working. Businesses and residents are supportive. We are not focused on building what 'through traffic' wants. We build for local residents and businesses.\n3) Precedent\nOne distant level of government intervening in the careful planning of another level of government sets a dangerous precedent. Surely the Provincial government doesn't want to set a precedent and expose themselves to a higher level of government intervening in its careful planning.\n4) Experts\nLocal experts and expert city planners around the world are in support of protective infrastructure on lanes on roads. What information does the Minister from Brampton have that contradicts global consensus?\n5) Mandate\nThe ridings that these lanes are in voted for different parties in the last election. They do not subscribe to the 'cars first' mentality of the majority party. The government does not have a mandate to overrule the wishes of the residents that these ridings represent.\n6) Liability\nThe province would be taking on significant, direct liability by directing well-planned infrastructure designed to protect vulnerable road users. Every accident, injury and fatality will be 100% directly attributable to this ill-advised action.\nThe City of Toronto is not like Etobicoke, Brampton or Vaughan. We don't see roads as car-centric thoroughfares. We believe in streets that support and protect all road users.\nThe wishes of the car commuters who want to 'pass-through' does not deserve more weight than the wishes of the local communities.\nWe reject this overreach by the Province.\n"

        "comment": "My whole family - grandparents, kids, adults - all use bike lanes wherever they are in place. On a daily basis.\nI commute to work on a bike, so does my spouse. We are fortunate to have them in place on our routes! When others commend us for riding to work (all year long, I might add), and we encourage them to consider it, the number one reason they give for not commuting by bike is perceived safety issues. That\u2019s why! Bike lane networks will encourage more people to ride and more cars to come off the roads. Full stop. Safety for cyclists is smart for everyone.\nI overheard someone say why he wasn\u2019t sure about supporting bike lanes. I was curious to hear why! He said he didn\u2019t like the way some cyclists ride, some have been rude or made bad turns when he was walking nearby. Totally understandable that he would find that annoying or unsafe! But when we see some car drivers operating their vehicles in an unsafe or discourteous way, we don\u2019t eliminate, cancel, or remove roads.\nLet\u2019s join the modern world and build UP our infrastructure for safe, clean, person-powered commuting/getting around this great city. NOT tear it down! What on earth?\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m concerned about the environmental impact of this bill and its impact on the ability to achieve Toronto\u2019s \u201cTransformTO Net Zero Strategy\u201d which has a goal that by 2030, 70% of work/school trips under 5 km will be walked, biked, or by transit.  Simply put, removing key bike lanes will make biking an unattractive, slow, and unsafe option, encouraging more cars on the road. Focusing on getting \u201cdrivers\u201d where they need to be faster vs. getting \u201cpeople\u201d where they need to be faster is a goal that will have negative impacts for the city, the health of its citizens, and the environment overall. Exhaust emissions from cars, trucks and other on-road vehicles are the largest source of local air pollution in Toronto and contribute to hospitalizations and premature deaths in Toronto. I encourage the Ontario Government to think holistically when proposing solutions to issues such as a gridlock.\nI am extremely supportive of reducing gridlock and getting people where they need to go faster. Fast and efficient transportation is the backbone of a thriving city, and these are real problems that Toronto faces. However, there are more creative, environmentally conscious, and ultimately effective ways to do this that the Ontario government should strive for. We can reduce gridlock by improving our public transit by running pilot projects to make a high impact for a low-cost (e.g. King Street Transit Priority Corridor), improving the availability of public transit, investing in bike safety to encourage biking as a form of transport, and completing government infrastructure projects on time to reduce gridlock-creating construction (e.g. ensuring engineers are paid a liveable wage, review engineering staffing needs).\n"

        "comment": "I submitted this comment:\nOntario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\n### Conclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "Rich people can afford cars and driving in a car into downtown by themselves luxury and I love that for them, yay them!\nPoor or poorer people can not afford a car or can not afford to drive a car they may own but can't pay the expensive parking fees downtown or they share their family car so the options for them are crammed into a TTC with all kinds of mental health explosions and discomforts.\nAdditional options are walking and biking. These are the options I choose. To allow for more people to choose these options we need wonderfully connected bike lanes from our outer surrounding suburbs making this delightful mode of transportation an option for them to choose. Safe, connected, fast, healthy, no bike traffic congestion.\nI can't imagine ripping up our sidewalks and not allowing for people to walk. Similarly, I can't imagine ripping out our bike lanes and removing this choice.\nThe choice for rich and poor alike. Biking.\nWe can not let only rich choice and rich voice be heard.\nHousehold incomes do not buy today 2024 what they bought in1980's. the rich who graduated from universities in the 80 and are relaxing in their luxurious sole ride into the city for the last couple of years of their working lives need not weigh in on this..... We need to listen to the commuters of the future.  University graduates of the 2000- 2024 and beyond ... this growing cohort will not afford the sole ride into the city of years past... the bike lanes will become more and more used as they years of wealth disparity and disintegrating middle-class erodes.\n"

        "comment": "I object entirely to Schedule 4 - Ministry approval for bicycle lanes required. This is written in such a way that the provincial government overreaches into devolved municipal powers to overrule elected officials who speak and operate on behalf of their constituents at the municipal level where the ministry may be either misinformed, lobbied, or altogether not aware of issues at this level of government. Provincial Ministries should remain concerned with large scale capital projects rather than meddling in on particular city's municipal operations.\nIn addition this adds another overbearing layer of bureaucracy, inefficiency, and burden to the tax payer where you have two levels of government wasting time arguing over something that can be resolved at the first level of government. Municipal. The province can step in and legislate in exceptional circumstances, whereas this lays the framework for any government to meddle at any time, for any reason, or worse, stall any projects or pilots, dooming them to failure.\nItem (4) also contains too vague language, who studies the traffic flow? will this be conducted by an independent body outside of political control? will this data be presented and available to the public? Will amendments to plans be accepted once data has been gathered or will this consideration only be used to cancel projects outright?\nThe entire Schedule reads like duplication of effort and a make work effort for the province to waste yet more money for political point scoring rather than actually focusing on issues, like healthcare, house prices, grocery prices, which benefit the people of the province as a whole as opposed to hyperfocusing on one city to which the premier appears to have a vendetta against.\nIt would be nice to also have legislation that is not named and is only the code Bill-212 as yet again, this reeks of point scoring and misleading the public through 'soundbite-like' bill headlines.\n"

Every bike lane that is built, every bike you see in a bike lane, is one LESS car in the lane of car traffic. Everything this bill insists it is fixing is going to have the opposite effect.
