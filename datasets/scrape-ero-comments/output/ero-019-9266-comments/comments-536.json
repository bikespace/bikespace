Restoring car lanes on major roads like Bloor, Yonge, and University could help alleviate gridlock and improve travel times for drivers and public transit users alike. While bike lanes are valuable, prioritizing key roads for high-volume vehicle traffic is essential to keep Toronto moving. I encourage further collaboration with local authorities to strike a balanced approach to transportation planning that meets the needs of drivers, transit users, and cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill as it is currently written.\nDecisions around city infrastructure should not be decided by the province.  Cities should know what is best for their residents, and give them whatever transportation choices those residents want.\nAll transportation choices need to be safe.  As a driver I don't like the unpredictability of bikes and pedestrians, and want them separated from me.  As a cyclist I am extremely uncomfortable on roads with no protected bike lanes.  The painted bike gutters are not safe because drivers park in them, and inattentive drivers drift into them.  Lastly as a pedestrian I don't want cyclists on the sidewalk.\nI want my city implementing protected infrastructure for both bikes and pedestrians.  I want to have choices, SAFE choices.  I want to be less dependent on my vehicle.\nYou can't solve gridlock by encouraging more people to drive.  You need to encourage practical, reliable, safe alternatives to get people out of their vehicles.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "To Premiere Doug Ford and the Provincial Government of Ontario,\nI strongly oppose your proposed Bill 212 - the Frame work for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\n(1) Bill 212 is an attack on Local Democracy:\nBike lanes are built after lengthy and careful research, consultation with the public stakeholders, design, and funded by municipal governments. It is a total over- reach and violation of the decisions of locally elected municipal city councils and their citizens on a matter of municipal government.\n(2) Bill 212 is based on faulty reasoning (see for example URLs provided):\nRemoving a bike lane will not reduce gridlock; the more lanes for traffic, the more automobiles will be in the lanes, and you get the same gridlock.  Hwy 401, the DVP, do not have bikelanes and by your reasoning should have less gridlock!  Most cars in downtown Toronto only have one occupant, the driver.  Cars, with single occupants, create gridlock!  (see CanStats link enclosed)\nSlower automobiles in downtown traffic mean more safety for all street users.  The provincial government seems to prioritize speed over safety.\nAlso, if there are fewer bike lanes, more cyclists will use their cars, creating more congestion or they will use public transit, which lacks sufficient funding from the province.\nMany other major cities have much more bike lanes than Toronto and their findings are that bike lanes reduce congestion and Complete Streets design improves safety for all citizens.\n(3)  Bill 212 Contributes to Harmful Climate Change:\nGiven the reality and increasing harmful effects of green house gases induced climate change, we need more cyclists and people taking public transit, NOT car drivers using fossil fuels.\n(4)  Bill 212 is the result of a Political Decision to benefit the Provincial Government of Doug Ford, not the citizens of Toronto (or other municipalities)\nBill 212 is a divisive distraction to draw attention away from the Provincial Government's failures such as its lack of sufficient support for equitable housing, public transit, and its under-funding of our health care and education systems.\nI strongly oppose Bill 212.\n"

Access to safe, sweatered bike lanes in the downtown core of Toronto is essential to maintaining public safety for cyclists.\nCyclists pay taxes too. Cyclists are citizens of equal status to those who drive motorized vehicles. Why does the Province feel they need to step in and interfere with cycling infrastructure that taxpayers of Toronto have already paid to have installed. The provincial government must stick to the jurisdictions the publics expects them to operate within and keep out of Toronto\u2019s internal policy setting and infrastructure projects.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Ford Government and Ministry of Transportation,\nI urge you to reconsider passing this bill. I\u2019d like to preface my concerns by presenting facts, alongside the voices of the Toronto public.\nI recently moved to Toronto this year from the sprawling suburbs of York Region, and I was excited about the proximity and infrastructure my new home would offer in terms of both work and city life. In the suburbs, I was dependent on a car to get around\u2014transit was slow, infrequent, and disconnected, with key destinations often too far apart. Since moving to Downtown Toronto, I\u2019ve adopted a more eco-friendly, cost-effective, and time-saving lifestyle by walking, biking, and taking the TTC. I regularly use the Bloor/Danforth and University bike lanes to commute to work and navigate the city. In fact, I\u2019ve come to realize that many of my neighbours and friends in Toronto don\u2019t own cars and manage to get around the city just as I do\u2014without depending on a motor vehicle.\nAccording to the 2018 Transportation Tomorrow Survey, 55% of households in Downtown Toronto do not own a vehicle. This is no surprise. Much of the vehicle traffic entering the city comes from suburban commuters who are forced to rely on cars due to the lack of efficient transit options. The frustration that arises from inadequate transit infrastructure for Greater Toronto Area (GTA) commuters is the primary driver of motor vehicle dependency and gridlock\u2014not bike lanes.\nThis bill is a distraction from the root issue that has plagued urban planning in North American cities for decades. Expanding roads for more cars will not solve congestion in the long term. It is unsustainable. With the GTA\u2019s population growing and limited development of new downtown neighbourhoods, people are forced to commute to Toronto for work and leisure. Without a functional, interconnected transit system, more people will turn to cars as their primary mode of transport. People choose the fastest and most convenient option to get where they need to go. If transit is not the fastest option\u2014when it should be\u2014drivers will resort to cars, creating more traffic. No amount of additional vehicle lanes can solve this problem.\nFor cities to manage traffic effectively, we need infrastructure that serves all commuters. First, we must eliminate the red tape that has stalled key transit projects. The completion of the Metro Line, the ongoing delays with the Eglinton LRT, and the lingering future of the Ontario Line need urgent attention. Second, we should prioritize dedicated lanes and traffic signals for motor vehicles, transit, and cyclists. Everyone deserves their own lane and signal for safe, efficient travel.\nThe mistake we are making now, and further compounding with this bill, is maintaining lanes exclusively for motor vehicles. This has serious implications for both congestion and safety. Without dedicated lanes for vehicles, transit, and cyclists, we end up with everyone fighting for space in the same lanes. This not only confuses road users but also creates unsafe conditions, increasing the likelihood of accidents and fatalities. Does the Ford government really want blood on its hands?\nAs a taxpayer, I would much rather see my money spent wisely on completing transit projects and maintaining infrastructure for all users\u2014whether they travel by car, bike, or public transit. Using our tax dollars to remove bike lanes and undo the progress we\u2019ve made feels counterproductive and frustrating.\nThis bill is akin to opening a can of worms, and I strongly urge the Ford government to educate itself on the broader context and hear from the many voices advocating for bike lanes. Bike lanes are essential for reducing congestion, improving safety, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Critics who argue that bike lanes increase traffic congestion are overlooking the bigger picture. Below, I\u2019ve summarized key points from a CBC article that outlines global studies on this issue:\nKey Points:\n1) Induced Demand and Traffic Congestion:\nResearch shows that adding more car lanes does not reduce congestion long-term due to \"induced demand\"\u2014more lanes attract more drivers, leading to even worse traffic conditions over time.\nIn contrast, bike lanes do not contribute to congestion. They often result in safer, more efficient travel and reduce car dependency.\n2) Benefits of Bike Lanes:\nCities like New York, Copenhagen, and Paris have shown that dedicated bike lanes can improve traffic flow, reduce travel times for cars, and increase cycling rates. For instance, in New York, bike lanes in a busy corridor reduced car travel time by 35% due to better lane configurations. In Copenhagen, widespread bike lanes have facilitated smoother travel for buses and goods transport.\n3) Increased Demand for Cycling:\nShoshanna Saxe, a professor at the University of Toronto, notes that the introduction of bike lanes leads to rapid increases in cycling demand, as seen in Toronto\u2019s Bike Share program, which saw ridership grow from 665,000 trips in 2015 to 5.7 million in 2023.\n4) Impact on Cities:\nParis saw a 54% increase in bike use from 2018 to 2019, while car use decreased by 5% between 2010 and 2018. In Canadian cities like Montreal, Vancouver, and Edmonton, bike lanes are heavily used, with Montreal alone boasting over 1,000 km of bike lanes.\n5) Misconceptions and Correlation:\nCritics often blame bike lanes for traffic congestion, but studies suggest that factors like population growth and the post-pandemic recovery are more significant contributors to increased vehicle traffic.\n6) Safety and Environmental Benefits:\nBike lanes reduce speeds on roads, making them safer for all users. Additionally, fewer cars on the road help reduce emissions and combat climate change.\n7) Economic Impact:\nIn Toronto, businesses along streets with new bike lanes have reported increased customer traffic, suggesting that bike lanes can also have positive economic effects.\nI hope my concerns and those of many others are taken seriously. Thank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I am incredibly distraught at the thought of bike lanes in Toronto being removed. This is incredibly short sighted. We are in a climate crises and need to do everything we can to encourage people to commute via bike and public transit. Safe bike infrastructure facilitates and encourages this. Scores of new developments in the city are being built on major streets (Bloor, Yonge) that will not have enough parking spots for all residents to be able to own cars, meaning these new home owners and renters will have to take public transit and bike. Where bike lanes are thought to be under-used now, in just a few years time they will see an incredible influx of riders as these new developments are being built. I am a cyclist and I bike year round in Toronto. As it stands, it is incredibly dangerous to bike in the city. The modest protections that these lanes provide are critical. I am strongly opposed to the provincial government overstepping their bounds and demanding the removal of bike lanes. What an incredible waste of tax payer money this would be, a very fiscally irresponsible move.\n"

        "comment": "I find it very unfortunate that the Government of Ontario feels that it needs to introduce its own approval process to approve bike lanes.  I feel that municipalities are better placed to determine whether a bike lane is warranted than the Government of Ontario would be.\nIf the government is concerned that bike lanes might slow car traffic, why isn\u2019t it also imposing restrictions on bus lanes or streetcar lanes that cannot be used by cars, or perhaps imposing restrictions on lanes where cars are permitted to park that prevent traffic from flowing?\nThe idea that bike lanes should be restricted to secondary streets would work if secondary streets actually allowed cyclists to reach their destinations.  But in very many cases a reasonable route between two locations forces a cyclist to use a major road.\nConsider as an example, riding from Yonge and St. Clair to Yonge and Bloor.  How would a bike route using secondary streets allow one to make that trip?  The lack of secondary streets travelling north and south in that area would force one to follow a circuitous route that would more than double the length of the trip.\n"

I regularly drive on Bloor st. and other roads which have had both painted and protected bike lanes installed in recent years. I can say, without doubt, that the bike infrastructure being developed around the City of Toronto is a critical component in decreasing traffic and congestion on Toronto streets by offering safe and reliable alternatives to driving. Now that I have the luxury of a car at my disposal, I almost exclusively use Toronto bike lanes and public transit when making trips within the borders of the city.\nAny decrease in the connectivity and viability of cycling infrastructure is unacceptable and removal of already installed cycling infrastructure is idiotic in the extreme.\n"

This was a great source of anxiety given that I am the father of two 3 year old twin boys. As it is, on my daily walks with my children on the street where we live I have to maintain a hyper vigilance to ensure that my children do not get harmed by a passing vehicle. I am so grateful to the bike lanes for providing a small barrier between the car traffic and the sidewalk where my children walk. Yes, we must still be mindful of the bike traffic, but at least cyclists are slower, and do not have a windshield / music / are less often on their phones than motorists these days.\nI am also irritated with the rhetoric which insists that cars should continue to have more consideration than other methods of transport. Due to inflation and the ever increasing cost of living, I actually have had to sell my vehicle in the past year, and now make routine use of the bike lines just outside my door. I can only expect that more and more people will be in a similar position to me.\nIn short, please don't make my neighborhood less safe for the small children who's well-being is threatened by the ability for cars to speed more efficiently and have closer access to curbs. And also please take some consideration in mind for those of us who cannot afford a personal vehicle...\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about provincial legislation that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all supported this gross overreach is extremely unsettling. This is directly against democracy. I am a resident of Toronto, and Mayor Chow was democratically elected by the people of Toronto. We have chosen a leader that supports bike lanes, because that meets our needs, and the Provincial government should not have the right to override our votes, and spend our taxes to to buy the votes of people who aren't even from Toronto.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"
