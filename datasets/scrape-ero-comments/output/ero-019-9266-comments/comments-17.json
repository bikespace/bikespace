        "comment": "I am a taxpayer living in the Parkdale High-Park riding. I own a car, cycle, walk and take transit to get where I need to be. It is abhorrent that the province of Ontario is proposing the use of my tax dollars to remove existing infrastructure and make it harder to keep our streets safer for vulnerable road users by creating useless barriers to expanding cycling networks. This money has better use improving transit times, among other things. Toronto is an expanding city, and people should not be able to drive wherever they want with ease, no other major city operates like that. London and New York for example have tolls that drivers must pay to enter downtown. I strongly support enacting tolls, people like the ministers supporting this bill do not even live in Toronto, their property taxes do not support maintaining Toronto's roads\u2013why is their need to drive being prioritized? By removing bike lanes, the province will create MORE gridlock. Pushing cyclists into shared lanes will slow cars down even further (and create more deadly situations). As per the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, bicycles are vehicles and can take the entire lane when it is not safe to stay a meter away from the curb\u2013which is often the case. Using bike lanes in a single city as a wedge issue to further divide the province is disappointing. I hope the province strongly considers a better use of our tax dollars to address the ACTUAL issues facing Ontarians today\u2013housing, affordability, our crumbling healthcare system...\n"

These bike lanes have all gone through rigorous consultations and city planning before their installation, and should remain.\nBike lanes keep our citizens safe. The gridlock should be dealt with by road tolls on highways leading into the city or congestion pricing.\nYes, I am a licensed automotive driver in Ontario and I approve this message\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown Toronto resident whose primary modes of transportation are cycling, transit, and walking, I'll keep my comments specific to that context. It's plain that vehicles are bigger than they used to be, largely contain a single occupant, and that there are many more of them on the road than what our streets were designed for. There isn't a real option to expand vehicle capacity on our city streets. Bike lanes are hardly the problem here, millions of dollars spent on reclaiming a four foot path on a handful of arterial roads will not ease congestion.\nWe need to look at transportation efficiency. We should encourage people to take transit by investing in transit expansion, efficiency, and frequency. We should encourage people to cycle by expanding cycling infrastructure safely and in harmony with other road users (look at Paris, London, NYC for e.g.). Remember that highway expansion outside of the city with no consideration for other modes of transport within it will only worsen gridlock.\nScapegoating one mode of transportation to obscure a failure of imagination regarding a holistic transportation system might provide some short term political benefit, but will not have any real positive effect for people on the road. The city itself has a lot to work on in this regard (e.g. remove street parking on arterial roads, especially those with streetcar routes) but the province should be a partner, not an adversary. Save taxpayers money and boost infrastructure management efficiency by allowing cities to make these decisions for themselves. The province does not need to micromanage this.\nThere will always be cars on the road, but not everyone should feel the need to drive a car. Give people options. Fewer cars on the road will be a net benefit for commuters, commercial vehicles, tourists, etc. Drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians need to find a way to work together to ensure safe and reliable transportation for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "The government's proposal to limit the construction of bike lanes and remove existing lanes is counter productive, ill considered, and a gross overreach of jurisdiction, and will directly result in more deaths, reduced business, and increased traffic time. Time and again data has shown that increasing alternative modes of transport is the only way to reduce car traffic, but this proposal seems to suggest that putting more cars on the road will somehow make everyone's journey faster. This is, frankly, boneheaded. The Toronto bike lanes that seem to be the focus of the government's ire have proven to be wildly successful, increasing the amount of cyclists in the city and removing them from dangerous car traffic with minimal-to-nil impacts on overall travel time. Removing these lanes will do two things: encourage travellers who would otherwise cycle into cars, increasingly traffic; and force cyclists to share the lane with car traffic, thereby reducing overall speeds and vastly increasing the risk of injury, road violence, and death. Make no mistake - this policy will directly result in more cyclist deaths.\nOn top of this, the micromanagement of municipal policy by the province will result in a huge increase in red tape. Premier Ford has previously said that the province would not interfere with cities determining their own development; why then does he feel that he needs to have such a direct hand in this? The Premier's personal vendetta against Toronto and cyclists is a poor excuse for this sort of onerous overreach, and the demand to roll back infrastructure that has been studied, planned, built and paid for is an onerous cost. The government should stop meddling in the personal gripes of the Premier and spend its time, money and focus on projects it controls that will help Ontarians' commutes - like the three transit lines that are stuck in development with no completion in sight.\nMore than anything else, the existing and planned bike lanes are good transit policy, and the result of literal decades of global data on increasingly transit times and road safety. Business along the corridors have seen increased traffic, street culture has been enlivened, and safety has been improved. Removing these vital pieces of infrastructure to make space for more cars - or, even dumber, parking - is incredibly backwards, and should be rightly discarded as the insane ditherings of out of touch policy makers who spend more time behind the wheel of their car then interacting with the communities they allegedly represent.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are proven to reduce road congestion, increase public safety, and promote local business throughout the world. The Government of Ontario should join this century. Bicycle riders gave as much right to taxpayer supported safe movement as vehicle drivers and pedestrians. Expanding lanes for general vehicular traffic increases congestion during at least part of the construction, and only provides short term relief.\nIf movement of commercial goods is indeed the problem to solve the province should consider commercial transport lanes similar to other special use corridors (HOV, bus, and yes bike lanes) as well as expanding public transportation accessibility, coverage and efficiency.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes don't cause traffic. Cars cause traffic. People use cars when they can't access reliable transit service. As a cyclist and a driver, if the province removes existing bike lanes that keep me safe I will be forced to use my bike to take up an entire car lane which will slow down car traffic and endanger my safety due to the lack of competent and considerate drivers in Ontario. If I am injured, it will cause harm to my person, financial and emotional hardship to my family, and since our healthcare is publicly funded a financial burden to the province as well as my employer. This is a regressive policy that will waste tax dollars that could be used to improve transit.\n"

        "comment": "The only way to improve traffic is to create viable ALTERNATIVES to driving. Making driving the ONLY OPTION means MORE CARS on the road, which means more traffic, which means longer commutes. The fact that the Ford government is willing to ignore the abundance of evidence collected in Europe, Asia, and North America in recent decades that proves that good cycling infrastructure IMPROVES traffic AND SAFETY is astonishing to me. The evidence is clear. There is NO REASON to privilege and prioritize car travel over other types of travel, and the fact that we still do is an indictment of our inability to think critically about the hold that the car industry has on our collective psyche via propaganda and on our government via lobbying. Transit, cycling, and walking are safer, healthier, better for the environment, better for travel times, and cheaper (the high cost of yearly road maintenance is almost entirely due to the effects of cars, not bikes!). Almost more astonishing is the idea that the provincial government would attempt to override municipal decisions about how the people of Toronto choose to travel. We elected Olivia Chow (convincingly) for a reason. Bike lanes are her jurisdiction. If the people of Toronto were against bike lanes, they would have elected one of the anti-cycling candidates. Worst of all is the proposal that bike lanes that are already built should be removed! This is completely beyond belief. Toronto is, for the first time in ages, on a 21st century trajectory: a more robust TTC system, better connectivity between TTC and GO, more \"third places\", mixed use developments, intelligent zoning changes, dutch-style intersections, and better cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. Turning back the clock to the 60s is not in line with what other serious cities are doing. And it's not just the obvious ones, like Copenhagen, Paris, and Uttrecht. Chicago too. Montreal. The provincial government needs to step back and allow their LARGEST AND MOST PRODUCTIVE CITY to continue becoming the serious, intelligent, respectable city it always should have been.\n"

I expect our government and the city to implement and consider policy that improves walkability and biking not slanders them for the sake of \"development\". I also expect a city like Toronto to be more open and experimental with how they think about social well-being and transportation and not just throw highways and lanes around like a bandaid.\n"

        "comment": "What an awful idea! And completely counter-intuitive to what you are trying to accomplish. Not only will bike lines decrease gridlock as more people will be able to commute using the lanes, it will also improve the quality of life of so many people. Not to mention public safety. Since moving to Mississauga where it is clear they prioritize drivers over cyclists, I have gotten into two cycling accidents due to poorly planned bike lanes or no bike lane at all. I am no longer able to commute to work because of the danger and am not contributing to this \u201cgridlock\u201d. So many other options, like improving public transit, will reduce to reduced gridlock. There is also the climate impact that can be added to this argument with more people driving. This going through will be dangerous for so many, will reduce quality of life and will surely lead to more deaths and injuries to cyclists. This seriously makes me wonder what the direction this province is trying to go.\n"

        "comment": "Really bad idea not grounded in any sort of reality. Studies show that bike lanes REDUCE congestion and  REDUCE death. This is Doug Ford and the PC Party waging culture war and nothing more, while showcasing how the party prioritizes the privileged over the many.\nThe way to improve traffic and congestion is to get more cars off the road. That means investing in transit (hey whatever happened to the Eglinton LRT?), investing in bike lanes and encouraging people to take transit and not drive. Robust transit and bike lane funding will help reduce congestion. Unfortunately the only thing the PC Party is interested in funding is the pockets of developers and friends of the party and leader, meaning this feedback likely falls on deaf ears. It's ironic hearing all the lip service about reducing \"red tape\" only for this administration to continue making things more difficult and less efficient for municipalities to get things done that their voters and residents want. Doug is not the mayor of every town and city in this province. Stay in your lane.\n"
