Bicycles and cycling lanes keep people moving. Removing the lanes would increase death and injury to cyclists and even pedestrians. Sharing the sidewalk is not an appropriate approach with the rise of e-bikes.\nI strongly disagree with this framework.\n"

By wasting our good money you are removing safety for both drivers and cyclists.  I finally had a safe route to meet my friend and health care provider in Etobicoke along Bloor.  But the proposed  bill ruins the growing network that makes cycling a great option. It removes the visual guide for me when I drive to leaves sufficient space for cyclists. We will be back to cars and bikes cutting each other off on fast car heavy streets. It\u2019s very very dangerous. People will be crushed by the enormous cars that dominate our traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this legislation and strongly urge the province not to implement this proposed legislation.\nRoads designed with diversity of traffic in mind create more predictable and safer traffic flow. When bikes have their own lanes, car drivers can feel more confident without fear of unintentionally hitting a cyclist as these two flows of traffic are separated.\nThe bike lanes and infrastructure encourage those who can to get out of their cars and to cycle. Removing cars off the road.\nThis is a question which is best addressed at the municipal level.\nThe bike lanes facilitate the transportation of thousands of Torontonians today (young and old). And shape transportation habits into the future.  Our family's default mode of transportation in Toronto is bicycle. And now it is for my daughter too.\nThe money that would be needed to reinstate car lanes can be better spent on projects that support health.\nLet's move forward.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a waste of tax payer money. The lanes have proven to reduce gridlock and make my commute, as a driver and pedestrian, safer and more efficient. With the bike lanes in place, I know that cyclists and couriers are safe from dangerous drivers. The bike lanes also allow me to pass at appropriate speed, instead of hanging back to make sure cyclists have enough space. The fact the Premier thinks bike lanes make traffic worse in the city, proves how out of touch they are. Also, the fact the Premier thinks they can mold the city however they see fit, without  proper procedure, shows how untrustworthy they are.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist, and a commuter, as are my wife and my kids.  I am appalled at the province's new bill 212 proposal.  I have rarely seen a less thoughtful, and poorly researched approach to dealing with gridlock.  This is a purely reactive plan that will not accomplish it's key goal.\nTime and time again, research studies have demonstrated that additional road infrastructure does not cut down on traffic.  In fact, car volumes increase in lock-step with roadway expansions:\nhttp://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124/\u2026.\nThe data and \"evidence\" provided by the province on the number of commuters/ cyclists vs drivers was deceptive and disingenuous.  The downtown Toronto routes targeted for removal, are the key arteries for commuters travelling downtown for jobs.  Those numbers are closer to 10% that cycle vs 40% that drive.  Perhaps if the cycling and public transit infrastructure were further improved, rather than degraded, you would actually see fewer drivers on the road?\nFurther amplifying my frustration is the fact that the cost of living is simply ridiculous in this province- but instead of helping to address this fact, we will be wasting tens of millions of dollars already spent on infrastructure to make the city even less appealing and affordable for those that don't drive.  How does this make any sense?\nCities around the world are moving away from such simplistic and banal thinking- why can't Ontario do the same?\nThere are smart infrastructure projects that could rapidly improve traffic flow. (Miovision in Waterloo for a start).  There are even easier modifications that can be made to the timing of traffic lights, as well as traffic rules and enforcement.\nThe government could also reduce congestion and gridlock in the city by modernizing its hybrid/ remote work practices and incenting other large organizations to do the same.\nRather than taking such a short-sighted and expensive approach, Ontario should take a look at what other similar-sized cities have done to reduce gridlock.  Removing bike lanes is simply not the answer and will, in fact, cause more gridlock through not only the construction phase, but by attracting even more drivers into our city post-construction.\n"

        "comment": "Let me begin by expressing my utmost anger and disgust at the provincial government for patronising municipalities in general, and targeting the City of Toronto in particular, in a bid to appear as though it is addressing the ever-increasing population and traffic issues in our city.\nIn a functioning democracy, MPPs representing Orillia, Kitchener, or Wawa should not have the authority to strip away the rights of Torontonians by removing the only safe infrastructure for getting around the city. Such decisions must be made by the people who live in and contribute to our community. I do not pay municipal taxes in Orillia, Kitchener, or Wawa, so my  local MPP should not have the right to interfere in a local matter in those municipalities. To do otherwise would be an abuse of power\u2014just as it is when external representatives erode the rights of Toronto.\nWithout resorting to measures such as charging drivers a congestion fee during peak times in downtown Toronto, has your government proposed any credible alternatives to reduce the dependency on single-occupancy vehicles? Not only are the number of vehicles increasing, but their size has grown significantly as well.\nCongestion is a reality in all major cities. However, world-class cities like Berlin, Paris, and Montr\u00e9al have successfully integrated cycling infrastructure into their urban landscapes. Toronto deserves no less.\nIt has taken the City of Toronto two decades of studies and consultations to establish the foundation of a cycling network that enables safe travel across downtown. The success of this network is evident: Bikeshare usage has increased tenfold over the years, now exceeding six million trips annually.\nAs a retiree living in a downtown condominium, my primary mode of transport is the bicycle. The TTC is invaluable for longer journeys, but for anything within a 15-kilometre radius, cycling is unmatched in speed, cost-effectiveness, and convenience. Removing what is essentially the backbone of the city\u2019s cycling network\u2014key lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor\u2014would be a severe blow to safe mobility for countless residents.\nThe speed at which this Bill was introduced, coupled with the Premier\u2019s apparent hostility towards cyclists and non-car traffic, makes it clear that your government is sacrificing the safety and well-being of Toronto residents to claim it is \u201cdoing something\u201d about traffic congestion. Yet, all evidence points to the opposite conclusion: building an inclusive network that allows all road users to travel safely is the true solution. This Bill prioritises vehicle flow at the expense of safety and inclusivity.\nOver the years, there have been numerous deaths and countless injuries involving collisions with motor vehicles. How many more lives must be lost or irreparably altered because cyclists are forced to share dangerous roads with cars? Downtown Toronto is home to universities, colleges, and high schools, where many young people rely on bicycles for transportation. Protecting human life should take precedence over shaving minutes off commuter travel times.\nI would respect a government that adopts an inclusive, thoughtful approach to addressing urban challenges, rather than taking the easy, divisive route. Prioritising short-term optics over long-term solutions undermines the very communities you claim to serve.\n"

Bikes don't wear off pavements as much as cars do. Bikes don't cause the pollution cars cause. Even electric bikes have a fraction of an electric car footprint. It's more fun to ride a bike. It's relaxing.\nWhy is Ford doing this? It's not rational. Just check any research done on the topic.\nI firmly oppose the removal of bike lanes proposed in this bill.\n"

        "comment": "To Premier Ford, Minister Sarkaria, and any MPPs considering voting for Bill 212,\nThis bill is an aggressive attack on youth, and we will not stand for it.\nMany of us want to continue living in the GTA and Bill 212 will further crush this already dwindling dream. By forcing people off of bikes and into cars, Bill 212 adds another burden to the cost of living. A $200 bike is the same cost as a month of TTC fares, and a little over 1% of the cost of a $15000 car. Building more bike lanes rather than tearing them out will secure affordable transportation for generations to come.\nWe are also in a housing crisis, making it very difficult for us youth to imagine finding an affordable home in the city. We need all the space we can get to build housing, and space for cars should not take priority over space for living. When we shift people from cars to bikes by building bike lanes, we can transform parking lots into housing. We can also plan denser streets, creating more space for homes.\nAlso pressing on our anxieties about the future is climate change. These bike lanes are key to reducing Toronto\u2019s carbon emissions. It\u2019s quite simple: cars pollute, bikes don\u2019t. In 2021, we saw that 24% of all of Toronto\u2019s carbon emissions came from cars[1]. Even electric cars involve upfront carbon, and require often destructive mining. We are already seeing the devastating impacts of climate change on affordability and wellbeing, which will continue to worsen if we continue to put more cars on the road through legislation like Bill 212.\nThis bill also threatens to expedite the destruction of parts of the Greenbelt for Highway 413, accelerating the expropriation of land, and bypassing proper environmental assessment. This would replace important ecosystems, air filtration, and food production with a huge source of emissions. Already, we are seeing around 600 deaths per year from air pollution, mostly from cars[2]. It is terrifying to imagine what this number will be like if we pave through the lungs of the city (the Greenbelt) for a continuous stream of cars. Induced demand will mean that this highway will not even help traffic, it will only line the pockets of Mr. Ford\u2019s developer friends. This will leave us youth to struggle with poor air quality, food insecurity, and worsening climate chaos.\nWhile cities around the world like Paris and Boston move forward in creating more bike lanes for more livable cities, Bill 212 would push Toronto backward to more emissions, higher cost of living, and more dangerous streets. Instead, we need to be looking to the future, and building bike lanes instead of highways.\nBuilding more bike lanes is also incredibly important for our current needs. Most students don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license or can\u2019t afford a car. Public transportation like the TTC is expensive, and often very slow. Cycling is the most accessible form of transportation for youth, and it is better for our health, our environment, and our wallets. But many of us don\u2019t bike because there is not enough infrastructure. It\u2019s not enough to simply save the bike lanes we have right now. If the provincial government wants youth to have affordable transportation, you must work to support municipalities in constructing more bike lanes. The $48 million you plan to waste tearing out bike lanes, and the $10 billion[3] you plan to waste building Highway 413 should instead be invested in improving the province. Whether it\u2019s building more bike lanes, constructing public housing with heat pumps, investing in green jobs, or fixing our healthcare system, that money is badly needed. When we do all of this, Toronto\u2019s youth may have a hope of a future in this city.\nFor the youth of this city, you must stop Bill 212 and invest in Ontario\u2019s future instead.\nFridays For Future TO\nSources:\n[1]: https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmenta\u2026\n[2]:https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/report-cost-removal-bike-lanes-t\u2026\n[3]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ottawa-ontario-deal-highway-413-\u2026.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is not rooted in the facts about transportation and planning. For a lifetime conservative voter like me, it is important the government stands on the side of reason, not emotion, and take a look at information for what it is. It is fiscally irresponsible for the government to invest millions of dollars into biking infrastructure, only to rip it up only a few years later. The cost estimates may indeed be inaccurate, but even a dollar more spent on this issue is too much because these lanes are already in the ground. It has been reported that only 1.2% of Ontarians use these lanes. I don't disagree with this. But not every Ontarian lives in Toronto! Not every Ontarian lives near a good bike lane! But a lot of Torontonians do. Why encroach on someone else's way of life for the sake of someone else's?\nWhether we like it or not, Toronto's population is growing rapidly. An extra 2 lanes on Yonge, Bloor, or University might help gridlock now, but what happens in a few years when there's even more drivers on the road? We can't build more lanes on to these roads, so why don't we work to a more permanent solution so people can enjoy their bikes and others can enjoy their cars?\nI don't know why logical person would go ahead with a plan like this. Ford is losing out on common-sense guys like me.\n"

This will not support small businesses.  This will also cost many more people their lives.\nTo reduce gridlock, encourage and incentivize more people to walk, cycle, use micro-mobility, and transit. Finish the transit projects that are overdue. Better coordinate infrastructure maintenance, repairs, and construction. Remove parking lanes from major streets. Create drop-off/pick-up zones on streets to prevent cars from blocking roadways. Ticket drivers blocking the box. Do not allow building construction to remove street or sidewalk access. Tackle distracted driving.  Tow-truck blitzes to remove cars from parking in no parking/stopping zones.  Encourage people to drive smaller vehicles as they take up less space.\n"
