        "comment": "This is truly terrible policy. Removing these lanes will put the hundreds of people use these lanes daily in danger and will not improve the movement of motor vehicles.\nI can speak for experience - I will not bike along these streets without the lanes. If that is the intention of the policy - congrats, you win. I'll avoid the commute entirely and will visit the restaurants along these streets less frequently or I'll join the traffic in my own car.\nThis type of policy is entirely ideological and the Province is attempting to masquerade it as logical. You are doing a great disservice to the people you are suppose to be governing to make some greater point about your so-called 'War on Cars', and it will lead to deaths of people who are just trying to move around the city they live in.\nPeople will die. I hope you send your thoughts and prayers when they do.\n"

There should be one road like King St. that is used for street cars and a bike lane.  But why is Adelaide one lane (it is a one way street)?  King can't be used and Queen is closed due to construction.  King should be reopened to traffic and Adelaide.  King St. is a ghost road with barely any use.  It is ridiculous.\nThe reason people are not going to work downtown even though they live in the city (me included) is because it is impossible to get in and get out.  A ride that took me 20 minutes is not taking me 50 minutes.  With the patios and the bike lanes, unclean transit (ie homeless people everywhere and being housed there), getting to and from downtown Toronto is unpleasant and not encouraged.\nGet rid of the bike lanes please.\n"

What a waste of the original public investment that went into building this infrastructure.\nI use these routes daily on my commute to work and my family on most weekends as we travel the City. What you are proposing will not only put me at additional risk but the lives of my 7 and 10 year old children.\nIf you want to ease congestion introduce a pricing scheme for non-residents driving through our communities.\n"

I have almost been attacked a few times and can\u2019t afford an Uber.\nWhy are we going backwards as a city?

We need MORE bike lanes, not fewer.  More and more people use bikes for transport and the more streets with bike lanes the safer we all feel.  Taking out bike lanes doesn't \"improve traffic flow\" it just tells us all that a person in a car seemingly matters more than a person on a bike. This would be a huge step backwards.\n"

The separated bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University have helped to make my commute to work both faster and safer. Their removal will not only make commuting slower and more dangerous, it will harm the many local business that have benefitted from better connectivity and safer streets. When this government's ignorance of transportation planning leads to ever worse congestion and danger on our streets, the people of Ontario will not forget.\n"

I suddenly could go and visit a lot of businesses in east York and Scarborough with the woodbine lane. I could for the first time, also ride across town on Bloor. Removing them won\u2019t stop people cycling. All they will do is kill more people on bikes and on foot and on scooters and on mobility devices.\nThis is a terrible proposal and I urge the MPs to not vote for it.\n"

Instead I will drive to work, occupying much more space on a road than previously. It's already faster for me to bike to work, I want it to be safer too. Without the bike lane I can't justify it to my partner why I take the risk every day and as such I'll be another car on an already congested street.\nThis didn't work when Rob Ford did it on Jarvis Street in 2011, when it cost 5x the price of putting it in to rip it out. Look at Jarvis St now! Gridlock.\nI'm a fiscal conservative, I can't vote for the PCs if they keep acting like Doug Ford is a socialist mayor of Toronto with cash to splash around. This is anti-evidence and irresponsible with our money. Accept that Toronto wants these bike lanes and leave us alone.\n"

        "comment": "This entire bill is ludicrous. The province should absolutely not be involved in where bike lanes go in municipalities. Let the municipalities do the due diligence and planning work and stay out of their way. The Province should also NOT be tearing out bike lanes in Toronto that keep people safe! As a driver, I am safer with the bike lanes there to protect people so I don't hit them, and they help to move me more quickly because the cyclists are not in my lane. I do not cycle in Toronto because I don't live near bike lanes and am too scared to bike in traffic. The Annex BIA has said that the bike lanes on Bloor St. have brought MORE business to their shops and restaurants, not less. And as someone who drives that strip, I can tell you that it moves just fine - I have not experience congestion as a driver on Bloor St in the Annex or in Bloor West. On University, the hospital CEOs actually ASKED for the bike lanes so their staff could get to work safely, and you want to rip them out? Stay out of the business of the cities and take care of the provincial matters: healthcare, education, etc.\nWe also don't need to build the 413 highway faster because we shouldn't be building it at all. We don't need another highway that just parallels the existing ones. It's a huge waste of resources and the environmental distruction and impact is enormous. Stop the 413 - get people out of their cars by building more and better transit, and get trucks off the 401 by making arrangements for them to take the 407.\nJust stop all of it: do not move forward with this bill.\n"

There removal will not stop congestion. Round abouts would help ease congestion, better timed traffic lights. As a driver i say leave the bike lanes alone.

        "comment": "When Doug Ford got elected, I remember him proposing policies that would limit government overreach. He talked about red tape reduction and reducing regulation. Should I be surprised that he has apparently reneged on this promise and decided to override the voices of Toronto residents? My wife and I lived on or near Bloor Street for many years (my wife grew up at Jane and Bloor). For decades, cars drove too fast and dangerously, it was loud, and Bloor Street itself was often unpleasant to visit and shop along. I was living near Bloor Street when the first set of bike lanes were opened. Not being able to afford a car, they were a Godsend -- especially given the state of the underfunded TTC. But apparently, if this legislation is to be believed, I'm not the right type of working class person that Ford and the Conservatives care about. I see that Ford wants to make my commute more dangerous and more difficult simply because I cannot afford a car. I find it insulting that apparently my daughter's safety as a pedestrian and a road user is considered \"gridlock\" to Doug Ford. This legislation will, inevitability, lead to more deaths. And it seems that I will now have to pray that my family will not be one of this Bill's victims.\n"

This highway should be properly scrutinized for impacts to wetlands, protected species, cultural heritage and farmland. We should not be pushing it forward just because we can.\nBicycle infrastructure is a key component of a functioning city, allowing people to choose more modes of transportation and reducing the need for unnecessary motor vehicle trips. Making roadways friendly to all is the more sustainable approach to future planning, and is a duty that is best left to individual municipalities.\n"

Ontario has lagged behind in biking infrastructure compared to other provinces and states in North America. To remove what had taken years to complete is an utter disappointment. We should be investing more to make our commutes safer and environmentally friendly. I fail to see a reason as to why this even needs to be debated on. If we want to prevent gridlock, removing bike lanes will categorically make things worse. Having these lanes increases peace of mind and will make more commuters feel safer to bike. I\u2019m appalled this is even up for contention.\n"
