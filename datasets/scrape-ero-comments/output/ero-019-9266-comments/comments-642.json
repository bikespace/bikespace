        "comment": "Please review the COUNTLESS studies that have been done on how bike lanes reduce traffic congestion, increase traffic to local businesses, encourage people to find alternative methods of transportation, and contribute to healthy communities. We have enough plans and bills geared towards cars and vehicular transportation - the last thing this province needs is some other bill that seemingly prioritizes cars (although, as I mentioned, check out the COUNTLESS studies that show bike lanes are a benefit for people driving cars as well!). Instead, let's look at REAL ways to benefit our communities - like more active transportation networks, better public transit, and neighbourhoods where we don't have to rely on cars to get places. This CAN be done and instead of passing some bill that pretends to \"reduce gridlock\", let's think about WHY gridlock actually happens (hint: it has nothing to do with bikes).\n"

This will only increase gridlock, while endangering the many people in this city that rely on the (already limited) bike lane routes of the city. Bikes relieve congestion (imagine each bile were a car), reduce emissions, and are affordable. Ford doesn't care about human life or wellbeing. This bill is truly shameful in every way it possibly could be. His greedy decision making has no place in our city infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "If Bill 212 is passed it not only jeopardizes future developments of safe and protected bike lanes in Ontario it is also a step back in sustainable, community consulted infrastructure. I do not think it will improve traffic, rather it will create more car centric roads therefore leading to more congestion and emissions. We need to take steps in building more sustainable ways of transportation in Ontario and this Bill is misleading and near sighted. I strongly oppose Bill 212 and do not think it is in the best interest of Ontario residents.\n"

        "comment": "The tagine says it all \"saving you time\". This is literally a prioritisation of commute times for people who drive compared to the literal LIVES of people who cycle. I am completely opposed to this bill. Bike lanes don't create more gridlock, if anything they help decrease gridlock, AND they save lives. More bike lanes result in more trips made via bicycle (and fewer by car), which has a positive effect on the environment (reduced emissions) and on the health of both people who cycle (cardiovascular, mental health, etc. improvements and fewer injuries and deaths from collisions with vehicles) and people who live in the area (due to increased air quality). Restrictions on the installation of bikes lanes is 100% a move in the wrong directions. Further, control over decisions regarding road usage should sit with the people who actually live in the area.\n"

The millions spent to remove bike lanes in Toronto would be better served in expansion and support of public transit (Toronto Transit Commission) rather than promoting car travel.\nAs a resident of the city, I think the gridlock is the result of redirection of one way streets into main roads like Bloor. This redirection forces additional traffic that compounds the lane restrictions.\n"

I started to be concerned when safety of bike lanes on Jarvis were traded away for the convenience perceived by a few car drivers. I biked and drove Jarvis, before & after bike lanes. The real difference is at best \"perceived \". Today, Ford is scaring cyclists to challenge the provincial government with a passion. A very frightening depth of horror. I travel and ride all over the world. Toronto was never a human-centric city, and this is the worst it has been. I meet many that are escaping Trump. Our family may need to escape Ford.

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto for over 50 years and have always believed that bikes deserve a safe space for travel including on main arteries like Bloor Street and University Avenue where other safe alternatives do not exist.\nMayor Olivia Chow has explained why the use of bike lanes is important to the overall wellbeing of the city. I am convinced that when she and Premier Ford discuss the issue together, a mutual agreement can be reached that allows for some flexibility in establishing bike lanes on Toronto streets and in other Ontario urban areas.\nLondon England, when facing gridlock, established a premium for parking in the central city. This reduced car use, made public transportation more efficient and increased safety for all travellers. Those who use their cars to reach downtown Toronto will be unhappy at first with this solution but in the longer run will get used to it. The Premier is popular enough with voters that it would be very unlikely that he would lose the next election over a decision to allow the city to charge higher parking fees for downtown.\n"

Conditions have worsened with e-bike delivery people, increasing the need for bike lanes.\nCar usage should be limited to taxi/uber, 3+ passenger vehicles, and cargo vehicles in the city.\nBike lanes give me more confidence that riding a bike will be safe, including at night\n"

It is a vehicle-friendly proposition and does the opposite of what we should be doing. We should not be supporting the use of cars on our roadways. By trying to make our roadways more convenient for drivers, we will create MORE congestion.\nThe proposed removal of bike lanes is ludicrous and will remove the safety measures they provide. I agree with what City of Toronto councillor Josh Matlow said:\n\u201c While Doug Ford is focusing on micromanaging Toronto, he's neglecting a healthcare system that needs improvement, schools that need fixing, vulnerable people across this province who don't have a premier who is for the people. But damn, we can go to 7-11 and buy a cooler now. Isn't that awesome?\"\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not cause gridlock; cars do. If you build more roads, or remove the bike lanes to add another, more cars will drive on them. We have seen this with how many lanes on the 401 now? And the majority of cars carry ONE person. The amount of space a car takes up for ONE person is ludicrous. Perhaps tolls for those who live out of the city and drive in should be implemented? I was against them for a long time, but have changed my tune. Also, maybe we should invest in the TTC instead of wasting more tax payer money on removing bike lanes. I have read that it will cost MORE to remove them than it did to put them in!\nIf the bikes lanes in Toronto are removed, I hope that the car drivers will love even more gridlock when I and my family start biking in the middle of the road. Bike lanes keep cyclists ( as well as drivers and pedestrians) safe. If you build them, they will bike! It just takes some time and patience for folks to feel safe enough to use them.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident and tax payer of Toronto, I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes in Toronto. Evidence consistently shows that bike lanes benefit safety, the environment, local businesses, and urban efficiency.\nImproved Safety: Bike lanes significantly reduce collisions. For example, the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street led to a 71% reduction in conflicts between cars and cyclists, making roads safer for everyone, including drivers and pedestrians. Research consistently shows that investments in cycling infrastructure improve public safety and reduce injuries. A review of transportation studies highlights that protected bike lanes and other cycling-specific infrastructure significantly lower the rates of crashes and injuries compared to roads without such measures. By designing roadways to prioritize safety for cyclists, municipalities can substantially mitigate traffic-related risks and create environments where active transportation is safer and more accessible\nBoosting Local Economy: Studies on Bloor Street demonstrated that bike lanes increased foot and bicycle traffic, with customers arriving by these means spending more and visiting more frequently than those who drove. Merchants reported stable or improved customer counts and economic activity after bike lanes were introduced.\nEnvironmental and Health Benefits: Encouraging cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions and promotes healthier lifestyles, alleviating public health costs and combating climate change.\nReduced Congestion: By enabling more people to opt for bicycles, bike lanes alleviate car traffic and improve commute times. This helps cities function more efficiently while reducing noise and air pollution.\nRemoving bike lanes undermines the city's goals for sustainable, safe, and accessible transportation. Instead of reverting to outdated urban planning that prioritizes cars, we should expand cycling infrastructure to create a greener, healthier, and more vibrant Toronto. Please reconsider this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "As a bike rider for decades, living downtown Toronto, I have felt considerably more safe with the installation of bike lanes. I move back and forth along Bloor St. quite a bit, and I'm happy to relieve traffic congestion by using my bike, and to contribute to healthier living by reducing car emissions and exercising my body at the same time. Please don't use the issue of congestion as a reason to go backwards and add more cars to these roads. Ripping out bike lanes would be a waste of money, increase congestion, and clearly would make bike riding more dangerous. Instead of dividing people on this issue, the government should be protecting people, and promoting the use of bicycles for all the obvious health factors and for reducing congestion. Please provide leadership that is forward thinking for all, in the bigger picture of safety and environmental factors, and reducing congestion by encouraging alternatives to driving cars in the downtown core. The rhetoric of the government right now promotes anger and division, cars against bikes, which can only lead to more anger and division and less safety.\n"

        "comment": "I am familiar with transportation research. This proposed policy tells me you have not done any research in the area, because if you had you would know about concepts like induced demand. Or perhaps you would have considered the limitations of using Statistics Canada commute data to characterize the cycling participation of the population - you should know better than to assume that commutes capture every type of cyclist I.e. someone riding their bike to grocery shopping or a dentist would not be captured. Your intentional blindness, or unintentional ignorance, demonstrates that either way you are a deeply unserious government undeserving of the power you have to make these policies. This terrible proposal will contribute to the deaths of multiple people who use a bicycle, if it moves forward. Please do better and think about equity. Do not continue with this useless piece of legislation that will not only harm cyclists, but make  automobile traffic much worse.\n"
