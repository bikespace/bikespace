        "comment": "I am opposed to Bill 212 in its entirety, as its content has been developed with little to no supporting data. Provincial transportation policy should not be developed on the back of a napkin by the owners of Bloor West businesses who have access to the Minister's ear.\nGridlock is a serious issue in Ontario, and increasing the use of private motor vehicles will do nothing to help those who have no choice but to drive on their commutes. If the Minister took the contents of this bill\u2014specifically the portion about bike lanes\u2014and showed it to any lawmaker in Japan, the Netherlands, or Singapore (anywhere where transportation planning is done with care, and common sense), they would laugh in his face. This is terribly unserious policy that, in the long run, will make our province less competitive and less livable.\nInstead of wasting countless hours (and taxpayer money!) to get in the way of municipal planning, the Minister should focus on the one thing that will truly alleviate gridlock in the province's most populated areas\u2014regional rail. It is terribly ironic for the Minister to pen an article in The Star bemoaning his commute from Brampton (by car), while not using this platform to raise awareness of the GO Expansion project, one of the most important transit expansions on the continent.\nFocus on solutions that will actually help drivers, transit users, people cycling and walking\u2014Bill 212 isn't it.\n"

        "comment": "Spending the same amount of money (if not more) to remove bike lanes in Toronto as it cost to install the bike lanes is ridiculous.  This is not a good use of taxpayers money.  Research shows that bike lanes do in fact help to reduce traffic congestion in the long term.  Expanding bike lanes can help reduce congestion long term as can improving our mass transit.  We must take a long term approach.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I use the Bloor Street bike lane to commute to and from work every day between Christie Street and Sherbourne Street. Removing this bicycle lane will make my commute more dangerous, and it will not reduce car commute times, which are caused by endless construction and lack of viable alternatives to car travel in many parts of the city. Sharing a lane with cars is frightening and dangerous. I do it every day because cars often block the bike lanes. I recently had a near miss on Wellesley Street East. A cement truck was blocking the bike lane so I was forced to merge into the car lane in front a car. The driver didnt like me in front of him so he passed me, leaving centimeters between him and me and the cement truck. Fewer bike lanes will make incidents like this more and more common. More injuries, more cyclist deaths. Harbord Street is currently under construction and even more dangerous. Plus it ends at Parliament Street in the east and Ossington in the west, and neither of those streets have bike lanes to connect to other east-west streets that do. Please do not remove these lanes. People depend on them for safe, sustainable transportation. Do the right thing. Cancel this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Excessive reliance on cars is what has led to our current traffic problems, and doubling down on the use of personal automobiles certainly won't improve the situation. I am very much opposed to the building of the 413 in the first place and removing the environmental review process only guarantees that it will have an even greater negative impact that it needs to.\nProvincial overreach on bike lanes is so obviously a political play that it would be funny if it didn't mean increased risks for vulnerable road users, as well as ensuring an increase in cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "There are two issues here:\n1. The implementation of a \u201creview\u201d from the provincial govt for proposed bike lanes. Municipalities have already shown that their transportation process is glacial, so adding additional review from stakeholders (who really hold no stake) is only going to slow down this process and keep Toronto behind in their transportation planning. Toronto is already so far behind large cities in the implementation of bike lanes, we need more and we need them fast. Delaying them for review from the provincial govt when that govt has other objectives doesn\u2019t help Torontonians or those visiting Toronto. Frankly it feels like meddling from outsiders that don\u2019t understand the needs of people who live and work downtown.\n2. Bike lanes are already reducing traffic congestion!! According to a Toronto study, >6000 people use the Bloor bike lane everyday. The amount of space 6000 cars would take up is exponentially more than a bike lane (to note the bike lane isn\u2019t even a full lane width). Studies have proven time and time again that more lanes to not equal less traffic, and it\u2019s a poor excuse put on by the govt. Right now Toronto needs to be forward thinking; bike lanes are safer, bike lanes are faster, bike lanes reduce admissions, bike lanes create happier and healthier people, and bike lanes reduce traffic congestion.\nPlease don\u2019t waste tax payer dollars on such a backward thinking policy.\nMore bike lanes now.\n-Toronto driver and cyclist\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important alternative mode of transit in a very busy city like Toronto. I bike from as my primary form of getting around.  The proposals in this bill will mean I am less safe on the roads. I worry it will increase drivers\u2019 feeling of entitlement to the road, jeopardizing safety of me and all other cyclists.\nFurther, the data used to justify the removal or need for approval of bike lanes is not clear. It appears the province used old and inaccurate data. Other data I have seen supports the need for more bike lanes, not less, and shows a significant increase in usage of bike lanes over time.\nThe province must know about induced demand. These decisions will do nothing to improve vehicle congestion in this city. But it will significantly and negatively impact many cyclists safety and accessibility.\nI do not support the spending of tax payer dollars on this endeavour. This is a waste of money, time and public service resources. I am ashamed of our provincial government in this matter.\nPlease work with the city and reconsider these proposals.\n"

On one hand you promote eco friendly transport like bicycles and on the other hand want to spend $48M to rip out the bike lanes so more folks can drive more cars on the same roads.\nMore grid lock should cause people to consider less traffic congestion methods to get where they need to be.\n$48 M of our tax dollars should be spent somewhere else.\n"

        "comment": "I am an avid cyclist. Most of my cycling is away from areas with a lot of traffic. When I have to share the road with motorists, there are often motorist who disrespect me and endanger my life by not giving me any space. Often it is because they don't like cyclists. Often it is because they do not notice me. When I have contacted to police with actual video, I am under the impression most times they don't care because I have not been hit. Doesn't matter that there is a 1m law. On one occasion, an OPP officer told me that he would speak with the driver because a friend (fellow officer?) was hit by a car.\nWhen I do occasionally ride in Toronto, I find it much safer when I am on the \"Weston\" trail along the railway and the bike lanes in the \"city\". Once I leave the safety of the these trails/lanes, it becomes much more dangerous as I am routinely confronted by motorists who yell at me to get off the road or those who endanger my life. One could say the difference between riding where there are bike lanes and without bike lanes is like night and day. I have been confronted by motorists in my town (Bradford) as many of these motorists just want to race through Bradford to get to their destination; Bradford, and cyclists, are just in the way.\nIf you want to reduce congestion, reduce the number of vehicles that enter the \"city\". Make parking way more expensive (tax) and provide fewer motorized vehicle lanes. The plan to reduce bike lanes is \"backwards\" and will only increase congestion.\nI have been hit in Toronto (driver stopped and appologised). Nothing broken but sore for several days. When I have contacted the police, they asked me to attend a reporting centre. I think the law says police must be called to all accidents involving pedestrians, cyclists and those using mobility devices.\n"

I don't want uber eats, door dashers or any delivery person having to be in more danger in the road. I walk very often on the side walk and I don't want to get hit by a bike. I also drive. I do not want to hit a biker and the traffic is already horrific in toronto. If we get rid of bike lanes, there will be MORE CARS IN THE ROAD = MORE TRAFFIC.  There is no amount of lane opening that will solve the problem. If you drove in toronto, you would understand that it is not a lack of lanes that causes the horrific traffic. It is the lack of alternatives to driving.\n"

I am a mother of three young kids and I now have to worry that I will be risking my life and their future every single day simply to get to work. I understand that Mr. Ford and several other ministers find their commute to work frustratingly slow and I sympathize. I hate getting stuck in traffic too (I'm also a driver as many who bike are) but I feel like my right to a safe trip should trump them saving 10 minutes on their commute from the suburbs. I'd like to say that I expect better from this government but of course I don't. Just know this will be remembered and it's going in my obituary if I'm killed by an entitled driver. PS. Should we expect all the sidewalks to be removed too? Surely that would save drivers up to five minutes a day!\n"
