They provide a reliable, efficient, and environmentally friendly method to support local businesses. They also increase the safety of all road users. Their removal will not improve traffic. It will increase dangerous interactions between automobiles and bicycles. It will lead to more injuries and deaths. It will cost money that would be better prioritized on healthcare or enforcement.\n"

I also drive (occasionally) and can appreciate cities where traffic lights are synchronized to help traffic move.  Perhaps more one way streets?  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one solution, there must be a way to have both options (including increased spending on Public Transit) like in most large cities around the globe.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am quite concerned about this bill as it relates to the removal of bike lanes. Time and time again there has been research and data showing that the only viable method to reducing congestion is by offering alternative modes of transportation. I fail to see how removing viable alternative of transportation will reduce congestion when those cyclist will now likely have to get into a car and add to the congestion.\nIn addition, I pose this question. Why does the provincial government need to be concerned with what is very much a municipal matter? I am a physician here in Ontario and instead of the provincial government attempting to manage our current healthcare crisis including increased \"hallway medicine\", the exodus of workers especially nurses, addressing issues of accessibility of healthcare, taking reasonable steps to offset the costs and increased care needs of our aging population, we instead have a government focusing its resources on needing to seek approval whether a town puts a single bike lane on a road.\nIt seems to me to be absolutely a waste of everyone's time and shows once again much like the closure of the OSC, the license plate change, the removal than reinstatement of reduced cost for transfers from municipal transit to GO transit, the $250,000,000 price tag to offer beer in our alternative venues, the court decision to strike down 1% pay raise for healthcare workers after the most stressful moments of our career with the Covid-19 pandemic and so many other inept decisions by this government, that this is nothing more than a distraction to pass through legislation to reduce environmental review to build new highways that are not needed.\nIf this bill should pass, the least this government should do is show the data once it inevitably shows it did not reduce congestion and instead resulted in increased induced demand.\nSincerely,\nA burnt out healthcare worker wanting alternative transit methods\n"

Let the city of Toronto and its elected officials deal with what\u2019s best for us and our individual streets.\nThe bike infrastructure is the result of *decades* of planning and teamwork across a wide political spectrum, involving numerous traffic studies, political ideologies and interested parties.\nStreets are not just randomly changed to have bike infrastructure. There is already a robust system In place of consultants, engineers, elected officials, and frankly, years of unnecessary traffic deaths.\nIt is not the provinces place undo the work of the community. People need to be willing to drive more carefully in cities as dense as Toronto - not faster.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who landed in one of Toronto's trauma units following a bike crash whose cause can be directly tied to the implementation of the Bloor St bike lanes, one might think I would be opposed to bike lanes. The opposite is true. I am strongly in favour of bike lanes.\nFor the vast majority of cyclists, the general feeling is that bike lanes provide a much safer alternative to riding amongst cars. However, the implementation of the bike lanes, at least on Bloor St has been poor as it attempted to accommodate moving cars, stationary/parked cars, and cyclists. That result has been a maze of turns, elevations, and distractions.\nIn my case, I collided with a parking curb placed perpendicular, by design, to the direction of travel of cars and bikes.\nI wish to make two points (neither of which are related to costs, fitness, environment, or other items that others will surely raise).\nFirstly, with abundant parking in the Green P lots across Bloor St., it seems more productive to view roadways/highways as platforms to allow the movement of people. Viewed this way, parking of cars is a detriment to the purpose of the roadway. In very practical terms and before the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor St in Bloor West Village, Bloor St was effectively, although not in design, a 1-lane road in each direction owing to the layout of parking spaces in a few locations. This created bottlenecks and gridlock that cascaded through the area.\nSecondly, in the absence of a change to the Highway Traffic Act, cyclists will continue to have the privilege of effectively occupying a full lane (I know the act is more subtle than I've stated). That places them directly amongst cars. By not continuing to provide separation between cars and bicycles, the government would be returning to a state of increased risk of collisions and increasing the legal liability for the users of the the roadway (both cyclists and drivers). I am quite certain that cyclists would prefer decreased risks while riding. I am also sure that drivers, if they weighted the options, would prefer the same.\n"

First, I disagree because this legislation sets Ontario and Toronto on the wrong track. We should not be building infrastructure that encourages more people to drive. This will only induce more demand and create more congestion instead of less. Instead we should invest in public transportation especially the subway and GO Train. Second, I don't think the province should overrule decisions by the city of Toronto. The city council was elected by the people of Toronto and is best placed to represent the needs of the residents of the city - not the government of Ontario. This is a huge waste of money and resources.\n"

        "comment": "https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-9266\nPlease remove the bike lanes on Bloor, cyclists have Dupont/Annette and Harbord. West of Ossington, these bikes lanes are never used.\nThis is a failed pilot project, so we need to quickly remove it.\nIn Etobicoke, and Bloor West I regularly count 1 bicycle for every 50-100 cars. I do see more bicyclists east of high park, but for the most part these lanes are empty.\nAs a bicyclist, I never use these bike lanes, we have plenty of safer parallel side roads.\nAs a driver, these bike lanes double my commute time, and increase my fuel consumption by about 33%. Only 15 years ago I was driving out from St. George/Bloor to Etobicoke at the speed limit in rush hour traffic when Dupont was a 4 lane road. Drivers lost Dupont, but with Annette being an ideal bike road this is a compromise drivers were forced to make.\nBloor at South Kingsway now has traffic reaching Old Mill during rush hour.\nBloor never had any traffic in Etobicoke, and now it's bumper to bumper at Royal York and at Kipling. Since Bloor is bumper to bumper at Royal York, more cars have been using side roads to avoid Bloor. Cars have been taking Glenroy Ave, Meadowvale Dr, King George's Road, etc to avoid Bloor as a result of these bike lanes.\nBy removing these bike lanes, Etobicoke commuters are Force to drive on side streets. We aren't going to switch to bike when our daily commutes are 50km+, especially not in the icy winter or hot summers.\nThese bike lanes at Bloor and Dufferin end up diverting vehicles traffic onto Wallace Ave, in front of a school. That's not acceptable, someone in a rush will end up hitting a child. Please remove the bike lanes on Bloor\nPlease also redesign the Kipling/Bloor/Dundas intersection. At the very least time Kipling/Bloor and Dundas/Bloor so that the lights turn green for North/South traffic at the same time. Add a 2nd left turn lane on Kipling North to both Bloor and Dundas as cars are always backlogged from the turn lane into regular traffic.\nI recommend that one of the intersections be a bridge like before. Two major intersections within 100m of each other just don't work. Making Bloor a bridge over Kipling would solve all of the congestion.\nIntersections like Bloor/Kipling, Bloor/Royal York, Bloor/South Kingsway, Bloor/Symington, Bloor/Duffering used to all be virtually traffic free and take 1 minutes to cross. Now it's not uncommon to be stuck for 10 minutes as cars proceed single file while the bike lanes remain empty.\nIf the city needs bike lanes, please keep them on side roads like you do downtown. Turn roads like Hepborne St and Dewson St into 1 way roads, and put a dedicated bike lane on one side of the road. Put signs on Bloor to guide bikes to the bike lanes on Annette/Dupont and Harbord and if needed make some North/South roads like Perth 1 way with a dedicated bike lane, so that Bloor bicyclists have a safe route to Dupont/Annette.\nI strongly urge Toronto to remove the bike lanes off Bloor and restore Bloor to a 4 lane road. In locations you refuse to remove bike lanes, please remove permanent parking cutouts so we can still have 4 lanes of traffic.\nAs for University, please remove the bike lanes completely. Turning University from an 8 lane road into a 4 lane road is unacceptable. Whenever cars are turning both left and right at an intersection, there is no free lane to pass traffic. University and Gerrand is particularly bad because going northbound, frequently cars are turning both ways, blocking traffic.\nThere is no need for a bike lane on University when St. George, Beverly, McCaul, Peter and Simcoe St are all parallel to University and have bike lanes still well under capacity.\nIf you remove lanes of traffic for bike lanes, you will force drivers to commute long distances on side roads. This is unacceptable, we need to keep the 3,500lb cars on artery roads and the much lighter and slower bicycles on side roads, on dedicated bike paths.\nPlease also finish that temporary bridge on Dowling Ave. If you get rid of that bridge support and extend the Jameson on ramp, you could make the on ramp safe much longer, much safer, and have it open all the time, reducing congestion.\nThank You\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my profound disappointment and vehement opposition to the proposed removal of Toronto's bike lanes, an unnecessary and misguided intervention into city planning that undermines our community\u2019s safety and prosperity. This unilateral decision to interfere with local infrastructure not only sidesteps municipal authority but also poses a real threat to the safety of all road users\u2014cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians alike. It will waste millions of taxpayer dollars while achieving no measurable improvement to traffic flow or road use efficiency.\nBike lanes are a critical part of our urban infrastructure. They are not a luxury or a side project but a necessity for the safe and efficient movement of people within our densely populated city. Removing these lanes disregards evidence-backed data on how multimodal infrastructure enhances traffic flow, reduces collisions, and ultimately promotes a healthier, more sustainable city. There is no research that supports the claim that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion or improve travel times in a meaningful way; in fact, studies repeatedly show that bike lanes improve traffic flow and reduce overall congestion in the long term. This decision demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of modern urban planning and Toronto\u2019s specific needs.\nFurthermore, the millions of dollars necessary for this project could be far better spent on initiatives that actually address our province\u2019s needs\u2014whether in healthcare, housing, or public education. Toronto\u2019s residents, who have invested time, effort, and money into the city\u2019s active transportation networks, deserve their voices and decisions to be respected by provincial leadership, not trampled by unnecessary and costly interferences.\nI urge you to respect Toronto\u2019s right to self-governance and immediately halt these actions. Allow our elected city council to work with local stakeholders to determine the infrastructure that best supports Toronto\u2019s needs. This overreach does not serve the people of Toronto, nor does it align with the values of safety, sustainability, and fiscal responsibility that our community holds dear.\n"
