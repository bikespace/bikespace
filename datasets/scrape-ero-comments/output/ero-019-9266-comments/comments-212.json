        "comment": "I do not support this bill.\nI do not like how it attempts to take away municipalities' ability to decide their own traffic needs, especially with bike lanes that, despite Doug Ford's ignorance, reduce gridlock rather than increase it. There's some 40 years of data on this and at this point Ford is either being intentionally ignorant or deliberately malicious.\nI also do not support how this bill will bypass regulations and force provincial engineers to take a deal that would pay them significantly less than what they're worth and likely result in the privatization of the engineers, which was a bad idea when Mike Harris did it, and is still a bad idea now.\nBut most of all, I do not support this giving highway 413 an exemption from environmental assessments. That has to the most malicious thing Ford has proposed, especially when it's public knowledge that his planned route for 413 goes through some very environmentally sensitive areas, let alone the pollution created by making and running the highway. This makes it abundantly clear Ford does not care about the people of Ontario and their long term health, and that he should leave politics immediately\n"

        "comment": "I see several problems with the bike lane proposals.\n- Local governments are better placed than the more remote provincial government to assess the impact of bike lanes on local traffic flow.\n- There are both environmental and personal health benefits to cycling rather than driving. Having more dedicated bike lanes encourages more people to cycle rather than driving.\n- Having more lanes for car traffic gives a short-term increase in speed but no long-term benefit as these lanes fill up with additional cars. Better public transportation and provisions for active transportation are more effective ways to address clogged roads.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea I am completely opposed to. Notwithstanding concerns if bike lanes either help dissipate traffic or if they make it worse, it is a gross overreach of power by the province. This bill interferes with municipal autonomy, further making them subservient to the province. Although this is legally within the province\u2019s right, it is a massive breach of public trust and of people\u2019s rights to self determination. This is my primary issue with this bill, but I have further issues with its goals of reducing congestion. Bike lanes, when implemented correctly, have been shown to ease traffic as they incentivize more people to cycle because the lanes are physically there. If they are not there, then people will be forced to drive leading to more cars on the road and more congestion. Bloor, Danforth, University, Yonge, etc are all streets with both bike lanes and subway lines. These streets give people options: subway, ride a bike, or drive. By removing bike lanes, this increases congestion on the roads (requiring more money to be spent on traffic management), on the subway (requiring billions spent on capacity improvements), and requires future governments to foot the theoretically higher bill to re-install them when future governments inevitably decide to do this. So not only is this bill trampling on the roots of democracy by its attacks on the people\u2019s right of self-determination, it also is heavily regressive, and likely to put a substantial cost on re-installing bike lanes in the future. This is not a bill that has any place in a modern progressive society.\n"

        "comment": "Good afternoon,\nI am deeply disappointed with the proposed bill and I am strongly against it, specifically in regards to the bike plane provisions.\nFirst, I am very surprised that a conservative government wants to be so involved in municipal affairs (determining which streets should have a bike lane), resembling a nanny state. I thought the conservative government would be in favour of small government and less intervention in municipal affairs, not the opposite.\nSecond, removing existing bike lanes is a complete waste of our hard earned money. I am a car driving, taxpaying home-owner. I can understand if additional scrutiny would be placed on new/proposed projects that are funded by the province, but removing existing bike lanes is a complete petty overreaction. I thought that a conservative government who claims to care about safeguarding our tax dollars would have eliminated wasteful spending like this proposal.\nThird, the proposal will not aleviate congestion. Study after study has shown that adding car lanes only worsens traffic due to induced demand. Providing alternatives such as public transit and bike lanes is the best way to reduce congestion. This proposed bill makes the Ontario government look like its run by a bunch of amateurs.\nLet municipalities make their own infrastructure decisions and cancel this bill!\n"

What I have seen is data showing that business has improved for business owners along Bloor with the bike lanes there. Cp24 just released a report today with owners saying they oppose removing the bike lanes.\nOn top of that, bike lanes make it safer for people to get around by bike and will encourage more people to choose biking over taking a car.\nSome car drivers may think bike lanes don't get used enough but that's probably because the bike lanes aren't full of gridlocked traffic.\nThe data shows bike lanes are good for Toronto. The premier is merely trying to win votes from people that don't actually live in this city.\nAlso, it is an amoral overreach for a provincial government to have this kind of say over municipal affairs. Stay out of Toronto, Doug.\n"

        "comment": "Repeated studies have shown that bike lanes eventually reduce gridlock.  I moved to Toronto in 1976.  Traffic was awful.  Now, almost 50 years later, we have the same streets and same highways within the city.  There are also more than twice the number of cars, although the streets are no wider.  You can't tear down homes and lawns to make them wider.\nMany solutions have been tried in other cities.  London, UK, for example imposed a tax on vehicles coming from outside.  Not sure how successful that was.  Other European cities (yes they too have winters), have embraced cycling.\nWe seem focused strictly on cars, but all one needs to do is look on the Gardiner Expressway to see what more and more cars causes.  Something has to give.  Bike lanes are ONE solution.  However, only where they make sense.  I'm inclined to favour properly thought through solutions to implement these.  Bloor Street makes sense.  It's wide enough to accommodate them.  North Yonge Street makes NO sense.  Spadina, Bathurst, University Avenue, etc are excellent locations for these.  Smaller and more restricted streets are not.\nThe Province's solution of banning cycling lanes seems poorly thought through.  It ignores the increasing traffic congestion and pretends that allowing more and more cars is the solution.  Just as you can only put so much water through a garden hose...you can only accommodate so many cars on our current roads.  Can't do more.  Can't build more roads, so common sense logic suggests looking for alternatives.  The current government doesn't appear to be thinking this through.\n"

        "comment": "Limiting bike lanes is counterproductive to improving the commuter experience and health of residents of the cities of Ontario.  Studies world-wide show that more bike traffic is better for reducing congestion and gridlock, that bicycles provide better use of and throughput for city space.  Bicycles also produce far less pollution than cars.  We should not be preferring or advantaging development for cars over that for bicycles -- in fact it should be the reverse.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a stunt intended to scapegoat cyclists for a traffic congestion crisis that is the fruit of decades of short-sighted planning policy. It flies knowingly and brazenly in the face of academic research and proven best practices in congestion reduction and street design. It will cost millions, worsen traffic, and create a bureaucratic bottleneck that will slow infrastructure planning and street design projects to an even more glacial pace than Ontario is already suffering. It represents another instance of drastic provincial overreach into municipal affairs. It also dangerously brands cyclists as the adversaries of motorists - something that may inspire a minority of reckless and irresponsible motorists to put vulnerable road users' lives in danger.\nCity streets and highways cannot indefinitely accommodate an endlessly increasing volume of private car traffic. This is a battle we have been losing constantly since the mid-twentieth century, at staggering public expense. The only proven way to reduce congestion is to get cars off the road by providing safe and effective alternate transportation. Bicycle lanes are by a huge stretch the cheapest and most efficient infrastructure by which to provide this alternative. Even if we set all of this aside, legislators should seriously ask themselves: will cars really move faster in lanes shared with cyclists?\nIf the government was serious about desiring a reduction in \"gridlock\", it would: 1) commit to a massive expansion of our public transport infrastructure so that people do not have to sit in car traffic to get around; 2) encourage medium-density, transit-oriented, publicly-funded infill development to allow more people to affordably live closer to their jobs rather than face a long commute; 3) support a congestion reduction cordon around major cities to replicate the success of London (UK), Stockholm, and Milan in reducing unnecessary car traffic; 4) remove street parking on major thoroughfares.\n"

        "comment": "What a poorly thought out bill. It makes no sense to me that the province has spent millions on essential infrastructure for the cyclists in our city, only to spend more money to take them down. Studies have proven time and time again that bike lanes reduce congestion/traffic, create an economic boom on streets such as bloor (that has less cars than foot traffic and cyclists as per the bloor bike lane study), reduce cyclist-related injury/death and reduce pollution and smog.\nWhy are we punishing people that are too poor to afford cars in the city? Why are we forcing these people to rely on an inaccessible and unreliable transit system? Why are we letting the province dictate where bike lanes can go when this is a municipal issue?\nThere is so much wrong with this, and this is such a clear ploy to appeal to the 905ers next voting season that hate bike lanes. Make it make sense!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, specifically the framework that prevents the construction of new bike lanes and mandates the removal of existing bike lanes to make room for additional car lanes. Not only does this undermine sustainable urban planning efforts, but it also disregards the well-established principle of induced demand, which suggests that adding car lanes may temporarily alleviate congestion but ultimately results in even more traffic over time.\nFurthermore, I believe that decisions regarding bike lanes within cities and municipalities should remain under the jurisdiction of local governments. This bill represents an overreach by the provincial government, encroaching on matters that should be democratically handled at the municipal level. If Premier Doug Ford desires control over city-specific decisions like transportation infrastructure, he should run for mayor, not attempt to impose centralized control from the provincial level.\nLocal governments have distinct responsibilities that reflect the needs and preferences of their constituents, and citizens elect these governments to address local issues. This bill disregards those democratic choices, stripping communities of the autonomy to shape their own transportation systems.\nThe evidence is clear: according to research by the UK Department for Transport, expanding road capacity for cars does not resolve congestion but exacerbates it through induced demand. Likewise, findings from the Wuppertal Institute emphasize that investments in active transportation, such as cycling infrastructure, are more effective in reducing long-term gridlock than simply adding car lanes. Cities worldwide are realizing this, as seen in Paris, where dedicated bike lanes have reduced car dependency, lowered emissions, and improved urban mobility.\nBill 212\u2019s framework, which restricts bike lane development and promotes car-centric infrastructure, feels undemocratic and authoritarian. This approach not only fails to address congestion sustainably but also centralizes control, undermining the principles of local governance. I urge the government to respect the autonomy of municipalities to make decisions that are best suited for their unique urban contexts and to reconsider this anti-democratic approach.\nThank you for considering this perspective.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and I am very accustomed to gridlock and traffic. I get around the city by walking, transiting, biking, and driving my car. I am very frustrated with this misguided idea that bike lanes are causing the congestion in cities and not the lack of investment in public and inter-city transit. In fact, more bike lanes means more people getting around the city by biking and less unnecessary cars on the road.\nAs a driver, I am so concerned that this barrier for municipalities to install bike lanes will make less bike lanes possible meaning more cars on the road. Bikers will still need to use the road and without bike lanes they will be more vulnerable and much more likely to be injured by cars.\nAlso, biking is more affordable than driving. There are so many people who cannot afford or do not want a car while living in a city. Bike lanes give everyone access while keeping everyone safer.\nThis government's dogmatic anti-science-based policies based on removing access for people is infuriating. Just leave the bike lanes alone and invest in the things Ontario citizens have been asking for forever: Greenbelt and nature protections, better transit, and for Doug Ford to stop giving taxes away to his friends' businesses!\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is a perfect example of how a near-sighted and irrational urban vision can hamper true progress.\nWhether judged on the basis of road space, carbon emissions, travel time, health, or numerous other factors, cycling within congested urban centres has been shown time and again to be a far superior and responsible mode of transport than driving vehicles. This is not a hypothesis, one can see it demonstrated in various countries around the world, especially Europe.\nToronto suffers from deep-rooted transport issues due to infrastructural limitations exacerbated by an ever-growing population. This bill chooses to worsen the problem by rewarding the wealthy, and promoting the most inefficient and environmentally damaging modes of transport.\n"
