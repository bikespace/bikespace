The safety of the bike lanes make that travel possible without constantly having to watch out for cars driving by on one side while hoping that the cars on the other side do not open their door right on you.\nRemoving the bike lanes will make my travel around the city which I live in harder and more dangerous as well nothing but more traffic due to construction.\n"

Bike lanes allow many people who live in the downtown core to get from one place to another. We are talking about people who may not even have any other means to travel due to income.\nBike lanes don\u2019t add to congestion - when there are more options and infrastructure in Toronto for bikers these are all options for everyone else too! It will help free up more space on roads because people are either biking, walking, or taking commute to work.\nAnd lastly, genuinely think about why we even need this much motor vehicle traffic in Toronto??? Most people who work in the core HAVE to commute in from other parts of the GTA using the subway or GO trains. Why do we need more room for cars when we should be making these pathways accessible to the working people who enjoy walking or biking at there lunch time.\n"

        "comment": "As a conservative voter I oppose this bill. The money should be going into rapid transit, not more highways. Also, stay out of city business, bike lanes are the responsibility of the cities, not a micro managing Premier. As a conservative, I object to big government, and that's what this is. Overspending big government.\n"

        "comment": "I am generally pro-business but have some serious concerns about the proposed legislation to require municipalities to apply for and receive approval from the province should they wish build a bike lane that would remove a car traffic lane.  Relatedly, I do not agree with the propose legislation\u2019s empowering the province to remove cycling infrastructure should it not meet their car traffic-centric criteria.\nFirstly, this change will increase the number of cyclist deaths in our province.  As vehicles (defined by the HTA) cyclists will often choose the fastest route and if this is on a road without cycling infrastructure (such as bicycle lanes) there will be more collisions, resulting in increased injuries and deaths.  Beyond the increased physical and social harm, this will reduce our province\u2019s economic productivity.  Possible alternative routes for bicycle lanes (away from main corridors) are festooned with stop signs and other features that cannot, because of the primary function of those roads, be sufficiently altered so as to provide a time-efficient route for cycling.\nCycling is good for the health of Ontarians.  We should encourage this mode of transport as it is a form disease-preventing exercise and it reduces the number polluting (in their production and operation) automobiles in a community.  Convincing evidence that there is a net reduction in the viability of businesses that are located on streets that have lost car traffic lanes so that cycling infrastructure can be installed is something that I do not believe exists.   Further, even if such changes does negatively affect a subset of businesses, like any change in the marketplace, the businesses that can adapt by, for instance, moving locations or altering their method of producing/getting their product to consumers, will be rewarded.  It is the same for any other change in the economic landscape.\nFinally, this proposal is anti-democratic.  The municipal governments voted into office by the citizens of a municipality should have the authority to oversee the development of the transportation policies for their municipality.  If they do a poor job at this then trust the electorate to bounce them out of office.  It is a hit to our democracy to see the Province of Ontario propose this legislation that tramples on the rights of the people living in the affected municipalities.  The Province may not agree with a municipality\u2019s transportation policy, but it should abide by their right to set it.  Is not the Conservative Party of Canada supposed to be the defender of our democratic rights?  This intrusionary legislation suggests that they can be tempted take the route that seems expedient even if it is not a democratic one\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, which would require provincial approval for all new bike lanes in Ontario, has raised significant concerns based on evidence from urban planning experts and best practices. Here's why such a proposal could be detrimental, particularly when considering lessons from the Netherlands, Strong Towns principles, and the insights from Not Just Bikes:\n1. Bike Infrastructure Reduces Gridlock for Drivers\nThe Netherlands demonstrates that integrating bike-friendly infrastructure benefits all road users, including drivers. By providing safe and convenient alternatives to driving, more people choose to bike or walk, reducing car traffic. As research shows, reducing cars on the road translate into less congestion and better travel experiences for drivers. In contrast, urban planning research shows that prioritizing car-centric infrastructure tends to induce demand\u2014meaning more roads attract more cars, leading to gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n2. Economic and Community Benefits\nThe Strong Towns movement highlights how bike infrastructure is a cost-effective investment that strengthens communities. Bike lanes encourage compact, walkable urban areas that reduce the need for costly car-centric infrastructure like wide roads and sprawling parking lots. They also support local businesses by increasing foot and bike traffic, which has been shown to boost economic activity in city centers.\n3. Safety and Quality of Life\nDutch cities prioritize safety through dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian infrastructure, reducing traffic fatalities significantly compared to North America. This focus creates an environment where all modes of transport\u2014cars, bikes, and public transit\u2014coexist more safely and efficiently. Bill 212's centralized control could delay these improvements, keeping unsafe conditions in place.\n4. How Bike Lanes Benefit Drivers\nIn Amsterdam, where bike and public transit options are robust, those who drive benefit from less traffic and faster commutes. In cities without these alternatives, everyone is forced to drive, creating the gridlock many Ontario drivers are familiar with. Investing in bikes and transit reduces this dependency, freeing up road space for those who genuinely need to drive.\n5. Local Decision-Making is More Effective\nCentralizing bike lane approval risks stalling or blocking essential projects. Local governments are better positioned to understand the specific needs of their communities and implement bike infrastructure tailored to their urban environments. The Netherlands achieved success by empowering cities to innovate and adapt, which Bill 212 would hinder.\nBy drawing from these proven strategies, Ontario can reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and enhance the quality of life for drivers and non-drivers alike. Restricting bike lane development through Bill 212 moves in the opposite direction, perpetuating car dependency, and the traffic and gridlock it creates.\n"

        "comment": "What a waste of time and money.\nIt's overreach to decide what a municipality should do with their bike lanes. We should be encouraging more people to bike, not fewer. As a driver, I would prefer for bike lanes so that I know everyone is safe on the roads. I don't live in Toronto and don't really care what Toronto does. But I know that bike lanes are safe and are used. It's a waste of money to tear them up after money was spent building them. I genuinely can't believe this is a real bill because what a waste of everyone's time to address something that's actually the opposite of a problem.\n"

Let municipalities and cities decide what is best with respect to bike lanes and street planning.\nAlso, the bike lane issue is such a small section of this Bill. There is so much else included that the government is not talking about. The bike lanes are an attempt to distract the public while the real goal is to force Highway 413 through without proper process.\nThis Bill should not be passed in its current form.\n"

        "comment": "Why are you doing this? Removing bike lanes will cost money, make more people less safe and will not solve traffic issues. If you\u2019re really for saving money and small government, maybe the provincial government should leave cities to decide what works best for them and stay out of business that quite frankly, doesn\u2019t concern them. This is a profoundly regressive move that will increase road accidents and do nothing to alleviate traffic. Pathetic. Keep suburban politics and views out of cities.\n"

        "comment": "The province's proposal to remove bike lanes from the city is a deeply sad example of provincial overreach on what should be a municipal matter. It is anti-business and increases the risk of fatal or life-threatening collisions. Above all, given the large number of roads with no bike lanes but high levels of standstill traffic, it is painfully obvious the proposed measure will not actually reduce grid-lock. Imagine if the tens of millions of dollars needed for this measure could be spent on healthcare or education.\n"
