        "comment": "I wonder why a bike path should be removed and the sidewalk should be made narrower, what is more important, your residents or the car???????. It can also be done differently, namely reducing car traffic so that there is MORE SAFETY on ALL levels. Since we can do it here in Europe, it should also be feasible in Ontario and the rest of North America, but the car is sacred so cyclists may be hit because they are also ''so-called'' traffic jam causers, that is discouraging 1) an environmental solution, 2) more peace in the streets, 3) in general more safety and 4) less maintenance of streets, or shall we say ''stroats''. Most motorists are alone in the car and cause, as I read on your site, SMOG, to reduce that you can do something about it....allow fewer cars in the city and arrange better public transport which can also generate money for the municipality. Another option is to start charging taxes on cars that want to enter the city like they do in London (UK), it will generate money and reduce the number of cars. These are options, but these are options that at least generate something, and not a highway through the city that makes it all less safe. #carcentricOntario.\nGreetings from a QUIET, SAFE and SMOG FREE Netherlands (maybe you should take a look at how we do it right?)\n"

        "comment": "I believe that removing the bike lanes is absolutely ridiculous. As a student at the University of Toronto, I have witnessed the amount of construction it took for the bike lanes. The construction on Bloor street was ridiculous enough but what is even more outrageous is that this bill will affect many people who commute from their homes on a bike/scooter. It is dangerous for them to commute without bike lanes. Construction costs money as well right? Well this is also a lot of money wasted. Money to create these bike lanes and now, money to remove these bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I want to know why the government is pushing ahead with the removal of bike lanes without waiting for evidence as to whether or not this will actually reduce traffic? A new lane can only accommodate roughly 1900 cars per hour, ignoring turning, parking, cyclists now forced to take a lane, pedestrians, etc. At off peak times even the single lane on these streets is more than enough, and at peak times the number of residents in these neighbourhoods who have opted to bike instead of drive would outnumber the increased car capacity provided by the additional lane. Meaning traffic will get worse. This is just common sense.\nBusinesses along Bloor are demanding this government not interfere with a project that has INCREASED business since implemented. Why is a supposedly conservative government using centralized powers to hurt local business?\nWhy is the transport minister using a statistic on the percent of people who commute by cycling from 2011? Before the bike lanes even went in. Why would this government need to distort the truth and lie in such a way if they truly believe this will reduce traffic? Shouldn\u2019t the facts support the cause? If so, use up to date statistics and get the relevant data from the city instead of lying.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is gross over-reach on the part of the Province.  While legislativey entitled, decisions on these matters should be the exclusive purview of the citizens in the municipalities in question who have a vested interest and intimated knowledge of the costs and benefits of these lanes.  For years I commuted to and from work in downtown Toronto using the safety of bike paths through the Don Valley and bike lanes on major roads.  With the subsequent expansion on major roadways that provide direct access to destinations, I use them even more, as do many Torontonians.  The root causes of congestion on arterial roadways is not bike lanes, but:  (1) peak hour demand for commuting which affects all roadways, not just those with bike lanes; (2) construction which causes constant lane closures, particularly on major arterial roads regardless of whether any work is underway or not; (3) myriad other car related instances such as those making left turns, delivery vehicles stopped in live lanes of traffic, people dropping off or picking up others, errand drivers putting on four way hazard lights so they can drop off/pick up items.  I use the Bloor Street and University Avenue bike lanes and feel relatively safe in doing so (notwithstanding that I was almost hit twice by TTC buses while riding in Woodbine Avenue bike lanes on a to-work commute because the bus strayed over the solid lines).  Why is congestion such an issue in Toronto:  (1) Mike Harris sold the taxpayer funded Highway 407 to reduce debt and boost his credibility- a short sighted move that makes the 401 a parking lot for most of the work day; (2) underfunding of infrastructure on the Gardiner Expressway which Mike Harris downloaded onto the City of Toronto to balance his budget while making the City of Toronto fiscally responsible for a roadway used by thousands of people and businesses domiciled beyond its borders; (3) the Ontario Line construction which has crippled vehicular and public transit movement in downtown Toronto through the massive closure of numerous primary roadways; (4) failure of the Provincial government to deliver projects on time and on budget - I often sit in congested traffic on Eglinton Avenue East and watch empty Eglinton LRT trains roll by, while TTC buses add to traffic congestion on the Eglinton roadway, especially when there are no pullouts for them to drop off and pick up.  Bike lanes are an easy wedge issue for the Province to choose when many of the City of Toronto traffic woes have been inflicted on the City by poor, short-sighted Provincial decision making.  HANDS OFF TORONTO BIKE LANES - THESE DECISIONS BELONG TO TORONTONIANS, NOT A PREMIER WHO WAS REJECTED BY TORONTONIANS FOR HIS LACK OF VISION.\n"

It is appalling that the province is taking control of bike lanes which until now has been managed by municipalities.  As a resident of Stratford I know my city and my mayor and city counsellors know my city so can judge where bikes lanes should or should not be built.  Not Doug Ford and not the provincial government!  Instead of wasting time eliminating and controlling bike lanes I would greatly appreciate my tax dollars going towards meaningful change such as affordable housing or the family physician crisis.\n"

        "comment": "I am an engineer in the Bloor/Annex area. It baffles me that proposals so contrary to current research on urban design and traffic management get proposed by the Ontario government. It is shameful to disregard the science and instead opt towards 'gut feeling' for decisions like these that will impact the life and safety of many, while also making the very congestion problem we are trying to solve worse.\nThe only way to reduce traffic is to get cars off the road. How do we do that? Alternative ways of transport, especially for population in this dense area. If a lane is added to the road, then people who would be biking (like myself to work every day) are now instead driving and adding vehicles to the roads instead because that is the only safe option. This is called latent demand and is why converting this infrastructure will just make the problem worse.\nPlease leave this decision up to municipalities, and in this case the city of Toronto. The government of Ontario should focus on transport projects helping all of Ontario move across the province - not the few streets in Toronto that are making it safer for city locals to make commutes/short trips easier.\nPlease read research and learn.

        "comment": "The bike lane is an essential to modern city. It provides a much safer ride for bike user, which is a mode of transit that can reduce the use of car in road and reduce congestion. The reason now the bike have not been utilised is because there isn\u2019t enough dedicated bike lane in the city that connect these major bike lanes and people don\u2019t feel safe to ride a bike in mixed traffic. Moreover, we have already spend so much money and time in making them, why should we spend more money and time to remove them to make do the impossible work\u2014deduce traffic congestion?? The adding lane to 401 already prove that adding one more car lane does not help with traffic congestion. The only ways to go is to reduce the number of people that need cars to commute. We need better traffic alternatives than Car: better ttc services, better Go transit coverage and service (government should make deals with CP and CN so that we can also utilise their freight train track)\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove three main bike lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor in the name of improving car commute times. This decision would not only undermine our community\u2019s commitment to sustainable transportation but also have several negative consequences for cyclists and the overall quality of urban life.\nRemoving dedicated bike lanes puts cyclists at greater risk of accidents. Without safe, designated space for biking, cyclists will be forced to navigate through vehicle traffic, increasing the likelihood of collisions. This could lead to more injuries and fatalities on our roads. This would also lead to more people choosing to ride in a car or drive, which would increase congestion even more, making this proposal even more counter-intuitive.\nBike lanes also promote active transportation, which is crucial for public health. By facilitating safe cycling, we encourage more people to choose biking over driving, reducing traffic congestion and pollution. Removing bike lanes sends the opposite message, discouraging healthy habits and active lifestyles.\nBike lanes enhance connectivity within our neighborhoods. They provide safe routes for residents to reach schools, parks, and local businesses, fostering a sense of community. Eliminating these lanes would hinder access for many and could diminish local economic activity.\nImproving car commute times is a complex issue that cannot be resolved by eliminating bike lanes. Instead, we should explore long-term solutions such as better public transportation options, traffic management strategies, and infrastructure improvements that accommodate all forms of transportation. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead think of other ways to remove gridlock like speeding up construction work or ensuring that transit projects like the Eglinton Crosstown and Finch West LRT lines are completed.\n"

It is easier for drivers when bikes are not on the road with them, but instead in dedicated bike lanes. I personally use bike lanes everyday to get to school and work, I do not have a car so it is my best option. Bike lanes support investments in transit infrastructure by making them more accessible to users.\n"

All people of Ontario pay taxes for those roads, not just car drivers. I ride a bike and I drive a car.\nBike lanes save lives, they protect folks on bicycles from aggressive automobile drivers.\nI believe what is needed is more enforcement of traffic laws, and a judicial system that can handle cases in a timely ,manor, not the removal and restriction of bike lanes in Toronto.\nHow about a bill called \"catching up with the injustice of court backlogs in Ontario Act\" instead?\nThen if drivers of cars, trucks or bicycles  were charged with a traffic violation they would actually have to go to court and face possible prosecution, instead of backlogged until the case is tossed due to delay.\nThe Ontario government should be focusing on issues for all of Ontario, not trying to run Toronto.\nHow must the towns and cities in the rest of Ontario feel about the provincial government spending limited resources of time staff and tax dollars on bike lanes in Toronto, when bigger issues like Dr.s and nurses and homelessness affect every area of Ontario?\nFinally, unless there is also going to be changes to the traffic act, bicycles are vehicles too and must follow the rules of the road.\n I was taught at the bicycle training I attended at the city of Toronto, in the absence of a bike lane, bicycles should \"take their lane\" to avoid being forced into the curb, or hit as a car or truck tries to navigate to pass in half a lane.\nWhat speed do you think traffic will move when bikes \"take their lane\" in traffic because the bike lanes were removed ?\nThis proposed \"act\" is dangerous, and will result in death, injury, and slower traffic overall.\nGet on with governing the province, leave the city's business alone.\n"

While I admire applying scrutiny to government infrastructure projects it is clear that there is far greater need for such scrutiny on this provinces over reliance on private transport projects even when such projects clearly provide minimal ROI not just in terms of money but outcomes as well. There is overwhelming evidence that bike lanes in Ontario, while still too early stages to benefit from network effects, return far greater returns that additional investment on an oversaturated car network. We need far greater scrutiny on additional car infrastructure and greater support and encouragement of emerging trands in public planning including bike networks.\n"

The ability for residents to choose their mode of transportation is fundamental to our city competing with other leading cities around the world. That means every citizen being able to safely choose whether they walk, drive, bike, or take public transport. Removing and throttling the growth of bike infrastructure would remove a key differentiator that Toronto has over other North American cities. Only New York City can claim to have better accessibility. The best and brightest are mobile and will leave Toronto if we lose this race.\nBill 212 will kill people. Bike lanes protect bikers by providing visual and physical barriers between multi-ton steel vehicles and unprotected humans. They provide the same service to bikers as sidewalks to pedestrians, which are standard practice to install.\nBill 212 goes directly against a key tenant of the PC Party of Ontario. As Premier Ford said in the 2024 Members' manual, \"we're working for the people of Ontario by keeping taxes low [and], cutting red tape...\". Bill 2121 adds red tape and will, over the long term, increase taxes, by reducing Toronto's potential growth.\n"
