        "comment": "Responding to \"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\"\nAs a citizen of Ontario, I am deeply upset about the additional bureaucracy and red tape that this bill will entail and am outraged that local democracy is being denied because the premier of Ontario thinks he knows better or is looking for a wedge issue to win some votes.\nI refuse to let my tax dollars be used to finance a childish war on bikes (a war on decency, really) or to build some white elephants like Highway 413 or a freeway tunnel under the 401.\nCycling improves physical and mental health and road diets have been proven to significantly reduce aggressive driving and the risk of car collisions. This means fewer people at the hospital and a less expensive health care system to be sustained by taxpayers.\nCycle lanes improves the local economy by allowing more people to travel in front of local businesses. Removing cycle lanes, or preventing their addition, will be detrimental to the hard working citizens who own a shop or a restaurant along strategic corridors.\nCycling is a much cheaper mode of transportation than driving. People trying to save money should be given the same respect and consideration as everyone else, regardless of the percentage of trips they represent.\nCyclists should not have to travel on a car lane (and thus block traffic) on a busy road, nor should they be forced to use the sidewalk or take long detours to avoid busy roads. They should not be discouraged from cycling either. The more people choose cycling as a mode of transportation, the less people drive and the lower the risk of congestion. The reverse is true: forcing everyone to drive will cause more congestion, no matter how many car lanes you add.\nBill 212 will NOT reduce gridlock or save people time.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the provincial mandate calling for the removal of bike lanes from Toronto's roads. As a resident of Toronto, and a proponent of sustainable transportation and safe urban spaces, I believe that the removal of these bike lanes would be a giant step backward for the city and its residents.\nBike lanes are a vital part of our urban infrastructure, serving not only as a key mode of transportation but also as an essential aspect of Toronto's broader strategy to address climate change, reduce traffic congestion, and promote public health. By removing these lanes, the provincial mandate will not only harm the environment but also limit the mobility options available to residents, particularly those who rely on cycling as a low-cost, eco-friendly mode of transportation.\nThe removal of bike lanes would disproportionately affect those who are most vulnerable in our city\u2014commuters, students, and low-income individuals\u2014who rely on biking as an affordable and efficient means of travel. In addition, removing bike lanes would lead to an increase in congestion, as more people would be forced to rely on cars for their daily commute. This will not only worsen traffic flow but also increase air pollution and carbon emissions, directly contradicting our city's environmental goals.\nFurthermore, bike lanes enhance the safety of all road users. Studies consistently show that cities with well-designed cycling infrastructure experience fewer accidents, with both cyclists and motorists benefiting from clearly designated lanes. Removing bike lanes will only increase the risk of collisions, particularly in an already congested urban environment like Toronto.\nToronto's population is growing, and with it, the need for diverse transportation options. Removing bike lanes undermines the city's commitment to being a forward-thinking, inclusive, and sustainable urban center. Rather than dismantling the progress made in cycling infrastructure, we should be investing in further expansion and improvement of these networks to encourage safer and more efficient commuting options.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this mandate and to support efforts that promote safer, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options for all Torontonians. Our future lies in investing in transportation systems that reduce congestion, improve air quality, and encourage active lifestyles\u2014bike lanes are an integral part of that vision.\nI am also concerned about the environmental implications of \"Bill 212\", particularly in relation to resource extraction, land development, and environmental regulations. Ontario is home to diverse ecosystems that must be protected for future generations. Weakening environmental protections would be a step backward in the province\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\nThe Ontario Greenbelt is an incredibly important ecological, environmental, and social resource for several reasons:\n1. Environmental Protection\nPreservation of Biodiversity: The Greenbelt spans over 2 million acres and includes a wide range of ecosystems such as wetlands, forests, and agricultural lands. This diversity helps to maintain local biodiversity by providing habitats for native plants and animals. Many species in the Greenbelt are rare or endangered.\n2. Climate Change Mitigation: The Greenbelt acts as a natural carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and helping to mitigate climate change. The trees, soil, and wetlands trap greenhouse gases, which is critical as cities like Toronto continue to grow and industrial emissions rise.\nWater Quality and Management: The Greenbelt is also key to maintaining clean water. It surrounds the headwaters of many rivers and streams that supply drinking water to millions of Ontarians. Wetlands and forests within the Greenbelt help filter water and reduce flooding by absorbing excess rainwater and preventing soil erosion.\n3. Agricultural Land Protection\nSustaining Local Agriculture: The Greenbelt is home to some of Ontario's most fertile farmland. It helps to preserve agricultural land from urban sprawl, ensuring that local food production remains sustainable. The Greenbelt includes vital agricultural areas like the Niagara Escarpment and the Holland Marsh, which are essential for producing a wide variety of crops and supporting Ontario's agricultural economy.\nFood Security: By protecting farmlands, the Greenbelt plays a role in maintaining a secure, local food supply. It helps reduce the environmental footprint associated with food imports and transportation.\n4. Urban Sprawl Prevention\nControlled Development: The Greenbelt serves as a barrier to prevent uncontrolled urban sprawl, which can lead to the destruction of natural areas and farmland. Its boundaries help ensure that cities grow in a more sustainable, compact way, encouraging higher-density development and reducing the pressure to build on sensitive land.\nUrban Quality of Life: By preserving green space, the Greenbelt provides areas for recreation, relaxation, and escape from urban life. Access to natural spaces in urban areas is shown to improve mental and physical well-being, and the Greenbelt offers these spaces to residents of Ontario\u2019s urban centers.\n5. Cultural and Recreational Value\nOutdoor Recreation: The Greenbelt is a popular spot for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, birdwatching, and nature walks. These recreational opportunities contribute to the physical and mental health of the population and provide a place for people to connect with nature.\nCultural Heritage: Many Indigenous communities have cultural ties to the land within the Greenbelt, and it also contains significant historical sites that reflect Ontario's colonial and indigenous past.\n6. Economic Benefits\nTourism: The Greenbelt boosts tourism by attracting visitors interested in outdoor activities, environmental education, and local produce. This contributes to the local economy, especially in rural and farming communities.\nSustainable Land Use: The Greenbelt fosters a balance between urban development and environmental stewardship. By ensuring that some land remains untouched or used for agriculture, it provides long-term economic benefits, including sustainable food production and environmental tourism.\n7. Public Health and Well-being\nClean Air and Recreation Spaces: Access to green spaces in urban areas is linked to better health outcomes, including lower rates of heart disease, obesity, and mental health disorders. The Greenbelt offers urban residents opportunities to escape the stress of city life and enjoy the benefits of nature, contributing to improved well-being.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 and engage in meaningful dialogue with the public, experts, and communities who will be directly affected by these changes. It is vital that any policy changes prioritize the well-being of Ontarians, safeguard our environment, and ensure equitable access to resources and services.\nThank you for your attention.\n"

        "comment": "This entire bill is malformed.  From the very first sentence under \"What we are proposing\" where it says \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\" the authors of this bill are missing the entire point of transportation which is that, if anything, we want to get Ontarians (not drivers exclusively or cyclists specifically or equestrians for that matter) where they need to go, and driving just might not be the best way to do that.  The bill nonsensically, and repeatedly contrasts bike lanes to \"lanes of traffic\".  Bicycles are traffic.  A bike lane is a lane of traffic.\nThis bill is not compatible with the Ministry of Transportation's vision \"to be the safest and most advanced transportation jurisdiction in the world where success enables healthy, prosperous and connected communities\" and directly contradicts state ministry priorities such as\n* Increasing transit ridership.\n* Promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation, that supports the efficient movement of goods and people.\n* Promoting road safety and remaining one of the safest jurisdictions in North America.\nand\n* Integrating sustainability into the ministry\u2019s decision making, programs, policies and operations.\nRemoving bicycle lanes will decrease safety, not only for cyclists and not only in the communities where those lanes are removed.\nIt will of course make cycling more dangerous in those areas.  It will also make walking more dangerous and motor vehicle traffic increases, as buffer zones provided by separate bike lanes where traffic moves somewhat slower and the (human powered) vehicles are less massive.  Bicycle lanes named in Ontario government press statements (on Bloor and on University avenues in Toronto) also include design features, such as \"daylighting\" (I believe that's the term) that increase safety by providing improved line of sight at intersections.\nThe governments publicly stated goal of removing bicycle lanes is to increase motor vehicle traffic, which it will both through induced demand and, perversely, because some people will no longer feel safe riding their bicycles in those areas and will resort to driving instead.  With increased motor vehicle traffic there will be increased fatalities.  It is virtually inevitable.  Perhaps an increase in motor vehicle traffic could be offset by improvements in motor vehicle safety to maintain net, absolute safety levels but the current bill does nothing to address motor vehicle safety.  There are no new limits on vehicle speed, or regulations on vehicle design, or road design feature requirements such as \"traffic calming\" measures--quite the opposite on that last point, this bill is likely to precipitate the removal of safe road design features as I've already described.  Increased motor vehicle traffic necessarily also means increased exhaust.  We are not yet in the all-electric, zero-local-emissions age!  That means more greenhouse gases, more smog, and all the negative health effects that come with poor air quality (up to and including increased rates of death for vulnerable individuals with existing respiratory illnesses).  It means more rubber particles from tire wear and more toxins from spills and leaks, which I've heard is already a major problem for some urban waterways (Taylor Creek in East York comes to mind).\nThe Highway 413 Act, 2024 is the most biased, short-sighted thing I have read in a long while.  Exempting one specific highway project from the Environmental Assessment Act is absurd.  It shows a government and a ministry unwilling (or unable?) to defend their present legislation on its merits.  Ontarians have a right to more transparency, and a right to clear factual information about the impact of proposed actions.  Let's have the assessment first and then debate whether this highway should be build.\nIf the government wants to grant themselves new expropriation powers and exemptions from scrutiny, and to get motor vehicle traffic flowing more freely in a hurry, let them expropriate the 407, which should never have been sold and is already built, rather than incur the cost and environmental damage of constructing a new, major highway through sensitive lands further from population centres.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is problematic on so many levels:\n1. PROVINCIAL OVERREACH\n- In the example of Toronto, Premier Ford was quoted saying the major bike lanes, like the ones on Bloor, Yonge, and University, will be targeted for removal, based on no data that this would be beneficial and no real criteria. Perhaps the criteria will be based on Mr.Ford's feelings? Since when does the premier get to decide what gets removed on city roads??\n- Do motorists need both major and minor roads? So do cyclists. The three he mentioned are major thoroughfares for cyclists, too. Putting bike lanes only on secondary streets doesn't solve gridlock.\n- Bike lanes are only installed after YEARS of study, planning, piloting, AND community input. The municipalities have already done this. It is a gross overreach of the province to suddenly butt in and announce they will rip out any that \"fails\" according to this non-existent criteria. The province should do their actual job, like completing higher order transit. Metrolinx, a PROVINCIAL entity, has been struggling to complete several LRT lines on time. I don't see the premier and the Transportation Minister Sarkaria doing much about that.\n2. WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND RESOURCES\n- All the bike lanes are already put in. It took years of time from various departments at municipalities, consultants, and construction crews. The carbon footprint to rip out all the materials and re-install asphalt is a huge waste of resources and means more construction, which DOES contribute to gridlock. It also took A LOT of money to build the networks we currently have in Ontario, TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS. The province announced that it will pay for any bike lanes that it wants removed. BUT WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM? If you have all that money lying around, why hasn't it been used for public transit or hospitals?? Stop wasting our money.\n3. UNSCIENTIFIC\n- congestion is a big issue in many places around the world, and lots of studies have been done. No study has ever shown that putting more cars on the road reduces congestion, also none has ever demonstrated that bike lanes cause gridlock. In fact, it is the opposite: see article attached. It is also worth to point out that cars are not IN traffic, they ARE the traffic. We need to promote less cars on the road, not more, by promoting alternate modes of transit (i.e. LRT, subway, BIKE LANES, etc).\n4. BACKWARDS\n- this proposal is not only based on feelings and no real evidence, it is backwards. The world is facing a climate crisis. We, collectively as human species, need to be moving towards more sustainable modes of transit, not promoting carbon inducing single passenger vehicles.\n5. CYCLIST SAFETY\n- just like motorists, cyclists want to stay alive and unharmed! Removing bike lanes not only puts cyclists at danger, but motorist as well. With bike lanes, everybody knows where to be and there is less confusion and/or mixing of the two road users. Perhaps this administration is forgetting that cyclists are also Ontarians, and their safety matters just much as motorists. And in case you didn't know, bike helmets don't save you from dying when you get crushed by a car.\n6. DECEITFUL\n- buried in this proposal is a clause that will allow bypassing of the environmental assessment required for the proposed Highway 413 (also, do we really need another highway?). It seems like this administration has complete disregard for safeguarding or protecting natural and environmental resources of Ontario, as was already demonstrated by the greenbelt scandal. Highway 413 will be an enormous piece of infrastructure if built, and it is paramount that we are fully understand the environmental impacts. We are facing a climate crisis and having to deal with extreme climates more and more. We need to more equipped with knowledge, not less. Such an infrastructure will last many decades, we owe the future generations of Ontario a better than this.\nThis proposal is an insult to the people of Ontario. There are so many other problems in our province, like the housing crisis or the buckling healthcare system. Yet here is the premier with a bogus proposal with a bogus name, wasting taxpayers' time and money that he claims he wants to save.\nAs a resident, driver, and cyclist of Toronto, I'd urge Mr.Ford and Mr.Sarkaria to try riding around those Toronto streets without bike lanes at peak rush hour and see if they can propose a bogus bill like this after that. Oh, wait, Mr.Ford already did: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders,\" he said on TVO back in 2017. I guess he conveniently hasn't heard about the deaths of multiple cyclists this year alone. Mr.Sarkaria lives in Brampton and commutes to Queen's Park by a car. He is part of the gridlock problem, yet he has the audacity to question the validity of municipal bike lane studies that exclude bad weather months. Cyclists bike less in the winter partly because the lanes are never cleared of snow or ice, therefore unsafe. But how would he know that? He does not ride a bike in my city to know.\n"

        "comment": "THANK YOU ONTARIO GOVERNMENT,\nFor STOPPING and REMOVING bicycle lanes on the streets of Toronto.\nThe City of Toronto is killing the economy of our city by constricting the streets from car usage by reducing street lanes for bicycles.\nIt is counter-intuitive to efficiency and economic growth by blocking commuters and businesses from driving to destinations across the city for the sake of woke \"15 Minute City\" ideology.\nResidents, small businesses and services should be able to drive throughout the GTA in an efficient and timely matter without being forced to use public transit that does not make logistical sense.\nFurthermore, in a Canadian city that experiences winter conditions for 8 out of 12 months of the year, bicycle lanes cannot be justified for such limited use.\nLastly, as a resident on Portland Street in downtown Toronto, Portland, Spadina and Bathurst Street all experience gridlock each weekend from 9pm-3am due to the nightlife, and the proposed PORTLAND - DAN LECKIE CYCLING CONNECTION Proposal would eliminate 2-way traffic on Portland Street adding further gridlock and delays during rush hour and weekends.

        "comment": "1) we need to build for where we are going - not where we were several decades ago.\n2) there will be tens of thousands of new residents in our city who will need to get around - they can't all drive cars.\n3) congestion is caused by cosntruction, and the sheer volume of cars; a well planned street works well for all users (that's what studies have shown).\n4) the city has invested huge amounts of time energy and money in creating this network of lanes that will take us into a future of lower emissions as planned by the \"TransformTO NetZero by 2040 commitment.\n5) the young people of our city and province are telling us they want a climate safe future.  Let's build it for them.\nBuilding a highway over greenbelt land would also be a travesty, increasing carbon emissions and destroying farmland.  For food security in our future we NEED to protect and preserve farmland. the primary purpose of the hwy is to spread housing further out, instead we need to intensify, in the city, where people can travel by transit, walking and cycling and can save a LOT of money by not needing to have a car.\nYesterday I happened to be driving on Bloor St at 5:30 pm (yes I drive occasionally as well as cycle) and yes, it was slow. But that's mainly because of construction! One of the lanes was closed from Bedford to University.  It was great to see the steady stream of cyclists on both sides riding safely along.  I did not mind it took me a few extra minutes to get to my destination.  I'd rather have a safe road with separated lanes.  That steady stream of cyclists, if we keep these lanes, will continue to grow.  (it's already grown several times over).  Please do not interfere with the important investment the city of Toronto has made in these lanes - through local democracy at work - and please respect the need to shift our traffic patterns.  Everyone in a car is not possible for our city so let's not disadvantage those using other modes of travel.\n"

        "comment": "Imagine driving if roads were independent segments that ended before you could get to work or to the pharmacy. That\u2019s the biggest challenge to Ontarians who bike or wish to lead healthier, active lifestyles by biking to more places. Few people feel comfortable biking on roads without protected bike lanes, so any trip that involves braving the deadly roads for any significant distance is unlikely to be done by bike altogether. This is why the piecemeal bike lanes Ontario has are underutilized.\nOntario cities do not need more drivers \u2014 it\u2019s clear that Ontario cities have enough car traffic. This is why investments in more space-efficient travel methods like transit and cycling are important. There\u2019s two things that will solve traffic for real: finishing higher-order transit projects like the Eglinton Crosstown and the Ontario Line, and stitching together a truly connected and inviting bike network to entice drivers to travel by transit and micromobility. GO Transit was originally designed to woo drivers out of their cars to keep congestion down, and wooing drivers out of their cars is a strategy Ontario can use again.\nRemoving bike lanes will only, at most, add one car lane per direction. Not only is that very little help for drivers, it\u2019ll be quickly filled up as the new lanes invite more driving activity and former cyclists become more cars on the road. In short order, congestion will be back to where it was. Not to mention the congestion that the process of removing bike lanes will cause.\nThe way the bill doesn\u2019t discriminate between main roads and side streets will create unnecessary red tape for bike lanes that will remove a car lane on a side street. I have commuted by bus many times on a side street where new bike lanes replaced car lanes, and traffic is not a problem at all. Some streets were simply overbuilt, and needing the province to acknowledge this every time a municipality wants to remove unnecessary car lanes is, well, unnecessary. In these cases, I\u2019d like to see the province help municipalities better protect new cycling infrastructure with concrete safety barriers and raised transit stops.\nSome streets would even be safer for drivers if bike lanes were added. Many four-lane streets with frequent uncontrolled intersections and driveways could be improved with a \u201croad diet\u201d. Due to the number of intersections and driveways, their inner lanes often see stopped cars waiting to turn left. These waiting cars are at risk of being rear-ended by those using the inner lane to pass. Being stopped, they also reduce the productivity expected of the additional driving lane. In a road diet, one car lane would be removed from each direction, a two-way centre turning lane would be added, and a one-way bike lane would be added to each side. Drivers waiting to turn left would get a safer place to wait, and at four-way uncontrolled intersections, wouldn\u2019t have their view obstructed by cars waiting to turn left from the opposite direction. Traffic throughput wouldn\u2019t be affected very much, again because the inner lanes kept getting clogged by drivers waiting to turn left.\nAs someone who travels primarily by bus and by foot, I know this act will not save me time. For aforementioned reasons, relief from congestion will be temporary. Buses may see more crowding, and I will have to watch out for more sidewalk cyclists when I walk on sidewalks too narrow for both of us.\nTo conclude, Ontario cities already have enough drivers. The solution to traffic is wooing drivers out of their cars by completing higher-order transit projects and stitching together Ontario\u2019s piecemeal bike lanes. Indiscriminately banning bike lanes that remove car lanes is adding unneeded red tape to projects that could improve road safety without hurting traffic throughput. Removing bike lanes would only provide temporary relief at most before drivers become less careful about avoiding traffic and start crowding the roads with reclaimed lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident in downtown Toronto, on Spadina Avenue, very near to several of the bike lanes which this proposal seeks to remove. In downtown Toronto, there are an enormous number of food delivery workers who ride E-bikes at high speeds through the city. On streets where there is improper bike infrastructure, these food delivery workers instead choose to ride their bikes on the sidewalk, at the same high speeds. On many instances, I have been nearly hit and run down by bikers riding at dangerous speeds on the sidewalk. The removal of bike lanes will only make this problem worse, provoking these delivery people to ride dangerously on the road and on sidewalks, making the city a more dangerous place for drivers and pedestrians.\nOur city needs what little bike infrastructure it has, and removing these bike lanes only to add more lanes to the road will make the city worse for everyone. This act would destroy the Annex, one of the most walkable neighbourhoods on the continent, only to induce demand for more cars on the road and do nothing to solve this issue of traffic congestion. If you want to make traffic lighter, take more cars off the road by investing in public transit and infrastructure, and don't gut our city in a bold abandonment of fiscal responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "The government's publicly stated goal of removing certain bike lanes in downtown Toronto will, if achieved, negatively affect the health and wellbeing of myself and my young family.  We live nearby and regularly travel along Danforth avenue by car, by bicycle, on foot, and by transit.  We have lived here for many years so have experience travelling along Danforth avenue both before and after the installation of separated bike lanes.\nFor all modes of transport the new, current design with separate bike lanes on the opposite side of a line of on-street parking from the central lanes of traffic is a great improvement.\nCycling on Danforth is obviously improved.  Not just for the buffer that a line of parked cars and of parking blocks with flexiposts  provides but also because the delineation of lanes provides clarity.  Previously, there was one full-width lane and then a partial width lane combined with parking.  That led to a constantly churning flow of traffic where vehicles (cars, bikes, everyone) would spread out into the second partial lane wherever possible (even if only barely possible, almost scraping by the mirrors of parked cars in that lane) only to merge back into the central lanes a few meters later.  It was chaotic.  Cyclists were forced into the most irregular and unpredictable part of that traffic flow: a varying width partial lane between parked cars and other moving traffic with vehicles of all types abruptly shifting in and out of the same road space.  I now regularly commute (3 to 4 times per week) by bicycle along Danforth with my 8 year old child riding their own bicycle.  It is 3 kilometers from our home to my child's school, almost all of it along Danforth, and several more from there to my workplace, also primarily on separate bike lanes.  We both enjoy this immensely.  There is a noticeable improvement in my child's mood on days when we bicycle together.  We also have wonderful conversations about our neighbourhood and things that we see along the way, conversations that just don't seem to come up when we drive along the same route.  I would never have considered taking that journey by bicycle with my child when the previous road design was in place, even at my child's present age.  It would have been terrifying.  Now, however, I could see my child making this trip alone in only a few years, long before they are eligible to apply for a drivers license.  What a gift of autonomous, free movement and health!  The keys to our community.\nYou may be surprised to hear that the experience of driving on Danforth is also very much improved. It is!  Both my spouse and I agree, and have remarked on it to each other while driving along Danforth in recent years.  With the previous road design that constant, chaotic churning of traffic in and out of a partial width lane shared with on-street parking created a nerve-wracking experience.  Even driving in the full width, central lanes you had to contend with others darting in and out from the adjacent partial lane.  It was terrible.  Now there is one central lane in each direction for most of Danforth, except at intersections where there are often dedicated turning lanes.  Traffic in those lanes moves in an orderly fashion and driving takes only a normal, relaxed level of vigilance.  Traffic flows generally well, and if it is ever truly snarled up there is Mortimer or Kingston Road or Dundas.  Another partial lane of traffic would not (and did not in the past) help.\nWalking along Danforth is also improved as the bike lane provides additional buffer from the noise and exhaust of motorized traffic.  The summer patios are an added bonus.\nMy family's quality of life would be considerably diminished if these bike lanes were to be removed.\n"
