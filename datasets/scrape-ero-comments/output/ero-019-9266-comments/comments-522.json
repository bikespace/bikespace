        "comment": "The idea of the Ontario government passing legislation to remove bike lanes in Toronto is a waste of money and resources, an inappropriate focus for the provincial government, and a step backwards for safety and municipal infrastructure.\nCity planning should be left to cities. I dislike that the Ontario government plans to waste taxpayer money reviewing and removing existing bike lanes when studies have shown they improve traffic, not worsen it. If a city determines that bike lanes are beneficial to a particular road or street, I dislike that they will face additional red tape to get that done\n"

I appreciated when bikes lanes were added to Bloor - there was no existing east to west corridor that reached far enough, and the addition of lanes allow me to switch from my car to my bike for half the year without feeling unsafe cycling on the road. There are plenty of east to west corridors for motorists to utilize - Dundas has always been my preferred corridor when driving over Bloor. No one actually uses Bloor to go east / west in a car. It's a business area full of pedestrian traffic and lights. Perfect for.... A bike lane!\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist and driver in the City of Toronto, and a property owner in the City, I am DEEPLY OPPOSED to Bill 212.\nI support the continued installation of bike lanes and infrastructure across our city and in other municipalities across Ontario. This infrastructure helps protect the safety of all road users and minimize conflicts between different modes of transportation. It also offers transit options other than the car, which ultimately reduces the number of vehicles on the road. That is a good thing for people who still choose or need to drive\nI am deeply troubled by the province's efforts to intervene in municipal decision-making on this matter. It is the city planners most closely connected with our local built environment that should be making decisions on local infrastructure developments such as bike lanes, with the approval of elected city officials. The province has no role in such decisions and needs to back off.\nI strongly support the continued existence and development of bike lanes in the City of Toronto, which I regularly use. We need MORE, not less, bike lanes. I am deeply opposed to the Province's efforts to intervene in municipal planning and attempt to remove bike lanes that my taxes have paid for and my municipal elected officials have approved. Not only is removing existing bike lanes a huge waste of taxpayer funds - it will endanger vulnerable road users across the city.\nTo be clear: I SUPPORT BIKE LANES IN THE CITY OF TORONTO AND THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO.\nI DO NOT SUPPORT BILL 212.\n"

People will not stop riding bikes on these streets just because there are no bike lanes. they will merge with traffic and have both the cyclists and the auto drivers more on edge thereby counteracting the effect that the Ford government is trying to achieve. There have been numerous studies on this issue. The answer to help ease congestion is order, not chaos.

        "comment": "Bike lanes, when properly separated from car traffic and connected throughout a city, are an excellent way to reduce car traffic as they encourage an alternate form of transportation. There should be more dedicated bike lanes, none should be removed and car users should face appropriate costs for the infrastructure that their chosen form of transportation requires. As the taxing system works now, there is very little burden put on car drivers to pay for the infrastructure they depend on to drive. As a car driver who commutes to work daily, I think I should be burdened with the true cost of my commute, which would include paying for roads and their maintenance, but also to pay the cost of the land that could be better used for other purposes or returned to nature, and I want to pay for the profound damage my choice to drive is causing to both local and global environments. Biking does a small fraction of the damage driving does, takes up a small fraction of the space driving does and maintenance requires a small fraction of what car infrastructure requires. If all tax paying Ontarians must contribute to the road infrastructure, then the needs of all Ontarians should be met. Bicycle infrastructure is a public good and should be widely adopted, encouraged and supported by governments at all levels. To continue down the path of cars as the ideal method of transportation is madness, when all of the impacts of that method of transportation are considered. Please alter or cancel this proposal as is.\n"

I think the addition of the bikes lines on Bloor street has been such an improvement to the two lane avenue that existed before. I don\u2019t believe that it has impacted car traffic or congestion in a negative way, and I often drive down this street. The bike lane provides safe, fast transport for those who choose to use it, and many many people do choose to use it. So many of my customers use the Bloor bike lane, and I myself use it all the time to get around instead of driving. I think to get ride of these major bike lanes would majorly reduce the usability of our city\u2014public transit is underfunded and the coverage is not good. Not everyone can afford to own a car, and lots of people simply want to get around the neighbourhood in a safe and efficient manner, which these bikes offer.\nI also assume the spending for the road work to install these bike lanes was pretty high, and to then just scrap it after only a handful of years of use would be such an absolute waste of public money and time. I don\u2019t know why the premier of Ontario is meddling in the affairs of the city of Toronto\u2014feels like this should be a mayoral issue and something decided by the people who live and work in the city.\n"

This bill would add unnecessary red tape and hinder cities' ability to improve cycling infrastructure, which is crucial for the safety and well-being of residents.\nAs someone who uses cycling for all my commuting needs, I can confidently say it is the fastest, most affordable, healthiest, and most enjoyable mode of transit. The improvements my city has made in cycling infrastructure have been impressive, and I want to see more progress. My friends, many of whom are hesitant to cycle due to safety concerns, would be even more discouraged if this bill passed.\nThe more bike lanes we have, the safer cycling becomes, reducing harm and creating more livable cities. Bill 212 would set us back by limiting the ability of cities to make these vital improvements, and I urge the government to reconsider this harmful legislation. We need policies that empower cities to build safer, more sustainable communities, not ones that create unnecessary barriers.\n"

        "comment": "I work as a licensed transportation engineer in Ontario, with over 16 years of experience in the field. I work for, and am a part owner of, one of the largest transportation consulting firms in the country. We specialize in supporting land development across the GTA, Ontario, and the rest of Canada for clients in both the private and public sectors. The proposed policy, to limit and remove bicycle lanes from major streets, will have a detrimental impact on the ability of Ontario to meet its housing targets and will slow the development of high-density housing in the communities that need it most.\nTraffic congestion in Ontario cities is, in some cases, at an all-time high. However, eliminating bicycle lanes will impact the ability of both the private sector and public housing developers to deliver additional housing, rather than improving traffic conditions for drivers. As part of the land development process, any medium to large scale development is required to provide a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) which outlines the potential transportation related impacts of the development (such as increased vehicular traffic generation) on the surrounding road network. For decades, the solution to increased traffic congestion was typically to \u201cadd more lanes\u201d, or alternatively, add things like turning lanes, in order to mitigate the impacts. That time has passed. Most major Ontario cities are fully \u201cbuilt out\u201d, meaning there are no more new roads, let alone new lanes, coming to major development areas \u2013 the roads are as wide as they\u2019re going to get. As a result, when a new development relies upon automobile travel to support the new residents (or employees or customers, depending on the land use), the TIS will show conditions worsening. When they worsen to a tipping point, and there are no mitigation measures available (i.e. no new lanes can be constructed), the project is opposed or reduced in scale.\nIn most municipalities in Ontario today, medium and large developments reach the threshold where automobile impacts \u201cfail\u201d frequently, and thus a project would be cancelled or reduced. However, cities and residents have widely observed that there are other ways for people to get around. Demonstrating that cycling is a viable mode of transportation, and thus people may elect to ride rather than drive, has proven extremely helpful in supporting development by moving some of the impacts of the automobile to other modes (this is also true of walking and transit).\nAs it has been demonstrated in Ontario and globally, improving the safety and separation of bicycle facilities from automobile lanes increases their use, and succeeds in providing cycling opportunities to those who are not comfortable travelling in mixed traffic. By eliminating cycle tracks and bicycle lanes (through the prevention of their installation between major destinations or through the removal of existing infrastructure), the Government proposes to take many people off bikes and put them back in cars. This will worsen the existing automobile traffic situation and make it nearly impossible for developments to mitigate their transportation impacts. It will be easier for local municipalities, and indeed the Ministry of Transportation itself (for projects that are within the MTO\u2019s controlled areas near highway infrastructure) to say no to residential, office, retail, commercial, and industrial developments. Simply put, this policy will slow the delivery of housing and economic growth by saying \u201cthere are too many cars, and there is no other way to travel, so you cannot build that here\u201d.\nAs the Government has not sought fit to impose measures that would reduce vehicular travel overall (such as road tolls or congestion charges), it has fallen to transportation professionals to prove that there are alternative modes of travel, allowing us to demonstrate to reviewing agencies that the overall impact of a development can be managed through an increase in the quantity of cycling in a new project (as well as increased walking and transit usage). This policy removes one of the key levers used to support development, and in doing so, will decrease the ability to densify in areas that are most appropriate for densification (as they are also the areas that are most congested with cars).\nThe secondary result will be a redistribution of development activities to areas that have sufficient road capacity, which means rural and suburban areas, resulting in a loss of farmland and greenspaces and creating congestion in suburban areas. These areas are much more automobile dependent, which in turn results in increased driving to already intensified areas for employment and recreation. Essentially, by pushing development away from congested areas (due to its inability to get approved in those same areas), the amount of people driving in a region increases, resulting in more congestion in those congested areas, further forcing development farther and farther afield. It is a vicious cycle that has played out across North America, as well as locally, as former Toronto suburbs such as Etobicoke and Scarborough became busier without becoming significantly denser, and more distant suburbs, such as Markham, Stouffville, and Uxbridge have also seen rapid increases in congestion. Removing cycling infrastructure from downtown Toronto will not help those commute times, it will only, over time, increase the drive time for those in Uxbridge, as development is forced to occur in those areas rather than near existing infrastructure.\nThis is not only a recipe for sprawl, and its attendant side effects, but it is, on its face, self-defeating to the stated goal of the bill: to reduce congestion. Only through providing alternative modes of transportation can the Province hope to free up road capacity which can then be used by those that need it.\nBy no means am I claiming that everyone will cycle, but for each person you put on a bike for a local trip, that\u2019s one less car in the way of someone who does need to drive (for accessibility, comfort, proximity, or any other reason). And the way to get people on to bikes is to provide them an experience that is safe (through separation from vehicular traffic) and convenient (direct routes on major streets, which connect where people live to where they want to go for work, shopping, or entertainment).\nThis proposal will result in less development and less economic growth in areas that are designated for it, and as such, I strongly recommend that the proposal be removed from consideration. It will undo many of the Government\u2019s efforts to meet housing targets, will not generate a significant improvement in vehicular travel times, and will, over time, only worse the effects of auto-focused development patterns.\nThank you for taking the time to review my comment, and I hope that going forward you will reach out to professionals in the field for their opinions on such a technical subject.\n"

        "comment": "I agree that congestion is a big issue in Toronto and other parts of the province. It is frustrating to be stuck in traffic and wastes time on a daily basis that could otherwise be spent with friends and family or on other hobbies. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, however the methods proposed by the Ontario Government in Bill 212 will not help the problem.\nToronto has always been a city with heavy traffic. I cannot remember a time where I have been able to travel through the city by car without experiencing some delay unless it was the middle of the night or very early morning. This is not a new issue. Toronto traffic did not magically become bad when the city started building bike lanes. It was the case without bike lanes in place, it is the case with bike lanes in place.\nI think that this can be best observed if you look anywhere in the city where no bike infrastructure has been built. Is there magically free flowing traffic because all of the road space has been given to motor vehicles? If so the Ontario Government should consider removing bike lanes from the 401, DVP and the Gardiner since they seem to constantly get backed up with traffic.\nNo, it's not the lack of space for cars that is causing congestion as some would like to believe. Over the past 70 years we have been building as much space for cars as possible. This has demolished communities, been a factor in millions of deaths (either through collisions or health issues caused by vehicle emissions) and has negatively impacted the planet that we depend upon. Continuing to invest primarily in cars for transportation is unsustainable and will not fix our issues in the short term, nor will it fix our issues in the long term. Especially in cities like Toronto we need to invest in alternative methods for people to get around so that we can continue to grow without the city constantly in a state of gridlock.\nHow can we do this? Well to start, there is no need to make it more difficult to build infrastructure that makes it safe for Ontarians who choose to cycle. Cities already conduct thorough studies on how a bike lane would locally affect the neighborhood and the community it contains. They already get approval from the citizens they are building for. Why the Government of Ontario wants to spend time and taxpayer money reviewing local issues is beyond me. Why the Government of Ontario has introduced a bill for the entire province specifically targeting local Toronto issues does not make any sense. It should remember that it is governing a province, not the city that is hosting it's legislature\nBut gridlock is still an issue right now. and something still needs to be done. If the Government of Ontario truly wants to help ease congestion and help people move around the Toronto faster, there are solutions that do not require ripping out existing infrastructure for dubious benefit. First of all, to help car traffic, they can push people to travel on currently underutilized car infrastructure. The 407 is a perfect candidate for helping to reduce congestion for people trying to get across Toronto. Subsidizing tolls would help get cars off of the congested 401 and help move more people around.\nSecond, expediting the construction of the Eglinton LRT would go a long way for reducing the number of trips people currently use a car for, thus reducing traffic. The government has shown with the current progress on the Gardiner that it can successfully speed up a construction project. Applying the same effort to get the LRT open ASAP would go a long way for getting people out of cars and onto transit, reducing traffic for everyone else who still needs to drive.\nIt's incredibly disappointing that this government seems to be willfully ignorant of actual solutions to congestion, and are actively working against efforts that can meaningfully address the issue. I hope that the Government of Ontario can shelve this plan and instead propose measures that can help Ontario and her cities grow sustainably.\n"
