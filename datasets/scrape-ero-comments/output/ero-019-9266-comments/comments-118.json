        "comment": "Please let municipalities continue to choose where they position bike lanes and whether they prioritize other forms of road traffic in certain areas.\nBike lanes provide huge positive impact to businesses, the health and safety for cyclists, as well as the health of others and the environment by reducing the number of cars in the road.\nAlthough some people are comfortable biking in traffic if there are no bike lanes, many people give it up if there isn't a dedicated lane for fear of their safety. This is completely understandable in big cities, where there are quite often distracted drivers in phones, aggressive drivers, or new drivers who aren't yet familiar with all of the road hazards they need to be looking for.\nBike lanes provide enormous benefit to our communities, and not allowing local communities to decide where they go would be a shame.\n"

Locally elected officials are more than capable of deciding whether or not a bike lane should be added to some random street in a city.\nAdditionally in dense urban areas the provision of bike infrastructure alongside of public transportation (and removal of car infrastructure) will reduce gridlock, not vice versa.\nMaking urban areas more pedestrian, cyclist, and public transit-friendly will reduce fatal traffic accidents, reduce average commute times, and improve economic activity.\n"

        "comment": "The way the government is talking about this Act fuels a divisive rhetoric of \"bikes versus cars.\" But what we can all agree on is that safer streets, with slower moving traffic in urban areas, saves lives. Lives of loved ones that we all have.\nProtected bike lanes are the best way to keep cyclists safe on streets, as research shows. It also shows that because of induced demand, adding more lanes of traffic does not in fact ease congestion. In addition, vehicles are a leading cause of carbon emissions in Canada.\nThis is 2024. Climate change is a reality. The way we live and move must adapt. Please drop this regressive Act and show true leadership by bringing people together under the common cause of safer streets for all.\n"

I think it is extremely irresponsible to put people\u2019s lives at risk for a little convenience if removing these lanes even provides that. I work for the City of Toronto in the social services sector and strongly oppose the idea of removing Toronto\u2019s bike lanes for the health and safety of its residence.

In fact it's universally regarded as the opposite; the more you make driving the only option the more people are going to be forced to drive, and traffic worsens. Complete streets with mixed-modal access are the only way forward.\nIf you really want to save people time, and not save the profits of automakers, expand public transit and build high-speed rail.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this legislation, in fact, if it were to become law I would increasingly fear for my safety.\nI am a resident of St James Town, downtown Toronto, and I am a daily biker. Biking is my primary mode of transport and I ride throughout the year. I have been hit by cars 5 times over the past year alone, always on roads with no bike lanes or where the bike lanes are temporarily blocked due to construction. I have been hospitalized as a result of some of these accidents. Just this summer, bikers were killed on the Bloor st bike lane - which I ride every day.\nBike lanes are an integral part of daily infrastructure that I NEED to navigate Toronto. Removing bike lanes for the sake of car infrastructure proves to me who are the residents that the province cares about. I am not one of them.\nNo matter what happens with this legislation, I will continue to ride my bike in Toronto and I will continue to assert my space on the road. It's the only way to stay alive. I wish the province would support me and the cycling community in trying to stay alive, but evidently politicians don't care about that. Please cancel this legislation and continue adding more bike lanes\n"

Time and time again more increasing car infrastructure has proven to just increase traffic at a bigger scale. It\u2019s a temporary solution. More bike lanes, more public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I moved to Toronto from Calgary about 1.5 years ago, and I've noticed a significant difference in the cycling infrastructure. In Calgary, there are great paths along the river and through parks, but they don\u2019t connect well to places where people work or do business. In contrast, Toronto\u2019s bike lanes on major streets like Yonge and Bloor connects cyclists directly to work, restaurants, and other key destinations, making cycling a more practical choice for daily commutes. This direct connectivity can significantly reduce the number of car trips, easing congestion and contributing to a more sustainable urban environment.\nI work on Yonge Street and use both the Bloor and Yonge bike lanes daily. These lanes are essential routes for my commute and keep me safe. Without them, I would feel much less secure biking on those streets and would have to take a much longer, more complicated route to work. When bike lanes are integrated into the existing urban fabric, they encourage more people to ride, knowing they have safe and efficient routes. This not only enhances safety but also creates a more vibrant city atmosphere, as people feel more comfortable biking.\nAdditionally, the presence of bike lanes on busy streets can influence traffic behavior, often leading to more cautious driving around cyclists. Overall, bike infrastructure plays a vital role in reshaping urban mobility, promoting active transportation, and enhancing the quality of life in cities.\nFurthermore, the science and data are clear: Bike lanes reduce traffic and congestion.\nThe impact of bike lanes on traffic and congestion can be broken down into several key areas:\n1) Increased Cycling Rates: When cities invest in bike lanes, more people are likely to choose cycling as a mode of transportation. Research has shown that the presence of dedicated bike lanes significantly boosts cycling rates. More cyclists mean fewer cars on the road, which helps reduce congestion.\n2) Safety Improvements: Bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists and other vulnerable road users, reducing the risk of accidents. This safety encourages more people to ride bikes and other alternative forms of transportation like scooters, contributing to a cycle of increased cycling and reduced vehicle traffic. Safer streets benefit everyone, including pedestrians and drivers.\n3) Traffic Flow: With fewer cars on the road, overall traffic flow improves. Studies have indicated that bike lanes can help reduce the number of short car trips, which are often the most problematic for congestion. When people choose bikes for short distances, it can ease pressure on roadways.\n4) Environmental Benefits: Reduced car usage leads to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. This is particularly important in urban areas, where pollution can have significant health impacts. Promoting cycling as an alternative transportation option aligns with sustainability goals.\n5) Economic Impact: Cities that invest in bike infrastructure often see economic benefits as well. Cyclists tend to spend more at local businesses compared to motorists, who may drive past without stopping. You can fit 8-12 parked bikes in the space of a single parked car. Bike-friendly environments can boost local economies and in turn increase municipal and provincial tax revenue.\n6) Land Use and Urban Design: Bike lanes can influence how cities are designed, promoting more compact, walkable neighbourhoods. This can lead to better land use, with less reliance on cars and more emphasis on public transit, walking, and cycling. Again, this increases tax revenue.\n7) Health Benefits: Cycling and other active transportation modalities promote physical health, reducing healthcare costs over time by encouraging active lifestyles. Healthier citizens reduce healthcare costs and extend their productivity, which increases the tax revenue over their lifespan.\nOverall, bike lanes are an essential component of modern urban transportation strategies, contributing to healthier, safer, and more sustainable cities.\nI strongly believe that the government should not proceed with building Highway 413. Instead, those funds would be better spent on expanding public transit and bike lane projects that promote sustainable transportation options. Investing in these alternatives not only helps reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances accessibility for all residents. Additionally, implementing tolls on existing highways could help manage traffic demand and generate revenue that could be reinvested into public transit and active transportation infrastructure. This approach would create a more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation system, ultimately benefiting our communities and the planet.\nI would be happy to discuss my experience further.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident in the largest city in Ontario, I strongly disagree with the provincial involvement in the decision making regarding municipal bike lanes unless guidance/resources are explicitly sought out by the municipality. This initiative is a weak attempt to draw attention away from the provincial governments failure to take action/complete effective multi-methods of transportation for decades (i.e. vehicular, public transportation, biking, and pedestrians). This also initative also shows that this provincial government prioritizes cars over people.\nBike lanes have been proven to have a positive impact on small businesses, minimal impacts on commute times, encourage communities to cycle more frequently (positives for individual and collective health as well as an improved environmental impact), slow down drivers which is vitally important in high foot traffic areas, and save cyclists lives. This only names a few of the statistically proven benefits (refer to link).\nI also strongly disagree with the removal of newly installed infrastructure as it is a colossal waste of resources (both physical and monetary).\n"

I deserve to be safe and separated from cars when I ride my bike in the city and you should be thanking me for doing so as that is one less car on the road during rush hour. Trying to appeal to your suburban base at the expense of people's lives is sad. Doug Ford should feel embarrassed for proposing that cars are more important than people on bikes with no protection from them. People in cars need to get used to the fact that as the city grows it gets more congested and moves like this will not help. There will just be more tragic and heartbreaking deaths. Doug Ford should think of the well being of his own family and their safety when they are outside of their cars. Bike lanes also make things safer for pedestrians as the separated bike lanes also get speeding cars further away from sidewalks.\nIn closing bike lanes MAKE THE CITY AND EVERYONE IN IT SAFER. I DO NOT support this bill or Doug Ford and his self-absorbed motives.\n"

We need to avoid gridlock by allowing alternative transit options.make it a pleasant city to actually live in.  Not just travel in to get somewhere else.  If everyone gets in a car, there will be more gridlock, more pollution, less ability to make quick stops to small businesses along our route, since with a car finding parking space is the next problem beyond gridlock. There is quality of life at stake here. There is small\nBusiness to look after. There is the public health issue too of the peol who actually live in this city.\n"
