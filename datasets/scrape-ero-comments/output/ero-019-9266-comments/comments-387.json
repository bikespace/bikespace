        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of city infrastructure, and are utilized successfully in major metropolitan cities throughout the world. It would be an egregious use of taxpayer money to deinstall perfectly functioning infrastructure that has recently been built, bypassing the opinions of cyclists, pedestrians, BIAs, and local businesses.\nBike lanes boost sales to neighborhood business, allow drivers to not be worried about hitting cyclists, and cyclists can travel knowing their chances of being hit by a vehicle are reduced. Reinstating the previous multi-lane arrangement with bicycles will kill lives. Cyclists heading to work, families in cars, and pedestrians can be killed because of these changes. These bike lanes are only one of a few examples that make the city of Toronto competitive to the pedestrian and cycle-friendly culture of European cities. Removing them would set a precedent that the only citizens in this city worth prioritizing are the high-income, able-bodied people who can afford cars as their primary mode of transportation.\nIs this the message that the City of Toronto wants to convey? That the rights, well-being, safety, and lives of its people are less important than its cars?\n"

        "comment": "I have been a Toronto resident for over 20 years. I have seen the pedestrian and cycling environment slowly improving in the city over this period. I have witnessed the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street, and the huge increase of people riding bikes at all times of day, and in particular during the morning and evening rush hours. At times there are visibly more bikes on the street than cars -- a line of just 10 cars stretches the length of half a city block, while 10 bikes side-by-side occupy a space not more than 10 meters long. In that respect, the bike lanes on Bloor have been a huge success that has reduced the amount of personal vehicle traffic.\nThis bill is a retrograde step that will discourage people from using bicycles to get around the city, resulting in increase of vehicle traffic. It will create a more dangerous environment for the remaining vulnerable road users, resulting in the increase of injuries and deaths.\nI am asking all Members of Provincial Parliament to oppose this bill.\n"

I'm also seriously concerned that this will impact my personal safety. Everyone deserves to be able to feel safe when traveling. Plus, isn't removing bike lanes just going to increase congestion? Instead of separating bikes from traffic so they're not slowing down cars you're proposing mixing the two together? Bikes are slower so it'd be much better if when I'm driving they're off in their own lane instead of slowing me down. Doesn't seem very common sense to me. Also, why rip up new infrastructure that's already built and waste millions of tax dollars?\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be adding red tape to prevent municipal governments from making their streets safer, more convenient, and faster for cyclists, let alone requiring the removal of some of the most important cycling infrastructure in Toronto. Bike lanes incentivise more activeness and are safer and more environmentally friendly transportation infrastructure than driving lanes, but they are also better for drivers. Separated lanes for bikes and cars are simpler and increase my sense of safety when I drive or bike. Additionally, bike lanes reduce congestion by reducing driving demand and being more space-efficient than driving lanes. The province should give grants to cities to expand bike share programs and protected bike lanes near transit stops to disincentivise people from driving long distances into cities, rather than implementing this regressive legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential method of transportation, and so they are a necessary part of the Toronto's infrastructure.\nThis bill puts the safety of bike riders at risk, as the bike lanes add a a layer of protection from cars.\nFrom the viewpoint of cars, this actually introduces more friction for drivers as they'll now have to share the road with bikers, essentially slowing down most right lanes on these roads anyways, instead of leaving bike traffic to the protected bike lanes.\nAnd finally, this bill will undoubtedly introduce more traffic and gridlock on these roads due to induced demand: more drivers will want to use these roads leading to more congestion. This is frankly a backwards approach, as the sole goal of reducing gridlock should be to remove as many single passenger car trips contesting these roads, instead of now incentivizing them.\n"

Plus, it will add needless time and red-tape, and slow-down any progress those communities are making with their transportation infrastructure plans. As a driver I would rather have cyclists in protected bike lanes than travelling in open busy streets,  They are very vulnerable and even minor interactions with a car/truck could be devastating for them.  Not to mention, the amount of young people who can not yet drive or chose not to drive, they should feel safe when biking, and I as a driver would feel more comfortable knowing they are in a protected bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this legislation, I feel it is short sighted and hypocritical.\nThe provincial governments regularly accuse the Federal Government of overreach and that the provinces are in the best position to make decision for their own province.  I therefore find it hypocritical that the province feels it knows what is best for the municipalities.\nThe revised proposal to remove bikes lanes from Toronto only, not other cities, also wreaks of the Premier's personal vendetta against Toronto.\nIf the province is going to require municipalities to ask for permission to put in a bike lane, then I expect the province to update urban planning codes to require that bike lanes be engineered from the beginning for all new developments.  As we need to accommodate more housing, which requires building new communities, then a full transport plan must be required by the province of all municipalities to ensure adequate and safe passage for people, cyclists, public transport, private cars and business vehicles (delivery trucks etc).\nIf the province is going to remove existing bike lanes, then they need to reimburse the municipalities for that initial cost and the province needs to pay for the removal.  And to be clear, this removal action is a massive waste of tax payer dollars and frankly irresponsible of the provincial government.  And as a conservative government that prides itself in fiscal responsibility, I cannot understand this incremental\nexpense. There are other priorities in the province that require funding.\nAs the population continues to grow, especially in Ontario, we cannot address congestion by adding more lanes for cars. There is literally a physical limit to that.  Alternatives need to be included for other modes of transport, not just bikes lanes.\nEach car takes up at least 75 square feet (5 foot wide, 15 feet long) where a bike takes up a fraction of that space.  Each cyclist that comes out of a car creates significantly more  room for multiple cars.  The argument that weather limits use is not true, cold weather riding is more comfortable that hot weather riding as your exertion warms you up and we are all fully aware of the benefits of toques and mitts.\nAnyone saying they \"didn't see anyone on the bike lane when they were on their commute\" may well be true for the minutes they were on that section of road , but what about when they were at home/work and not on the road?  They have no idea of how many bikes were used when they weren't there.\nI am a pedestrian, a driver, a cyclist and public transport user.  They all have merits.  Each time I choose to walk, ride or take public transport I take a car off the road leaving room for someone else that has to use their car.  Removing these alternatives for me and others only forces me onto the road and adding to the congestion.\nThe province's focus on Toronto is a complete waste of time and energy when other areas of the province needs the attention of the government and their resources.\n"

This bill:\n1. adds red tape and bureaucracy for local governments trying to increase transportation options - it's a completely unnecessary intrusion into municipal affairs.\n2. betrays a bias towards car-centric streets and transportation infrastructure - in urban centres this is not a viable approach - downtown traffic is already terrible enough, people need other options, like transit and cycling.\n3. reduces support for essential transportation infrastructure - bike lakes are key to ensure cyclists can move safely through dense urban environments, and help to keep motorists and cyclists apart from each other on the roads, which reduces the likelihood of accidents and fatalities.\n4. wastes tax dollars on ripping out important bike lanes in Toronto - infrastructure that was implemented with tax dollars in the first place - it's a really stupid use of funds that could be used to help local communities within Ontario's biggest city in much more productive ways.\nI fully support safe cycling infrastructure and making it possible for people to have more transportation options in our cities. This bill works against this and should not go forward.\n"

Also, removing the bike lanes on Bloor etc is silly, there will NEVER be enough car lanes to accommodate Toronto traffic, since it is such a busily growing region. We need to get people out of cars and into other forms of transportation.

With the removal of bike lanes you can rest assured I won't be taking him by bike anymore. So this will be adding another car to the commute. This policy will not stop me from biking in the road, but I imagine it will lead to more deaths and injuries on the road, as cyclist, I assume, will now find themselves in traffic. It's a shame that the conservatives are so bent on supporting car drivers. I guess this is another example of why we can't have nice things.\nI still have to wonder if the conservative government added this to their bill to distract from the changes to the environmental assessments for highway 413... it wouldn't be the first time they insulted the populace's intelligence by trying to sneak sketchy stuff into their governance.\n"

Plenty of other cities across the world, including Canadian cities (Montreal, Calgary, etc.), have shown that if you build out solid infrastructure that many people will opt to cycle or use other forms of micro-mobility.\n- Inferring that because people don't bike (due to the lack of infrastructure) means that people don't WANT to bike is incorrect. In fact, a study done of Toronto residence shows that there is actually an overwhelming desire to bike more (see attached image).\n- The idea that bike lanes CAUSE congestion is just plain misinformation; every study ever NOT done by a corporately backed lobby group has shown that improving pedestrian, bike, and public transit infrastructure eases congestion as not everyone feels they have to drive everywhere.\nI could go on for hours about how the reasoning behind this isn't based in any kind of reality, but I'll just end by saying study after study, and real world example after real world example, clearly show that bike infrastructure is better for peoples health, people's wallets, the planet, and even people in cars.\n"
