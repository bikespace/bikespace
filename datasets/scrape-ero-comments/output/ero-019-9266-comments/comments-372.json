        "comment": "I think this is a misuse of resources in time, money, and working power. This could be spent on better upgrading mass transit options to reduce congestion instead.\nIncluding but not limited to free transit (bus and subway), and increased service locations and times.\nRemoving the limitations of cost will increase usage, and help people who are already struggling. Increasing service area and times will allow more people to conveniently access these options. People are far more likely to use options that are close and reliable.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives downtown in Toronto and drives, I love having the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University. It has made both driving and biking so much safer, especially for families as biking with kids in streets with cars never feels safe. Having bikes in their own designated lane means that travelling through the city is safer for both drivers and cyclists! As a driver, I have found that the bike lanes have also REDUCED traffic congestion going through the city. I think removing bike lanes for more traffic lanes would have a grossly negative effect.\nAdditionally, as a member of the voting public I think the provincial government interceding in municipal affairs like this sets a terrible precedent. Mayor Chow was elected on a platform which included increasing bike lane. This is something the majority population of Toronto was in favour of. For the provincial government to attempt to overrule that (and needlessly spend our taxpayer money to do so) is a clear overreach. They should not be able to so directly interfere with the workings of our municipality, and on such a nit-picky issue.\nThey\u2019re already built! The people of the city asked for them and enjoy them! It is disappointing that this even made it to the table.\n"

People  can get to their homes to those we care about.\nSo that people want to come back to Toronto and spend a day or 2 or 3 and enjoy the city and fine parking to whatever event they are going to. This is also economics and financial economics of the city. It is ridiculous to expect people to spend money and come into a big city when they can not drive to Athena Vine Parking.  And the bike lanes have definitely added to this problem by three fold.\nPlease remove these bike lanes.Put them in secondary streets.\n"

Bike lanes are vital to the city\u2019s multi-modal transportation and I use them regularly to commute and get around safely. Further, proponents of this bill have cited no evidence to support their claims that bike lines cause \u2018gridlock\u2019, when in fact, transportation planners and experts on the subject argue that bike lines improve traffic and reduce motor vehicle demand.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my profound disappointment with the decision to rip out the bike lanes in Toronto. This move not only demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of urban transportation dynamics but also threatens to exacerbate the very traffic issues you claim to address.\nEliminating bike lanes is not a solution to traffic congestion; it is a regression into outdated thinking. Studies consistently show that protected bike lanes reduce traffic incidents, lower vehicular congestion, and encourage cycling as a viable mode of transportation. By removing these lanes, you are effectively prioritizing cars over the safety and convenience of cyclists and pedestrians, thereby increasing the number of vehicles on the road.\nThis decision seems to ignore the realities of a city grappling with rising population density and climate change. As more people seek alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, bike lanes provide a necessary infrastructure that supports a healthier, more sustainable urban environment. Ripping them out will not magically clear our roads; instead, it will likely lead to increased traffic jams, higher emissions, and a deteriorating quality of life for all Torontonians.\nIt's also important to note that the lanes were installed in 2020, and a 12-month evaluation period revealed limited to no impacts on motor vehicle travel times. The city has confirmed that emergency services have not raised any concerns regarding traffic on University Avenue. This evidence undermines the argument that removing bike lanes is necessary to facilitate quicker emergency response times. In fact, maintaining these lanes supports a balanced transportation system that accommodates all road users while ensuring that emergency services can operate effectively.\nFurthermore, the proposal to move bike lanes to side streets is not an effective solution. While it may seem like a compromise, diverting cyclists away from main thoroughfares can create confusion and danger. Most destinations\u2014be it shops, offices, parks, or public transit\u2014are located along main streets, making them essential routes for cyclists. By relocating bike lanes, you force cyclists into less visible and less monitored areas, increasing their risk of accidents. This approach not only deters potential cyclists from using their bikes but also undermines efforts to promote sustainable transportation. Ultimately, it makes our streets less safe for everyone and fails to address the real needs of urban commuters who rely on direct access to their destinations.\nI urge you to reconsider this shortsighted decision. Let\u2019s work towards a solution that promotes a comprehensive approach to transportation that respects the needs of all road users, not just those behind the wheel. The future of Toronto depends on our ability to innovate and adapt, not to retreat to the failed strategies of the past.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver and this makes me immensely uncomfortable. Knowing that cyclists are in their own lane, safely separated from my car is a relief. I frequently drive on the 3 main roads proposed and have not found any difference pre or post bike lanes in terms of traffic.\nAdding cyclists to regular lanes of traffic is a nightmare for us motorists and cyclists alike. It will add more time to commutes as cyclists take full lanes for their own safety. It will be more frustrating for us drivers to be sharing the lane rather than have dedicated lanes for cars and bikes each on main arteries as it is.\n"

        "comment": "I would like the Province to focus on actually solving major problems, not creating wedge issues. Countless reports underscore the absurdity of Ford's unilateral removal dreams--he's stated himself he doesn't care what the data says, and it's curious how focused he is on areas where he likes to drive. This is a dereliction of his duties to the taxpayers of the entire Province, and warrants investigation by the ombudsman.\nPerhaps his regime can focus on undoing the previous shameful PC govt's sale of the 407 for pennies on the dollar instead of putting cycling families at risk for cheap \"BUILD THE WALL/WRECK THE LANE\" imported rage-politics.\nIf only the Premier could be as cheap as his tactics, we might actually have money to keep hospitals functioning and Science Centre roofs patched. What a disgrace.\nAdditionally, the simple obsessive focus on municipal issues is a gross overstep of level of government delineation. It's clear Mr Ford cares not for learning how lanes work, and can't seem to even stay in his.\n"

        "comment": "The problem with gridlock is not that cities do not have enough space for cars. The problem is that they're too many cars. Adding one more lane of car traffic will only induce more people to use the road and cause it to return to its previously congested state. Ontario is expected to grow by 41.7 percent by 2051. We simply cannot support all the new residence driving a car, especially in a busy city like Toronto. The only way we can tackle traffic in the GTHA is by creating viable alternatives to driving such as biking. The province must justify why everyone except people living in the most expensive part in the country can only choose to drive. The province must justify why the transportation mode that is the least efficient, most dangerous, and least sustainable should be most peoples only option. Preserving communities and cities power to create extensive bike networks that have wide bike lanes that allows people of all ages to use them and emergency service vehicles to take advantage of them is the key to get more cars off the road and reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto, and cities in Ontario as a whole, need better alternatives to driving in order to reduce traffic. In a dense city environment like down town Toronto, vehicle lanes (and especially vehicle parking lanes) are a horribly space inefficient way of getting people around, and cost inefficient too. Cycling, taking transit, and walking are all better alternatives. Not only are these modes of transport more cost effective  (which is extremely important in a time where cost of living is rising) but they are also more space efficient, are FAR more eco friendly, and are SAFER! Safety is incredibly important, and in a time when deaths due to cars are ever so high, adding more car lanes is ridiculous. Not to mention car lanes means more vehicle noise. Bike lanes are incredibly cheap to build and maintain compared to vehicle lanes too, keeping these bike lanes is a no brainer, and expanding the bike network in Toronto would be an incredible improvement, and will increase bike ridership, making roads safer, and taking what would otherwise be another car in gridlock, a cyclist who will be saving money, getting to their destination quicker, and helping the environment.\nThe Ontario provincial government has no business interfering with cities planning to replace car lanes with bike lanes. Interfering with progress is not what we need. Passing this bill will not only harm those who cannot afford to drive, but waste an incredible amount of money, if and when money goes into planning for bike lanes fully agreed upon within a city just for them to get rejected provincially. Instead of requiring approval from the Ontario government to build bike lanes, cities should be provided more opportunities to fund transit and bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Incredibly foolish plan. Bike lanes help to prevent lethal accidents- which the province has acknowledged as being a major contributor to traffic congestion- and the idea of creating MORE construction in downtown's highly congestible areas just to remove bike lanes that have already been established is, frankly, poorly thought-through. Common study findings have been that bike lanes overall improve traffic flow- and I believe that adding more car lanes in downtown would have very little positive influence on traffic flow. Additionally, requiring provincial government's approval for cities to keep or build bike lanes seems like an unnecessary bureaucratic factor that would unnecessarily slow down traffic improvement projects across the province even further, and would be a waste of our tax dollars to boot. I am of the opinion that the costs outweigh the benefits for this movement, and as a citizen of Ontario, am strongly opposed to the proposed framework.\n"
