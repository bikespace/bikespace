        "comment": "Hello, I would like to state that I vehemently oppose this bill proposal. I believe it is a classist, counter-productive, and overall harmful bill. It reads as a thinly-veiled plot to line the pockets of Doug Ford's construction cronies while spousing a false narrative of making the province more efficient.\nFirst I would like to show why this bill proposal is classist and will, in effect, harm lower income individuals and families. According to the Autotrader price index report, as of June 2024 the average cost of a new car is 66,807 CAD and the average cost of a used car is 36, 342 CAD. According to Statistics Canada, the average annual income in Ontario for an individual is 58, 700 CAD. Lower income individuals and families RELY on alternate modes of transportation other than cars. Cycling is a cheap, efficient way to commute. Many citizens are not able to afford a motorized vehicle, and a bicycle is a necessary alternative for them. I understand that public transit is also an option but can be unreliable, especially considering the service cuts already imposed on the T.T.C. It is a direct act of class violence to remove existing, safe bike lanes. I will expand upon this below.\nI believe this to be not only an unnecessary bill, but a dangerous one. There have been six instances of a fatal traffic collision involving a cyclist in Toronto this year. That is six cyclist fatalities to be clear. This number is a single-year record for Toronto. This number would undoubtedly grow if you take away the already too few bike lanes that already exist. There is already a blatant disrespect for cyclists and bike lanes considering how often they are obstructed by construction, garbage bins, or countless other objects. Removing these basic, minimal safeguards you expose cyclists to the regular flow of traffic, which increases the likelihood of a serious collision. This is not rocket science.\nLastly I want to speak on how this bill is counter-productive in achieving its outlined goals. This proposal claims that removing bike lanes will increase efficiency by easing congestion on Ontario highways and roads. Forgive me, but I do not see in any reasonable way how the removal of bike lanes in metropolitan areas will have any effect whatsoever on the congestion of highways. This is a MASSIVE reach, and in fact I believe that it will have the opposite effect. Studies show that adding more alternative modes of transportation is the most efficient way to ease traffic congestion. Taking away bike lanes will force thousands of people into cars, adding to the congestion. As for the thousands more who cannot afford cars, they are left with much fewer options. Either take public transit which would likely extend their commute significantly, or continue to cycle at an massively increased risk to their health and safety.\nIn conclusion, I think this is a completely unnecessary bill that will massively inconvenience thousands of citizens, if not directly making their lives significantly harder. It reads as a thinly-veiled excuse to line the pockets of Doug Ford's friends. We have seen this play many times in our premier's tenure. It is completely unacceptable and gross to put citizens at risk through the guise of \"efficiency\". Furthermore, it does not make a good case for nor does it provide evidence for its claims. I strongly urge to vote no on this bill.\nSincerely, a concerned citizen.\n"

        "comment": "I recently moved to Ottawa because of the bike lane system. After living in Europe and being able to cycle and walk everywhere with many city center cores not allowing cars, cycling is a vital part of my lifestyle.\nThe bike lanes were central to our lifestyle of living sustainability.\nLarger roads invite MORE cars and create more traffic, degrading the center city experience.\nSustainability is a crucial concern of mine; we must dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and cyclists do not create carbon emissions.\nObesity is a growing pandemic; the more we can encourage people to cycle, the more we fight obesity. People are scared to cycle next to cars; adding bike lanes and more people cycling will make them healthier and will make fewer demands on our health care services.\nLet Ottawa and other municipalities decide for themselves. Capitals around the world are competing for tourist dollars; people love to cycle on vacation; it feels like an adventure. Each city has unique needs. Let us decide for ourselves.\nThe bike lanes are in place; removing them wastes taxpayers' money.\nLocal shops will suffer; if I cannot bike to them, I won't go.\nE-bikes are changing the face of transportation. Without bike lanes, they will be on the roads; people have invested a fortune in these bikes and will continue using them. It will be unsafe for cyclists and drivers alike.\nCycling is fun and free. With all our economic pressures, let people use cycling to save money.  It needs to be safe.\nWe have a mental health crisis; cycling supports mental health, being outdoors, joining others, and feeling connected rather than isolated in our cars; we need more, not fewer, bike lanes.\nThis issue is fundamental to me. It will decide how I vote.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "City infrastructure is the business of city voters and taxpayers, not the province. This sets a dangerous precedent of provincial overreach.\nAs a taxpayer and Toronto resident:\nI feel very strongly the roads and infrustructure within the city ARE THE SOLE CONCERN OF TORONTO TAXPAYERS AND VOTERS AND THAT THE PROVINCE HAS NO BUSINESS TELLING TORONTO VOTERS AND RESIDENTS WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO RUN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I very much doubt folks in barrie or oshawa would take too kindly to provincial leaders based in Toronto telling them how to run their cities.\nJust because Toronto is the provincial seat does not mean we have taxation without representation like the district of columbia (washington DC)  in the US.\nAs a user of roads and bike lanes:\nAs a daily, all season bike commuter, the lanes on bloor from High park to University prove extremely helpful, especially when the weather turns.  That said, any continuous, traffic separated, east-west bike lane(say a block off bloor or on dupont) would work well- it doesn't have to be bloor or university, and may work better if it weren't\nAs a driver who regularly goes to downtown, Its not at all clear to me that gridlock on Bloor or University got any worse as a result of the lanes-- its always been a no-go most weekdays during rush hour. It does make truck deliveries harder on local businesses, but this is a city and cities have those difficulties regardless.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident and frequent user of the Bloor Street, University Avenue, and College Street bike lanes, I would like to state my strong opposition to Bill 212. Time saved for drivers should not come at the expense of biker safety. The removal of bike lanes in Toronto and other Ontario cities will lead to many cyclists opting to drive or ride-share in these locations rather than cycle, worsening traffic gridlock. Those that choose to cycle without the safety of bike lanes will be much more at risk for injury or death by collision with motor vehicles. This bill is bad for Ontario and should not be passed.\n"

        "comment": "I pay almost 50% in my taxes and I am very happy that bike lanes exist in our city.\nThe reason for increased traffic is not because some car lanes have been converted into bike lanes, the reason for an increased traffic is because everyone has to drive in order to get to the place where they work. We have suburbs where people sleep and cities where people work. We will never solve our traffic issues in so far as this configuration remains.\nWhat will end up happening is that we will remove lanes and very quickly find out that the traffic has not improved at all because bike lanes were never the reason in the first place.\nPlease, it would be a far better way to spend our tax money on increasing the supply of affordable housing. Bike lanes is not a priority and is not the enemy.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\n### Conclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "I write as an Ontarian and Torontonian who is concerned about the environmental, public health, safety, economic, and community impacts of Bill 212 and the \u201cFramework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\u201d. I urge the Ministry of Transportation to withdraw this irresponsible, misguided Bill in its entirety.\nENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS\nActive transportation, including cycling, is a key part of both the Province\u2019s and the City of Toronto\u2019s plans to meet their climate goals. Bill 212\u2019s anti-bike lane framework is inconsistent with Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Strategy, which notes that, at 35%, transportation emissions are the single-largest source of emissions in the province and acknowledges that \u201cOntario must transition as many existing drivers as possible to transit, cycling and walking.\u201d The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report similarly highlights the importance of active transportation, including cycling, to reduce GHG emissions and improve health.\nNot only does active transportation help reduce GHG emissions, it also helps reduce traffic-related air pollution. The City of Toronto has identified increasing active transportation as a key part of the City\u2019s plans to reduce traffic-related air pollution \u2013 the largest source of air pollution emitted in Toronto.\nThe anti-bike lane framework is contrary to the Ministry of Transportation\u2019s own Statement of Environmental Values, which states that the Ministry is focused on delivering specific priorities including:\n\u2022\tPromoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation, that supports the efficient movement of goods and people.\n\u2022\tPromoting road safety and remaining one of the safest jurisdictions in North America.\n\u2022\tIntegrating sustainability into the ministry\u2019s decision making, programs, policies and operations.\nMaking it harder for municipalities to build bike lanes \u2013 and removing existing bike lane infrastructure \u2013 will increase reliance on motor vehicles which will increase GHG emissions and increase traffic-related air pollution.\nThe Ministry has offered no justification for acting with blatant disregard for its own Statement of Environmental Values and indeed demonstrates it has given no consideration to the environmental or public health impacts of this Bill whatsoever.\nREDUCING MOBILITY OPTIONS AND INCREASING TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND GRIDLOCK\nI live in Toronto with my family, which includes two children under the age of 5. We travel around the city by car, by bike, by transit, and on foot. About a year and a half ago, I started cycling as my primary mode of transportation around the city, because I found this was usually the most efficient mode of travel. My five-year-old also loves riding her bike, including biking to school. I am able to bike to school with her and then bike to work afterwards because of bike lanes on the major roads connecting our home, her school, and my office, including one of the bike lanes the Ministry wants to remove. Safe, protected bike lanes enable my family to make the efficient, healthy, environmentally friendly choice to travel by bike for some trips where otherwise we would likely need to rely on a car.\nRemoving the ability to travel safely by bicycle in Toronto removes choices for how to travel safely and efficiently around our growing city and will increase car trips, further increasing traffic congestion and gridlock.\nSAFETY CONCERNS\nThe evidence is clear that protected bike lanes improve road safety for all road users \u2013 including cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. Bike lanes are an essential part of the City of Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero plan to improve road safety.\nThe anti-bike lane framework is harmful for all Ontarians, but especially for children. Children are the most vulnerable road users, and making roads less safe for children is inexcusable. As a parent, my greatest concern for the safety of my children is motor vehicle traffic. Every day, I see dangerous driving in my neighbourhood and across the city, from drivers who are careless, distracted, don\u2019t understand the rules of the road or don\u2019t think those rules should apply to them. The City is trying to make our roads safer and the Province is now trying to prevent them from doing so.\nI will reiterate: bike lanes improve safety for all road users and they are a crucial part of Toronto\u2019s attempts to make its roads safer. Preventing Toronto from expanding its safe cycling network, and removing existing safe cycling infrastructure, will make Toronto\u2019s roads more dangerous and will lead to injuries and deaths of vulnerable road users.\nECONOMIC IMPACTS: RED TAPE, WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY, AND IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES\nThe bureaucratic red tape and waste of time and money imposed by requiring municipalities to ask the Province for permission to install bike lanes on municipal roads is unconscionable. Further, ripping out existing, well-used, protected bike lanes in Toronto \u2013 without even the pretense of justifying this decision based on any evidence \u2013 is an egregious waste of taxpayer money. The City has estimated the cost of removing protected bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University at $48 million and the Province admits it has not even bothered to consider the costs of the bike lane removals. Whether the City or the Province ends up saddled with the costs of this wasteful project, it is the Ontario taxpayer who ultimately pays. The fiscal irresponsibility of this Bill is shocking.\nMoreover, evidence shows bike lanes are good for the local economy, especially small businesses. The Bloor-Annex Business Improvement Association has collected evidence that shows that monthly customer spending and number of customers in the Bloor Annex increased after bike lanes were installed on Bloor Street. Removing bike lanes, and preventing the expansion of Toronto's bike lane network, will hurt small businesses.\nNO EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THIS ANTI-BIKE LANE FRAMEWORK\nThe Ministry has not cited any evidence to support its bald assertion that reducing safe biking infrastructure would \u201creduce gridlock\u201d. All available evidence \u2013 from the City of Toronto and municipalities worldwide, from transportation and planning experts, and from the Province\u2019s own documents \u2013 demonstrates the precise opposite: that safe, protected cycling infrastructure is a key feature of a multi-modal transportation network that offers efficient travel options and reduces congestion and gridlock.\nThe Ministry has also offered no justification for prioritizing driving \u2013 the least efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation \u2013 over other modes of transportation. Why does the time and comfort of a person who chooses to travel by car matter more than a person who chooses to travel by foot, by bicycle, or by public transportation? Why does the Ministry want to prevent municipalities from considering the expertise of planners and engineers to design safe and efficient transportation systems that work well for the needs of the people who live there?\nIn summary, Bill 212 and the \u201cFramework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\u201d is an environmentally harmful, fiscally unsound proposal that will make transportation in cities like Toronto less efficient and less safe. It should be withdrawn in its entirety.\n"
