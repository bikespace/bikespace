There is ample parking for businesses.\nPLEASE do not remove the bike lanes! They are a safe way for me and my family to get around the city.\nThe gridlock would be improved if you allowed for the toll on the DVP, keeping cars out of the downtown core. Spend the $40Million + dollars to finish the Eglinton cross town,  TTC upgrades and electrification of the GO trains.\n"

        "comment": "This legislature is fundamentally flawed in two ways.\nThe first being that the province should not be interfering with municipal governments ability to run their own municipality.  Our governance is based on each level of government having certain areas of responsibility and that is where their focus should be.\nThe second flaw is the plan won't work and will in fact make traffic worse and out lives in danger. The way to reduce grid lock is to increase the viability of other options, such as cycling and public transit.  The more lanes you have the more traffic you will get, and the gridlock will continue.  There are numerous examples of roads with no like lanes that have grid lock.\nI believe this bill is politically motivated and not based on studies or factual evidence.\nIf passed this bill will be a big step backwards environmentally, safety wise, and will not solve the problem.\n"

Many studies have proven a balanced approach to transportation where cars a part of the road access and not the dominant form of transportation.  A liveable city is what is needed for human beings to thrive  Cars have a place just like cycling , walking and public transit.  It is a wasteful step backward\ndon't do it\n"

More people on bicycles will actually reduce traffic, not increase it - more people on bikes can fit in the same space that a single driver in a car takes up.\nIt also seems like a massive overreach for a provincial government to step into municipal politics and tell a city or town what is best for the commuters in their municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford & Minister Sharkaria,\nWith no supporting facts, your government has put legislation before the House at Queen\u2019s Park that would require municipalities to seek provincial approval for future bike lanes that replace vehicular lanes, on the grounds that this would ease traffic congestion.\nJournalists have fact-checked the Premier\u2019s remarks and there is ample evidence that disproves bike lanes are the cause of traffic congestion.\nGiven the lack of detail, we ask that the following be considered;\n\u2022 The safety of all road users, including cyclists, is a paramount concern and a fundamental responsibility of both provincial and municipal governments.\n\u2022 The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario (\u201cOCC\u201d) conducted the Cycling Death review, which was the most comprehensive review into the causes of cycling deaths in Ontario. The findings of the review included recommendations which targeted improved cycling infrastructure, education, legislation\nand enforcement. Of note within the review was the adoption of \u201cComplete Streets\u201d, which\nemphasizes the planning, designing, building, operating, and maintaining streets that enable safe\naccess for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities.\n\u2022 Municipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs, including the development and maintenance of safe cycling infrastructure within their community. Locally, municipalities and regions have transportation plans in place which recognize the need to support and construct safe cycling infrastructure within our communities, including future bike lanes, as an integral part of improving the safety of vulnerable road users, which is now being jeopardized by this proposed legislation.\n\u2022 In recent polling conducted by CTV News / NANOS Research, Canadians were asked about their level of support regarding the construction of bike lanes even if building those lanes meant reducing traffic lanes for cars. The response received \u201cCanadians are more likely to be OK with the construction of bike lanes even if it causes a loss of traffic lanes for cars.\u201d\n\u2022 CAA recent polling further supports bike lanes with the following findings: \u201cThe poll asked Canadians what type of infrastructure would lead them to cycle more often? Lanes separated by barriers led the list, with 40% of Canadians saying it would move them to cycle more.\u201d\n\u2022 Premier Ford once expressed on a televised bike ride in 2017, that vulnerable road users are at risk without protected infrastructure and that we must ensure their safety.\nAs such, it cannot be stated enough; bike lanes do not cause traffic congestion, single occupancy motor vehicle trips on our roadways are causing traffic congestion. Should this bike lane legislation move forward, the opportunity to prioritize safety for all road users is being lost, and worse, more preventable life altering injuries and fatalities will happen.\nIn closing, the citizens request is simple; we urge you to not introduce restrictive bike lane legislation. Not just because this infrastructure saves life and helps lower traffic congestion, but because it is an incredible provincial over-reach. THE MONEY AND RESOURCES spent to enact this bill would be ludicrous and it is not the business of the province what the lower-tier offices do with the roads that are within their responsibility.\nThank you for your consideration on this important matter. Lives are worth more than this transparent pandering.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill proposal is a thinly disguised attempt to deflect blame away from major construction projects (like the Metrolinx cross-town) as the primary reason for slowing down the roadways of Toronto. It is a shallow attack on an easy target - a targeting of cyclists and cycle lane infrastructure framed as the enemy. Removing all of the hard work that has been put into making Toronto a healthy and accessible city at taxpayer expense, makes zero sense.\nIt appears to me too that this Bill paves the way for a continuation of the environmental affronts that this administration has already proven very adept at.\nI strongly renounce this proposal and would hope that rational decision-makers do the same.\n"

        "comment": "Returning vehicular only lanes to where the bike lanes have been installed will make streets unsafe, slower, and an extremely wasteful amount of time, tax payers money and construction resources for everyone utilizing these roads.\nThe bike lanes on University, Bloor Street, and other roads have been coordinated with traffic engineers, community members, businesses, city planners and staff for a number of years. To return them back to vehicular only lanes makes the streets unsafe for not only cyclists, but pedestrians and cars as well. More lanes means faster speeds and unsafe drivers.\nGiven the numerous cyclist deaths and collisions this year alone in the city, this is a regression in civic planning and city building.\nAs a cyclist, transit rider, driver, pedestrian, and overall champion for greater mobility in the city, this proposal is a one-sided, biased and provides little data to improving the safety of our streets.\nAs well, this also shows the Ontario government's disregard for environmental stewardship and support for modes of transportation that is not fossil-fuel based. Adding more cars on the road does not improve traffic conditions that get folks where they need to be faster. This solution adds more capacity to a volume of vehicular service that is already broken to begin with.\n"

        "comment": "The problem causing traffic congestion on Bloor St. is not the bike lanes, it is the Parking. Before the bike lanes were installed there were two traffic lanes going in either direction but the right lane was not drivable, because this lane was always blocked by parked cars. Removal of the bike lanes will accomplish nothing in terms of improved traffic flow. That lane has always been blocked. This is obvious.\nGetting rid of parked cars on Bloor Street is the answer, in terms of improving traffic flow. Build multi level parking structures near the Hot Spots on Bloor starting with the ones adjacent to the subway stations and wherever there is an existing Green P parking lot, or any parking lot for that matter. Anything to direct traffic away from Bloor St. Spend the money that will be wasted removing bike lanes on getting cars off of Bloor St. It would be interesting to know how much congestion is caused by drivers just circling around looking for a parking spot. I know that I have done it.\nBloor Street is a destination.  Greek Town, Bloor West Village are nice places to go. Make it easier for everyone. Spend money on getting cars OFF of Bloor.\n"

Encouraging cycling reduces the number cars on the road. Bike lanes will be a key element of Toronto\u2019s transit system as more and more (and more and more) residents live in dense downtown condo buildings without adequate parking for each tenant. Not everyone in Toronto can drive a car - there physically isn\u2019t enough space - so we have to share the streets. It\u2019s the only logical way to grow the city.\n"

To get to work. To actually move around the city.\nWho's driving a car or truck in Toronto? People that don't live here. If the government were to actually listen to people that live in this city, they would learn that we need more, not less biking infrastructure. And more public transportation. And that cars are killing us and ruining our communities.\nI'm absolutely sick of Doug Ford's divisive politics, especially now that he's bringing people's lives and health into it by waging war against bikes. Bikes?\nThis is some nice slight of hand, but at the end of the day, we remember the Greenbelt.\n"
