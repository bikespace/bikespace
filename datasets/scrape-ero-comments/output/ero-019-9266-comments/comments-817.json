        "comment": "I am a resident in Etobicoke who lives just north of Royal York and Bloor. I have lived in this area all my life. The introduction of bike lanes has changed our community for the worse. Traffic along Bloor St has slowed immensely and drivers are diverting off the arterial road onto the side streets which were not built for this volume of traffic. The traffic on our street has increased by a factor of 10. There are no sidewalks on our street and vehicles speed up to make up for lost time on Bloor. It is no longer safe to walk in our neighborhood and it is only a matter of time until someone is injured or killed.\nI personally am not against bike lanes, but consultation with the community has been minimal. City officials have done their best to minimize impact once two vehicle lanes were assigned to bikes. However, there has been no meaningful impact assessment. We are told that it was a political decision.\nNow city politicians tell us that it will cost 3 times more to remove bike lanes than it cost to install them in the first place. At a meeting held at Etobicoke Collegiate, we were told by city officials that emergency response times have improved since two dedicated traffic lanes were removed. This has to be nonsense - emergency vehicles must also divert because traffic driving along Bloor have nowhere to pull over.\nAll of this to say, please save our community and remove the bike lanes on Bloor.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. I bike to work 2-3 times per week (on the Bloor and Young lanes) and also bike as a volunteer delivery rider for the Toronto Bike Brigade 1-2 times per week (all over the city). Thus, multiple times a week, whether I am biking with my laptop bag or my bike trailer full of foodbank packages, I rely on bike lanes to get me where I am going, and home again, safely. Researchers and physicians oppose this Bill because they know that bike lanes help reduce preventable deaths on the road. And broader global research shows that bike lanes actually reduce congestion (and emissions) AND they are a boon to small businesses (which is why you will find many Toronto BIAs support the bike lanes). We should be crafting policy that incentivizes citizens to use bikes and transit to get around - THAT is what will aid congestion.\n"

It keeps me moving faster as I don't have to keep watching for people darting in and out of my lane and most importantly, makes travel safer for all.\nIf this was truly about improving traffic and not corruption, the province might look at banning parking on certain main thoroughfares instead, as parked cars are usually the lane blockers.\nI've never voted conservative in my life in part due to regressive policies such as these that take us backwards instead of into the future.\nRegressive conservatives - shame on you all!\n"

It undermines the consultation process; reveres progress in reducing carbon emissions; and eliminates a safe method of active transportation. It will deeply reduce economic activity on the corridors in which the bike lanes will be removed. Businesses will suffer. It is clear that this government does not understand many concepts, the first being the concept of induced demand. If a lane is removed, more drivers will continue driving on it until congestion reaches the current levels observed today. Additional, this will only serve to ADD drivers to the road.\nThe other clauses in this bill are obviously concerning as well. This government has lost the plot and does not understand what are actual drivers of economic activity.\n"

        "comment": "Moving away from sustainable transportation strategy which actually promotes a cleaner, greener, happier and healthier City is totally unacceptable and appalling. As a tax payer, it is unacceptable for me to use tax money to rip out an infrastructure which should actually be more common.\nMoving away from car based transportation should be a long term strategy for Ontario and Canada in general. Putting needs of cars ahead of people's need to move is wrong, and confusing car's speed with faster commuting is also a fallacy.\nThe contention that car is what people want so we should give it to them is also flawed- it should be government's responsibility to educate people towards a sustainable future. So if a sector of society wants car based transportation, they should be educated to the benefits of sustainable modes of transport. Secondly, if saying it is a democracy, so in that similar argument, would we give them something bad if they want something wrong- like drugs? No!\nBig picture should be clear- make Ontario leader in sustainable transport, put tax money to good use.\nBikes, skating, walking, public transit reduces economic burden on weaker society sections, makes cities more livable, reduces urban heat island, reduces flooding and stormwater management costs, and keep the population happier and healthier.\nLastly, the fact that Province is proposing to bypass environmental legislation in so many large infrastructure projects undermine our trust in their capacity to provide us a clean sustainable future. There has been too much investment in public infrastructure, and very little in the manufacturing sector.\n"

        "comment": "The Evidence is Clear: Toronto's Bike Lanes Should Stay. It\u2019s better for the city in every way. We should not waste our energy into this, it would be an embarrassing for a city as developed as ours to do this. People will cycle anyways, making driving more slow and dangerous. Demand for cars are induced in the long term, which makes traffic worse over time. We don\u2019t need more exhaust fumes and honking, we need better public transit to actually provide the benefits that this bill falsely attempts to seek.\nAs a concerned Toronto resident and urban planning enthusiast, I've delved into the research about bike lanes, and the findings overwhelmingly support keeping and expanding our cycling infrastructure. Let me break down why removing bike lanes would be a costly mistake.\nLocal businesses often worry about losing customers when bike lanes are installed, but the data tells a different story. When researchers studied Toronto's own Bloor Street, they found that customers arriving by bike spent more money per month than those arriving by car (Arancibia et al., 2019). Property values also tend to increase in areas with good cycling infrastructure - a study in Pittsburgh showed a 2.5% increase in housing prices near bike-sharing stations (Liu & Shi, 2020).\nThe argument that removing bike lanes will improve traffic flow is fundamentally flawed. Studies consistently show that removing cycling infrastructure doesn't solve congestion - it actually makes it worse through induced demand. Research from Vancouver demonstrated that after implementing protected bike lanes, travel times for vehicles remained stable while cycling trips increased by 40% (Henderson & Gulsrud, 2021).\nI've heard the concerns about bike lanes causing chaos, but the evidence points in the opposite direction. Protected bike lanes reduce injury risk by 90% compared to streets without cycling infrastructure (Thompson et al., 2022). When everyone has their designated space, the street actually functions more efficiently for all users.\nWith Toronto's commitment to reducing emissions, removing bike lanes would be a step backward. Transportation accounts for 35% of our city's emissions, and every person who cycles instead of drives helps reduce this number (City of Toronto Climate Action Report, 2023).\nThe money required to remove bike lanes could be better spent on expanding our subway system. Public transit investments show a return of $4 for every dollar spent, compared to the negative returns associated with removing cycling infrastructure (Transit Economic Analysis Group, 2023).\nInstead of giving in to short-term complaints, we need to think about the Toronto we want to build for the future. Cities that have embraced cycling infrastructure - like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Montreal - consistently rank among the most livable cities globally. We should learn from their success, not move backward.\nThe bottom line is this: removing bike lanes would waste taxpayer money, worsen traffic in the long run, and make our city less safe and less sustainable. Let's focus on evidence-based solutions and invest in infrastructure that actually works.\nReferences:\nArancibia, D., et al. (2019).

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes that the tax payers of Toronto have already paid for and are using is not only a highest degree of disrespect to them, but also to the rest of Ontarians; it goes well against of the government\u2019s mandate to be fiscally responsible.\nAs for Toronto, this move might hurt the businesses that are along these bike lanes. For instance, Bloor-Annex BIA has stated that those businesses have seen an increase of customers to their destinations \u2014 removing the bike lanes might deter the customers from visiting as they would not have a safe alternative anymore, and as a result these businesses might lose valuable revenue.\nMoreover, removing these protective bike lanes will put both drivers and cyclists at risk, with injuries ranging from minor (which can lead to loss of work time) to serious to even fatal (which will psychologically impact the loved ones of the victim(s) as well as the communities). The government should encourage cities to make streets safer, not more dangerous. The government needs to remember that there are people use these bikes for work or to get to/ from work (e.g.: people living close to their offices, delivery couriers) as well as other means to support themselves (e.g.: going to appointments, grocery shopping, etc.).\nIn regards to the rest of the province, the government should spend more time and money investing and upgrading public transport to reduce convention. It is very upsetting to hear that the government decides to pursue petty projects and neglect the rest of the province\u2019s needs. The money the government is promising to use to remove these bike lanes could be used for other critical causes like healthcare, education and housing. Additionally, there are several transit projects that have been taking too long to be completed. For example, the Hazel McCallion LRT has been in development for about 4 years now; while this transit project is a great idea, the construction has negatively impacted the commuters by creating congestion during the rush hours. The province also has an option to speed up the construction on Gardiner with would greatly benefit a lot of people in the GTA.\nAsking municipalities to require Ministry approval to install certain bike lanes would simply add more red tape and stall the city\u2019s progress. Citizens need to be given means to use alternative ways of transportation to reduce car dependency. Having less cars on the street will improve safety and benefit the environment.\nThe province needs to look to Europe and Asia on how it can take their learnings to improve biking infrastructure (like Amsterdam) and transit (like Tokyo).\n"

        "comment": "As representatives for Safe Streets Halton, Oakvillegreen Conservation Association, BurlingtonGreen Environmental Association, Climate Action Halton Hills, and Halton Environmental Network, we are writing to express our concern for the recently tabled Bill 212. The changes in this bill will restrict municipalities\u2019 response to growth-related infrastructure needs, put residents at risk, limit sustainable transportation options and harm the environment.\nAll commuters have a right to get to their destination safely, regardless of how they get around. Removing cyclist protections would result in more traffic deaths, injuries, and unsafe road conditions. Without safe infrastructure, the government effectively punishes pedestrians and cyclists, and risks their lives and well-being whenever they travel to work, school, or activities.\nMoreover, removing or putting restrictions on bike lanes would not solve the traffic congestion problem that municipalities in Halton Region face. A mixed-transportation model is the best way to ensure smooth traffic flow among a growing population. According to research, cars take up to 14 times the public space of a moving bike. Taking this option away from municipalities would mean silencing the voices of residents who live in those communities and ignoring their unique needs. For example, not everyone can afford additional vehicles (and the associated maintenance and repair costs), such as those living on fixed or limited incomes. Municipalities would also be faced with additional road maintenance and an increased demand for parking, with those costs placed on residents through higher taxes.\nPrioritizing cars would have a detrimental effect on the environment and people\u2019s health. 44% of emissions in Halton Region are from motor vehicles, contributing to poor air quality and climate change. The government should encourage sustainable transportation wherever possible to benefit Ontarians\u2019 health and surroundings.\nThe changes proposed in Bill 212 will put people, communities and the environment at increased risk. We strongly urge the provincial government to rethink this legislation and focus on creating safer streets for all road users.\n"

        "comment": "Why We Should Remove Bike Lanes in Big Cities\n1.\tIncreased Traffic Jams\nBike lanes often take up valuable road space, reducing the number of lanes available for cars. This causes severe congestion on major roads, leading to longer commutes and frustration for motorists.\n\t2.\tInefficient Use of Main Arteries\nIn large cities, main roads are critical for moving large volumes of traffic. Reducing these roads to a single lane for cars to accommodate bike lanes is impractical and unsustainable, especially in areas with high population densities.\n\t3.\tLack of Equal Responsibility for Cyclists\nWhile cyclists share the road, many do not adhere to traffic laws, such as stopping at red lights or using proper signals. Unlike car drivers, they do not pay for road maintenance through vehicle insurance, creating an imbalance in responsibilities and rights.\n\t4.\tEconomic Harm to Small Businesses\nSmall businesses rely heavily on automobile traffic. Car drivers are more likely to stop, park, and shop, often traveling with family or friends. Cyclists, in contrast, cannot transport multiple people or large purchases, limiting their economic contribution. Gridlocks caused by bike lanes further deter car drivers from accessing stores or restaurants.\n\t5.\tAutomobile Drivers Fuel the Economy\nDrivers of cars contribute significantly to the local economy, from paying for parking and fuel to shopping and dining out. Bike lanes disrupt this economic flow, as they make it harder for cars to navigate streets, park, or access businesses.\nRemoving bike lanes would prioritize the efficient movement of traffic, support small businesses, and ensure fair use of public roads in urban areas.\n"

        "comment": "I am very strongly opposed to the legislation proposed in Bill 212.\nI am concerned that removing bike lanes would be an expensive step backwards, especially since many of these lanes were only completed recently. The removal of bike lanes in the city of Toronto is estimated to cost $48 million or more given that there would be unknown costs for designing and building alternate cycling routes, which would utterly waste the money spent to construct them in the first place.\nMoreover, the proposed initiative is not an effective way of solving the issue of congestion. Bike lanes prevent cyclists from taking up space on the road and can reduce the overall number of drivers on the road. Due to induced demand, increasing the number of lanes for cars is not a viable method for reducing traffic congestion. Furthermore, forcing cyclists back onto the road places them at a higher risk of being struck and injured or killed by a vehicle.\nAside from the proposed legislation against bike lanes, I am also strongly opposed to the legislation proposed to accelerate highway construction, particularly Highway 413 Act. The area proposed for the construction of highway 413 is critically important for our watershed and includes thousands of acres of prime farmland. Any construction undertaken in such a sensitive area should be subject to the regular environmental assessment process and not be rushed through it. In addition, I do not think highway 413 is an effective method of reducing highway congestion.\n"
