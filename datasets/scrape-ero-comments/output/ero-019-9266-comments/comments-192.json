We rely on the safety of bike lanes every day.\nThis bill does nothing but prioritize car users at a direct and dangerous cost of everyone else.

The extra cars on the road will create more air pollution. Our city is densely populated and we do not need to add air pollutants which can be prevented.\nIf cars are so concerned about congestion, maybe they should park at a subway station (Kipling or Warden has huge lots) and encourage them to take the TTC. :)\nToronto is a bike city. Look at how happy people are in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.\nDoug Ford should focus his concerns on the LTR and getting Metrolinx to finish their job.

It makes no mention of public transit and only serves our corrupt and incompetent premier in his complete failure to deliver working transit to Ontario's congested cities. Instead Mr. Ford wants to be mayor of a city that rejected him and to serve only the wealth of his few friends. This bill is proof, written out, that Ontario has not had such poor, incompetent, corrupt and self serving leadership since the days of the family compact. To do this to Ontarians, who duly elected their municipal leaders to deliver the municipal infrastructure that matters to them, is disgusting and akin to authoritarianism.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s counterproductive to expand highways, promote suburban sprawl, and keep critical transit projects like the LRT lines closed while blaming cyclists for traffic congestion. Cyclists are not the root cause of gridlock; rather, the focus on car-centric infrastructure that promotes long commutes and car dependency is creating these problems.\nAs a Realtor who drives across the GTA daily, I experience firsthand the challenges of commuting. No drive is as stressful as navigating suburban arterial roads and highways. Despite road expansions, gridlock persists, and I frequently observe more erratic and aggressive driving behaviors\u2014such as weaving between lanes, speeding to get ahead on green light changes, road rage, inconsistent speeds, and \u2018hogging\u2019 the left lane. Simply widening roads does not resolve congestion; it often worsens it.\nBloor Street has never been more vibrant than it is now, with dedicated bike lanes creating steady traffic flow and a much safer experience for pedestrians. Previously, the curb lanes on Bloor felt hazardous, as drivers would speed past only to swerve left between parked cars, making it nerve-wracking for anyone on foot. Bike lanes have added vibrancy to the street and effectively balanced the needs of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike.\nOntario\u2019s focus should be on sustainable, people-centered urban infrastructure. Rather than investing in projects that induce demand for more cars and congestion, I urge the government to prioritize \u2018complete streets\u2019 that support diverse, safe transportation options. Emphasizing cycling infrastructure alongside accessible transit would lead to healthier, more connected communities and alleviate the pressure of our current car-dependent road system.\nFinally, open the LRT lines on Eglinton and Finch, and the Kitchener Line GO/UP station in Mount Dennis. These transit options are essential for GTA residents who need alternatives to driving and support our shared goals for a livable, sustainable future.\n"

My children\u2019s school is on Yonge St and it is a hazard to get the children in and out of the car to the sidewalk with these speeding bikes.  The traffic is also a standstill while hardly anyone goes by in the rush hour southbound lanes.  It\u2019s also causing increased aggression where the lane merges to one at southbound Davisville with cars speeding up the right turn curb lane to cut back in to the line of traffic.  We used to go to an extracurricular class on Bloor street and I\u2019ve actively removed our programming there because traffic is a mess and it\u2019s Olympic bikes and e-bikes everywhere.

        "comment": "This is an absolute waste of time and taxpayer money, and should be a badge of shame on the current provincial government. The duties and responsibilities of municipalities are for the municipalities! This will only result in he reduction of the autonomy of municipalities and, additionally, is very clearly a thinly veiled power grab from the Ford government to undermine the city of Toronto while framing it as a \u201cprovincial concern\u201d to address city congestion. Toronto is not the province, but if Premier Ford is dead set on unfairly impacting the city, its mayor and its people, he should consider resigning from provincial office and running for the mayor of the city. Leave these issues up to the municipalities within the province, and stop wasting our time.\nAdditionally, the inclusion of the promise to build Highway 413 is laughable. This government has proven in the last 4 years that it has no interest of either fulfilling the needs of the province or making those needs met in a timely or affordable fashion. Highway 413 will not solve our problems, will not be cheap, will impact our watershed leading to more flooding, and will most likely never be completed. Yet another project to pay our personal connections to the Ford government while getting nothing finished.\nIt is clear from the wording included in this bill that the provincial government is choosing what facts and science to believe when it comes to traffic and environmental impact. Most studies show that traffic will swell to the size of the roads built, meaning that by the time the highway is completed it will already be gridlocked, and the same is true for municipal roads. It is the exact reason as to why there is a demand for bike lanes; they can move people faster through a city than driving can because of population density.\nTo reiterate, this bill is a waste of time. If the province wants to step in and do anything productive, they can do so instead by finishing what they\u2019ve started. Get Metrolinks to finish the Eglinton LRT. Work with the city of Toronto to finish repairs on the Gardiner. Stop undermining public institutions and sowing divide between municipalities and the province.\n"

Bike is by far the most efficient, environmentally sound method to get from one place to the other in Toronto.\nDoug Ford and his government should be focused on Metrolinx and the debacle that is the Eglinton Cross-Town. Keep building the Ontario line. Work with the city to accelerate construction on the Gardiner with a focus on removing lane reductions and delivering a proper exit to the East End at the end of the Gardiner.\nWhere's your data that shows bike lanes are the problem? \"One more lane\" for cars means one more lane of congestion until you work on transit, consider congestion charges, and co-ordinate construction in a sensible manner.\nStay in your lane, and stay out of our bike lanes. You're not Mayor of Toronto, Doug Ford, you lost that election.\n"

I'm very concerned that the existing bike lanes in my area are going to be taken away.\nI have had some incidents with drivers yelling at me to get off the road because they didn't like when I take the lane where there are no bike lanes. During one incident while I was waiting to turn left, a driver behind me was honking his horn and rolling very close to my back wheel. It was very scary. I was very shaken afterwards, and had to pause my trip.\nI don't like the proposed Bill 212. We need more bicycle lanes, not less, to keep people who bike to school and work etc., safe. There is data in Canada and from around the world that proves that bicycle lanes reduce gridlock, and alleviate congestion, along with robust, reliable public transit.\nPlease don't take away our bike lanes. They're a healthy way to move around, and for people like me who do not drive, they're a necessity to keep me safe.\nThank you. Sincerely\n"
