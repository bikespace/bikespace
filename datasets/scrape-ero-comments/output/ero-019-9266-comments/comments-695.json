        "comment": "What the future of our province needs is not expedited highways. We need carefully thought out strategies to reduce emissions, and safe, and sustainable alternatives to travel. Building more highways has not decreased traffic. Cars idling produces more pollution, which impacts everyone's health. We should be supporting bike lines, and commuting that cuts emissions, which both directly and indirectly improves the health of our communities. Directly through the many benefits of exercise on an individual's health, and indirectly by reducing emissions for the broader community. Focusing on cars and changing infrastructure to support them would be a step backwards at a time where we need to be making strides forward for our planet, and for our health. Improving individual and community health saves money in the long run.\n"

        "comment": "The Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states under 2.1 Planning for People and Homes that planning authorities should support the achievement of \"complete communities\" and to accommodate an appropriate range of mix of land uses and transportation options with \"multimodal\" access. Complete communities cannot be achieved without the existence of safe & connected bike lanes. The transportation landscape is already dominated by vehicular traffic with many options for those who drive and the removal of bike lanes is not the solution to gridlock.\nMunicipal traffic is a municipal issue. Each cities' needs are unique and should not require the provincials approval for the construction of bike lanes, even if a lane must be removed. This legislation will just prolong the construction of creating connected bike lanes and prohibit municipalities from developing complete communities. The government of Ontario should follow their own planning statement.\n"

I hope you will look even more closely and consider the cost of removing the bike lanes, the safety issues that explode without dedicated bike lanes on busy streets, as well as the overreach into municipal affairs that this bill will cause. There does need to be investment in transportation with efforts to deemphasize car travel which benefits us all. I am vehemently against this bill as a pedestrian, motorist, user of public transportation and cyclist. This bill abuses power and process and will cost us all. On top of this it is unlikely to achieve its aims.\n"

        "comment": "I use my bike to commute all around Toronto. It is the quickest mode of transportation for me. It is a fact that having safe and conveniently located biking infrastructure is an integral component of a well-planned city. Using bike lanes on side streets is NOT feasible when I am travelling from my neighborhood of Roncesvalles to the downtown core as it is a convoluted route and would significantly increase my travelling distance. In addition, it would still require me to divert onto main roads due to the lack of continuity of side streets. The removal of bike lanes would put my life and the lives of countless other cyclists at risk. I believe prioritizing what is assumed to decrease commute times over the safety and lives of cyclists is an abhorrent decision that is not at all worthy of consideration. The removal of bike lanes to decrease gridlock is NOT grounded in evidence and lacks logical consistency. We need to prioritize active forms of transportations and support the infrastructure to be able to actualize the goal of a complete, safe, and healthy city\n"

It does not appear that bike lanes increase congestion at all but rather they alleviate it. The citizens of Ontario deserve efficient, safe and varied transportation options for pleasure and to conduct or support businesses and our economy and limiting cost effective and efficient options in this age of rising costs is fiscally irresponsible and counter productive.\n"

        "comment": "I object to the prioritization of drivers vs the right of all Ontario citizens to practical means of transportation.  This Bill priorities a specific means of transportation, individuals driving their cars, that contributes to climate change and poor health, and favors the wealthy. It is not mathematically possible for everyone to be able to drive in high-density places like Toronto due to the sheer physical space that one car or takes up, never mind where to park them when they are not in use most of the time. Just look at New York City! This bill unfairly targets dense urban areas that must provide citizens with space-efficient transportation alternatives to cars: cycling, transit right of way, safe walking. Forcing everyone to drive a car will make traffic worse (thousands more cars on the road!), kill even more pedestrians and cyclists, isolate non-drivers, and waste money deteriorating urban quality of life. Ontarians deserve better. Signed, someone born and raised in North York near the 401.\n"

What happened to small government? I have been commuting to and from my office in the financial district for years. Would you prefer I hop into my car instead and make the traffic problems even worse? How about you do something about construction and street parking instead.

How many lives have to be lost before it becomes apparent to this government that bike lines are in necessary part of traffic infrastructure.\nPeople who drive cars are also people who ride bikes and are also pedestrians. Everyone has a right to a safe environment, whether they\u2019re walking on the sidewalk, riding their bike in a lane or travelling by car. Weight should be given to the lives of those who do not drive at any given moment, and municipalities should have the right to create and maintain bike lane according to the needs of their residents.\nThe arbitrary removal of bike lanes and laws that enforce such removal, go against our understanding of global warming, and our need to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Biking and walking are effective, economical and reasonable ways to get around town.\nOne shouldn\u2019t have to drive a car for one\u2019s life to matter to the Ontario government.\n"

If bike lanes are removed, the people who still need to bike will take up an entire lane - as allowed in the Highway Traffic Act - creating more traffic and even more dangerous biking conditions. If road space and extra lanes are so important, take out the on-street parking! In cities like Toronto, it is impossible to fit everyone in cars as the primary mode of transportation. Biking and public transit are the most efficient and economical way to move people across the city and we need our infrastructure to support that. Maybe this Bill could work well in small cities and towns, but it is ridiculous to apply it to the entire province without rigorous consultations with local municipal politicians and advocacy groups.\n"

        "comment": "I, as a resident of Ontario, opposes to the removals of the bike lanes because of the following reasons.\nFirst of all, bike lanes are incentivizing a form of active transportation.  People would not bike if it is considered too hazardous or unsafe.  And examples in Vancouver, BC, along with the likes of Finland, had shown that cycling is a viable mode of active transportation, if infrastructure for such is being provided.  It also carries the next point, that cycling is much more environmentally friendly than the automobile, which contributes to a decent amount of pollution and carbon emissions in the Province.  Whilst the provincial government is subsidizing battery plants for electronic vehicles, which actually has a higher negative environmental impact by the fact that the metals used for the batteries are being mined from thousands of kilometres away, and contribute to significant water and land pollution, the emissions for transporting the metal all the way to the battery plants.  And not only can bikes be manufactured within Ontario, the metals needed can also entirely be mined in Ontario, reducing unnecessary emissions from the transportation of materials.\nMy opposition to removing bike lanes is also based on the fact that adding car lanes in expense of bike lanes will lead to induced demand, where more people choose to drive because of a perceived increased road capacity, leading to congestion being worsened, along with increased, unnecessary pollution and carbon emissions.\n"
