        "comment": "This proposed Act is irresponsible and is an extreme example of an overreaching government meddling in municipal affairs when it is not needed. The fact that this Ontario government thinks they need to interfere with municipal cycling infrastructure shows just how uneducated and narrow-sighted they are when it comes to effective traffic management and congestion relief in large metropolitan areas. This Act should be illegal and the current government should be ashamed and embarrassed for even proposing it.\n-Extremely concerned citizen\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes have largely been a great addition to Toronto. They could be improved in some areas, but that should be the city\u2019s responsibility, not the province\u2019s. I bike my kids to school and I bike to work. I also drive when I need to, and I use transit. Cycling is the fastest way to get around the city, and it needs to be safe as well. It\u2019s been proven that bike lanes increase road safety and increase local economic activity - two stated goals for this government. Not to mention all the red tape it would cause, something we want to reduce. Bike lanes get more people on bikes, which reduces congestion and crowding on the TTC. Every morning I bike by dozens of cars with a single person inside, getting stuck at turns and getting in each others way. Talk about inefficiency. While dozens of bikes roll by - none of which are adding to gridlock. If we are serious about addressing congestion in the city we should be finding ways to give people more options to get around, not less. While world class cities are expanding options and their bike lane networks we are talking about going backwards, undoing some of the great work that has raised Toronto\u2019s stature in the world, and made it a place people want to be and invest in. A safe, effective cycling network is an important part of attracting talented people and attracting investment. The province should leave this to the city, with a mandate to keep working with data and designs to expand the network with a balanced approach for all users.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out the lanes already installed incurs a cost and those funds are better used for healthcare and education purposes. This is a municipal issue. Stick to your jurisdiction. If this government really wants to tackle congestion, apply pressure on Metrolinx for the Eglinton and Finch LRTs that are much delayed. Use the 407 for trucks, which will ease congestion on the 401. Think logically and in the best interest. Stop pandering to the base just for votes. It\u2019s insulting to intelligent citizens of this province.\n"

Why in the goddamn hell, do bureaucrats in Toronto, get to decide whether the residents of Bradford, or Waterloo, or Ottawa can spend their money to install bike lanes for their communities?\nThis is a GROSS overreach of power.\n2) Why does the text of this legislation not acknowledge that passenger rail, not highways, is the most efficient and effective mode of transportation that the government operates and builds?\n3) How does the justify the increase in cyclist deaths and injuries that it will cause? What are the estimates, and what are your justifications for going ahead with a policy that will make the roads fundamentally less safe on a statistical basis?\n4) Every single trip made by bicycle or electric bicycle is orders of magnitude more environmentally friendly, with lower carbon emissions and other  air pollutants which directly impact human health. How is the government justifying incentivizing a less efficient form of transportation?\n5) None of our current cycling networks come close to being as comprehensive as our road networks, and cycling is fundamentally more work than sitting in a motorized car. How are you evaluating the network effects of a complete cycling network vs one that only covers 1/10 the same as a car network?\nQuite frankly, this legislation is some of the dumbest and most flawed legislation I can possibly imagine.\nBuild some trains in this province (and open them), if you want to reduce congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad idea that does not make sense, will not achieve the goals it's designed to achieve, and is essentially a step backwards for the province. We should be encouraging residents of the province to use modes of transportation OTHER than cars; not making it harder for people to use those alternate modes of transportation. Biking infrastructure has improved so much in the city over the past few years. As a result, more people than ever are biking instead of driving, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road and reducing congestion and gridlock. It is absurd to blame bikes for the bad traffic. The problem is that we have too many cars on the road and too many people driving in the city without paying their fair share. Removing bike lanes is only going to make the problem worse. This is also completely outside the scope and mandate of provincial authority, and should be left up to the municipalities to decide for themselves. Finally, it is ludicrous and irresponsible to spend my tax dollars ripping out bike lines that have already been built; especially those on Eglington, that the province itself just installed.\n"

        "comment": "Implementing more bike lanes in Toronto is a crucial step toward reducing traffic congestion and making the city more efficient and livable. With the growing population and limited road space, encouraging cycling offers a practical solution to ease gridlock, particularly in high-traffic areas like King and Queen streets. Dedicated bike lanes not only promote safer, more accessible transportation options but also contribute to a cleaner environment by reducing car emissions. While the removal of vehicle lanes may seem challenging, it ultimately leads to smoother traffic flow, better air quality, and a healthier, more vibrant downtown for everyone.\n"

I don\u2019t live in a big town, I live in a suburb in the outer GTA and the bike lanes I have access to are so important to me. We already have tons and tons of roads and lanes for cars, highways, and parking spots, we really don\u2019t need more, we need to make it practical to actually use alternatives to cars. It\u2019s been proven that adding bike lanes actually reduce congestion since it gives people an alternative to driving and it\u2019s generally a really good use of space. Having the option of more ways to get somewhere is an improvement on our freedoms and liberties as Canadians. I really think limiting people to only driving is a reduction in freedom. The fact that bike lanes improve traffic is not an opinion, it\u2019s a fact - see the study I\u2019m linking below by the CBC done this week that shows bike lanes are good for traffic AND the local economy. Not to mention the happiness of residents. Please, please listen to Canadians and experts on this and do not take away the bike lanes that we rely on and that give us so much more freedom.\n"

I do not believe there is any proof that they increase gridlock, which is more likely caused by poor service in other forms if public transportation. They do improve safety of both cyclists and drivers ( who are much less likely to hit the cyclists any more).\nperhaps the provincial government could spend more time worrying about Metrolinks and why they can't get the Eglington LRT working than bike lanes, which honestly looks more like a distraction, pre elections, to avoid voters paying attention to failures on other areas.\nLeave bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Province of Ontario\u2019s decision to restrict and remove bike lanes in various municipalities. This decision is not only a step backward in terms of urban planning but also ignores clear evidence that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion and save lives.\nBike lanes are a proven method of alleviating congestion in cities by providing an alternative, safe means of transportation. In cities worldwide, the most effective solutions to reducing traffic and improving the flow of people have been found in building up public transit and expanding bike lanes\u2014not focusing on car-centric infrastructure. Ontario\u2019s municipalities, particularly those with dense urban populations, require solutions that prioritize efficient and sustainable transportation, not policies that regress to urban sprawl and car dependency.\nFurthermore, the province\u2019s decision to remove bike lanes represents an overreach into municipal matters. Thousands of Ontarians rely on these lanes daily for safe, affordable, and environmentally friendly transportation. Removing them is a waste of taxpayer dollars, especially when people have adapted to and benefit from these lanes. Such decisions undermine the autonomy of municipalities, which are best equipped to understand the needs of their local communities.\nThe removal of bike lanes is not only fiscally irresponsible but also places lives at risk by forcing more cyclists and pedestrians into dangerous situations on car-dominated roads. We need to invest in future-focused infrastructure that accommodates all modes of transportation, reduces our carbon footprint, and fosters healthier, more connected communities.\nOntario should be moving forward with progressive urban planning policies, not backward. I strongly urge you to reconsider this decision and focus on building a transportation network that prioritizes the needs of all road users.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, to be quite blunt, this bill is awful and will not achieve the goal of reducing gridlock like it claims to do.\nThose same folk who bike on bike lanes will just take the lane as a cyclist or a driver, maintaining gridlock issues or even exacerbating them. If you truly want to reduce gridlock, I suggest you keep bike lanes as people will have more options to get around than driving, actually reducing the number of cars on the road.\nThere is also the issue of safety. Bike lanes keep bikes away from cars and reduce and prevent potential collisions involving them. If you want a safer city, keep the bike lanes.\nI've also heard that the Ford government is willing to pay municipalities to remove some of these bike lanes. This is inefficient spending that could have gone to solutions that actually reduce gridlock such as investing in public transit.\nOverall, there is nothing progressive or conservative about this bill. It is regressive, irresponsible, and ineffective. This bill appears to be a selfish wish of Doug Ford in his attempt to control municipalities on what they can or cannot do to suit his vision of what Ontario should look like to him. I suggest the government DOES NOT pass this bill and in fact, never bring anything like this up ever again. Find better solutions to reduce gridlock instead of whatever this is.\n"

Removing bike lanes on major and/or minor streets will waste tax payer money and increase risks to cyclists. As a city of Toronto resident, I bicycle as my main mode of transport throughout the city for 10 months of the year. Taking away bike lanes will only make cycling less safe and necessitate taking up a full lane of traffic to ensure my safety on the road. Please focus on opening the Eglinton line and increasing public transit options in the city to reduce traffic congestion for everyone. It\u2019s better for people and the planet!\n"

Research consistently shows that the only effective way to reduce congestion is to decrease the number of vehicles. For instance, studies have demonstrated that bike lanes can significantly ease traffic congestion, reduce emissions, and enhance safety for all road users.\nQuestions on Costs and Efficiency\nWe would like to understand the financial implications of this new framework. Specifically:\nWhat will be the cost of implementing provincial oversight for new bike lanes?\nWhat are the projected expenses associated with removing existing bike lanes?\nIs this framework the most efficient use of taxpayer money, especially when considering the proven benefits of bike lanes in reducing congestion and promoting safer, more sustainable transportation options?\nConclusion\nI urge the provincial government to consider these points and to engage in a dialogue with municipalities and stakeholders to find a balanced approach that supports both local autonomy and the broader goal of reducing traffic congestion through sustainable transportation solutions.\nThank you for your attention to this matter\n"
