        "comment": "As an Ontario who's family is based in Richmond Hill, I made the choice to move to Downtown Toronto originally for school, and it was the best decision I have made because I get to live city life; walking and biking around town gives a freedom that driving does not match. I actually got into cycling because of the newly added bike lanes and how it made cycling so much safer for me and my friends. I've also driven in downtown toronto before regularly, and was always afraid of hitting cyclists because were sharing the lane. Bike lanes are an elegant solution that made driving downtown less stressful, and it makes bikers safer too.\nAlso ever since I picked up biking in town (mind you, I only committed to biking after the bikelane additions), I have been able to support businesses outside of core downtown like roncesvalles and east toronto, which would not have been feasible on foot alone, or inaccessible due to poor street car coverage. Bike infrastructure and biking helps toronto build a more resilient local business network!\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m astonished at how stupid this proposal is. Every single evidence-based study shows that when you increase transit and bicycle options, that traffic is reduced. It\u2019s not rocket science, cars take up way more space per person and require more space between vehicles than bikes or buses do. I myself only started biking to work when the Bloor street separated lanes were installed, removing a car from the road.\nNext- at a time when climate change is becoming increasingly real and obvious, to institute a policy that deters bicycling and encourages driving (while increasing traffic and therefore making pollution worse) is irresponsible and generationally-reckless.\nThird- do you not understand that cyclists will die because of this? Human beings with families will die because of this decision. The difference in momentum between a cyclist and a car/truck is huge, and the car drivers do not respect that at all.\nFourth! My god please fund the healthcare system or transit or schools or something useful instead of wasting money and time to undo successful bicycle lanes that were put in by municipalities\u2026 as ironic as the statement is, STAY IN YOUR LANE.\n"

Improving gridlock is an unsupprted claim that will move Ontario back on the climate change mitigation front\nCycling is a healthy and environmental alternative that should receive more support if we are to achieve reduce CO2 emissions, in order to mitigate the increasing weather and health consequenses of our over-reliance on fossil fuels.\nPlease abandone this unhealthy and damaging Bill.\n"

Respect the will of the electorate that live in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are backing up traffic all over, and are mostly unused for the majority of the day, and empty even more during inclement weather or the winter.\nRoads were initially designed to handle the expected traffic flows. With our ever-growing population, the removal of traffic lanes in place of bike lanes only seems to make problems worse everywhere they are implemented.\nI fully agree with this decision, and hope that the vocal minority of cyclists don't override the millions of motorists who have to deal with the gridlock traffic these bike lanes contribute to.\n"

Our government policies should encourage and make it easier for people to use public transportation and other forms of clean transportation more and incentivize people to rely on automobile use less. These policies do the opposite.  Canadians must do their part to alleviate this crisis, as must Ontarians. This will help to create a cleaner safer environment for future Ontarians to live in.\n"

You cannot rip out accessible infrastructure in Ontario and not replace it with something better.  As a disabled person that needs help walking and also have epilepsy I use a bike to go short trips (15km) or the day after I've had a seizure and not feeling well enough to drive.  Take away accessible lanes what other choice do I have but to drive when I feel drunk as a skunk after a seizure.\n"

        "comment": "The province should be making policies that maximize road space use for people, not for cars.\nThat means some streets, cars should dominate. But other streets, such as main shopping areas, pedestrians should dominate.\nBike lanes should be encouraged on all arterial roads in order to reduce congestion, since over 50% of street traffic are people traveling the distance of less than a 15m bike ride.\nBus-only lanes should also be encouraged on all arterial roads since buses move far more people than cars do.\nEncouraging bus and bike use will reduce global environmental impacts as both modes use far fewer resources than both gas and electric cars.\n"

Vulnerable road users Deserve and need safe lanes of travel to protect them against a 4000+ pound obstacle.\nThere are many citizens in this province who cannot or choose to not drive, especially in busy cities. it\u2019s incumbent upon the premier and his government to put the safety of his citizens at the forefront over his desire to move vehicles swiftly.\nThere are ample studies that demonstrate that additional lanes of travel do NOT improve the flow of traffic. Over and above the scientific research that supports this one simply needs to look at the 401 and other massive highways throughout the world that continue to be bogged down through induced travel\nIt\u2019s time that the premier puts the safety of the people he is supposed to be leading first\n"

I am a supporter of bike lanes, especially safe and separated lanes where possible but reducing lanes of vehicular traffic in growing municipalities is not the answer. Forward thinking and planning is needed and investment in all forms of transportation is needed. The cost of installing bike lanes while removing vehicular lanes is not cost effective either.\n"

They also decrease air pollution and improve fitness, thus have improved health outcomes, and lower healthcare costs, and make our cities quieter with a better quality of life for everyone. Please reconsider this legislation and instead introduce rational measures to INCREASE the number of bike lanes, properly fund mass transit, and get trucks off the 401 and into the 407.\n"
