        "comment": "Hello,\nI heavily disagree with my tax dollars being wasted on such a pointless project. If this province wants to be serious about \"moving people\", I would highly recommend focusing on projects such as the Eglinton and Finch West LRT lines that have been consistently delayed with no proper explanation. Taking out these lanes will do nothing to solve the congestion issue - rather, they will make it far worse as vehicles fill in the space and create even more traffic which does not move, as we see consistently on our highways (which do not have bike lanes, it should be noted) Focus on actual solutions, not wasteful culture wars.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian, I find it unconscionable that the provincial government is meddling and overriding municipal infrastructure decisions. This decision will not only make it harder for commuters to move around, but it will make our streets more dangerous for cyclists. In modern cities, carless modes of transportation should be encouraged to facilitate gridlock, not make it easier for cars. Maybe the provincial government should instead help expedite the renovation of the Gardiner Expressway instead of making unilateral decisions that will make the city a worse place to live.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled that I have to speak for the safety of our city and ask you to ensure that the Province reconsiders its position and keeps Toronto streets safe. Removing bike lanes will only make Toronto a more dangerous place to live and work.\nMy plea is supported by my experience of surviving after being hit by a car on my way to work. The resulting injuries put me on a slow and painful recovery for more than a year now. As a result of the collision, I had several broken bones and I had to undergo a surgery to stabilize and fuse my lumbar vertebrae. I spent more than a month in a Hospital and a Rehabilitation Centre, plus six months without being able to work, and I have been in therapy to regain my mobility since then. Still today, I am in pain when lifting things or trying to run. And I consider myself lucky of being alive and walking again. Mine has been a happy-ending \u2018statistic\u2019; fortunate to not be one of the fatal cycling collisions that have been worryingly increasing in Toronto this year.\nIt is very disheartening to hear that the Province is removing the bike lanes that have protected many of the road users that travel and work in Toronto, under the weak and debunked argument that they affect negatively our commute and are costly or unnecessary. I will ask instead how much money can our Province save and redirect by preventing accidents like mine. I really hope no one has to go through the pain and injuries I had to suffer, just because I was on my way to work... on a bicycle.\nAs Toronto keeps growing faster than its infrastructure, the equity co-benefits from investing in a Cycling Network that includes road safety projects like the bike lanes already in use, will be worth every single dollar invested on it. These co-benefits range from the prevention of more injuries and deaths on vulnerable road users, as well as environmental, social and economic gains. We are seeing this paying back in other cities like Paris, New York and Montreal. Why does Toronto seem to turn to the opposite direction?\nPlease, we need our bike lanes for everyone's safety and keep Toronto from more preventable road deaths and injuries. Removing the bike lanes will NOT improve traffic. Please, save other people from the pain of a broken back.\nThanks,\n"

        "comment": "The main reason for congestion in our ever growing city is a combination of boxes at the crossings being constantly blocked, and a complete lack of law enforcement to discourage drivers from doing it. Bike lanes are an invitation for drivers to choose a more environment friendly transport method which not only reduces pollution, but also reduces the number of cars which reduces traffic. Doug Ford being so aggressively destroying a great progress this city was able to achieve is an absurd attack to the people of Toronto, there is absolutely no factual, logical, or reasonable motive to do such a thing. I am horrified at how dishonest and untrustworthy that man has been to Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is such a terrible idea. They will just be replaced by parked cars in the right lane and left turning cars in the left lane making for a very stressful drive. A single lane for cars actually provides the space for left turn bays. A single lane also stops those pesky queue jumpers racing up the right lane when everyone else has changed lanes to get around the car illegally stopped to grab a quick something from the shop.\nIf you want to get traffic moving in the city step up parking enforcement during the peak periods and get ride of parallel parking on major roads. The bike lanes are not the problem.\n"

Less drivers on the road is better for everyone, and is the only way to reduce gridlock.\nBut to get cars off the road, there have to be alternatives that people know will get them where they are going and feel safe using. Bike lanes that are separated and dedicated are one of these tools.\nThe provincial government has so many problems that it could address, such as healthcare, housing, and jobs. Do not waste the time money and effort removing these bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "In Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), traffic congestion is influenced by multiple factors. Here\u2019s a look at the most prominent ones:\n1. Population Growth and Density: Toronto\u2019s rapid population growth means more people moving in and out of the city every day, placing high demand on an infrastructure that\u2019s often stretched thin. High population density in urban areas, combined with suburban sprawl, leads to massive volumes of people commuting to the core daily.\n2. Car Dependency in Suburbs: The suburban areas around Toronto are primarily designed for car travel, with sprawling residential neighbourhoods and fewer transit options. Limited public transit coverage in these areas means most residents rely on personal vehicles, increasing the volume of cars entering and exiting the city.\n3. Limited Road Infrastructure: Toronto\u2019s road network, particularly in the downtown core, is limited by geography and historical development patterns. With few highways directly entering the city centre, the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway are frequently congested. Surface streets, some designed before cars were even prevalent, struggle to accommodate high traffic volumes.\n4. High Levels of Commercial Activity: As the economic hub of Canada, Toronto attracts businesses, tourists, and freight trucks, all of which contribute to congestion. Delivery trucks and service vehicles add to the traffic load as they move through dense areas to fulfill demands within the city.\n5. Inadequate Public Transit Alternatives: While Toronto has a robust public transit system compared to other Canadian cities, it is still underdeveloped for a city of its size and growth rate. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and GO Transit both struggle with overcrowding and aging infrastructure. Additionally, many suburban areas have limited rapid transit options, making car travel more appealing.\n6. Construction and Road Maintenance: Constant development and road maintenance projects exacerbate congestion as lanes are closed and detours are implemented. Toronto\u2019s short warm season means that most construction happens in a limited timeframe, causing frequent bottlenecks.\n7. Single-Occupancy Vehicles (SOV): Many commuters drive alone rather than carpool or use transit. This is partly because of suburban designs that favour personal car travel, limited incentives for ride-sharing, and gaps in transit coverage, especially for those working unusual hours.\n8. Traffic Incidents and Lack of Alternative Routes: Accidents, breakdowns, and other incidents cause significant delays. The lack of alternative routes in some areas, especially on the Gardiner and DVP, means that any incident on these roads can lead to backups across the network.\n9. Cross-Border Traffic: Many people commute into Toronto from neighbouring regions, such as Durham, York, and Peel. This cross-boundary travel contributes significantly to the number of vehicles on the roads during peak hours.\nReducing congestion in Toronto and the GTA would likely require a combination of transit expansion, infrastructure improvements, and policies to reduce car dependency in the suburbs.\n"

        "comment": "My name is John and I live in Hamilton.  I drive and cycle approximately equal amounts for transportation purposes within the city.\nHamilton is full of streets where vehicle demand has plummeted since their peak usage decades ago amidst the decline in Ontario's domestic industrial sector, which has hit Hamilton disproportionately.  There are many streets with more room than locals here know what to do with, some of which have recently added bike lanes and still never see any vehicle congestion (Victoria Ave, for example).\nOther streets have removed a vehicle lane to add a bike lane that connects two situations like the one I described above. Bay Street South of Main has no congestion caused by the two-way bike path that removed a lane of traffic.  Bay Street North of Cannon has no congestion issues related the bike lanes there.  For the very short distance of Bay Street in between Main and Cannon, a lane of traffic was removed for the bike lanes on that stretch to ensure continuity of the Bay Street bike infrastructure across the city.  That stretch of Bay has always been congested, bike lanes or not.  The bike lanes on Bay Street connect the far south of the lower city to the waterfront, and connect the employment core of the city to residential areas north and south of it.\nThe bike lane in the middle of Bay Street in Hamilton between Main and Cannon would certainly fit this proposal's criteria for removal.  Removing it, however, would create a disconnection on a cross-city route, leaving City Hall employees no safe way to reach the non-congestion-causing bike lanes north of Cannon to bike home to the North End, and leaving cyclists who live in Durand neighbourhood no safe way to complete their bike ride from the Bay bike lanes south of Main to events at the Hamilton Arena, or further north to West Harbour Go Station, or to Bayfront Park.\nI share this not to simply advocate for preservation of one bike lane in Hamilton, but as an analogy for the function of bike lanes in cities across the province.  Removing bike lanes in stretches that cause increased traffic congestion render useless bike lanes in the many, many areas of cities like Hamilton that do not cause congestion for everyday taxpayers who want to bike from their homes in quiet neighbourhoods to work or recreation that might be slightly within an area of vehicle congestion.\nThe value of fully connecting cycling networks for the sake of ensuring safety for people who value mobility and transportation by a variety of methods makes the current proposal so clearly misguided that it leaves the public with reason to believe the theories floating around various internet and social media circles presently, that this whole Province-wide proposal is a direction from the Premier himself in response to a change in his neighbourhood that he's sad about.  I am not suggesting anything about how this proposal came to be, except that it is so obviously misguided that it invites conspiracy theories  quite naturally.  I look forward to seeing it revoked.\n"

        "comment": "The identification of specific bike lanes to be removed without the due processes set out in the legislation seems to contradict the statement that \"Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out...\". Further, a statement is made that the minister will consider enviromental values, but the removal of the  specified bikelanes will be specifically exempt from enviromental accessments. The over arching criteria - to \"to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"- would seem predeterminate.\nI would suggest the Minister of Red Tape look at this legislation. The municipalities have much more expertise and understanding of local traffic issues than the provincial authorities. They also are much closer to the needs of their populations, are atuned to local BIAs and local concerns, more so than the province.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not stop many cyclists from using their bikes for their commute as many do not own cars or prefer not to use public transit (due to its own long list of issues). Lack of bike lanes will not reduce gridlock as cyclists and drivers will be forced to use the same lane resulting in slower speeds especially rush hour and increasing potential accidents.\nIt also goes without saying that it will cost the province/city a lot of money - money that could be used instead on something which could make an immediate positive difference for Ontario residents e.g. hospital funding and education systems. If the bike lanes are removed and there is not an improvement on traffic congestion, taxpayers would deem it a complete waste of money on something that was unnecessary.\n"

        "comment": "The province is overstepping. Why should the provincial government be allowed to police municipal infrastructure? Doug Ford lost the Toronto mayoral election and just because he has to drive down Bloor to get home doesn't mean that he should have a say in Torontonian affairs as Premier.\nYou are proposing removing the bike lanes when there is no evidence that they are the cause of congestion in this city. In fact, bike lanes reduce traffic and gridlock by taking people out of cars. They help to reduce carbon emissions from vehicles. They allow people to travel under their own power rather than having to depend on expensive and sometimes unreliable cars. Not to mention how important physical activity is to maintaining health.\nThere is also the cost to think of. The bike lanes have only just been completed. And to spend time and money ripping them out now is a waste and gross misuse of taxpayer money. My money.\nI am an avid cyclist. I do not drive and I do not own a car. The TTC is a disaster and I started biking to work because of the Spadina streetcar shutdown. It turned my commute from 40 minutes to 13. Bike lanes are an important part of city life and should not be removed, they should be expanded. The true secret to improving traffic is to have a well funded transportation system which includes bike lanes. If you want to meddle in the city's affairs, why don't you fund the TTC? Imagine how many more people we could get off the streets if we had a robust transit system.\nI won't even touch on cyclist safety and deaths. May that weigh heavily on your souls.\nI love my city and I am disgusted by what you are trying to do to it.\nIf you remove the lanes, please know that I will continue riding my bike. And I will take the whole lane, since I am considered a vehicle under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act. I'm sure that help to improve traffic conditions in the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, introduced by the Ontario government, sets an unwelcome precedent in provincial overreach and is entangling efforts to make streets safer in a culture war. Safe streets are not a partisan issue, we all stand for safe streets. The Peterborough Bicycle Advisory Committee is opposed to this legislation for the reasons described below.\nMunicipalities Know Their Streets the Best, Not the Province\nBill 212 would require provincial approval for the construction of new bike infrastructure in local municipalities and hinder the ability to implement other road safety initiatives. The City of Peterborough has recently adopted a Cycling Master Plan to help guide this community towards a comprehensive system of safe and accessible routes for travelling by bicycle around the city and to help us reach the City\u2019s stated goal of 25% active transportation mode share as set out in its current Transportation Master Plan. This plan was developed with extensive community consultation and keen attention to best practices.\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario is concerned as well. Their position is that municipal expertise is best positioned to make decisions on bike lanes and local transportation planning, and these proposed changes are an overreach into municipal jurisdiction.  We don\u2019t want the province telling us what to do, costing our municipalities more by encumbering its work with bureaucracy.  Is it the province's place to step in and dictate to our community what may or may not be built on our streets? We don\u2019t think so.\nFlawed Rationale\nThe rationale for implementing this legislation is flawed. Research has shown time and again that increasing the use of active transportation reduces rather than increases congestion. More people on bikes means less cars on the road. Emergency service leaders in Toronto have stated that response times in that city have gone up less where the bike lanes are located than on other streets.\nImpeding Municipal Ability to Meet Transportation Safety Objectives\nThis legislation would make it significantly more time consuming, expensive and difficult for our community to implement new cycling infrastructure and other road safety measures, such as road diets. The road reconfiguration on George Street in front of the Holiday Inn is an example of a road diet. The street is safer for all road users and the traffic flow has been maintained.\nWe believe the proposed regulations could put a significant chill on progress being made in Peterborough and across the province towards improving the safety and travel times for all road users. If the Provincial government was serious about reducing congestion, they would be implementing HOV lanes on all busy highways. Too many single occupancy vehicles is the cause of congestion. You can\u2019t build enough road lanes to meet the travel needs of everyone in the GTA.\nLiveable Streets Bring More Tax Dollars to Municipalities\nAdoption of this legislation threatens to set Ontario years back in the efforts to create livable, healthy, economically and environmentally sustainable communities. It would take us in the exact opposite direction of where we should be heading as municipalities and as a province.  Time and again, cities see that investment and tax revenue increase when we convert our streets to ones that people enjoy visiting.\n"
