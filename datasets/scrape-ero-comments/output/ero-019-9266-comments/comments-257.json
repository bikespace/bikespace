        "comment": "I have been cycling in this city since I was a teenager, and thank you to bike lanes and the increasing bike infrastructure, I feel more confident in letting my son ride his bike to school and soccer.\nIn the back of my mind,, however, I constantly think of the six cyclists we've lost to traffic fatalities, and more over the years, some of whom were part of my extended circle.\nFor those of us who live in the urban core, bike riding is core to the urban experience. It's a faster way to get around the city. It's the healthy choice, the environmentally friendly choice, it helps me feel part of my city as I bike past new businesses and feel part of street life and economically it makes sense that, in a time of cost of living rises, my bike is always free.\nI know that our premier does not experience the city the way that my community does, nor does he understand what it means to consider how a fragile bike infrastructure means more people I know will b e injured or worse. But I do expect my government to care about its citizens, use evidence-based decision making and to imagine a more beautiful and bikeable city.\n"

        "comment": "YONGE STREET BIKE LANES\nThe gridlock caused by the removal of 2 lanes of traffic from the narrowest part of Yonge Street for bike lanes (that are even a hazard as they to are too narrow) has made life living and working  in the neighbourhood unbearable.  The bike lanes are rarely used especially in poor weather.  The biggest user of these lanes are E-bikes and food delivery\nThere are over 30 developments proposed or approved from Yonge to Heath street bringing with it large trucks.  There is a 2 year watermain project expected to start shortly at Rowanwood. There again there will be large construction trucks.\nBetween Bloor and Heath streets there are 18 dead end streets whose entrance and exits are only to and from Yonge Street.\nBusiness are suffering and the Rosedale BIA told the City this in writing and they lied to Council.  I was in the room.\nThe usage of the was fudged by averaging out winter usage and poor weather usage.\nMet and wrote with the City several times and all comments were met with deaf ears.  Any changes made by the city of Toronto only pushed traffic on to a few side streets (Roxborough, Farnham and Balmoral as well as through Rosedale.  This has brought large trucks and service trucks and commuters into the community neighbourhoods.\nPeople living in this area have difficulty getting service companies to their homes due to the gridlock.\nSeniors and disabled have difficulty getting across the street.\nI have 2 every good studies done I would like to share with the minister\nAlso there are a few hundred letters of objection to these lanes that were ignored.\nMOST importantly EMS union complained about the gridlock.\nEmergency vehicles are often stuck in traffic and 18 streets are only accessible by Yonge.  The stats provided by EMS and FIRE are an average no one has provided stats for the strip of Yonge Street with bike lanes during 6am - 8pm.   They won\u2019t provide that after being asked via the City.\nMike Merriman, the Unit Chair, Paramedic Services, CUPE Local 416 after viewing a viral video posted on X, formerly Twitter, by user @markrmcqueen, on Dec. 18 showing an ambulance delayed at the Toronto intersection of Yonge St. and Macpherson Ave., south of Summerhill TTC Station, due to cars and one big truck unable to get out of the way because of the bike lanes.\nMcQueen wrote: \u201cThanks to the Yonge St. bike lanes, this ambulance wasted 30 valuable seconds at a single intersection. There was no where for the cars to pull off to. There are dozens of intersections coming up. If it\u2019s your family member waiting for a defibrillator, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\nGET rid of the bike lanes.  ASAP\nYou are doing the right thing\n"

        "comment": "This bill will promote the usage of private motorized vehicles within urban and suburban communities. This is unreasonable, short-sighted and poor public policy. It fails to recognize that the space required by motorized vehicles on roads, and in private and commercial parking spaces, is needlessly wasteful and unsustainable within the limited space of communities. Motorized vehicles also produce air and noise pollution which are harmful to the health of residents. This, in turn, increases provincial health care costs and degrades the quality of lives.\nThe province should focus exclusively on promoting alternative transportation modalities such as public transit and bicycle riding, as well as pass legislation, such as congestion taxes, that reduce the use of motorized vehicles, particularly non-commercial ones. In order to reduce gridlock caused by cars and trucks operating within urban and suburban communities, to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries, as well as to promote the health of environment, Ontario must promote and encourage the implementation of dedicated, and physically separated, bike lanes.\nThe provincial government would do well to recognize that its legacy is the long-term impact of its governance upon its citizens.\n"

Anyone who supports this proposal from Doug Ford has obviously never had road violence touch their lives through the violent death or life altering severe injuries that occur when a car impacts a human body. All road users deserve safe passage at all times. Bicycle lanes protect cyclists and their family and friends, and do not cause gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I think this is dangerous. Most people who live in Toronto use bike lanes and it does speed up traffic with taking cars off the road. I often see bikes lanes packed downtown. If people complain like drives those are people who don\u2019t live downtown. If you really want to ease congestion take parking off major streets. I often walk down Dundas, Landsdowne, Queen and if the parking was removed you would have a whole other lane. That would speed up traffic way more than just taking out bike lanes.\n"

In fact, it denies a municipality's right to decide on transportation solutions that work best for its situations. Having the provincial government strip the rights and decision-making autonomy of munipalities and its people further undermines our democratic system. Instead, it dictates and restricts our freedoms so we are told we can't try to make our streets safer, more liveable and denies us choices that we want and need.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a citizen of southwestern Ontario, a region largely forgotten about by provincial governments time and time again. We only get thought of when it comes to manufacturing or transportation, never peoples daily lives. I've recently been studying mechanical engineering with an automotive focus in Windsor and one of the things this city is doing extremely well is their cycling infrastructure. As someone who owns 3 cars, it's nice to have protected space to be able to bike when I choose to. I've had multiple instances of uneducated drivers attempting to run me off the road while cycling in areas that don't have bike lanes, because they genuinely believe bicycles aren't supposed to be on the road despite the highway traffic act outlining it. While I understand some drivers complaints about cyclists not following the laws of the road, such as stopping at stop signs, and think police need to be more active in enforcing those laws with cyclists, bike lanes have never negatively affected my driving and have almost always affected it positively. City planning is a city affair. Local governments exist specifically to deal with local issues like these, where blanket policy across the province or country doesn't work. The provincial government lays out the rules in the highway traffic act, and it's up to cities to decide what works best for them. Having the provincial government review every single bike lane installed in the future as well as the past 5 years is not only a waste of time and money, it's an overreach of the provincial government into municipal affairs. Under the Municipal Act of 2001, public transit, public health, and parks and recreation are all responsibilities of municipal governments, not the province. The claim that removing bike lanes will \"reduce gridlock\" has not only been disproven, the months of construction will only serve to increase congestion only to have the exact same amount of traffic after that construction is complete.\nAs a short summary, this is a complete overreach from the provincial government into municipal affairs that will not have the claimed effect and will only waste even more taxpayer money.\n"

        "comment": "In September 2011 I broke a leg for the second time while cycling on a Toronto street, this time on the corner of Clifton Road and St. Clair East, while avoiding a broken neck on the back of a moving van parked far too close to the intersection.  Lower leg smashed in four places, kneecap halfway around my leg.  Knee damaged, life changing, taken away by ambulance before a cop appeared.  The truck was moved right away, nothing to see here.\nI sympathize with Toronto drivers, used to be one before glaucoma damaged my sight.   This and further issues require use of an ebike now and absurd speed restrictions mean open travel with cars can be hazardous.  I love biking, a lifetime of it has shown me two things for sure; bicycles are a legitimate, practical way to get around and sometimes we require protection from drivers.  Mocking my bike use as Doug Ford did the other day points to nothing, not the future.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a stark example of playing politics over doing what actually improves the lives of our citizens. Cheap shots for getting votes from the vocal nay-sayers against bike lanes when the outcome will undoubtedly worsen road safety for ALL users (including anti-cycling motorists) based on the myriad evidence from around the world on the benefits of active transportation infrastructure is an act of sheer cowardice and incompetence.\nIf our official cannot even take the time to scratch the surface on the available data for the proposals they make, we are in serious trouble. If you want less congestion, more parking spaces available, more efficient movement of people, nicer communities to spend time in and better income for local business: bike lanes do all that! Just because there are loud people opposing what they view as an imposition on their rights, does not make them correct or worth pandering to.\nLook at the evidence. Look at the cities, countries and communities people LIKE to spend time in. What are the themes of their priorities and actions? On the flip side, look at places that have done what you are suggesting we do. How has highway widening worked, as logical as it SEEMS? Does making more space for cars reduce congestion? Or is getting people out of cars the only way to reduce traffic?\nAsk the questions! Look for answers! Don't just make rash decisions based on what you think makes sense. Especially when people WILL be harmed and very likely killed if this action comes to pass.\n"

Telling Municipalities what they can/cannot do on their own Municipal roads is overstepping.\nI feel like your opening statements (Proposal Details) discuss building priority highways, but then your details \"What we are Proposing\" has nothing to do with Provincial Highways.\nFocus on your provincially owned highways.\nIf you want to lessen gridlock, then support municipalities financially with funding of public transport initiatives that will move larger numbers of people, rather than having every individual have to drive a car. A single bus, LRT car, or subway will move so many more people than clogging up of roads and highways because people have to drive. Plus, it's much better for our envrionment to have people take public transport over driving vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "The changes proposed by Bill 212 belie a fundamental misunderstanding of the transportation and housing challenges currently faced by Ontario municipalities. Ostensibly proposed to reduce gridlock in Ontario cities, Bill 212 succeeds only in undermining municipal decision-making and creating unwarranted red tape which will delay, inhibit, and financially burden direly needed infrastructure projects.\nThe frequent gridlock in the Greater Toronto Area relates to several contributory factors unrelated to bike lanes:\n1.\tInadequate public transportation infrastructure due to years of underfunding and underinvestment\n2.\tDecades of inefficient land use resulting in exorbitant housing costs and longer commute times\n3.\tThroughput at road network chokepoints, primarily intersections, which are unable to accommodate upstream traffic volume\nMunicipalities have a vested interest in creating safe and functional transportation networks that meet the needs of all users, not just automobiles. Cities already take careful consideration of traffic and parking impacts when considering the implementation of bicycle lanes, and numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of said infrastructure. These decisions are made by qualified planners and transportation engineers, who understand the specific needs of the community and are far better equipped to make decisions on these matters than the Province.\nIf the Province is determined to help alleviate the traffic issue in the GTA, they should consider working directly with local municipal governments to find solutions that work rather than enacting broad, heavy-handed policies which will affect all Ontario municipalities. Furthermore, promoting work from home policies, investing in local and regional mass transit infrastructure, and enact broader zoning reform to allow for more urban infill will all better address the problem than fixating on bicycle infrastructure. I implore the Province to reconsider the regressive policies laid out in Bill 212 and \u2018stay in their lane\u2019, so to speak.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to raise my concern regarding Bill 212. Particularly Schedule 3 which will enact the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Which states \"Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nI am concerned that the removal of environmental assessments could lead to shortsighted and potentially illegal work which could damage the ecology surrounding the construction. Impact assessments for endangered and protected species (animals, and plants) needs to be conducted. The impact on soil quality is also concerning since adequate farmland in Ontario has been shrinking. Such a large project which impacts many different areas should not be exempt from environmental assessments.\nI am also concerned how removing environmental assessments might impact the infrastructure (e.g., water quality) of the communities surrounding construction of Highway 413. The lack of adequate environmental assessments/testing for Highway 9 directly caused the Walkerton Crisis leading to 9 deaths and 2000+ cases of E. Coli (causing lifelong health ramifications the government is liable for). The Highway 413 Act has the similar potential to cause a lack of oversight that will make the Ontario government directly culpable due to inadequate enforcement of the environmental standards set by the Environmental Protection Act. This department along with the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks would also be liable.\nI ask this department along with the Ontario government to consider how this clear violation of environmental protections directly opposes the steps that were taken following the Walkerton Crisis. For the safety of our citizens environmental assessments cannot be made optional, particularly for large projects like Highway 413.\n"
