        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, which proposes removing essential bike lanes in Toronto and requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes that impact vehicle lanes. This proposal disregards the environmental and health benefits of cycling infrastructure, increases reliance on cars, and undermines Toronto\u2019s efforts to promote sustainable and safe transportation.\nRemoving established bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University will worsen congestion and emissions, and limiting municipal control over these decisions is counterproductive. Instead of rolling back bike lanes, Ontario should be expanding them to meet growing urban transit needs. I urge the Ministry to prioritize sustainability and support bike-friendly infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes from ANY city will cause citizens to die - forcing them onto busy roads instead.\nMaybe the Conservative party should get off their butts and try cycling to work for a year. They might actually enjoy their commute instead of complaining about being part of car traffic.\nOh and perhaps if they discover that the route from Etobicoke suburbs to Queens Park is terrible, perhaps you should petition for a connecting route to your municipal government. You know, the level of government responsible for most intra city transportation.\nAlso this legislation completely disregards any research about personal motor vehicle traffic. Induced Demand - LOOK IT UP.\nThis Bill should be shut down. And Mr. Ford should stay out of municipal politics.\n"

        "comment": "As a 17-year-old kid in the city, it's crucial that you keep bike lanes available for me to travel through. Without bike lanes, there is a higher likelihood of accidents to occur (there is a 50% reduction in injury occurrences according to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program). It would be a great catastrophe for the public good if there was a sudden 50% rise in cyclist injuries, especially since many teenagers and kids like me utilize these crucial bike arteries for transportation.\nAnd in addition to the of safety of children (which I believe the Ford government believes in), adding extra lanes won't solve traffic. You have induced demand so there will still be gridlock, and instead, the cyclists who can't get to places safely with then turn to cars and the TTC which would crowd our already overcrowded infrastructure.\nThese bike lanes also release strain on our infrastructure because they divert massive demographics of commuters from the TTC and our roads onto bike lanes. Without these bike lanes, you would be forcing more strain on our infrastructure which would require even greater investment to solve.\nWe've already invested into the bike lanes as a city, and the city is facing fiscal problems, thus removing what we've already invested would just mean money waste. And for what? We would then require more infrastructure investment to solve the problem of overcapacity, and there would be the same traffic due to induced demand. So in the end, you're spending more money on solving our traffic problems which entirely goes against government efficiency.\nThese bike lanes incentivize people to cycle as a method of commuting, which not only releives traffic, but also promotes good mental and physical health. We as a nation face massive obesiety and mental health problems, alleviating some of the strain on our health by cycling would be a common good and a net benefit for society. The positive externalities from bikes echo out to our wider economy and healthcare system, where healthier people are more productive and innovative, and require less support from the health care system.\nIn stark contrast, the negative externalities from removing bike lanes from these major arteries would mean the opposite, you would have an unhealthy populous and a more strained healthcare system. That is completely counterintuitive to the progression of our society.\nMr. Ford, this proposal does not make any economic or logical sense. If passed, the only reason would be political. It's counterintuitive to the public good, poses many negative externatilies, and would lead to worse outcomes for us as a province.\nI hope you reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "To my mind, Bill 212 is an example of provincial government overreach on municipal issues.\nThis bill proposes to use constitutional laws which allow for the provincial government to override municipal law for an issue which is fundamentally not a provincial issue. I would much rather this provincial government spend their valuable resources attacking our single use zoning policies which are actively making housing difficult to come by. I am a university student in my twenties, and I have ABSOLUTELY ZERO hope of owning a home in the future. The majority of my peers and I are ready to leave this province, and country, if this issue does not get taken seriously in the very near future. Provincial bills such as this one should be directed to providing more housing options NOT reducing micro mobility options.\nI commute using Line 1 Yonge-University-Spadina every day to get to school, sometimes even on weekends as my major is very demanding. Unfortunately, due to the commonly occurring delays I experience on this system, I find myself using Toronto Bike Share to complete my commutes in order to save my limited time. Every single time I use Bikeshare, I try to find dedicated bike lanes to ride on, as I do not feel comfortable riding in mixed traffic. The Bloor and Yonge street bike lanes, which this bill is proposing to remove, are my most used routes by far. Removing these lanes will actively make my commutes much more dangerous, and time consuming. Micro-mobility is an essential tool for myself and many others to move throughout Toronto\u2019s downtown. It is extremely disturbing to me that the provincial government is actively trying to implement more red tape and bureaucracy to this mobility option.\nMobility in the downtown core is extremely poor due to the lack of high quality transportation infrastructure. The TTC streetcar system, though extensive in downtown, is painfully slow as it needlessly operates in mixed traffic. Providing dedicated transit-only corridors, rather than spending money on removing permanent bike infrastructure would be a much better way of spending my tax dollars. I find that by far, the fastest and easiest way of getting around the downtown core is by bike. Once again, I use the Toronto Bike Share system to complete any trips I would like to make while downtown, whether it be seeing friends, getting food, going to a theater, buying groceries, etc. The provincial data on bike modal share in Toronto is flawed, as it does not count essential trips like those. The data specifically counts commuting trips. A large portion of the bike traffic I encounter throughout the day is NOT commuting traffic. The provincial government MUST consider these other needs in their plan. The issue of poor micro-mobility options, in the most densely populated area of the largest city, in one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, is embarrassing, and proved to me that the current governing body is not serious about urban issues.\nBill 212 proves to me that the current provincial government does not value road users, if they are not in a car. Though I believe this is unjustifiable, it is understandable in suburban areas of the province, where driving is the only viable option for getting around. However, forcing more cars onto congested downtown streets, where the modal share for cars is severely outnumbered by all other road users, holds no water. Rather than pouring money into a mobility method which is proven not to work in heavily urbanized areas, I would much rather like to see this money actually improving the safety and accessibility of the current bike network. The reason why biking seems to be so unpopular as opposed to driving in this city, is purely due to the fact that there are a very limited number of safe corridors to bike in. The extent of the bike network compared to the vehicular road network is incredibly uneven. I find it extremely hard to believe that biking would be a small portion of Toronto\u2019s modal share, if there was a complete, dense, and safe network throughout the city. Before that happens, it does not make sense to use the modal share comparison to justify removing essential portions of the infant bike network.\nI live in North York, in the inner Toronto suburbs. I often use my car to get to places in this area. It also often happens that I must drive downtown to university, in order to transport items for my studies, or due to a university event, or other reasons where driving is more convenient than taking transit. I understand the need for car use in this city, however I do not understand the prioritization of car users over ALL other road users. When I drive, in North York and downtown, I do not enjoy being mixed with cyclists. I find the situation extremely unsafe, and I am sure the cyclist finds it similarly uncomfortable. I would MUCH RATHER micro-mobility users have their own dedicated lane, so that I do not need to actively worry about their safety while sharing the right of way with them. Micro-mobility users deserve a safe method of using their city streets, in the same way that car users do.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 seems to completely miss the point of providing a safe alternative to driving in urban centers. Time, energy, attention and money is being spent on giving the provincial government the power to control decisions which fundamentally belong to the municipality. I would much rather this provincial government spend these resources on provincial issues such as healthcare, and MOST IMPORTANTLY housing. This type of energy should be spent on legalizing 4-plexes throughout the province, and pushing zoning laws to provide more housing options, in order to finally fight the crippling housing crisis we are experiencing. If this government wishes to improve the provincial economy, they will do everything in their power to improve the livability of the province for younger people, who currently do not have any hope of owning their own homes. If the government continues to misallocate resources to city-scale issues, rather than provincial issues, I will be ready to leave the province, and country. A functional economy MUST value the needs of the younger generation, as said generation will support the future and well being of the economy.\n"

        "comment": "If dipshit wastes more time and more taxpayer money tearing up perfectly fine bike lanes because he feels like being spiteful I'm going to have to make this a personal issue. I am NOT putting up with even more construction because the premier feels like being an asshole after the city chose not to elect him. It's not his place to interfere in how municipalities operate. The solution to inner city congestion is NEVER going to be more cars. We do NOT need more cars downtown. Improve funding to public transit so we can get more cars OFF the roads if congestion is an issue. I better not see people tearing up roads that are perfectly good condition just to remove bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This asinine bill should be renamed the reducing choice and endangering my family bill. The bike lanes it will remove are ones my family members and I use regularly precisely because they are the fastest and most inexpensive way to get around. Removing them will have the exact opposite impact of the stated goals the the bill. Further, it is a prime example of yet another case of provincial overreach motivated by petty grudges and base populism, adding red tape to what should be an evidence-based municipal decision that responds to the needs of people who actually live and work in these neighborhoods. Perhaps the Premier should worry about the fact that millions of Ontarians have no primary healthcare provider, something that's actually provincial responsibility, rather than acting out his revenge fantasies over losing a decade-old mayoral race by treating my neighborhood like a game of Cities Skylines. Grow up.\n"

        "comment": "It is my belief that the provincial government shouldn't be adding bureaucratic red tape and interfering with city development. If Premiere Ford is so interested in Toronto's infrastructure he's free to run for mayor (and lose) again. I use the Bloor, University, and Younge bike lanes as an essential part of my daily commute. These bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks, roads, and public transit and should be respected as such. Furthermore bike lanes support public transit by providing additional transportation to and from stations, something that this city badly needs. This is not only a matter of convenience but one of life and death, why is it that I so rarely hear mention of the many cyclists who've been killed by cars, many of whose deaths were catalysts for the creation of these bike lanes in the first place? Does Premiere Ford consider these Ontarians live to be less valuable because they weren't in cars?\n"

It is a complete lack of foresight to remove bike lanes.\nOne of the reasons stated is that accidents that involve bikes and cars are a detriment to traffic issues. As if the solution is to remove the lane. Look at other cities that thrive off bike infrastructure. This a complete slap in the face to efficient city infrastructure to propose a removal of bike lanes. For example why not make it safer for bikers as opposed to just removing a lane.\nI understand the need to want to alleviate traffic. This is not the way. Toronto simply was not & is not made to handle this level of congestion. Removing the bike lanes will do little if anything to solve this issue.\nWhat is the solution?

        "comment": "I am absolutely opposed to this bill. The title has little to do with the content and disguises the fact that it's intention is to both undermine municipal autonomy when making local transportation-related infrastructure decisions and advance environmentally regressive policy.\nWhy would a government with any knowledge or conscience legislate the removal of sustainable transit infrastructure? Removing bike lanes will not ease traffic congestion. Having fewer cars on the road will ease congestion. This will only happen by providing reliable, accessible and sustainable transportation alternatives. Investing in bigger roads and destroying alternatives will only put more cars on the road and increase traffic and gridlock.\nMany people want viable transportation alternatives and would happily take a bus, bike or other option for their daily commute - but this will only happen if the sitting government doesn't implement an absurdly regressive Act. The alternatives have to be viable for people to use them. You can't chip away at bike infrastructure and then be surprised when there are more cars on the road - increasing traffic.\nBigger roads and thus more cars on the road are not the solution to \"gridlock\" - not for us today and certainly not for our kids and future generations. Amend this ridiculous Act and propose something that will actually benefit Ontario's population. Do not be remembered as the government that acted in the face of all evidence, common sense and the needs of its people just to give yourselves more power to meddle in municipal affairs and build bigger highways.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is, to be totally frank, insane. It makes very little fiscal sense, is the opposite of what we need to do to fight climate change, and will have no real impact on traffic over any reasonable timeframe. It also goes against some of the core principles that the government argued in support of when giving municipalities \u201cstrong mayor\u201d powers, and is surprising anti-democratic.\nThis isn\u2019t like the housing crisis, where not enough of something is being built and so the province wants to step in to make changes. It\u2019s the exact opposite \u2014 things are actually being built, with input from citizens via city council, and people are actually using the bike lanes. There are also existing city expansion plans. While overall usage is low relative to cars, the increase year-on-year is generally impressive no matter how you slice it and suggests bike lanes are doing what we want them to do \u2014 getting people onto bikes to get to their destination \u2014 and will be winners in the coming decades.\nMany businesses have also commented that they have seen increased or unchanged foot traffic since these bike lanes have been constructed. Adding cars to a busy street with no additional street parking is not going to drive additional business traffic unless you have giant empty parking lots sitting empty, just waiting to be filled.\nAs such, I do not understand how this legislation makes any sense. We want to support mobility of people of all types, whether that be walking, cycling, driving, buses, subways, etc. Bikes are an integral part of that mix.\n"
