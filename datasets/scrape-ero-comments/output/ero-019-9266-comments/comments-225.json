        "comment": "The bike lanes are horrific. They have taken an already terrible traffic situation and dramatically worsened it. The city contains very few bikers (~1% of traffic), the vast majority of whom are delivery and not commuting.\nEvery major city on the planet uses an intelligent system of timed lights and one way streets to INCREASE the flow of traffic. Toronto has an obvious war against cars, which was in evidence BEFORE the bike lanes.United one way streets. Lights time to make traffic not flow. Reduced speed limits in areas which do not merit it. Speed bumps in inappropriate places. In other words an attempt to solve problems that do not exist and the creation of one of the worlds worst traffic situations. Bike lanes make this significantly worse. They are dangerous. Oversized. And in abjectly silly places taking up vitally needed lane space. Not to mention the city is in winter 6 months a year and these lanes are hard to maintain and will go unused. The raised platforms which simply remove driving capacity are asinine. And ridiculously dangerous. Remove all of this idiocy immediately. Or maybe refund all of my property taxes as I can\u2019t drive anywhere, there are no policing efforts to protect my property and loved ones and no efforts to make things better for the people who make the money to fuel this insanity. Remove them. Now.\n"

        "comment": "I DO NOT SUPPORT BILL 212.\nBike lanes offer numerous benefits to both cyclists and the wider community. They provide a safe and dedicated space for cyclists to travel, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. Additionally, they encourage more people to cycle, which can lead to improved health and reduced traffic congestion. Bike lanes also promote sustainability by reducing carbon emissions and promoting a more eco-friendly mode of transportation.\nOver the past few years, safe and protected bike lane networks have become increasingly popular in cities around the world. Many cities have recognized the benefits of them and have implemented them as part of their transportation infrastructure. In some cases, entire networks of bike lanes have been created, connecting different parts of the city and making it easier for cyclists to get around such as in many cities in Europe including Amsterdam and Paris. The growth of bike networks is a positive sign for the future of transportation and what the Government of Ontario is proposing runs contrary to the wisdom accumulated by the rest of the world.\nBike lanes are safe. Bike lanes increase business activity. Bike lanes reduce congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The Government of Ontario is wrong - on so many counts.  It is NOT bikes or bike lanes that cause gridlock --there are SO MANY investigations, research papers, surveys, and studies from North America and around the world that show that good biking infrastructure - including replacing traffic lanes with bike lanes - actually improve/reduce gridlock.  PLEASE do some research and do not make gridlock worse!\nThe 401 is the wideset highway in North America and it is constantly stopped.  Adding more highways has never reduced gridlock - so why add more lanes or highways instead of focusing on solutions that have been proven to work over and over -> give people alternatives with reliable/frequent public transit as well as active transportation infrastructure.\nI highly recommend that if the Ford government wants to improve things -- review information from Strong Towns.\n"

        "comment": "Submission: The Importance of Bike Lanes and the Misguided Legislation Against Them\nBike lanes are vital to creating sustainable, healthy, and safe communities. They not only support green transportation options but also contribute to reducing congestion, lowering emissions, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Unfortunately, recent legislation targeting bike lanes\u2014particularly those that utilize lanes previously designated for vehicular traffic\u2014undermines these benefits and reflects a failure to consider the broader impacts on public welfare, the environment, and urban planning.\n1. Safety for All Road Users\nBike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the risk of collisions with cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Studies consistently show that cities with protected bike lanes see a decrease in accidents and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians alike. Removing bike lanes forces cyclists into mixed traffic, increasing the likelihood of accidents, particularly in busy, high-speed zones. Safety should be a paramount consideration, and eliminating bike lanes ignores the well-documented safety improvements they provide for all road users.\n2. Environmental Impact\nBike lanes are a key component in promoting environmentally friendly modes of transportation. By facilitating cycling as an alternative to driving, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and make meaningful progress toward environmental goals. Removing bike lanes and prioritizing vehicle lanes exacerbates traffic congestion and increases emissions, setting back climate goals and creating a dirtier, more polluted urban environment.\n3. Public Health and Community Well-being\nCycling is an accessible, affordable form of exercise with clear health benefits. Cities with robust cycling infrastructure encourage physical activity, which reduces rates of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other lifestyle-related health issues. In turn, this reduces strain on public health systems and enhances overall community well-being. Cutting bike lanes diminishes these health benefits, effectively discouraging active lifestyles and contradicting public health objectives.\n4. Economic and Accessibility Benefits\nCycling is an affordable transportation option for residents across income levels. For many, especially those who cannot afford a car, bike lanes offer a safe and practical alternative. Moreover, local businesses benefit from bike lanes, as studies show that cyclists are more likely to shop locally and more frequently. Removing bike lanes ignores these economic and accessibility benefits and fails to recognize the diverse needs of all community members.\n5. Global and Local Precedents for Success\nCities around the world are embracing cycling infrastructure as a smart urban solution. Cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam have demonstrated that prioritizing bike lanes creates more livable cities, reducing congestion and enhancing quality of life. Domestically, Canadian cities like Montreal have invested heavily in bike infrastructure with significant success. The legislation to remove bike lanes not only disregards the success of these models but also risks positioning our communities as regressive in comparison to progressive, cyclist-friendly cities worldwide.\nConclusion: A Step in the Wrong Direction\nThe decision to remove bike lanes is a short-sighted one that overlooks the far-reaching benefits they provide. Rather than eliminating bike lanes, the government should be focused on expanding them, creating protected, integrated systems that allow for safe and efficient movement of cyclists and vehicles alike. A commitment to sustainable, inclusive urban planning requires understanding the true value of bike lanes. This misguided legislation must be reconsidered in light of the evidence showing that bike lanes are indispensable for modern, sustainable cities.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be focusing on getting \u201cdrivers\u201d around. It should be focusing on getting people around.  The implementation of bike lanes not only creates a safe means of travel for cyclists, but alleviates sidewalks from cyclists.\nInternational data supports the notion that multi-use roads and bike lanes can effectively reduce traffic congestion. In London, for example, the creation of extensive bike infrastructure, including \"Cycle Superhighways,\" has not only increased cycling but also reduced car travel times in congested areas. Specifically, traffic flow has improved on main roads, as bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the roads and encourage alternative transportation methods. Similarly, New York City observed a decrease in car travel times on major streets after adding bike lanes, despite initial concerns that these lanes would add to congestion\u200b.\nStudies from cities worldwide show a clear pattern: bike lanes not only support safer, more efficient transit but also increase traffic safety and improve access for pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. The implementation of bike infrastructure in Paris and Bogot\u00e1, for example, has significantly lowered accident rates while simultaneously enhancing mobility options for a growing urban population. These cities demonstrate that balanced road planning with dedicated bike lanes leads to smoother traffic flows, showing that bike lanes and multi-use roads create a sustainable, efficient urban environment without increasing road congestion\u200b.\nThe autonomy of the provincial government to remove a bike lane should not be where the provincial government is focusing their efforts.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is an absolute overreach of provincial government on what is clearly part of municipal jurisdiction.\nMore than that though, this proposal aims to make our roads even less safe by enacting further restrictions on municipalities. Since my city has installed bike lanes we have seen a reduction of accidents and an increase of safety. This means that the city is a safer place for my daughter where I can take her to daycare and school without being hit by a car. Where she can now play outside and bike downtown safely.\nThree weeks ago a relative of mine was in a fatal bike accident because the lack of safe bike infrastructure in his city. This proposal aims to make that a grim reality for even more people. I am appalled that a government which claims to stand for family values would push forward an initiative to make Ontario less safe for our children.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a waste of public funds. Removing bike lanes will be costly and based on data, will either have no impact on travel times or at best might save drivers a couple minutes only at peak travel times.\nAdding bike lanes actually has a proven track record of making our streets safer, our environmental impact smaller and our population more healthy. In many cases, good bike infrastructure also actually reduces congestion because less people drive.\nI am sure the Ontario government has experts telling you all of this. Listen to them instead of a handful of loud drivers who are misinformed about why their drives are slow.\nAnd focus on the whole province instead of just the City of Toronto. While you\u2019re distracted with pet projects there, the people who actually voted for you are dealing with crumbling schools and hospitals. Build roads in the north where they are needed if you\u2019re so intent on it!\n"

Specifically, bike mobility is a small part of getting us out of the mess we're in.\nI take issue with your consistent favouring of certain modes of transportation over others. I ride my bike all the time and that makes me great deal. I pay my full share of tax and I use a small fraction of what I pay for through those taxes. This could also include my lack of a need for significant medical interdiction.\nYou also must know full well that picking on bike lanes as a solution for congestion won't work and is just nutty. I believe this is simply a distraction and a nod to people who hate cyclist because they so often see them getting to where they need to go quickly and without clogging up the roads. I truth, they should be encouraging cycling because that would free up road space.\nI didn't vote Conservative and your behaviour will not encourage me to change my vote. I would like to point out that I am simply interested in sound financial decisions that improve the quality of life in our cities. This proposal will do neither.\n"

        "comment": "All it takes is a quick Google search to see why creating additional barriers to bike infrastructure might be a terrible idea. As a cyclist, motorist, but most importantly a citizen who wishes for the continued growth and properity of our neighbourhoods, communities, and cities, I think this aspect of the bill should be scrapped.\nHere are a few thoughts as to why:\n-Roads should be a municipal issue, not a provincial one. It would be a huge overreach for the Government of Ontario to dictate how each city grows in this respect. It feels as if this aspect of the Bill is clearly and unfairly targeting the City of Toronto.\n-Bike infrastructure is essential to building a thriving city. Looking to other great cities in Europe and USA, the data shows that having bike lanes can have benefits for health, for the economy, and so many more aspects of life.\n-In the long term, bike infrastructure can help reduce congestion. If you can convince a person that commuting on a bike is safe and sustainable, that could mean one less car on the road. Isn't the point of this Bill to reduce Gridlock and not add to it?\n-Bikes are more sustainable. Climate change is no joke. While we are fortunate in Ontario to be shielded from some of the major impacts thus far, we are not immune to climate change as evidenced by the increase in local wildfires. We have a duty to be global citizens in promoting a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle.\n-Deaths/injuries from bicycle vs motorized vehicles are rising. As a hospital-based physician, it breaks my heart to see the people that end up in the ICU or the ward with life threatening/altering injuries from bicycle vs motorized vehicle collisions. These are fully PREVENTABLE with safer cycling infrastructure and it would be in the best interest of the Government to enhance this aspect of Public Health.\nUltimately, I think the Ford Government needs to take a hard look into what it wants for the future of the province. I feel that it may a bit shortsighted to think that additional roads (and less bike lines) will solve the multifaceted issues that have led to commute congestion in the first place. Besides, the collateral damage this Bill may have on Public Health and the health of our communities is too high.\nIt takes guts to look ahead beyond the upcoming election cycle and make decisions that might be controversial to some. It takes guts to sow the seeds of change and cultivate a better future that only the next generation may enjoy. It takes guts to be open-minded, to put aside prejudices, and to truly listen to opinions that might not align with your own.\nI hope the Ford Government has the guts to reconsider its war on cyclists and to scrap this aspect of Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Hello:\nWith bike lanes, it is great for the Province to take a leadership role.\nOn a particle level, decisions on bike lanes should be made at a Riding-by-Riding level after a full public consultation has taken place.  After the consultation, a transit study must be undertaken before any work starts on installing bike lanes.\nThe lesson learned from Toronto regarding bike lanes is:\n(1)  their use is weather dependent (i.e. - not used in the Winter / rainy days)\n(2)  they increase gridlock\n(3)  bike lanes are mainly used by courier services\n(4)  they pose a hazard to road maintenance\n(5)  they require expensive and specialized services for cleaning (i.e. - how do you clear snow or leaves or garbage)\n(6)  these lanes remove space for public parking\n(7)  they pose a hazard for pedestrians and people with assistive devices.\n(8) bike lanes only impact an extremely small segment of society at the expense of the majority)\nIn a time when there are limited public funds available, are bike lanes the best use of public infrastructure funds?\n"
