        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal that will only make gridlock and traffic worse, and greatly endanger the lives of cyclists, motorists and pedestrians. There are plenty of studies that show that bike lanes improve traffic in urban cities, as they provide safe, healthy and environmentally friendly transit alternatives. To enact this proposal would be ignoring the facts. It would also be ignoring the citizens of Ontario and Toronto, who simply do not want this.\n"

        "comment": "I submit this comment as a resident of Toronto who lives along Bloor St West and gets around by walking, cycling, public transit, and driving. I'm incredibly disappointed to see this bill even be proposed. This is a serious overreach from the province and an absolute regression in city planning. It will go down in history as one of the most embarassing pieces of legislation from this government.\nIn urban areas, giving people choices to get around safely and efficiently using the mode best suited to them and their trip is paramount. It's unbelievable that the Minister of Transportation doesn't understand or recognize this. This isn't an opinion, it is a fact, proven over decades across cities around the world. There is no city on earth that has solved traffic congestion by making more space for cars and encouraging more people to drive. The government is choosing to ignore all available data and research to advance their personal agenda.\nSafety and environmental benefits aside, bike lanes (and more importantly \"complete streets\" like Bloor St and Yonge St in Toronto) make the city a better place to live. These are STREETS. They are places for people, not for cars. They are places to live, work, eat, shop, play, and rest. I cannot tell you how much better it is to do all of these things along the street today as compared to a few years back before the complete street redesign. Toronto is building the kinds of places that North Americans traditionally long to travel to in old cities across the world. Quaint neighbourhoods with real street life that aren't just places \"to drive through\". Nothing is stopping us from having that here too, except this government.\nAdding more legislative red tape for municipalities is not \"common sense\". Making it more dangerous and difficult for people to get around safely by walking or cycling is not \"common sense\". Adding more cars to a road to decrease congestion is not \"common sense\". If you are sitting in traffic, you are the traffic; there is no way around that. The government should focus on its failure to deliver on any major transit projects (which would ACTUALLY help address congestion) instead of trying to put more cars on the road. Premier Ford, you are not the mayor of Toronto and we've shown that we don't want you to be, so stop pretending that you are.\n"

        "comment": "If the government wants to reduce gridlock, why would they be effectively introducing more construction to the streets of Toronto by ripping up already built bike lanes?  If the government really cared about reducing gridlock, perhaps they should be trying to encourage fewer people to commute by car from the suburbs into Toronto by investing in more public transit to get cars off the streets. This proposal is short-sighted and draconian. I commute by bike everyday and the bike lane on Bloor Street keeps me safe as I make my way from my home in Etobicoke to downtown.\n"

        "comment": "Comments, in order from within the proposal:\n\"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving you Time Act\"\nBizarrely framed.  Bike lanes do not contribute to or cause gridlock.  They are much smaller per person than cars, their lanes take up less space, they have never been gridlocked themselves or caused gridlock in car lanes.  They do not block car lanes when a bike breaks down, unlike cars.  In fact, when there are bike lanes, it makes it simpler for drivers and cyclists alike to know where the cyclists are expected to be, which will reduce driver confusion and potential accidents, which in turn reduces congestion that leads to gridlock.  Overall, this bill does nothing to reduce gridlock or save anyone time.\n\"provides for the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic.\".  It was already proven that these roads with an \"extra\" lane experienced gridlock regularly, so spending money to return these roads to their previous state is already known to not solve the problem being stated, but will cost the provincial taxpayers a lot of money for this non-solution.\n\"The legislation would also, if passed, provide the province with the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes (where the removal of a lane of traffic took place).\"\nThis is counter to the provincial government political position of less red tape and less bureaucracy, it is in fact imposing an entirely additional level of bureaucracy by requiring the province to be sole arbiter of how municipalities govern and make decisions regarding bike transportation infrastructure, using as-yet undefined metrics and criteria for evaluation (which, also, will cost money to create).  Plus, imposing this act retroactively on existing bike lanes is exactly wasteful.\nIt is not fiscally responsible for the Ontario government to take on the cost of undoing existing municipal infrastructure, or double the municipal cost for returning roads to the condition prior to the bike lanes being implemented.\n\"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\"\nThe government should be trying to get EVERYONE where they need to go faster, including but not limited to drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists.  This is the root problem with this act, is that it is the assumption that DRIVERS are the only consideration.  They are not even in the majority, especially if there is effective mass transit, carpooling, and pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure in place.\nAlso, the goal shouldn't be \"faster\" without also being at least as safe.  The safety of all should also factor in.  Realistically, safer should be a higher priority than faster.\nIf existing bike lanes are to be removed in order for more lanes of traffic (decreasing bike infrastructure and cycling safety), the exact same reasoning should be applied to sidewalks, which are pedestrian lanes.  To be consistent, the provincial government should also be pushing for all sidewalks to be removed to give more lanes for traffic, so \"drivers get where they need to go faster.\" at the expense of pedestrian infrastructure and safety, if that is the only factor that matters as this proposal presents.\n\"The proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads...Based on the outcome of the review, a regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane\" immediately followed by \"proposed to require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto\".\nThis is internally inconsistent.  The act is presuming the sections of Bloor, Yonge, and University already do not meet the requirements that would be set for other existing bike lanes, before that criterion has even been developed, while simultaneously ignoring the fact that these bikes lanes are to be the root of the infrastructure for the entire geographic area, so the potential positive impact of their existence cannot be measured yet.\nIn conclusion:  These bike lanes are essential infrastructure, both to provide diverse transportation options as well as improved safety for all (drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike).  This act fails to address any of the root concerns, and in fact can only increase taxpayer burden in a failed attempt to decrease single occupant commute times at the expense of the safety and accessibility of non-car commuters.\n"

        "comment": "Really unsure why we have identified 3 lanes to remove without any research on analysis done to explain why those 3. The fact we have a premier who is being petty and picking random spots of Toronto to change shows how ridiculous this all is. Time and effort spent on both the delayed LRTs (no dates can be given for the opening) or the endless roadworks would be better spent.\nBy removing bike lanes we push people back into the roads alongside drivers who have shown a poor history of sharing the road equally. It's shocking that me, someone with literally no background in urban planning, seems to know more about traffic calming than our transportation minister.\nThe stats thrown around usage of the bike plans really avoids the obvious... Eglington bike lanes are not complete, the usage of bike lanes with no infrastructure around them are poorer than those with support... it's obviously a tactic to be untruthful.\nCan we stop playing politics with peoples lives and covering up avoiding environmental surveys. I'm sad any of you have to work for this ridiculous government\n"

        "comment": "This is a massive overreach.  Your summary even agrees when it says \"The Government of Ontario Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows\" Keyword there is \"highways.\"  These are not highways and the Province has no conventional authority to dictate what happens on municipal streets/ROWs.  This is a municipal matter, a local matter that the Province should respect local decision making on.  The last mayoral election turned in part on this issue and one could argue that the voters supported bike lanes.\nI am not a big cyclist, I do not use the downtown bike lanes, I am more of a driver and/or transit user - however these bike lanes add to safety for cyclists AND FOR DRIVERS.  They did not reduce traffic volumes as they took up a lane of parking which frankly we need less of to encourage transit use.  Without bike lanes any cyclist basically takes up a lane anyways as drivers have to go around them.  The corridors you have announced removal on are all served by subways in all directions.\nThe model split the premier referred to of 70% drivers may be true for Toronto overall but not in these locations.  Publicly available traffic studies for development applications in the area put driver use at 17% and cyclists at 18% (see 320, 328, 332 Bloor St W application) - and transit users at 38%!!\nIf you want to manage car traffic effectively from a Provincial standpoint - implement a downtown congestion charge.  That will reduce car traffic at peak times if priced dynamically, increase transit use and raise some revenue that can be applied to building transit.\nPlease rescind this legislation.\n"

The whole point of municipal jurisdiction is to address and fix problems within their locality and without the need for larger regional bodies to interfere in their affairs. If a city or town finds that the addition of bike lanes or alternate travel infrastructure fits their needs then it is not the business of any other regional body or locality to hamper that decision. This is a crude, ham-fisted attempt to punish cities for attempting to escape the automobile addiction that has hamstrung civic development for decades.

        "comment": "Let me start by asking a question, have you guys ever heard of the phrase \u201cnone of your business?\u201d Usually it\u2019s used a way to get people to buzz off, so I shall employ it here, this is none of your business. This Bill shouldn\u2019t have even been considered let alone be at this stage. You lot are the PROVINCIAL government, not a municipal government. The Government of Ontario shouldn\u2019t be worried about bike lanes when you have bigger fish to fry, for example: A housing crisis, a dysfunctional provincial rail network, and pollution. That is all your jurisdiction, but when it comes to municipalities, especially those that you have never and will never step foot in, we have a different level of government overseeing them and their own unique needs. You don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be focusing on municipal politics when you\u2019re the provincial government.\nNow onto the main show: What are you lot on about? You say you wish to relief congestion and speed up travel times, but this is not how you do it. The only things things that will change from this getting passes will be a rise in bike and car accidents due to a lack of dedicated bike lanes, and increased transit issues for people who can\u2019t own a car, who don\u2019t want to own a car, or who aren\u2019t able to get a car, and if you say \u201cthey can take public transit\u201d well guess what? Not everyone can afford to take public transit. Even if it\u2019s only a few dollars, multiply that by 2, at minimum to get home and to where you need to go, and the multiply that by 365 days, and then multiply that by 3 years. That cost, especially for people who aren\u2019t employed or aren\u2019t able to be employed, is too much. Bikes lanes offer the commuter a way to get around without having to fear getting killed by impatient drivers. Not to mention they reduce the amount of accidents pedestrians have with cyclists. Bike lanes are essential to our transit network, whether you like it or not. They provide a safe way to get around for people who don\u2019t have cars and help to reduce congestion already, as for every cyclist that means one car off the road. If you truly believed in reducing congestion, you\u2019d push for more cyclist infrastructure, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re just making life harder on those who don\u2019t fit your bill of what an Ontario commuter should look like, and undoing so much progress for bike lanes. Here\u2019s something I want you and your party to consider, think about how actions like these will take away from the next generation. For example, the original Ottawa O-Train was set to run between one of it\u2019s outer most suburbs into the heart of downtown, but because some knob known as Larry O\u2019Brien decided it wasn\u2019t worth it, he\u2019s cost Riverside South and Barrhaven reliable and efficient public transit, and in addition he cost the taxpayer 177 million dollars for cancellation with the contractor. Think about what you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re miffed about bike lanes, that\u2019s unfortunate, but you cannot and should not be using your political power in this way. This is what we would call corruption by power. Are you corrupt?\n"
