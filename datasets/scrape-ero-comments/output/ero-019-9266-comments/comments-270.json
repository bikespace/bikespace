My car mostly sits in the driveway.\nMy neighbourhood could be better if car lanes were removed to make it safer and more convenient for pedestrians and bicycles.\nToronto should be for Torontonians first. Want to reduce the traffic? Reduce the need for cars!\n"

It has allowed me to rely less on a car or car services as well as feel safe and secure while using them.\nThis proposed change is also incredibly tragic as provenance should be embracing future looking infrastructure, especially climate friendly infrastructure.\nOverall this change has me considering if I should be live in Ontario anymore or look elsewhere in Canada to live.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes fight climate change. They reduce pollution; they are literally a net zero way to get around. Removing bike lanes will put cyclists who came out of their cars thanks to safe bike lanes, back into cars. This proposal will likely cause cyclists to get catastrophically injured and possibly die. It is not evidence based, and is the wrong move in the face of a climate emergency. I am stunned we are talking about removing bike lanes in the year 2024. This is absolutely wrong and should be stopped.\n"

More car lane, too many drivers will be speeding a lot that put other users at risks and some will drive careless and more road rage. The traffic signals timing should be look at like timing adjusting or Signal Synchronization.\n"

        "comment": "After years of driving to go from the east end to downtown, I have decided to take the bike for 30min everyday to get to work.\nThe main rational in why people use bike (or not) is because they can safely do so. Once the entire city is connected with safe bike lane, then it becomes a no brainer to do so.\nGiving the priority to polluting vehicle versus bike that make people healthier and don\u2019t pollute is a complete non sense.\nLook at any city in Europe such as Amsterdam and you will see that the reason people take their bike is because it is 100% safe. Yes Toronto bike lane might not be use enough but this is because they are not yet completely safe and complete. They are many studies that show the obvious: the more you build roosts, the more cars go on them and you always end up with congestion. Be reasonable Doug: go bike to go to work and you will leave a healthier and longer life !\n"

        "comment": "Requiring the City remove bike lanes is both an egregious over reach of provincial authority into municipal jurisdiction and is justified without fact. Bike lanes save lives and do not cause traffic congestion. If Doug really believes bike lanes cause traffic congestion then why won\u2019t he wait for the updated studies first before acting?. If I lose my life biking on a section of road that Dougie removes a bike lane from I\u2019m gonna be really annoyed.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to this proposal to remove bike lanes in Toronto to prioritize more motor vehicle lanes. This approach is a misguided and shortsighted plan that disregards sustainable, environmentally conscious transit solutions.\nThe decision to eliminate bike lanes on key streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University shows a complete lack of regard for the essential benefits that cycling infrastructure brings. Bike lanes reduce congestion, lower emissions, and contribute to a healthier, more livable urban environment. This proposal goes against any genuine commitment to environmental progress and undermines Toronto\u2019s future as a sustainable city.\nThe plan to bypass the Environmental Assessment Act while claiming to consider environmental implications is contradictory and unacceptable. This exemption risks unchecked increases in emissions and disregards the proven environmental and health benefits of cycling infrastructure. If environmental criteria are to be used, they must be applied transparently and fully account for the impact of removing bike lanes.\nThis proposal is a regressive move for Ontario, favoring a temporary traffic fix over the long-term well-being of the city. I object to this plan and urge a reconsideration that values sustainable transport, public health, and a balanced urban infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This policy will not do anything to help congestion in Ontario. If anything, it will make it worse - we have decades of evidence showing that more traffic lanes do nothing to alleviate congestion, as seen by our continually worsening traffic here in Toronto, despite adding more lanes to bike-lane free highways like the 401. The *only* realistic solution to traffic is to provide good alternatives, like more public transit and yes, bike lanes.\nThis policy will also get people hurt or killed. Good cycling infrastructure keeps people safe from dangerous traffic, and not just cyclists - pedestrians also benefit from having an extra buffer from traffic.\nWe need smart and forward-thinking policy to solve traffic issues in Greater Toronto, and simply repeating the mistakes of the past over and over will do nothing besides make innocent people get hurt. This bill needs to be rejected.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor street should not be removed. They are an intrinsic part of our neighborhoods and a way for families who live in and around the area to get around without adding more cars on the street.\nFurthermore, returning to the four lanes on bloor steeet will not increase traffic flow. Instead it\u2019ll increase the amount of slowdowns as people attempt to weave in and out of parked cars, and turning cars.\nAcceptable alternatives: We should first consider removing street parking at all hours of the day, or expanding the sidewalks to include a raised bike lane, before outright removing them. It\u2019s understandable that we want to keep the flow going and these are two options that guarantee it.\nA more expensive but much needed alternative: more cross town transit. Going from high park to union is an hour by transit. This should be a short 15m ride in a diagonal line below high park .\nUltimately, around High Park there are no viable alternatives for a bike lane route at this distance from the lake without adding an unreasonable (and thus never taken) detour to DuPont or Lakeshore. This forces people to take a massive detour so that cars in the area can save a minute or two in their day.\nAnd finally, the traffic around high park is sometimes busy but it is never gridlock. Cyclists safely move up and down the street, cars manage to move forward at a reasonable pace in a dense residential/commercial area, and everyone in the neighborhood is happy.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is in conflict with the autonomy of democratically elected municipal governments.\nThe authority to decide where to remove motor vehicle traffic lanes in favour of bike lanes should rest with the municipal government, alone. Municipalities are better informed about their own roadways to be making such decisions than the provincial government.\nAdditionally, no evidence has been provided that repurposing vehicle lanes into bike lanes does indeed increase traffic. Per person, vehicles take up far more space than bikes and other modes of transport do. If congestion and gridlock is the concern, then there should be more investment into public transit and other means of commuting like bike lanes.\nPlease, come to your senses and shut down the proposal for this problematic bill.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford is nothing but a sorry excuse for a premier. It\u2019s a shame that this grown man, who somehow found himself in the position of premier, for which he is unqualified, has been granted the ability to make real decisions affecting the lives of thousands of Ontarians who did not vote for him and who do not support him. Worse, it\u2019s quite pathetic that Ford continues carrying out a personal vendetta against the people of Toronto after losing so badly the mayoral election, and after the people of Toronto made it clear that they also hated him even as a councillor. I\u2019m truly baffled that someone in his position has the time to make such stupid decisions for affecting a municipality in which he does not even live, where he does not even walk the streets every day. How sad that this man continues terrorizing Toronto all because of his hurt feelings. What a total waste of taxpayer dollars, time and energy spent on BIKE LANES instead of education, healthcare and many other concerns within the province\u2019s jurisdiction that have been suffering under the Ford government. I do not support the removal of the bike lines on Bloor, Yonge and University, and furthermore, I do not support Doug Ford or the Conservative government. I think they have done nothing useful the entire time that they have been in government. I hope that one day, Ontarians will wake up and demand more from their government, and stop allowing the Conservative government to ruin a province that has so much potential, and a city that was once known as world-class but is now starved of the people who made it Toronto. Get out of Toronto, Doug Ford.\n"
