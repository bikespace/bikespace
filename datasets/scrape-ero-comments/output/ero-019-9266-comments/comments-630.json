Adding more road construction when the city is already overwhelmed with it makes zero sense. And the plan to cut corners and bypass construction regulations that lessen environmental impact? That\u2019s a decision based in greed and selfishness. Do better.\n"

Not only will it do nothing to address traffic congestion in the City of Toronto (https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7358319), this is manifestly an issue for the City of Toronto, not the Province, to decide on. The Province should focus on keeping its side of the proverbial street clean, by delivering long-delayed transit projects and addressing congestion on provincial highways. I work on Bay St. Although I usually take the TTC, when I do drive, the issue on, for example, Adelaide St. is not the bikes, it\u2019s the cars. There are too many single drivers who could and should be taking transit or car-pooling. If the Government of Ontario is actually serious about helping Toronto become a world class city, it should be following the example of its peers in supporting proven strategies like congestion charges, investment in reliable public transit and, yes, bike lanes.\n"

It's generally men who are cyclists, food delivery guys and idiot male e-scooter riders who currently ride on the sidewalks where there are no bike lanes.  If a person is hit by a cyclist, the injuries are likely to be significant. The costs of lost income and/or physiotherapy is likely to be in the thousands of dollars with little likelihood of the offending cyclists/riders being on the hook to pay the person injured for those costs.  In essence, they can be \"hit and run drivers\" who simply leave the scene of an accident involving a pedestrian with the pedestrian on the hook for the cost of regaining mobility. Bike lanes provide some measure of safety for pedestrians. Is the province willing to be liable for ANY injury resulting from the removal of an existing bike lane?\n"

End of story.\nRemoving bike lanes does not reduce gridlock, the amount of money spent to do so is a smack in the face to tax payers.\nI use bike lanes on Bloor, University and all over Toronto. When there isn't a bike lane I have been made to feel unsafe by car drivers not paying attention and being aggressive. Bike lanes keep me, my daughter, my friends, my coworkers safe. They keep drivers from accidently killing people. Public transit isn't always reliable, there's unhoused people on it, mentally unwell people, I've been scared to ride it alone after dark. Bike riding gives me freedom, exercise, a chance to explore my beautiful city.\nAll the research, all the numbers point to bike lanes improving EVERYTHING. More lanes doesn't mean less congestion it means less alternatives to cars leading to more cars which leads to MORE CONGESTION. You could turn all of these main artery roads into 6 lanes and it still wouldn't ease congestion. The construction to remove bike lanes would cause more congestion and traffic than bike lanes ever could.\nThe money being proposed to remove bike lanes is grossly over stated and that money could be allotted for SO many other much more needed projects instead of lining pockets and placating a few drivers who believe they're more important than others.\nPlease don't remove the bike lanes that exist.\n"

There are very limited options for lane installation North-South and Yonge is the best of the available options.  Mount Pleasant has become a commuting corridor and most commuters traveling by car prefer Mount Pleasant over Yonge.\nYonge should remain a main street and not a highway.  The bike lanes should remain installed.\nMore fundamentally, the province should stay in its own lane and worry about matters that are within its jurisdiction, such as getting the long-overdue LRT running.\n"

Bikes are not squished in with traffic with bike lanes, which actually improves traffic.\n3.

        "comment": "Critique of Ontario Government's Proposed Legislation on Bike Lane Removal\nI am strongly opposed to Ontario Bill 212. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in Toronto, along with the broader framework to potentially dismantle more existing bike lanes across the province, raises several critical concerns. There are proven benefits of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving environmental sustainability, and fostering economic growth. Removing existing bike lanes would not only undermine these advantages, but it would also represent a waste of taxpayer money and jeopardize public safety.\n1.\tBike Lanes Reduce Congestion\nBike lanes play a critical role in alleviating urban congestion, which is a persistent problem in cities like Toronto. Car-centric transportation systems encourage more cars on the road, leading to bottlenecks, longer commutes, and air pollution. By offering people a viable alternative to driving\u2014namely, cycling\u2014bike lanes can encourage more people to leave their cars at home. This shift not only alleviates congestion but also improves the overall flow of traffic.\nWhen more people cycle, the number of cars on the road decreases, which reduces traffic jams, lowers the demand for parking spaces, and makes travel more efficient for everyone. The addition of bike lanes is an essential tool for creating a balanced transportation ecosystem where different modes of transport can coexist and contribute to smoother, less stressful urban mobility. Removing bike lanes would only encourage more car use, exacerbating congestion and decreasing overall mobility efficiency for all road users, whether they are in cars, buses, or on foot.\nAdditionally, the removal of bike lanes would only result in cyclists taking up entire vehicle lanes rather than their designated bike lanes, which will only serve to create more frustration for drivers, danger to cyclists, and even more slow downs if accidents between motorists and cyclists were to occur.\n2.\tEnvironmental and Health Benefits\nBike lanes also contribute significantly to the city's environmental sustainability goals. Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transportation that helps reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, both of which are major contributors to climate change and poor air quality. Ontario, like many regions, is aiming to reduce its carbon footprint, and supporting cycling infrastructure is a cost-effective way to meet these environmental targets.\nAdditionally, the promotion of cycling over driving offers substantial health benefits. Increased bike use leads to higher levels of physical activity, which can improve public health outcomes, reducing healthcare costs related to sedentary lifestyles, heart disease, and obesity. In this context, removing bike lanes undermines efforts to create healthier, more livable urban environments, where cycling is a key component of a sustainable transportation system.\n3.\tCost-Effectiveness and Wasted Taxpayer Money\nThe removal of already existing bike lanes represents a significant waste of taxpayer money. Bike lanes are not built overnight; they require careful planning, public consultation, design, and construction, all of which incur costs. Once bike lanes are in place, their infrastructure, such as bike racks, lane markings, and safety features, represent a long-term investment. To undo this work by removing bike lanes and converting them back to car lanes would be an inefficient use of public funds\u2014taxpayer money that could be better spent on expanding and improving bike infrastructure, public transit, or other city services that enhance mobility for all residents.\nFurthermore, the proposed review process introduces a layer of bureaucracy that will require additional resources for evaluation and decision-making. The funds spent on this review could be far better used in advancing the goals of sustainable transportation, such as improving safety measures for cyclists, extending bike lane networks, or developing public transit systems that complement cycling as part of an integrated urban mobility plan. Ultimately, removing bike lanes is a shortsighted decision that negates previous investments and wastes money that could be directed toward building a more efficient and equitable transportation system.\n4.\tBike Lanes Support Small Businesses\nAn often-overlooked benefit of bike lanes is their positive impact on small businesses. Studies have shown that areas with bike lanes tend to experience more foot traffic and higher levels of consumer spending. When people cycle to shop, eat, or visit local businesses, they tend to spend more time in those areas, stopping at multiple locations along the way. This contrasts with car traffic, where drivers are more likely to pass by businesses without stopping, particularly in busy areas where parking is scarce.\nIn fact, studies in cities like New York and Portland have demonstrated that the installation of bike lanes can lead to increased retail sales, particularly for local businesses that rely on walk-in customers. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop in neighborhoods with bike infrastructure, which is good for the local economy. By removing bike lanes, the government risks undermining the vitality of these neighborhoods, potentially harming small businesses that benefit from the increased activity that bike lanes encourage.\nConclusion\nThe Ontario government\u2019s proposal to remove existing bike lanes is a regressive step that overlooks the numerous benefits of cycling infrastructure. Bike lanes reduce congestion, enhance public safety, improve environmental sustainability, support small businesses, and contribute to public health. Furthermore, the removal of already-established bike lanes is a poor use of taxpayer money that undermines previous investments in urban mobility. Rather than dismantling these valuable assets, the province should focus on expanding and improving bike infrastructure to create safer, healthier, and more efficient transportation systems that benefit all residents.\nBike lanes are not just for cyclists\u2014they are a critical part of building vibrant, sustainable cities for everyone. Other cities around the world like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and New York have demonstrated that people will choose to cycle IF there is a robust and safe network of bike lanes, and as a result have enjoyed the benefits of reduced traffic congestion, cleaner air, and healthier populations. Ontario should look to these success stories and expand, rather than remove, bike infrastructure to ensure that its cities are prepared for future challenges.\n"

They have been an huge benefit to myself and the thousands of new cyclists that use them. I have seen no data that suggests they have done anything but add a positive benefit to overall transport flow, and removing them seems ridiculous.\nThere is no \u201cwar on the car\u201d - everyone wants the same thing - good traffic flow. Traffic issues are caused by many factors which have nothing to do with the (heavily used) bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Your proposal stinks for two reasons:  1) it is an uncalled-for interference in local affairs and local democracy; and 2) it's basic premise is not based in fact or evidence.  The people of Toronto, which I remind you was amalgamated into one city by a previous Conservative government without consultation or regard for what Torontonians wanted, voted for local representatives who approved and implemented a bike network plan following all the proper, democratic processes.  Now, because those suburbanites who lost their own local councils because of your buddy Mike Harris, are complaining, the entire city must consider that local democratic process irrelevant (including the strong mayor powers you gave to Toronto when you thought a conservative mayor was going to be in power).  Just because some people don't like the outcome doesn't mean that local process doesn't count.  You are sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, regardless of whether people agree with the policy or not.  There is a process for the majority voters in the city to change their elected representation, but having a higher level of government constantly second-guessing every local decision undermines the whole idea of local democracy.  Your government has made such interference in Toronto's affairs a habit.  Do you also believe that the federal government has every right to second-guess every decision that you make?  I doubt it, but you sure are able to dish it out much better than you can take it.  Bunch of hypocrites.\nThe premise that bike lanes should never remove road capacity is flawed because you have presented no evidence that such is true.  The municipalities have made their own case for the bike networks that they are implementing, yet you have wiped all of that out at the stroke of a pen based on nothing.  You say you will set out criteria \"later,\" but why do we not deserve to see and comment on the rationality of that criteria before it is set in law, instead of after?  You talk about \"listening to the people,\" but you only listen to the ones you like and you screw the rest.  You practise the politics of convenience instead of developing policies that are fact and evidence-based.  You do this with all of your transportation policies, including the new transit lines you are building that could have delivered so much more than they will because you are building them wrong.  The idea that we could ever build enough road capacity in Toronto to accommodate infinite traffic growth is absurd, yet that's what you are telling the people you can do.  This is a pack of lies and there isn't one credible urban transportation expert that will agree with you.  Never let it be said that your government ever listens to the credible experts who actually know what they are talking about.  You only listen to the ones who have their own agendas, and you only tell the voters what you think they want to hear.  That's not good leadership, it never was, but as long as it gets you the votes, I'm sure you could care less about whether it's the right thing to do or not.  This bill is a load of crap, and should be scrapped.\n"

        "comment": "The forced removal of bike lanes will lead to more cyclist deaths and likely deter some cyclists from using their bike in the downtown core.\nThis is a BACKWARD step.  European cities have increased their bike lanes without reducing traffic flow.  Premier Ford has changed his opinion from his 2017 quote on the safety of bike lanes.  The Province of Quebec has invested heavily on constructing a bike network, the \"Route Verte\" across the province, which is not only used by Quebecers, but also by visitors to the province.  This adds to Quebec's tourism revenue.  Sadly, Toronto, is missing out on this potential.\nThere is no clear evidence that traffic flow is endangered or that driving times are severely affected by the construction of bike lanes.  Driving habits have adapted.\n"
