        "comment": "The challenge we face is not bike lanes. Instead it is too many cars on the road which is a result of the sprawl in the GTA. The only solution is to get some of those cars off of the road. The way to do this is by investing in more transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian infrastructure. There is no other way. Many cities around the world have already gone down this path so it is nothing new. We can just take their lessons learned.\n"

        "comment": "Cars are a very inefficient form of transportation, especially when each car has a single occupant. Cars themselves are the cause of gridlock, not bike lanes.\nIn order to improve the transportation efficiency of Ontario, we must provide viable alternatives to cars, like reliable and frequent public transit and a complete grid of bike lanes that allow more people to get to the places they need to go.\nBike lanes are important for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. It is crucial that cities continue to build bike lanes, given that so many cyclists and pedestrians have died in our cities as a result of a collision with a car.\nIt's also proven that bike lanes are good for businesses, because it's much easier for a cyclist to stop anywhere and shop. Businesses in the Annex, along Bloor St, have observed a boost in their sales.\nMunicipalities across Ontario recognize the importance of bike lanes and are responsibly building them. They already conduct the necessary traffic and business studies that justify them, and correct course when necessary. This bill introduces unnecessary bureaucracy that would just slow down municipalities from improving the safety of their streets and their transportation efficiency.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out existing bike lanes only adds MORE traffic.\nI would like to see more bike lanes for major arteries and heavy pedestrian areas.\nI think we should restrict on-street parking to improve traffic. Parking should be built underground or in parkade buildings, there is no reason for empty cars to sit on our roads. King St proves that this makes areas more lively and attractive for people to patronize businesses.\nTTC streetcars should also have their own dedicated lane to ensure traffic moves appropriately - then perhaps less people will want to sit in cars and traffic will be better for everyone\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely devastating the Ontario government thinks this bill will have genuine benefit to the province. Building hwy 413 is not the answer. Taking away PROTECTED bike lanes is not the answer. We need MORE protected bike lanes, with guard rails to protect pedestrians, cyclists, AND drivers. Cities should have the power to decide when and where bike lanes should be added, NOT the provincial government who's primary focus is the core Toronto area and fails to actually recognize the remaining province.\nInstead of adding unnecessary highways at the expense of needed farmland, expand public transit. Expand the rails for Go Transit, and increase the service to Waterloo region. That will alleviate more traffic off the 401 than additional highway lanes or adding another useless highway that has no tangible benefit for the average citizen in this province who rarely has to go into Toronto from the western, northern, or eastern regions.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is ill-considered and foolish. It's going in the opposite direction of where transportation funds should be going. What a waste of tax money and provincial oversight. Do you have any idea how many fraudsters are making off with people's hard-earned housing deposits? Focus on improving the home development industry and mass transportation to communities instead of this navel-gazing nonsense.\nCyclists do not cause gridlock: there would be no gridlock if there were no cars. If you improve urban planning, then the cyclists don't have to be anywhere near cars and there's no need for increased municipal appropriations. This province is just showing it has no genuine plan for infrastructure beyond the GTA.\nBike lanes save lives. They make it easier and cheaper to get around cities and towns and reduce traffic congestion. There are countless nonpartisan studies saying exactly these things (see link). People have become inured to comfort and think that the slightest inconvenience like a cyclist or pedestrian or road crossing justifies their road rage. \"Oh it's so uncomfortable to have a bike lane near my house!\" We don't need road wars. We need public education on how to act like a civilized society where people can respect the rules and follow them on the road, pedestrians and car drivers alike.\nOntario is huge. You can't be everywhere at once and to have this kind of oversight. It just means more government bloat; way more people will need to be hired for this petty administrative nonsense. Stop it. Let the municipalities run their own operations and leave the cyclists alone.\n"

        "comment": "I dare say, I do wish the provincial government would stay in their lane! (See what I did there)? You\u2019re suggesting using provincial public money to rip up infrastructure approved by democratically elected city councils, when I believe you should be working to fix what is already on your plate (healthcare, schools, lines 5 and 6) rather than adding anything additional (bike lanes).\nThe province has asked for data, so I have data. I will first say, it does not favour your ill-thought position that somehow taking away the bike lanes and adding additional cars (because many cyclists will decide to drive, instead; they didn\u2019t just pop up out of no where! Many drove consistently before the implementation of a safer alternative)!\nThe PC government loves to pay lip service to small, local business. Let me give you the statistics around who most often shops local, and how much they spend:\nDrivers on Bloor in Bloor West Village report visiting businesses along the road less than 1x per week, and 69% spend more than $100 per month. On the flip side, those who use alternative modes of transport (walk, bike, transit), visit these businesses at least 3x per week, and 86% spend $100 or more per month. After the bikeway was installed, total reported average customers increased by 40%, and average customer spending rose from $186 to $245. If I had a restaurant or storefront in the area, I wouldn\u2019t be very pleased about losing clientele should the bikeway be removed.\nLet\u2019s look at another part of the city, so we can\u2019t just claim Bloor West Village as an anomaly; Queen West in Parkdale.\nHalf of business owners along this stretch assume more than a quarter of their customers arrive by car. One in five stated half their customers arrive by car. Are you ready for the real percentage of customers that arrive by car? 3.9%. Yes, you read that right; less than 4 in 100 customers arrives by car. If we extrapolate the number of those 100 customers using other forms of transport, 19 arrive by bike, 22 would\u2019ve arrived by transit, and 53 by walking. Why are you wanting to prioritize the lowest number of customers over the greater number? A business could likely afford to lose 4% of customers; I doubt they\u2019d survive losing 19%.\nBike lanes mean business: 93% of customers walk, cycle or take transit to visit Bloor Annex BIA local businesses and only 7% arrive by car, says local BIA reps. And business has been growing since the lanes were installed in 2016.\nLet\u2019s look at our neighbours across the border for some further data.\nBefore bike lane installation in a major thoroughfare in NYC, car travel from 77th to 96th street took an average of 4.5 minutes. After installation, this same trip took the average car 3 minutes - a 35% time savings!\nThe stretch of Central Avenue in Minneapolis that saw a bike lane installation  saw a 52% increase in food sales; a 2x greater increase than a nearby control area.  Bike lanes also aid in employment, as the bikeway on Broadway in Seattle saw a 31% increase in food service employment, compared to the only 2% and 16% increases in control areas.\nCyclists make up approximately one third of all vehicles entering the Downtown Core in the morning along Adelaide (32%) and leaving the Downtown Core in the afternoon along Richmond (30%). Therefore, there is a higher total volume of vehicles within the single lane, than any single motor vehicle lane on the same stretch.\nI\u2019ve also seen plenty of claims about not being able to bike through the \u201c6 months\u201d of winter. First, I was raised in Calgary; if you think Toronto truly has 6 months of actual winter conditions, you might just be a giant baby. Second, if you cannot bike through the winter out of fear of your toesies getting cold, the average Norwegian 9 year old biking to school all through the year is tougher than you. I think that\u2019s honestly quite embarrassing.\nBut back to data; in 2024, Bike Share clocked 779k trips through January to March. And that\u2019s JUST bike share; the city nor province have installed bike counters into lanes, so we don\u2019t know the total number of bike trips which would include cyclists who have their own at home bike.\nFinally, Conservatives love to spout fiscal responsibility. Well, I have some further numbers for you. Dutch investment in cycle lanes (about \u20ac600M per year) saves an estimated \u20ac19B (yes, with a B) in healthcare costs per year. Car commutes also come with a net cost to society (tax payers) as a whole. For every one dollar the a cyclist puts towards their mode of transport, society pays an average of 8 CENTS. For every dollar a driver pays for their transport, society pays almost TEN dollars.\nHaving a cheaper means of transport is also more money into your constituents pockets. Car ownership costs vary, but usually are no less than $10,000 per year. A household that has two cars even being able to cut down to one is a massive savings for them, allowing them more money to put back into other economic outputs, as just the car would benefit only a handful of sectors (oil and gas, vehicle manufacturers, etc), while without that car, they can spread their savings out over multiple types of businesses, especially local ones! Improving safety for cyclists, by extension improves safety for pedestrians, as when physical barriers are in place, motorists are unable to cause harm to those both in a cycle lane, and on the adjacent side walk. This avoids over $60 million in economic costs.\nBike lanes and encouraging use are fiscally more responsible than endless car lanes.\nI would say warm regards, but I don\u2019t like to lie.\nDani\n"

The most successful, vibrant and tourist-friendly cities in the world have embraced bike lanes and cycling, as well as public transit. Cities that try to encourage everyone to travel by car are hollowed out, boring, unappealing to tourists, polluted from all the cars, and nevertheless gridlocked despite ever more vehicle lanes, because the more lanes that are built, the more people drive cars. The more cycling lanes that are built, the more people ride bikes. Do we want to emulate the most successful cities in the world, which are cities that encourage cycling, walking and public transport, or do we want to emulate the most unattractive cities of the world which are cities that dedicate more and more infrastructure to vehicular traffic. This bill is a travesty, and it will also end up with more cyclists getting killed while trying to navigate unsafe roads. Kill the bike lane removal bill!\n"

As climate change continues to merge the seasons, more and more people will bike year-round and the easier it is, the more encouraging it will be.  Climate change needs to be considered in every aspect of life at this time.\nCurrently, there are also many many e-bike food delivery vehicles using bike lanes year-round.\nDo you have facts that bike lanes contribute to gridlock? Can you publish them?\nI have recognized that in the winter, there are fewer cyclists and wondered about the possibility of having some lanes be seasonal and not permanent. This is something to consider.\nDo they need to be on main streets? Not necessarily- as long as the street has enough space for many cyclists/e-bike delivery vehicles, then a lesser main street is a valid choice.\nOn Dundas east, the bike lanes take up 1 1/2 lanes, which i don't think is necessary.

Building a new 400-series highway is a waste of money which will not decrease traffic congestion. The money should be spent on public transportation instead.
