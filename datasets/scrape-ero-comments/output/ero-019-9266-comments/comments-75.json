        "comment": "Bike lanes are very important to ensure the safety of those who choose to bike. In larger cities like Toronto, getting around is much more time effective by biking than transit in many cases. Removing bike lanes will not only threaten the lives of bikers but they will create projects that will only increase traffic while the removal is taking place.\nKeeping bike lanes:\n- improves accessibility\n- improves affordability of transportation (not having to take a taxi to travel to farther destinations)\n- promotes safety for bikers and fewer collisions for cars\n- promotes methods through which residents of Ontario can live healthier lives and engage in physical activity\n- promotes a metropolitan culture within the province's larger cities, which contributes to the overall appeal of the city for future investors, businesses, etc.\nIt is the province's duty to protect the safety and wellness of Ontario residents. Removing bike lanes is contradictory to this duty.\n"

Bike lanes are incredibly important for feeling safe as a biker. Even if bike lanes are removed, people will still be biking. Except it will be more dangerous for them. Bikers will also be competing with cars for a lane, which will slow down traffic even more.\nIf anything, we should have MORE segregated bike lanes. Instead, why can't we remove parked cars on main roads to allow for more driving lanes?\n"

Removing bike lanes from major streets doesn't change the fact that my destinations are often on those major streets. Forcing me to share the road along those stretches with cars will not make me safer.\nI'm strongly opposed to the introduction of more red tape on city governments that are already struggling to provide new infrastructure. I'm livid that the most cost-effective form of transportation, relied on by low-income Ontarians, is being discouraged while cars are being treated as the default. The government should not be hostile to the needs of it's poorest citizens, nor should it be making decisions based on rule-by-dictate, rather than evidence based outcomes.\n"

This is the biggest waste of time and resources and is not backed by statistics or facts. I thought the conservative government moved based on facts and not feelings? I thought the conservative government made fiscally responsible decisions? Why not focus on actual problems in the province like funding healthcare, schools, transit, programs, things that the people of this province actually need?\nWhy is the provincial government so obsessed with Toronto? This bill is specifically targeting Toronto. It appeases the 905ers who drive to Toronto once in a while. Why is the provincial government so obsessed about a war against Toronto/cyclists instead of actually making the lives of citizens of better?\nRemoving bike lanes will just cause bicycles to occupy the right lane blocking traffic anyway. Removing infrastructure that helps people get from A to B faster is the opposite of helping with transit congestion. More cars on the road cause traffic congestion. Do you know what helps reduce traffic congestion? Less cars on the road. How do we get less cars on the road? Better cycling and transit infrastructure. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see any of this.\nI don\u2019t understand how you can get into politics and not want to help people and make the province a better place. This government should be ashamed of themselves. I don\u2019t understand why CONSERVATIVES who are supposed to be FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE want to waste TAXPAYER MONEY on some weird car vs cyclist culture war that benefits no one.\nThe people of Ontario are watching.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and do not drive. Cycling and public transit are my only ways of getting around this city, and have been for the nearly 40 years I've lived here.\nI use my bicycle to get my two young children (a 4 and 1 year old) to and from their school and daycare. This is done mostly using residential side streets, as there is no bike lane along the majority of the route in question. We spent a significant amount of money on a large enough bike to seat both children safely. This is not a hobby - it is my one and only commuter vehicle.\nI have had a car attempt to run me off of the road before. This was on a residential side street only a few hundred meters from my child's school, *while my child was on the bike immediately after kindegarten pickup.* This because the driver was angry that I used my legal right to occupy the full lane, mid afternoon outside of rush hour, and felt entitled to pass me illegally in an intersection, cutting me off directly so that I had to brake and swerve, on a single lane, one-way street. And, I should note, this was on a bike with an electrically assisted motor, and that I was moving at the speed limit for the street in question. I was not \"impeding traffic,\" and was fully complying with all laws.\nAll this so that the driver could get to the red light that awaited us 50 meters down the road one spot in front of me. I pulled up alongside to point out how dangerous their behaviour had been, and was yelled at because I didn't pull over and let them pass, despite me not having room to allow them to do so safely.\nThis bill is absolutely backwards, and will put the lives of me and my children in danger. We will not stop biking if lanes are taken out, or not installed. We will simply be *in* the car lanes instead. This bill is going to put human lives at risk, and is a clear step backwards that is against evidence based urban planning approaches. You don't relieve traffic by making more space for cars - you do it by providing viable alternatives to them.\nI cannot believe that this is a priority for the provincial government - it is the most cynical kind of irresponsible pandering.\n"

        "comment": "Bike infrastructure has been proven time and time again that they are positive for congestion and a city's overall health. Adding vehicle lanes DO NOT reduce traffic. They are an invitation for more cars to use the road and will eventually fill up again. Induced demand is real.\nDoug Ford said himself in 2017 on his own bike ride that riding outside of a bike lane feels dangerous. This new bill will kill more cyclists as drivers seem to be on the trajectory of being more comfortable breaking the law, buying bigger trucks with bad visibility, and having no concern for anyone outside their vehicle.\nToronto is in need, more than ever, of introducing more non-personal vehicle methods of transportation. We need trains, trams, buses, bikes, scooters, and walkable cities. Not more cars. They are the least efficient form of mass transportation.\n"

The crooked dealings in the Premier's office round land make the whole think stink to high heaven.  That last thing Ontario needs is to funnel billions more to crooked business.  We've already wasted billions on the Crooked Crosstown that will never open.\nI oppose the removal of protected bicycle lanes.  I use them every day instead of bringing my car downtown.  There simply isn't enough room for a million people to use the 1000 square feet a moving care demands every day in town.  Cars stop working in cities once they pass 10 stories, as a trip to any major city in the world will teach.  Toronto passed that line 20 years ago.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about the proposed legislation granting the province authority over municipal bike lane installations and removals. As a suburban citizen who frequently commutes to the downtown core, I appreciate the need for safe and efficient transportation options. This includes well-functioning transit and bike lanes, and we should be doing everything we can to improve these networks, not take away from them.\nThis move represents an overreach by the provincial government into local decision-making. Municipalities are best positioned to understand the unique needs and preferences of their communities. Bike lanes enhance mobility, promote sustainability, and support local businesses. Removing the ability for cities to adapt and manage their own transportation infrastructure could stifle progress and community engagement.\nOn a personal level, biking is not just a means of transportation for me; it\u2019s a way to connect with my community and enjoy the outdoors. But every time I ride, I\u2019m acutely aware of the dangers that come with sharing the road with cars. I\u2019ve had close calls where drivers seemed oblivious to my presence, and it\u2019s terrifying to think how easily a moment\u2019s inattention could turn fatal. Each tragic story of a cyclist losing their life resonates deeply, reminding me that without safe, dedicated bike lanes, we are putting lives at risk.\nWe must also consider that mixing cars and bikes not only endangers cyclists but can also lead to slower traffic overall, as drivers navigate around them. Dedicated bike lanes help reduce this problem, encouraging more people to cycle and ultimately easing congestion.\nInstead of taking away lanes or approving them on a street-by-street basis based on anecdotal feelings of what is causing congestion, we need to start applying evidence-based transportation planning. This includes approaching bike lane planning with a network-wide mindset. Just as a road system is only as effective as its connections, bike lanes must be part of a cohesive network to be truly useful. Imagine if a highway suddenly ended without any exit\u2014there would be no drivers as they would be left stranded and frustrated. Similarly, unconnected bike lanes do little to encourage safe cycling or effective commuting. We need to do better in taking the politics out of transportation planning and start adopting these evidence-based approaches to traffic.\nDedicated bike lanes help reduce risks, encourage more people to cycle, and ultimately ease congestion. Empowering local governments to make these decisions is essential for creating vibrant, bike-friendly communities. Let\u2019s support local autonomy and ensure that decisions about our streets reflect the desires and needs of our neighborhoods.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is not based on any evidence.  It is completely backwards.  Removing bike lanes and adding car lanes is not going to work to reduce congestion.  The only way to do that is to reduce the number of single-occupant vehicles on the road.  Bike lanes are a key factor in doing that.\nThe evaluation of the Bloor bike lanes (see link) showed that they were successful in increasing the volume of cyclists while decreasing collisions, with only a minor increase to overall travel time for motorists - an effect which was further mitigated by adjusting the traffic signals.\nThe Laurier bike lanes in Ottawa (see link) are another similar success story.  Again, cycling volumes increased while collisions decreased - for ALL road users, not just cyclists.\nThe argument that bike lanes should be moved to secondary streets is silly.  Bike lanes need to go where the cyclists are.  In most cases, that is on main arteries.  The cyclists are there for the same reason drivers are - it's the fastest way to get where they're going.\nIt also makes no sense for the province to involve itself so closely in municipal decisions.  City governments know best what works for their citizens.  The province should not be coming in and telling cities where they can and can't put bike lanes on streets that they own and manage.\nIt is beyond ridiculous that in 2024, anyone would be seriously proposing this legislation.\n"

Municipal roads are a municipal responsibility and the province should not be micromanaging every project that wants to add bike lanes. The planning and approval process for these projects is already subject to public input and biased against the addition of bike lanes as it stands. Adding additional friction will only make our roads more dangerous for everyone.\n"

If you take them out of a bike lane and stick them in a live traffic lane traffic will get worse. If a driver runs a cyclist down because they weren't going fast enough in front of them traffic will get worse.\nIf you want to improve commutes give people more options. Invest in trains. The province has known that the Kitchener line was going to need more capacity for like 20 years. Get that done. Every person you convince to take a train is a car you're pulling off the road.\nMake the Go Trains nicer on every corridor. Enforce rules on quiet cars. Clean them more often. Improve wifi. Every person you can convince to take the train pulls someone off the highway.\n"
