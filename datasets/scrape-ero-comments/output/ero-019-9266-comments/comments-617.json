        "comment": "Wow, this is the EXACT OPPOSITE thing you should do to reduce gridlock- we need MORE bike paths, not less!\nMore bike paths and more people in bikes will reduce the number of cars on the road. That, paired with increased funding for public transit will decrease traffic, improve the environment, and make the city far more \"World Class\" in the eyes of its residents and the rest of the world. Proper bike lanes are a sign of a modern city that cares about its residents, and especially its pedestrians. We need more bike lanes now!\n"

        "comment": "My wife and I are in our late sixties, and we live in the downtown west end.  We rely, as we have done for most of our lives, on bicycle as our primary means of getting around.  We cycle practically every day, save for truly inclement weather.   We don't even own a car.  The same is true for two of our three adult children.\nWe are not comfortable cycling beside speeding traffic, or past parked cars, especially at our age.  It doesn't feel safe!  Toronto's bike lanes have been a great boon to us.  We urge the Government of Ontario to remove the restrictions on bike lanes.  They are there for our safety!\n"

        "comment": "We need less traffic and highways and more trams/trains/public transit (including safe bike lanes). Why not put more effort into giving more access to public transit to reduce the need for vehicles.\nLiving in a place like Sudbury, owing a car is a privilege where it might take over an hour just to get across town using public transport. Why can't we have nice things like the European cities have with their robust public transit?\n"

        "comment": "I have been cycling in Toronto since about 2008 when there were fewer bike lanes. Cycling is so much easier and safer now that there are more bike lanes. I appreciate the bike lanes very much. And beyond that, the idea that the premier should be consulted on local matters seems like an over reach. Let Torontonians decide what happens in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal to remove the incredible progress of bikelanes in Toronto in recent years is a huge step backwards. Without safe places to cycle, people are reticent to consider cycling as a primary mode of transportation. Yes, it takes time for people's habits to change but without the lanes, more people will go to cars, rather than fewer, which will have the net impact of increasing gridlock. Additionally, courageous cyclists will need to be in the traffic, increasing safety risks and making it more difficult for drivers as well. No longer will children or youth be able to cycle safely to get to school or programs.\nToronto and the rest of the country to need to continue to look FORWARD - towards a climate friendly, safe and enjoyable future where cycling, walking, and transit are the prime modes of transportation, not the car. Cars and trucks already have huge amounts of road allocation.\nThe evidence supports all of this. Please, please don't move forward with this short-sighted, reactionary and politiczied proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Protected bike lanes are important for keeping everyone safe. Food delivery people, commuters, youth, people going to social events, etc., rely on these lanes to get around safely especially in a city like Toronto with congestion and unreliable transit. The argument that bike lanes cause congestion is ridiculous - construction and utlity work are the leading cause of congestion. Cars cause congestion. The lanes in Toronto being proposed for removal all have street parking on them - remove the street parking instead! Getting rid of protected lanes won't get rid of cyclists, it will only make them less safe and more fatalities will occur. It's also such a waste of public money, especially the University lanes which just opened this year.\nThis is a poorly thought out plan based on no current evidence - purely ideological and actively makes people less safe. Anyone involved in implementing this should be pretty embarrassed.\n"

        "comment": "As a physician and cyclist in Toronto, I implore the government to give consideration to safety over travel times.  While the construction of the new lanes certainly slowed traffic, these lanes are now in place and are proving to be a very effective shared use of the street.  This morning, in rush hour, traffic was moving well along University Ave.  It does not seem clear what problem this legislation is intended to address.  The construction to remove them will only slow traffic again.\n"

It will take time for cities to grow accustomed to them, and by removing them. you are erasing all of the hard work done within the community over the last decade.\nIt will be a shameful situation to clearly prioritize money over people, especially when the latter influences citizen safety.\n"

        "comment": "I do not know where to start in listing reasons for how awful and misguided this bill is.\nFirst, since this seems to matter to this govt most: it is wasteful! Removal of lanes that already exist wastes money used to build them, and wastes time and effort to remove them (not to mention carbon footprint).\nSecond, since this also seems to matter - bike lanes do not cause gridlock - CARS DO! And lack of investments - commensurate with demand - for public transit. Rather than interfering with municipal powers, this govt should invest in robust and comprehensive public transit infrastructure, including bike lanes.\nThird, bike lanes save lives (I guess this does not matter to this gov't so shame shame shame), and they are good for health and environment (this also does not seem to matter, so shame again!).\nDO NOT remove/block existing and future bike lanes - they will not solve the gridlock problem; invest in public transit - this WILL solve it.\nThere is plenty of data to support all of the above.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike infrastructure is insane. Toronto already is lacking in safe pathways to encourage more people to cycle and remove cars from the road. Removing this infrastructure is wasteful of tax payer dollars and will put another car on the road for each cyclist that can no longer cummute safely. Do not pass this bill.\n"

It\u2019s embarassing from a sustainability point of view that the province wants to support cars rather than bikes.\nThe bike lanes are AWESOME. We\u2019re delighted with the new ones on Eglinton and feel much safer biking there than fighting traffic in our bikes OR in our cars. Besides which, the layout on Eglinton offers street parking even during rush hour (yay for when we have errands to run that require a car) while there was no street parking before during rush hour.\nPlease don\u2019t take a step back and remove any bike lanes. Toronto needs MORE bike lanes, not less.\n"
