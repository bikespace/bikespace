        "comment": "This is a dangerous proposal that is not substantiated by any relevant data. In fact, data points to a significant increase in road safety and business activity when bike lanes are installed. What is particularly troubling with this plan is the potential removal of bike lanes on University Ave, which help get doctors, nurses, and other essential healthcare workers to work in our hospitals. With the removal of bike lanes, everyone loses: more cyclists will die, pollution from car emissions will increase, healthcare workers will take longer to get to work, and local businesses will lose sales.\n"

        "comment": "My mother was run over by a car that lost control while biking on a separated, but unprotected, path two years ago. The force was such that the bike sliced into her abdomen, narrowly missing crucial internal organs. Bones were protruding from her left leg. Her partner has PTSD from witnessing the event. More people will get to see their mothers, fathers, children, partners, and friends in this state or worse as a result of this legislation. It is cruel and wrong, and will only be undone as soon as this government is no longer in power. It is a drastic waste of money and resources, and the rest of the province suffers for this use of provincial resources in the city of Toronto. It is a reversible decision, and should be removed from this legislation.\n"

Cars are the least efficient use of limited road space, giving people alternatives to single occupancy vehicles is the only way to reduce congestion. Safe bike lanes are essential to getting around this city. Do not waste my tax dollars removing infrastructure we already paid for.\n"

        "comment": "The facts do not support this legislation.  It is simply based on some disgruntled drivers (some in Doug Ford's riding) and not on the facts which are that bike lanes do not cause congestion. I do not bike, but I walk and these lanes make it safer for all. Have you even read the studies?\nCities and towns should be able to decide where bike lanes go and how to make moving around safer for everyone. The Association of Municipalities has already told you this.\nThe environment should always be considered in what we build and support.   Highway 413 does not seem to pass that test.\nConcentrate on transportation that really matters and looks to the future.  We need more public transportation that connects people within cities and towns and between smaller centres.  Owning a car should be not be necessary to get around Ontario.\nReverse Bill 212\n"

        "comment": "As a retired 67 year old woman, who owns a car but also loves to cycle I don\u2019t like the plans set out in Bill 212.  Gridlock won\u2019t improve with the removal of Bike lanes.\nPeople coming from areas west, north and east of the city need to change their mode of travel and start using other means of coming into the city such as GO Transit. The trains are running more frequently and the cost to connect to TTC has dropped saving citizens money and time to get to their destination using a Presto card.\nI live in the east end on the Toronto-Scarborough border. When construction began a few years ago on the Gardiner Lakeshore DVP area it would take over an hour to get downtown. Cutting thru city streets didn\u2019t improved my travel time.\nI decided that I needed to see if I would be able to bike the 15 km distance. I know what it feels like to ride in traffic. The first day a van with wide mirrors clipped my handle bars that really shook annd scared me. People open their car doors into traffic. Cars pull out into traffic not looking for cyclists.\nI now regularly bike using the Danforth-Bloor lanes. Please don\u2019t remove the Bloor St lanes bc it provides me a safer zone that I and others use daily.\n"

Proper bike lanes provide a safe, alternate way of travel (which may help reduce congestion).\nIt is extremely disappointing to see this misuse of time, energy, and funds when there are much more pressing matters to attend to.\n"

        "comment": "I think it is totally ridiculous that the city needs to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes. It is also ridiculous that the province wants to remove bike lanes that have been implemented around the city. You should be implementing more! The city of Toronto is about people NOT cars. This government is so out of touch with what's going around them. The major problem is the government allowing developers to block off lanes of traffic for years, people who live outside the city driving in their SUV's with one person in their car causing havoc. Maybe you should consider 2 things: Install a City Congestion Charge Zone in the city as London, Uk did. This has reduced congestion by over 30%. Educate yourselves on how other citys in Europe control car congestion. Increase fines for cars/trucks that block intersections.\n"

Cyclists are FAR more at risk from death without these bike lanes than the minuscule time saved by removing bike lanes. It is a huge waste of tax payers money and TORONTO wanted the bike lanes. Stay away from our city and fix the healthcare system.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes from the proposed streets will not meaningfully ease traffic through Toronto. Traffic is not caused by cyclists (who might otherwise be driving cars and therefore exacerbating traffic) taking up less than a full lane's worth of space along Bloor or Yonge. Traffic is caused by decades of underinvestment in Transit in a context of massive geographic expansion which renders the car the most attractive option for many Torontonians. Investment in transit service and infrastructure may not have the culture war appeal, or quick-fix sugar high that removing bike lanes delivers for the provincial Conservative government. But neither will it endanger the lives of cyclists, or encourage even more cars on to Toronto's already gridlocked streets and as an added bonus, it would reduce traffic, reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality in the city.\n"

From everything I have seen, the lanes improve commute time, particularly to the hospitals.\nWhen this study looked at spend on Bloor at Small Businesses, we saw a lift in sales. Why would we hurt small business?\nI urge you to reconsider.\n"

I will continue to do this with or without the bike lanes, since I actually have work to get done and don't have time to sit in traffic. In practice this means I'm just going to be biking down the center of whatever traffic lane they put in. Given the volume of bike traffic along this street I have no idea how the premier expects cars to actually be able to use that lane. Personally I don't think he's thought about it at all.\n"
