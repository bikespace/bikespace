        "comment": "This proposed legislation risks reinforcing a car-centric approach to urban planning that prioritizes vehicles over pedestrians and cyclists. Limiting bike lane installation and removing environmental assessment processes for major highway projects does nothing to reduce gridlock. In fact, it actively ignores the growing demand for more sustainable, safe, and diverse transportation options.\nEach municipality should have the ability to design and implement transportation infrastructure that suits its communities\u2019 unique needs. Different neighbourhoods face different challenges, and the solutions must be tailored accordingly.\nPerhaps the most compelling reason for rethinking transportation policy is safety. Ontario, like many other regions, has seen tragic incidents involving vulnerable road users \u2014 particularly cyclists. Just this year, six cyclists were killed on Toronto\u2019s streets. Bill 212 disregards the safety of these individuals, which is not only unacceptable, but dangerous.\nLimiting bike lanes undermines efforts to make our roads safer for all users. By encouraging more cycling and creating designated lanes, we protect cyclists, reduce traffic congestion, and make the streets safer for everyone \u2014 drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.\nOne of the biggest concerns with the proposed legislation is that it would limit municipalities\u2019 ability to make decisions based on their communities\u2019 specific needs. Cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Hamilton face different transportation challenges than small, rural municipalities like Ramara and Severn, and it\u2019s essential that the local governments have the flexibility to address these issues on their own terms.\nInstead of restricting municipalities\u2019 ability to install bike lanes, we should empower them to make decisions that reflect the realities of their communities. Each city should be able to create a transportation strategy that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and accessibility for everyone \u2014 not just motorists.\nAs we look to the future, we hope that the Ontario government will adopt a progressive transportation strategy that prioritizes safety, environmental considerations, sustainability, and municipal autonomy. After all, the future of Ontario\u2019s transportation system must be one that works for everyone \u2014 whether they are driving, cycling, walking, or taking transit.\n"

        "comment": "ERO number  019-9266\nI strongly oppose the proposed changes in Bill 212 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, especially \u201cSchedule 3, Highway 413 Act\u201d and \u201cSchedule 4, Part XII By-Laws and Bicycle Lanes.\u201d  With respect to Schedule 3, I am deeply concerned by article (2) \u201cExemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act.\u201d Exempting Highway 413 from environmental assessment risks destroying ecologically and hydrologically sensitive features in the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine, putting at risk invaluable and irreplaceable natural environments and endangered species \u2013 including the redheaded woodpecker, Jefferson salamander, western chorus frog, redside dace, and more. Moreover, by allowing \u201cearly work\u201d to occur before Indigenous consultation is complete, this act undermines meaningful consent for Indigenous communities and reconciliation. The Environmental Assessment Act exists for the \u201cbetterment of the people of the whole or any part of Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the environment\u201d (R.S.O. 1990, c. E.18, s. 2.); any infrastructure development that requires exemption from such an act is clearly not in the best interests of the people and province of Ontario.\nWith respect to Schedule 4, Part XII, the placement of bicycle lanes should be a municipal matter. Municipalities have an in-depth knowledge of their communities, local traffic, and public transit options, and are best situated to determine the location of bicycle lanes. Moreover, Ontario has significantly more important issues that deserve and require attention from the provincial government. Rather than micromanaging proposed lanes, traffic flow, and existing bike lanes (articles 1-2, 4-5), it would be a better use of time and resources for the province to focus on these serious problems - such as the shortage of doctors and nurses, emergency room wait times, unaffordable housing, insufficient shelters for homelessness, drug crises, etc. - that require serious solutions.\n"

        "comment": "I feel there is no need for a bike lane along Bloor St. west of Runnymede Rd.\nIt's a main artery that can be avoided by cyclists by using side roads or existing trails. I have traveled on my bike from Dixon Rd. / Scarlett Rd. area for the past 3 summers to High Park. on a regular basis. I use the Humber River Trail until Warren Park and then go through side streets to Annette St. From here I then go south on High Park Ave until I reach the park.  No need to use Bloor St., use side streets and trails.\nOh, and High Park is now a mess with Bikes zipping around everywhere, on the roads, on walking trails and on grass. It was safer with cars, you knew a car would only be on the road. They are easy to see and hear and they all have horns that are used.\nOur city councilors are too preoccupied with making Toronto a cycling heaven. Do they expect me to go grocery shopping, go to work at city hall or go to the Eaton Centre on a bicycle?\nWe are not a European city. Scarborough, North York and Etobicoke were originally suburbs and designed for using cars as transportation.  If you want to go downtown, instead of cycling ......use the subway!\n"

Furthermore, at a time of financial stress, it\u2019s deeply irresponsible for any government to spend an exorbitant cost to remove high quality, working infrastructure.\nPlease reconsider your plan to remove any existing bike lanes. Cities need to be responsible for making decisions for their local communities (which include cyclists, pedestrians and drivers) without provincial overreach.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing to express my concerns about Bill 212 and its potential negative impacts not only on the environment but also on the health and safety of the people of Ontario, and economic impacts. The removal of bicycle lanes and the potential prevention of their implementation will not reduce gridlock/car traffic, and will likely make it worse in the long-term. Just on this aspect of Bill 212 alone, several groups of experts \u2013 from clinicians and researchers at University of Toronto (1), engineers (2) \u2013 and municipalities (3-5) have spoken out against it, citing concerns around safety, environmental harms, provincial overreach, and the general lack of evidence supporting the underlying premise of the Bill.\nDedicated bike lanes are a tool that many jurisdictions have used to improve overall both cyclists\u2019 and road safety, in efforts to reduce road user injuries and deaths. Looking to Montreal, QC, separated cycle tracks have been found to have a lower injury risk, compared to riding on the street (6). A study looking at the implementation of cycle tracks in Toronto found that the rate of cyclist-motor vehicle collisions decreased despite the increased volume of cyclists using the cycle tracks (7). The presence of bike lanes have also been found to have a traffic calming affect, which helps reduce the risk and severity of traffic collisions (8). Seeing that Toronto is seeing the a record high of cyclist fatalities this year so far, road safety should be prioritized over drivers\u2019 convenience.\nIt\u2019s an often repeated claim that building bike lanes on roads increases traffic congestion (like this Bill is suggesting). However, cities all over the world have found that reallocation of space from cars to other modes of transit, when implemented carefully, is an effective way to manage traffic (9).  Building out a connected bike lane network is part of this, along with increasing affordable, reliable and extensive public transportation options. When given safe and sufficient alternatives to cars, people will choose them.\nAnd people do use bike lanes when they are built (10)! The City of Toronto found that bike lane along Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue daily usage had double to triple digit percentage increases after they were built compared to before. Some people choose to cycle instead of drive cars when bike lanes are built (11), while others bike more as a result of their presence.\nConsider also that many jurisdictions have been moving away from car dependent infrastructure and reducing space allocated to cars to reduce air pollution, which has increasingly been found to be harmful to human health (12-13). The removal of bike lanes and potential to prevent municipalities for building them may discourage some people from cycling; when coupled with little discouragement to drive and trying to make it more convenient, traffic-related air pollution levels will increase. The Ontario Hospital Association recently released a study projecting that millions more people in Ontario will have chronic diseases, many of which have been associated with or are exacerbated by air pollution, by 2040. Given this, it would be in the best interest of the government to promote and implement policies that positively contribute to people\u2019s health, which the contents of Bill 212 don\u2019t seem to do.\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize that bike lanes work best when they are built where people want or need to go, such as main streets where businesses or places of employment are located, just like Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue (14). While bike lanes might not be as beneficial for businesses on wider, busier streets, bike lanes have been found to have minimal negative effect on, and often positively benefit businesses where this infrastructure is built (15-16), particularly small businesses and restaurants. This has also been supported by the Bloor St W pilot study of the bike lanes in the Annex and Korea Town neighbourhoods (17).\nIn the interest of brevity, I have not mentioned all that issues that will be negatively affected by Bill 212. The provincial government has a responsibility to take into account evidence and guidance from experts in developing and implementing sound policy, yet this Bill is a demonstration that the Progressive Conservative government is ignoring that responsibility to the detriment to the very people they were elected to represent. This leads me to question what is convincing the Progressive Conservative government to force through Bill 212 despite the evidence against it.\n"

        "comment": "No. This goes against everything we collectively know about traffic flow efficiencies, public road and transit cost efficiencies, what we need for safety for all road users, and the many benefits of bikes for health, social connection, nature connection, and community safety. And we need bike lanes for our survival. 1.5C of warming is all but lost. We need every single bike trip we can get at this point. So completely counter productive it would take me all night to actually write it out. It goes against the bodies of research of probably a large university campus- worth of researchers, scientists and academics from disciplines such as exercise physiology, community development, psychology, planning, transportation management, landscape architecture, health sciences, economics, political economy, sociology and more. What actually are you trying to accomplish with this, besides increase power and control over municipalities, and make them less equitable, safe and climate-ready/responsive? No.\n"

The racket and contamination generated out of the question could lead us to think that wrong is right.\nDo a quick imagination exercise and put yourselves in the place of the people who were to read about the following matter in about hundred years. Most likely, unreason and absurdity will trigger: the plan here is tearing down recent built infraestructures, which funnel bike commuters throughout the concrete jungle of downtown Toronto, and replace it with addiitonal new car lanes. Brilliant!\nLet's have a quick journey along the basics here: cities in Northamerica were designed around cars, over a century ago. The consequences exhausting out of such a \"motor-centrism\" is pollution, traffic jams and unsafe conditions in the central heart of our cities.\nAfter countless scientific studies, published in numerous papers around the world, plus all kind of traffic analysis and research, in combination with all metrics about quality of air collected from weather stations located in multiple points around cities everywhere, all data comes to the same conclusion: a healthier development of public space should not just go by adding safer and well-signed bike lanes, but about turning more existing driveways and streets for cars into pedestrian streets.\nEnjoying of a proper designed and built bike lane does not only contribute to physical protection and agility on urban community. The impact in the psychological and mental health are proven, by reducing noise and fumes from cars, honks and congestion in the areas were we live, walk, commute, attend to school and courses or work.\nAll considerations above are just when setting a passive vantage point. If we consider an active commuter, using those lanes for biking to her/ his daily destinations, the effects in health are even better: promoting a healthy lifestyle, saving cost in transportation, reducing gases contamination and noise to zero and improving mental health and well being.\nIf this government would really have its centre of attention on willing to contribute to its citizens with a better life conditions, it would not vote for Bill 212. Governments are suppose to care about the people they represent, with a vocational service for public and protect them from any potential risk or hazard.\nVoting for Bill 212 demonstrates that this Government either has other interests, far from the listed above, or does not really care about the citizens is serving to. If the reason is former, then what we have here is a collective of civil servants whose power have corrupted the ultimate goal of their political mission. That would mean they are not competent, in good condition or prepared any more to develop their state functions. On the other hand, if the reason is the later -does no really care about the wellbeing of the Torontonians- then what we would have here instead is a case of malicious and evil attitude, close to the psycopathy, which, in an ideal world, would immediately put the current decision makers out of the representation of the people, for obvious reasons.\nHence, here comes the fork in the path for you, Ontario PM, ministry of infraestructure any other responsible of this Bill: do you want to prove yourself as people with good intent, good moral and merciful of the position you hold? Or would you prefer, instead, to let your hand being led by toxic rage and cruel intentions?\nMake ourselves a Christmas gift and favour and surprise all us for good on this one!\n"

When bikers fear for their safety, they bike on sidewalks which makes it difficult and unsafe for pedestrians. Traffic flow is better when everyone has a place. Biking reduces pollution. Using a bike, instead of a car for short trips, reduces travel emissions by 75%. Biking also offers all the benefits of exercise. Also, biking in the city is it is the only way you absolutely know how long your commute is going to take. It is more reliable than driving or public transit in that regard. The province should be encouraging cyclists not ripping out bike lanes at ENORMOUS taxpayer expense.\n"

The proposed streets for bike lane removal (Bloor and College) aren\u2019t wide enough for an extra car lane each direction. So - it isn\u2019t as if the bike lanes are taking away space from a potential other car lane.\n"

We are a cycling family, me, my husband, and 2 kids - 10 and 14 years old. The bike paths have made our bike travels more frequent and safer. I feel protected when I ride on them. We travel with our children all over the city by bike. To the dentist, the doctor, the swimming pool at Christie Pits, to my son's soccer games at Central Tech Dome, Ontario Place (before it closed!), High Park, The lakeshore. All along the Bloor and College street bike lanes. We need more bike lanes. Not removal of them. When I drive I don't mind it taking a bit longer. Or I leave my car at home and bike or take the transit. People's mind sets have got to change. We don't need more cars in the city. People should leave their cars at home like I do. Much faster to ride, walk or take transit. All the cosmopolitan cities know that already. We should be taking note.\nIf the bike lanes are gone I can guarantee you most people like us won't feel safe riding in the city with our kids anymore. Do we need more pollution and grid lock with cars? I say no. Put more bike lanes in and you will see in a few years there will be more cyclists, less pollution, and a healthier population.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 fundamentally threatens our rights as Ontarians to have a healthful environment by removing removing existing bike lanes.\nBy proposing removing bike lanes, the government demonstrates a lack of care for the environment. Bike lanes can support more people per hour than a car lane and produce much less noise and air pollution. Cycling is an cheap and clean way for people of all ages and economic status to get around their own communities. Removing existing cycling infrastructure and expanding the bureaucracy required to expand it will discourage people from cycling and thus increase noise, air and water pollution as well as increase road violence. By removing a community's option of having safe cycling infrastructure, the government risks their citizens health and lives.\nDrivers and vulnerable road users including the disabled peoples on mobility devices, cyclists and pedestrians all benefit from having a separated protected bike lanes. Bike lanes keep cyclists off of sidewalks, preventing collisions with pedestrians, and provides a protective barrier, preventing cyclists from mixing with car traffic. The perceived narrowing of the road will slow down drivers, reducing the severity of car crashes. People with mobility devices can as also use the bike lanes to get around. All road users are safer as a result of bike lanes. They are also shown to increase business in areas where bike lanes are built. They have no impact on emergency vehicle response times.\nThe removal of preexisting cycling infrastructure is unfair and undemocratic. The City of Toronto specifically built the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Young through it's own municipal processes. The people of the city rely on these bike lanes to get to work, to see family, to do business, and to enjoy the city recreationally. Forcing municipalities and communities to tear out bike lanes is unjust and uninformed.\n"

Please scrap this bill and it\u2019s unnecessary meddling in municipal infrastructure.\nUrban bikelanes on main streets are a valuable and needed corridor that supports the transition to eco-friendly transport, and an essential element of a more human scale GTA.\nI live in Etobicoke, I drive a car on Bloor, I just biked on University Ave today. I support bike lanes on main streets, and the existent bike infrastructure in Toronto. As a long time cyclist I know these routes have made my rides noticeable safer. As a driver, they've increased my confidence knowing that cyclists will be in a dedicated lane, and not filtering in between car lanes.\nPushing these lanes to side streets is not even possible in some areas, plus it makes them an in-direct route and less appealing option for many cyclists. It will also divert local bike traffic away from main-street businesses. Data from comparable cities shows that bike corridors on commercial strips boost spending to local businesses, while also raising property values and more.\nThe recent statements and actions of the Ford Provincial government, and now this legislation represent attitudes that have already set the GTA back years in achieving the basic low-carbon transportation infrastructure of comparable cities. They also embolden violence from drivers who continue to act on the irrational belief that theirs are the only vehicles that deserve space on the road.\nPlease think of the sustainable future of our cities. How can we create a city that our grand children, and their children can traverse in an efficient, enjoyable and environmentally friendly way. Please respect the jurisdiction of municipal government and the data they share regarding urban transportation.\nPlease scrap this bill!\n"
