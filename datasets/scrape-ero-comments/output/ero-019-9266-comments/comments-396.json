        "comment": "As I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you, this is such backwards thinking and regressive policy. There are countless examples of where bike lanes have contributed to reduced congestion, rather than the opposite. Especially when you consider that e-assist bikes are the fastest growing electric transportation in North America.\nSome proof points:\nReduces congestion: Cities like New York saw a 14% traffic reduction on streets with protected bike lanes. Shifting more people to bikes means fewer cars and less gridlock (NACTO Report).\nIncreases road capacity: Copenhagen found that bike lanes move 5 times more people than car lanes in the same space. Bikes require less road area, allowing for more efficient use of space (Copenhagenize).\nFaster short trips: Studies show that in cities like Paris, bikes are faster than cars for trips under 5 kilometers due to avoided traffic and easy parking (Transport & Environment).\nHealth and environmental benefits: Bike lanes contribute to lower emissions and air pollution. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s cycling network helps save 350,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually, reducing traffic while improving air quality (ITDP Report).\nCost-effective: Building bike lanes is significantly cheaper than car lanes. In Portland, every mile of bike infrastructure costs just $300,000, compared to $60 million for a mile of freeway (City of Portland Study).\nImproves safety: London\u2019s introduction of separated bike lanes led to a 40% reduction in cyclist injuries, showing safer infrastructure reduces accidents and improves traffic flow (Transport for London).\n"

        "comment": "I bike everywhere and have almost been hit by a car multiple times. People have lost their lives due to the poor bike infrastructure in the city. We need more and better bike lanes, not less of them. We should also not be wasting all the public money that was spent building recent bike lanes by removing them. We are in a world class city and what this bill proposes is a backwards move for Toronto. We need to move forwards towards progress and how can we say we are progressing to a better future if we are making decisions that do the complete opposite?\nMore and more people are biking. It's an easy, cost effective, quick, environmentally friendly and healthy way for people to move around the city. Does the government think that less people are going to bike if they remove lanes? Absolutely not. People who bike will always bike and we are going to be putting those lives at risk for the benefit of motor vehicles? This bill is an endangerment to the lives of thousands of citizens. People are already dying so please don't go ahead with this bill and cause more deaths. The lives of people are more important than politics or a popularity contest. Have some common sense for once and listen to the people who are directly affected by your decisions, whose lives depend on you. You are directly responsible for our lives so please make the right decision.\nThere are bigger issues to focus on in this province and this proposal proves to me that your priorities are in the wrong place and that the leadership of this province doesn't care about us. And if you want to focus on solving gridlock? Then actually look at facts and data and take examples from other cities in the world where they've solved it. Not just go off a hunch or do it to gain votes. You can and must do better, please stop embarassing us in front of the world (a tunnel under the 401 really? Everyone thinks we're a joke of a province). Do better!\n\u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\"\n- Doug Ford\nIs one death really too many to Doug and this government? How about 6 deaths in 2024 in Toronto alone? Stop fooling us and do your job!\nAlso, you're trying to sneak in an exception of environmental assessment for the 413? Really? You think people are stupid and won't notice? How many controversies is this government going to have? We're done with corruption and done with you playing us for idiots. Like I said before: do better! Have a spine and stand up for what really matters. People are not happy, people are angry. Do your job and do it well. I can't express with words how disappointed and embarrassed I am to live in this province when other parts of the world actually do a good job of governing.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident in Toronto and this bill is ridiculous. I have never cared about politics because BIKE LANES SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIZED yet here we are. So, please keep the bike lanes and keep having more of them. None of the reasons that the provincial government has listed to back up this bill is scientifically correct.\nI use bike lanes all the time, and so do many many residents in Ontario. This is an essential part of my life and their lives. This bill will prevent me from getting to places I need to go. They are like sidewalks to me. Would you rip out sidewalks one day if you don't see enough people walking on a random Tuesday? I hope not. I don't know how I can make you understand how essential bike infrastructure is to me and many many other residents. Just please open your eyes and open you mind and try to talk to and understand us for once please.\nAs a minority on the road, we should be protected. We should not have to share roads with motor vehicles and we should feel safe just to get groceries and not having to get squished by 6 lanes of cars. This will further eliminate people who wants to bike but fear to due to the lack of infrastructure and surprise, you are going to have more cars on the road which increase congestion even more. And that's only for people who can afford and drive. For those who can't, they are left stranded at home and not go outside as often which means worse physical and mental health for those individuals.\nNot to mention drivers don't like to be driving with bikers on the same road, either. When I drive, I feel much safer driving on Bloor and University because of the very well-designed fully-protected bike lanes. I know that I will be less stressed driving and the bikers will be safer driving on their own lanes. Removing these infrastructure will be forcing all means of traffic to share roads hence cause more accidents.\nFurthermore, the provincial government should not have a say in the municipal decisions on bike lanes in the first place. Do you go to Oshawa everyday and uses their municipal infrastructure everyday? No, and neither do I. Therefore, neither of us should have a say in what to build in Oshawa. People who live in Oshawa should be the only ones who can decide on their public infrastructure.\nPlease please please reconsider and take back the bill. I like Toronto because of how much progress we have made in the past decade to make this city more friendly to pedestrians. I would love to keep living here and enjoy the improvements in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I vigorously and adamantly disagree with this proposed legislation, and as a resident of Toronto I demand that it not be passed. I outline my reasons below.\nBike lanes in Toronto are an essential part of our transportation system. We use them to commute, to run errands, get groceries, and so many other purposes. I use them regularly to get around my neighborhood, attend appointments, and go to the gym. The removal of bike lanes and the stagnation of their development (which let's be honest here, is what this legislation would effectively accomplish) directly harms me.\nBike lanes incentivize people to bike instead of drive, reducing the amount of cars on our roads and reducing gridlock. As a driver, I am in favour of bike lanes because it means that when I have to drive less cars are in my way. As a cyclist, I am in favour of bike lanes because they keep me safer and allow me to bike downtown if I want to.\nBike lanes are cheap to build, maintain, and use compared to automotive lanes. Toronto has just drastically increased taxes to cover our budget. The last thing we need is to spend money destroying cheap infrastructure to build expensive infrastructure.\nThe need to consult the province before building new bike lanes introduces bureaucracy that slows development and increases costs for no benefit. This proposed legislation is not a framework, it is an obstacle. Why should an MPP from Thunder Bay, for example, be bothered about Toronto's bike lanes when she has so much other important work to do? With all due respect, does she know more about my city than my city councilor?\nThe involvement of the province in municipal affairs in this way without the city's consent is overreach.  Doug Ford, stop trying to be Premier of Toronto, that's not your job. You were elected to be Premier of our province, so govern the entire province and not just our city.\nI both drive and I ride my bike regularly so I see both sides of the argument. This legislation is an extremely poor idea, and downright regressive. I want transportation infrastructure built, not delayed and destroyed. Stop waging a culture war and do your job.\nEvan\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is terrible. I am appalled that the Premier wants to waste my taxpayer money ripping out the expensive transportation infrastructure that was just built with my tax dollars when it will do nothing to ease traffic congestion. If anything it will make it much worse. The construction itself will cause congestion and moving the cyclists into the vehicle traffic will absolutely slow down traffic -- not to mention certainly injure and probably kill several of them. Look at all the other \"world class\" cities -- they are all building active transportation infrastructure because it is necessary for a decent quality of life in dense cities. Is the Premier unaware that almost all the new intensification along these streets, high-rises that his government has argued that we need, is predicated on the residents using active transportation? Just look at the number of parking slots allotted in them to cars vs. bikes! There are literally THOUSANDS of new residents who will be moving to my neighbourhood in downtown Toronto in the next few years, who are expected to use active transportation here and who will completely clog the vehicle lanes if there are no bike lanes for them. Already we are seeing a massive increase in rental bike use every year, with thousands of trips every day -- having them in the vehicle lane will NOT speed up traffic! I beg you to reconsider this incredibly stupid legislation. If it goes through it will do terrible harm and serve no one's interest.\n"

As a driver, I feel safer on roads with dedicated bike lanes than sharing roadways. As a rider who uses a bike as his primary means of transportation in the City, my son-in-law feels safer on the dedicated main routes. Suggesting routes be moved to secondary roads that have significantly lower level of winter maintenance will kill the viability of bike transportation entirely.\nI truly believe that the City of Toronto has done their due diligence by following the data and worldwide studies before implementing bike lanes. We therefore do not need the Ontario government second guessing and vetoing the municipal government\u2019s decisions.\nSee link to CBC article on bike lane statistics\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Ottawa Ontario, this proposal is deeply concerning to not only the existing number of cyclists across the province, but to drivers as well.\nThe provincial government should not be allowed to prevent cities from building infrastructure that will benefit their own communities. Many residents across Ontario rely on bike infrastructure to safely commute in their day-to-day lives, removing vital cycling lanes would make it dangerous for cyclists and drivers alike, making it impossible to avoid conflict on the road between these 2 modes of transportation, which will lead to crashes and deaths that are preventable with proper infrastructure in place (for example; separated bike lanes).\nIf you want to reduce traffic for drivers, you MUST have convenient, safe and affordable alternatives to driving. The more people who choose to cycle, and the more infrastructure you build for them to safely commute, the less traffic you will have for those that DO want to drive a car.\nIf your concern is about traffic for drivers, and not about the safety of thousands of Ontario cyclists who either; do not want to drive a car, cannot drive a car, or cannot afford a vehicle in this economy, you are not prioritizing the health and wellbeing of Ontario residents.\nThis proposal will not benefit the province, please re-evaluate and allow all Ontario residents to decide what is best for them and their communities.\nThank you.\n"

Maybe instead of focusing on wasting money on ripping out existing infrastructure that is valuable to the city, the government should focus on actually completing transit projects that they've failed to complete on time or within budget. If the objective is to speed up car commute times, why not spend the money to improve transit in order to get cars off the road instead of destroying options? In the end, getting bikes off the road and adding more car lanes is probably just going to exacerbate the problem.\nIt's just ridiculous that the provincial government is focusing its attention on BIKE LANES on specific streets within a specific city. Not only do I think this is none of the provincial government's business but it's also outrageous given the plethora of other issues that the government can be focusing on that are 100% in their purview.\nThe Ontario PC party is just out to lunch on this. There's evidence everywhere that this is a terrible idea. We should be focusing on getting cars off the road and not adding to the problem.\n"

As the GTA continues to grow it\u2019s infrastructure needs to develop with a wide range of transport options. the goal of limiting bike infrastructure will not only lead to more deaths on the roads but diminish the accessibility of transit including in relation to the TTC. Many Torontonians use bikes to access the subway, their immediate destination or workplace. Removing desirable infrastructure for these options will simply make more people choose to drive and greatly increase the amount of vehicular traffic on Torontos roads. As a frequent biker and driver I much prefer in both instances when bikes have a designated space to be. Even more so when i drive; managing a biker who is encouraged to share a lane with me opposed to having their own designated lane is stressful and often leads to accidents. Toronto needs to be more accommodating of its diverse culture, lifestyles, and transportation needs. I wholeheartedly believe that bill 212 will INCREASE gridlock, increase the amount of time spent in cars and ultimately hinder people\u2019s happiness and livelihood. Ultimately we all want to get to work and get home safely to see our friends and families. However one chooses to do this is up to them and it is to the benefit of all if the city and province work to provide options suitable to support the population in a way that is based on traffic studies, health, environment, and proven methods of efficient and diverse mass-transportation.\n"

Hasn't it forgotten to ask the provincial government?\nThis bill is an utterly transparent attempt to distract from the province's failures to properly modernize rail and public transit infrastructure. This inability to effectively provide drivers with any alternative means to get to where they want to go is the reason the roads are clogged with motor vehicle traffic. Fortunately, the Ontario government has found yet another alternative form of transport infrastructure that they can provide less of, and even prevent cities from providing more of. Surely this will fix traffic!\nAs an Ontario resident, I am firmly against this bill. The province adding more red tape to municipal infrastructure planning is not the way to fix gridlock, and it comes at the peril of cyclists and pedestrians.
