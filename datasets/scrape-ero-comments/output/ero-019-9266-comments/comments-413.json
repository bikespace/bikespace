        "comment": "City congestion has yet to ever be addressed by adding more motor vehicle infrastructure to a city. This bill would, without a doubt, cause increased congestion as alternative means of commuting (i.e. cycling lanes) would be reduced leading to more vehicular traffic. Congestion needs to be addressed by providing better public transport infrastructure to reduce the number of vehicles on the road thereby providing a scalable solution. Increasing the number of vehicles on the road (such as by increasing the number of lanes on a road or by removing alternatives mean of transport) does not provide a scalable solution.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a terrible idea, I have lived in Toronto for more than 10 years and bike infrastructure is the best solution to traffic congestion in downtown. Since the installation of bike lanes on major roads, more commuters including myself can bike for short trips within the city instead of driving, and I can see a significant improvement to traffic on University Ave and Bloor St. Without bike lanes, tens of thousands of commuters like myself will have no choice but to drive to downtown and exacerbate the traffic. It has been proven across the world that bike infrastructure and public transportation are the only effective solution to traffic congestion in cities, and it has also been proven over and over again that adding car lanes only exacerbate the traffic due to induced demand. Leave the decision on bike infrastructure to the city and the whole province will benefit.\n"

        "comment": "This is gross overreach by the province. It also ignores all current research on efficient urban planning. A robust city infrastructure offers options for safe travel that include walking, cycling, public transit and driving. Considering that the bike lanes being suggested for removal are along the lines of the already overburdened and under maintained subway, this shows a complete lack of forethought and vision. The plan should be to connect the disjointed portions of the cycling network, which would increase its use and thereby take cars off the road, decreasing traffic. Instead, this bill proposes to waste tax payer dollars by ripping up existing infrastructure. SHAME!!!! This is ignorant, backward and selfish policy proposed by a motorist trying to preserve his own interests, not do what is best for the city! SHAME!!!\nIf the province wants to keep touting Toronto as a \"World Class City\", perhaps it should try to keep pace with the infrastructure models being used by actual word class cities instead of sticking its head in the sand.\n"

        "comment": "This is a disappointing bill. I\u2019m commenting specifically on the parts of the bill relating to bicycle lanes including the removal of some Toronto bike lanes.\nI\u2019m sure other comments will argue the benefits of protected bike lanes with respect to healthcare and the environment, so I will avoid reiterating those arguments.\nAs someone not living in a major city, I\u2019m frustrated seeing the provincial government concern itself with issues that are clearly not relevant to the province at large. The provincial government should not be intervening in matters clearly more relevant to municipalities. City streets should not be the concern of the Province.\nFrom a government supposedly concerned with cutting red tape, this bill is quite perplexing, as it seemingly adds an unneeded level of bureaucracy to what I expect is an already arduous process decided by municipal staff and locally elected leaders with significant input from the public.\nFinancially speaking, whether it\u2019s Torontonians or provincial taxpayers who foot the bill for removing those Toronto bike lanes, it seems an incredibly wasteful exercise.\nOn a different note, the majority of people, myself included, drive to work. That said, it is unjust that those without the means to drive are given no reasonable alternative in most areas of the province. This bill suggests that the provincial government has decided that ostensibly catering to those of us privileged enough to drive everywhere is more important than allowing cities to provide safer infrastructure for everyone.\nRemoving existing bike lanes and limiting future bike lanes will do nothing but force more people to drive instead of allowing cities to do the pragmatic thing and get more people out of cars to reduce traffic. This bill will increase red tape and the scope/size of the government, things not aligned with the claimed ideals of this government.\nI urge the government to reconsider this bill and the scope of their involvement in obvious municipal matters.\n"

With the cost of living rising astronomically, the government should be spending the money it makes off of us on making our cities more affordable and not wasting it to redo roads that help people on a low budget get to and from work. With the TTC facing more delays every day, bike lanes keep the citizens of Toronto moving. The option to rent a bike to bypass a subway delay becomes less efficient without direct routes on major throroughways. Drivers are not more important than the rest of us.\n"

The only trouble the bike lanes were was when they were building them! I live at Bloor and Ossington and like the bike lanes. It keeps the bikes separate from the traffic and we dont have to go around them like when they were mixed in with the traffic. There is more congestion when they are mixed in with traffic. Too many people drive cars when they could have taken ttc. In summer i worked at same location for three weeks so left tools there and took ttc. Subway and bus was faster then driving plus no parking problem! Bike lanes are good! Needless driving is congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The governance of Toronto should rest primarily with the city's mayor, allowing for autonomous decision-making free from provincial interference, particularly regarding the management of public roads. As Toronto continues to increase in density, it is imperative to expand our biking infrastructure. Many residents in high-density condominium buildings lack access to parking, with car ownership out of financial reach for some. Expecting everyone to drive in such densely populated areas is impractical.\nEnhancing the city's network of bike lanes, ensuring they are both comprehensive and secure, is crucial to encouraging cycling as a viable mode of transportation. The fear of harm from inattentive drivers, especially those in large SUVs, deters many potential cyclists, myself included. Labeling cyclists as elite is misguided; a bicycle is far more affordable than a car.\nThe province\u2019s role should focus on expediting stalled public transit projects, which can effectively address congestion issues. Furthermore, implementing roundabouts could alleviate traffic by streamlining vehicle flow compared to traditional intersections, which often result in bottlenecks from inefficient left-turn patterns.\nA city that prioritizes cycling and pedestrian pathways elevates the quality of life for its residents. The demand for walkable neighborhoods indicates a universal desire for such communities. Expanding these spaces would allow more individuals to experience the benefits of an active lifestyle, known to enhance both health and happiness. By genuinely embracing progressive urban planning, we can move beyond car-centric policies and create a vibrant, sustainable city. The province should align its efforts towards enhancing public transit infrastructure in support of this vision.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr Ford,\nI am greatly disappointed in your proposed legislative reach into the business of the city of Toronto and its 3-year plan to build bicycle infrastructure. I recently retired and bought two new quite expensive bicycles and spent much of 2024 riding Toronto for fun and fitness. The bike lanes are a valuable attraction and I suggest you and your transportation minister should try cycling them, just for kicks. You might like it. If you do, your health will undoubtedly improve as mine has! I feel great! Cycling makes distances dissolve and you will be amazed how far you can go! You might be tempted to try cycle commuting, in which case your Bloor street cycle lanes will be very convenient for your case.\nRemoving those beautifully executed lanes on University will be more expense in both time, effort, and money and such an outrageous waste of tax money that you really should be ashamed to even propose it. It is indeed much worse than that, as it seems transparently based on your own personal distaste for them and I imagine the inconvenience you perceive they cause you.  Be humble please Mr Ford.\nOntarians are your concern. All Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Hi...to who ever is going to read this. I oppose the decision of the current Ontario government to put forward legislation to undo years of meticulous research, planning and consultations to just remove bike lanes \"because they want to\".\nBike lanes are a crucial component of a sustainable urban transportation system, particularly in a dense city like Toronto. By providing dedicated infrastructure for cyclists, bike lanes encourage a shift away from car dependency, thereby alleviating traffic congestion. When individuals choose to cycle instead of driving, the number of vehicles on the road decreases, leading to smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion. Additionally, cycling is a zero-emission mode of transport, contributing significantly to lowering CO2 emissions. By promoting cycling, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and improve air quality. Furthermore, bike lanes can enhance the overall quality of life by creating more livable and pedestrian-friendly urban environments.\nBike lanes are not just a solution for the present; they are an investment in the future. As cities continue to grow and urbanize, it is imperative to create sustainable transportation systems that can accommodate increasing populations. By promoting cycling, we are fostering a healthier and more environmentally conscious generation. While it may take time for people to adjust to a cycling culture, the long-term benefits are substantial. A well-developed cycling network can encourage more people to choose cycling as their primary mode of transport, leading to reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality. Moreover, a healthier population, resulting from increased physical activity, can lead to significant economic benefits. Reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and a stronger workforce are just some of the positive outcomes associated with a cycling-friendly city.\nBike lanes are not just a trend in Toronto; they are a global movement embraced by many forward-thinking cities. Cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Utrecht have long been renowned for their extensive cycling networks. These cities have demonstrated that investing in cycling infrastructure can significantly improve urban mobility, reduce pollution, and enhance public health. By following the examples of these successful cities, Toronto can position itself as a leader in sustainable urban development.\nFor more information on the benefits of cycling infrastructure, please refer to the following resources:\nCopenhagenize Design: A global consultancy firm specializing in sustainable urban design, including cycling infrastructure: https://www.copenhagenize.eu/\nInstitute for Transportation & Development Policy (ITDP): An international non-profit organization working to build sustainable cities: https://itdp.org/\nThe World Health Organization (WHO): A specialized agency of the United Nations concerned with international public health: https://www.who.int/\nBy investing in bike lanes and creating a cycling-friendly city, Toronto can improve the quality of life for its residents, reduce environmental impact, and position itself as a global leader in sustainable urban development.\n"

        "comment": "I for one am not in support of the proposals outlined within this bill; especially the proposals focused on reducing or removing bike lanes in the City of Toronto. Firstly, the provincial government should not be adding additional red tape and bureaucracy that would slow down local municipal government\u2019s ability to provide transportation options to their constituents; especially if it is truly a conservative government that aims to reduce government spending. Secondly, as someone who lives in the suburbs of the GTA but works in the core of the City of Toronto, I value the transportation options that are available to me including using my bike or rental bikes on bike lanes to bypass automotive traffic when downtown in the city\u2019s core. I consider the bike lanes as essential transportation infrastructure\u2014like sidewalks\u2014that I and thousands of others need to work and live in the city. Thirdly, dedicated bike lanes provide a basic standard of safety for vulnerable road users like children who using bikes to get to and from school in the city, instead of just maximizing the number of cars using the road. Fourthly, having dedicated bike lanes simplifies my own driving experience when I choose to drive in the city. This infrastructure makes it clear for me as a driver where I should be and where cyclists should be; making it safer for myself and them by reducing the risk of collision where otherwise we might be in closer proximity on the road. Fifthly, bike lanes support transit usage by making it easier for me and thousands of others to get to transit stations on days where I am not inclined to drive into the city. Lastly, it is well researched that when you build car infrastructure, car usage increases to match capacity; this results in a net zero change in terms of motor vehicle traffic reduction; i.e., there will still be gridlock. Similarly, if cycling infrastructure is built it will incentivize usage; however, it will ultimately reduce the number of cars on the road as people who would otherwise drive and cause motor vehicle congestion would start to use bikes. In conclusion, should these proposals be passed into law and come into effect, it is my view that progress in regards to transportation options and infrastructure will be not only reduced but reverted back by a decade in the province of Ontario. These proposals ultimately reduce the transportation choices citizens have, depriving us of alternate means for moving around the city.\n"

        "comment": "Hello ERO,\nI try to bike as much as I can so I don't get stuck in traffic either when driving or on the bus. I can tell you that biking is significantly faster than driving. I go past so many cars that are in queue at the red light or waiting for a car in front trying to make a left turn. When I order delivery, the delivery person that are on bicycles are significantly faster than those in cars as well.\nI would like to bike more, and get around faster. But the lack of bike infrastructure prevents me from doing so - I don't feel safe without safe biking infrastructure. The name of this bill is completely misleading and false - if bike lanes are removed, I am forced to be in a car or in the bus, which will be stuck in gridlock. And as I said, is going to be much slower. I am deeply disappointed that this bill was introduced in the first place and request that it be rescinded.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212 and I want to go over why.\nI am a resident of Toronto and regular cyclist, using the bike lane infrastructure for work, picking up packages, visiting friends, and for exercise. I think the parts of Bill 212 that aims to remove bike lanes is bad for Toronto.\nI think over the summer, citizens agree that the city has reached a breaking point for traffic. The long term solution to this is not to increase the number of car lanes, but to decrease the number of cars, or at least keep the number of cars the same. But how do you do that in a city where the population is growing? Making bicycling a safe and attractive option is part of the solution (along with better public transit). Citizens like me will choose to bike because it is a cheaper, faster alternative to driving. This decreases the number of cars therefore helping to alleviate car traffic. While increasing the number of car lanes might increase the flow of traffic for a short term, the traffic in a growing city will certainly increase in a few years due to induced demand. Look at Highway 401 as an example.\nThe reason some bikes lanes are not fully utilized is because the network is young. Newer parts of the bike network \u2014 such as Bloor West \u2014 are not connected to many other bike lanes in their vicinity. The stretches of Bloor near the city center have more bike traffic because it is connected to a more developed bike lane network. Bloor West will see similar levels of bike traffic once the bike network is more developed in that area.\nCritics of bike lanes are using a circular argument. The reason we don't see more bicyclists is because there is not enough bike infrastructure. But critics are then saying we should remove bike infrastructure because there are not enough bicyclists.\nA lot of these points are discussed better in a YouTube video in the channel \"Oh The Urbanity!\" titled \"I Can\u2019t Believe I Have to Make This Video\". I'll attached it to this document.\n"
