It's time to get on with construction of transportation infrastructure, using the studies, data and permits that are already available to municipalities and have been for more than a century. The regulations on bike lanes are both unnecessary and ignorant of this provincial government, betraying the premier's ongoing emotional attachment to a failed mayoral race.\n"

        "comment": "This is entirely backwards and severe overreach from the provincial government into municipal matters.\nRegardless of the data that proves that safe bike lanes REDUCE traffic, limiting safe bicycling access to places people want to go will only increase traffic. I will be using Uber to get to destinations I usually biked to, adding yet another car onto the roads. And when I do bike on roads without lanes, I will take the entire lane as afforded to me under the highway traffic act. At the 25km/h max that BikeShare bicycles can travel, I assure you that will have a far greater impact on traffic than the current bike lanes ever hypothetically did.\nI very much encourage our minister of transportation to invest in and use the GO train service to get to Queen\u2019s Park. It will allow him to get work done on his way to the office or even catch up on a TV show instead of getting stressed out in traffic.\n"

Said to be \u201cevidence driven\u201d when every study on the matter shows bike lanes as a net good and the only thing the minister of transportation can trot out contrary is some weak anecdotes. Hospitals are under funded, welfare programs too and this is what you are spending time on?\nThe only thing this legislation will accomplish for me is make my day-to-day life more dangerous (so you can save a few minutes on your commute). I have been politically lethargic but if this passed I will campaign energetically against the party putting this into action\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an overreach into local governance and risks undermining efforts to make streets safer and more efficient. In an increasingly dense city like Toronto, biking is not only essential for transportation but also beneficial for the environment and public safety. Cyclists should have the right to access major streets without risk of cycling-related injuries and deaths, which occur when bikelanes are not present.\nToronto's Bikeshare usage has skyrocketed from 665,000 trips in 2019 to 5.7 million in 2023\u2014a growth of over 750%. That represents 5.7 million fewer cars on the road. Without safe infrastructure like bike lanes, people will be deterred from cycling and instead turn to driving, which will only add more congestion to already crowded streets.\nWell-designed bike lanes can ease congestion by offering safe, sustainable alternatives to driving. Municipal governments, being closest to their communities, are in the best position to assess local needs and should retain the authority to implement infrastructure that serves their residents.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI am an occasional cyclist in Toronto. I take advantage of the Bike Share program and I ride carefully on bike lanes to get to appointments, work, and fun. A few months ago a car parked in a bike lane, and when I went around it I was doored and broke my wrist. It has affected my life since, as I have been recovering from my surgery. I am also an occasional driver, borrowing a car for work, getting groceries, and more.\nI OPPOSE this bill, we need bike lanes. As a cyclist I feel safer having cycling infrastructure. It feels great to cycle in bike lanes to get everything I need done, and it's sometimes faster than transit.\nAs a driver I like driving down streets with bike lanes because I know I do not need to be afraid that I will hit a cyclist with my car. They are in their lane and I am in mine. When I drive on streets without bike lanes I sometimes get slowed down by cyclists because I cannot safety pass, usually because there is a row of parked cars on either side of the road.\nThe number one thing affecting traffic is cars! Cars, illegally parked cars and drivers acting carelessly. Cars that block the \"box\" as it was. I see this every single day as a driver, cyclist and pedestrian. I am frequently almost mowed down by cars that refuse to stop at pedestrian stop signals. What are we doing to combat this problem? Why aren't we ticketing bad drivers? Ontario has become lawless in it's driver enforcement. Frequently cars block intersections and then everyone is stuck.\nDo not remove bike lanes, we absolutely need them for everyone's safety. Build more. Encourage more cycling, less driving, remove cars from the streets and traffic will improve.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This is extreme government overreach and one that is devoid of logic or concern for the citizens that use and pay for their cities' infrastructure.\nDeveloping complete streets includes input from traffic and safety engineers that focuses on controlled movement of ALL road users and putting bikes into the car lanes will only increase 1) injuries and 2) gridlock. The cyclists will continue to use the roads and now will be more likely to ride slowly between cars, impeding the flow of traffic.\nAlso, why is the provincial government spending dollars and time on municipal issues - focus on the issues we need - healthcare, education, and housing.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford\u2019s Deperate Attempt to Pit Cars against Bikes.\nI disagree with this proposal in the strongest possible way. Bike lanes help ease congestion, their existence does not add to it.\nWhat causes congestion is trying to move people, one or two at a time, in personal motor vehicles - which are around the footprint of a queen sized bed. It\u2019s not hard to understand: when you try to move everyone around in their own personal queenside bed, you get congested streets . These bloated vehicles ( and their already existing domination on our streets) are what clog up urban streets\u2026 taking back a bike lane does nothing to help with this.  Not to mention the issues with storing these personal motors vehicles. Think you need an extra lane for car traffic ( you don\u2019t, but for arguments sake) why don\u2019t you start with removing all on street parking for cars? Think about the benefit of not having half a dozen stationary queen size beds taking up a lane every block?\nAlso, without safe infrastructure to move around the city in - how are people who currently travel by bike meant to get around? Oh that\u2019s right, they\u2019ll switch to using a queen size bed vehicle themselves. So your solution to reduce congestion is to \u2026add more drivers?\nAnd what proof do you have that this is a sensible course of action? What studies have been done? Or is this just a catchy title to try and fool people.\nI\u2019m going to stop here. It\u2019s hard to respond to this proposal because it\u2019s so idiotic.\nOf course it\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be the provincial government\u2019s decision to rule on something to do with municipal movement of people. This is clearly a thinly veiled attempt of the premier to stoke culture war conversations instead of trying to solve actual issues ( and yes, congestion is an actual issue).\nAs someone who uses a car, public transit, and occasionally cycles, this is abhorrent. And a huge waste of government resources even talking about it.\nThe only positive is to show what an ineffective leader Doug Ford is.\n"

I do own a car, I just don't want to use it for short day-to-day trips.\nAdditionally, my teenage children are not old enough to drive so their bicycles are their main option for traveling. I would like to give my children their independence and not be their full time taxi driver. Having children cycling in the same lanes as the motorists is an incredibly dangerous idea.\n"

I use it to get to and from work, to pick up groceries or visit friends, etc.\nHaving bike lanes has been essential to make this a viable option, and having a direct path through main arterial routes saves me time and helps me get through the city safely.\nI wear a helmet, use safety lights, use hand signals and obey road rules. Despite this, every day I have close calls with drivers who don't check their side mirrors, run red lights, fail to indicate, etc.\nIf bike lanes are removed, I will continue to bike and instead I'll have to bike within car lanes. It's a risk to myself, and I imagine drivers will get fed up and make unsafe manoeuvres due to impatience in trying to get around me. Overall it'll be a bad scene that will not deliver drivers the outcome they're looking for, and removing these lanes that have been created after extensive data and consultation is a massive waste of taxpayer money.\nPlease put the money into healthcare or homelessness instead.\nThanks\n"

Anything that encourages more drivers leads to more traffic.\nThe only way to decrease gridlock is to give people viable alternatives to driving which means MORE bike lanes not fewer. And don\u2019t get me started with this fiscally irresponsible idea of ripping up already finished infrastructure. Maybe take that money and use it to fund transit and build denser mixed use neighbourhoods so people don\u2019t have to drive.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation would results in needless costs in removing already substantial roadworks, e.g. the bike lanes on University Ave and Bloor Street. Instead of spending the budget on this there are many pressing needs including healthcare and education that would deserve the funds more. This legislation would also result in more cars on the road, leading to more gridlock, pollution, and wear and tear on our public infrastructure. Additionally, this legislation would put vulnerable road users at risk, such as wheelchair users, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. who will be more likely to be in conflict with vehicles since more will be on the road and there will be more space given to them. This legislation distracts from the fact that the way to get more people moving faster is through mass public transit, as well as through having more options for alternative transportation such as walking, biking, scootering, etc.\n"

Like any other rational decisions that governments make this issue should be based on studies and data not on politicians placating to their constituents in order to buy votes. Do we really want to be the only major city in the world that is going in completely the opposite direction of everyone else? Not only do bike lanes help to decrease travel times for everyone, they also promote a healthier population which in turn lowers healthcare costs.
