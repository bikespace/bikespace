        "comment": "This proposal is thoughtless, enraging, and a waste of time. Listen to the many experts providing so much data showing that bike lanes aren\u2019t the problem and in fact are an important part of the solution. Leave our bike lanes alone! My husband bikes our kids on those lanes constantly and this allows us not to own a car despite being a family of 4 in midtown Toronto - living in a city where it\u2019s possible to not own a car is a real way to reduce traffic congestion. Every bike that leaves the road because you make it unsafe is another car that will fill so much more space. Every bike lane we add and connect makes it so much safer for residents to leave a car at home and make it possible for those that need to drive to have the space to drive. Shame on you!\n"

        "comment": "Riding a bike contributes to reducing carbon footprint, keeping self healthy, saving money, and getting to work and practice on time.  If the Ford government removes bike lanes on direct routes i.e. Yonge, Bloor, etc. he is adding to the congestion of traffic and pollution as more people will decide to drive cars. I feel that the Ford government is in my opinion single-handedly adding to environmental toxins by encouraging more cars on the roads and not coming up with alternatives. I am fed up. No wonder he looks so overweight and out of shape. I am guessing he would drive to the corner store versus walking 15 minutes. Ford has children - does he not care about what he is doing to their and their children's environment - too bad there is no evidence of conscience. Ford government is for rich guys - never fool yourselves - it does not care for the survival of all classes\n"

        "comment": "Instead of making roads more dangerous for everybody and giving the middle finger to low-income individuals (while also not improving traffic by your own standards). Why don't you remove the red tape around zoning laws so that people can finally live and work close to eachother, meaning they don't need to travel these huge distances all the time? That'd have a far better impact on travel times, while also making our neighbourhoods able to deliver services more cost effectively.\nAnd before you come out with your usual \"people don't want to live near 'x' houses\" nonsense, why don't you let the free market decide that instead of catering to your developer buddies?\n"

Even if this proposal would slightly speed up traffic (which it won't by the way), you think that's worth human lives? How many exactly are you willing to sacrifice?\nFor another, why are we spending more money to remove bike lanes that we just spent money to put in? Financially conservative, eh? It's a joke.\nFinally, this is a municipal issue. Respectfully, stay in your lane and leave the lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "Our provincial leaders need to understand that gridlock occurs because there are too many cars on the streets.  People without options for affordable and accessible alternatives to driving a vehicle contribute to gridlock.  Your focus needs to be on improving public transport and access to safe bicycle options.  Removing bicycle lanes is not a long term solution.  Planners from the ministry of transportation need to travel outside Ontario and the US to see how European cities and indeed Canadian cities such as Victoria BC have successfully used public transportation, safe cycling routes and walkable cities to reduce car use and subsequent pollution.  Stop imposing car use on us.  We want a government to be forward thinking and progressive.  The provincial government also needs to support governance by cities and municipalities not strong arm them.  Please consider being responsible to long term planning that supports fewer cars and more public transport, cycling and walking.\n"

We need two roads on north south and east west to have bike lanes that\u2019s it. But they have to be protected.\nSpeeding up Gardiner construction, coordinating construction solves traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes doesn\u2019t solve the traffic issue.\nMore transit and disincentivizing driving.\n4 cars equals the same space as 1 bus but the bus moves 10x the people.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes in Toronto.\nThe Ford government argues that it is \u201ccommon sense\u201d to do so since most people drive.\nWhy do most people drive? Because for the last several decades there has only been investment in roads for cars and no investment in cycling infrastructure. Of course people don\u2019t ride their bikes in the city; they don\u2019t feel safe to do so, and indeed many cyclists have been killed as a result. So it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: lack of investment in cycling infrastructure leads to few cyclists and many drivers. So it is circular logic to say that we need more roads because most people drive.\nWhile the \u201ccommon sense\u201d argument seems to reflect the reality at face value, the actual reality is more complicated. To understand the true reality one needs data and rigourous study. Have bike cleans truly contributed to gridlock? Experts would argue that in fact that is not the case. Gridlock is common where there are no bike lanes. Cars take up so much space and the population is so large that driving is one of the most inefficient uses of space.\nAnd according to a study, the Yonge Street bike lane increased commute times for drivers by only 90 seconds.\nLook at other cities that have developed cycling infrastructure like Amsterdam or Copenhagen. Gridlock is in fact, far less common than here.\nAnd commute times are not the only variable to look at. What about safety of cyclists, what about improving air quality and combatting climate change? Cycling is healthy for people and the environment.\nRipping up bike lanes will not solve the gridlock problem and will only make the quality of life worse for residents of Toronto.\nUse evidence to make decisions, not \u201ccommon sense \u201cwhich is based on false assumptions.\n"

        "comment": "A bicycle takes less space on the road than a car. The more people who choose to bike, the fewer people who will drive, making overall more space on the road. Taking away bike lanes will make traffic worse, because it makes biking less safe and people will choose to drive instead. If the goal is to reduce traffic for cars, you need more bike lanes, not less. This whole bill is just a performance, and it will make life worse for everyone in Ontario, bicyclists and drivers alike.\n"

Bike lanes make it safe for us to get to work, school and summer camps. Cyclists die on the roads; a woman was killed in front of my office a month ago because a bike lane was blocked. The driver's life was ruined too. It's better with bike lanes for bikes AND cars.\n"

There's not much cycling that goes on here apart from when the weathers nice, but there's no lanes for that we just ride on the road. Scott Aitchison is our MP for Parry Sound - Muskoka.\nThis bill is just pointless meddling in municipal affairs that is going to cost all taxpayers money whilst you rip up bike lanes that are already installed. Meanwhile the roads round my way need patching and its crickets. There are more important issues that you are not dealing with.\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible and unsafe policy that will kill and maim people. My best friend was killed biking on a main street without a bike lane. She was only 23 years old. Six cyclists have died this year, including a 24 year old on Bloor Street because construction blocked her bike lane. A pregnant woman died crossing the road this summer and a 46 year old woman was killed on the sidewalk after a car hopped the curb. I\u2019m worried who will be next. None of these deaths were caused by bikes.  We need safer streets. We need slower streets. We need more commute options. We need better transit.\nBiking is the most efficient around the city and we should be encouraging more people to bike to reduce the number of cars of the roads. You are the traffic. You have the potential to kill our loved ones. This is a waste of money to gain 5 minutes of time when you\u2019re taking years away from lives lost.\n"

In addition, near my home, on the section of Hungtingwood Road from Worden to Kennedy, I don't understand why a new permanent roadblock has been added that has made a previously spacious lane very narrow and poses a significant danger at night. I am also concerned that these newly opened permanent roadblocks will cause difficulties in snow removal and driving during winter rainy and snowy weather.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is an awful idea. They make traffic flow better, removing them will slow things down for everyone.  They also make cyclists safer when drivers of cars respect the bike lanes, and that respect should be enforced by police. The expense of removing the lanes will be huge and that money should instead be spent on social services. Use our money to pay for housing and food!! I should not have to donate to a food bank so that people in my city can eat, the government should pay for that. Stop making stupid decisions like tearing up bike lanes, and put money where it will actually help the people who need it.\n"
