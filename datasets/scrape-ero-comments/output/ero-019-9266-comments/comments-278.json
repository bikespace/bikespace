        "comment": "This bill is incredibly regressive and puts cyclists at risk. To reduce gridlock, a strategy that incorporates several different modes of transportation is required.  As a Toronto taxpayer, you are wasting our tax dollars by ripping up already installed infrastructure.  This is a significant over reach- stay in your own lane Ford.\n"

        "comment": "For a government who claims to focus on reducing excess spending, I believe that spending money on removing bike lanes that were just put in is a huge excess.\nIf there truly is a concern regarding traffic, why is a study not being conducted to observe what the changes in habits are? Why is the provincial government so focused on one municipality, when there are multiple regions whom can also use the money being allocated to removing something that has barely been in use?\nI am extremely frustrated and disappointed in the Ford government for proposing such a Bill that is clearly is biased towards one municipality and serves as a waste to provincial funds.\n"

        "comment": "This feels like a huge step backward. It is a given in urban planning that adding more lanes just leads to more lanes being filled by cars. Removing the bike lanes will makes things more dangerous for those choosing not to clog the lanes with their cars, will make it more difficult to commute, and won't solve the problem. I'm very disappointed with this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "The idea that recovering a lane on Yonge, Bloor and University is going to improve gridlock is quite frankly laughable. Traffic flow AND public transit infrastructure and active transportation infrastructure needs will just increase with immigration. The amount of construction, and the presence of trucks on downtown roads has to be factored in as well \u2014 what are we doing about that?  Thousands of people who bike on those lanes every day (including many who have to make a living riding a bike or mobility device on delivery services) will be pushed into competing with cars on the roads resulting in higher numbers of injury and accidental death. We already have enough cyclists injured and killed every year by drivers of cars. This law is irresponsible and will NOT achieve Mr. Ford\u2019s objectives.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against removing bike lanes in these areas of Toronto\nBike lanes have significantly reduced my commute time (by bike and vehicle), not increased\nWhen there is no bike lane available, cyclists have fewer options to get from point A to B and have to use the road, thereby slowing down traffic significantly (<20km/h).  When there is a protected bike lane, cyclist safety is improved and flow of traffic improves as well.\nOverall, bike lanes have improved my experience of the city - please don\u2019t get rid of them\n"

        "comment": "This proposal moves Ontario backwards. Studies into the effectiveness of various interventions on commute times, including those commissioned by this government, indicate that we need to be doing the exact opposite of this bill.\nWe need more bike lanes. We need more transit. We need commuter trains with routes and schedules that are viable both within and between our cities and towns. We need to give people options that are better than their cars, to reduce the number of cars on the road. It will improve traffic for those who have to drive, and it will improve quality of life and reduce commute times for those who will then be able to commute conveniently via bike or transit.\nWe do not need more highways. We do not need more car lanes. Adding them will not improve gridlock. Remove parking in traffic lanes if we must implement an immediate change - it will be faster, cheaper, and reduce gridlock more than tearing out recently constructed bike lanes.\nEven if we do add highways, it requires full environmental assessment to mitigate potential irreparable harm to our environment.\nThese issues are not novel to Ontario. We have a multitude of other countries to study who have dealt with these issues already. The actions we need to take to address gridlock are clear, and they are the opposite of what is being proposed here.\n"

        "comment": "It is very disappointing to see that the Ford government is wasting time meddling in municipal affairs. The Ford government should be focusing on healthcare, housing, and education for Ontarians, but instead they are spending their time on something that is handled by municipal governments. It is ironic that the Ford government recently introduced the Ministry of Red Tape Reduction and this bill will only increase \"red tape\" since it is seeks to add a layer of approvals to adding new bike lanes. As someone that doesn't live in Toronto, I feel like the Ford government is focusing on municipal affairs of Toronto and ignoring the needs of the rest of the province.\nIn addition to this bill being a poor use of the Ford government's time, I believe this bill will put the lives of cyclists at risk and not reduce driving times by any reasonable amount.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is frustratingly backward, it is plainly ideological policy.\nThe ideas put forward are not evidence based, in fact these measure are the opposite of transportation experts say will reduce gridlock.\nMore highways and less bike lanes will not reduce gridlock.\nAs a person who often drives a car, walks, and cycles to get around, I am concerned about the implication to safety of this legislation for those outside of cars. I'm concerned about the induced demand and increased car traffic, and about the increased cost and red tape required for municipalities to plan and maintain their transportation networks.\nOne would hope that a policy that is costly, increases bureaucracy, impedes on local decision making, reduces safety, reduces transportation choices, and increases travel times would not be under consideration. Again, this bill is incredibly disappointing.\nThe lunacy of reducing environment requirement to build highway 413, a costly highway that transportation experts say will reduce travel times by less than a minute but will cost billions of dollars and eat up some of the most productive farmland in Canada, is also hard to understand. Environmental studies have many practical aspects, like assessing flood risks, and this work should not be compromised in favour of expediency.\nI would implore our provincial representatives to strive to support legislation that adds choice instead of taking it away, makes transportation networks safer for everyone, allows local decision makers to plan and enact plans that reflect the needs of their entire communities (not just the wealthy), and to safe guard farmland, headwaters and groundwater recharge areas.\nIn short, please do not allow this bill to pass.\n"

        "comment": "This is an incredible waste of taxpayer money. These lanes are already heavily used and only recently installed. This is outrageous overreach by the provincial government and does absolutely nothing to reduce congestion in Toronto, as research clearly shows. If the Province were serious about congestion in major cities it would reduce on-street parking on major roads, provide funding for MORE bike lanes and more transit opportunities that aren't cars. That's the way to reduce congestion - fewer cars, not fewer bikes.\n"

License e-bikes and e-scooters; require they wear helmets and have front/rear lights\n5. Demand manufacturers make door sensing technology mandatory on all new vehicles starting 2026 in Ontario (e.e. door won\u2019t open is vehicle senses approaching cyclist)\n"

I also own a car and drive for most trips other than my daily commute.\nBike lanes are crucial to safety for cyclists in the city. Twice in the past year, I have had to be a witness for the police after seeing cyclists get hit by cars. In one case, the cyclist had to be taken away in an ambulance. I worry for my safety if we get rid of bike lanes.\nPeople will die.\n"
