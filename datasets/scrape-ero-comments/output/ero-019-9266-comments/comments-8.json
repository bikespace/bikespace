A more effective solution would be removing street parking on those streets and giving those lanes back to traffic. Bike lanes take cars off the road by providing an alternative path of transport.

I would vote for parties/candidates who advocate for bicycle infrastructure.\nOn a personal level, I sold my car and bought a bike for commuting to work. I did this for climate crisis reasons and I believe that more bicyclists (who need safe infrastructure) will result in less gridlock for drivers.\nI live in Toronto. My ideal for Toronto is for us to be a bike-friendly city. This will a generally higher quality of living. Any provincial limits on bike lanes (or worse, removing bike lanes) will be horrible for general quality of life, and frankly, an embarrassment as the world evolves to fewer combustion engines. Bike lanes are considered progressive, dynamic and thoughtful. Car lanes symbolize lack of vision and climate crisis denial.\nThank you,\nMarco\n"

Please for just one minute act as serious as the position you are all in should demand. This will do nothing to solve congestion, in fact likely make it worse, and you all know it.

Finally, Ontarians should have the freedom to choose the right transportation method for the - the government shouldn't be telling me how to get from point A to point B.

        "comment": "The proposal to remove or restrict bikelanes is foolish for a number of reasons, all backed by years of research data. I will list the reasons I vehemently oppose the province meddling in municipal affairs.\n1. Removal will result in two things: cyclists will either take convoluted, inefficient routes, or they'll take the route which previously had a bikelane and now does not, increasing the likelihood of collision with motor vehicles/injury, death. With this bill the government is telling cyclists it either doesn't care about their time, or doesn't care about their life.\n2. This is a waste of provincial time and resources. Why is someone in Timmins paying to remove bike lanes in Ottawa or Toronto? This also strips municipalities of what little autonomy they still have.\n3. Only a Communist would support an ideological, centralized government making top-down, broad-stroke decisions for individual communities.\n4. Never before anywhere in the world at any time in history did a bike lane contribute to congestion. Sprawl, poor mass transit, and unsafe cycling infrastructure all contribute massively, however.\n5. This is the opposite of conservatism. I am a conservative which is why I not only support protected bike lanes, but am a cyclist myself. Bike lanes are incredibly cheap to build compared to other infrastructure, and cyclists cost the public the least in terms of infrastructure maintenance. Cycling is the most efficient form of transportation in terms of people moved and space needed. Cycling is the most inexpensive form or transportation, and cyclists are able to reroute or detour or take paths one simply cannot do in a motor vehicle (more freedom cycling). Cycling and protected bikelanes are all perfect examples of conservatism: community autonomy, self-sufficiency, cost effectiveness, value for dollar, freedom.\n"

I am strongly against the removal of any bike lanes.\n- Bike lanes protect cyclists. They save the lives of people like me. Without bike lanes, I would have to ride unprotected on the street alongside cars, buses, streetcars and trucks.\n- We can't keep funnelling more cars into the city. The geometry and the physics don't make sense. Cars take up too much space on the road and for parking. We need to focus on more space-efficient ways to move people through the city.\n- If you are concerned about opening up more lanes to moving vehicles, I'd urge you to remove on-street parking instead. Using valuable road space for on-street parking on some of our busiest streets is absurd to me. Parallel parking stops the flow of traffic for everyone \u2013\u00a0cars, cyclists, streetcars, buses.\nWhile I understand the frustrations of congestion in the city, I am urging the provincial government to focus on  getting the much delayed transit projects finished instead, rather than using bike lanes as the scape goat.\n"

This bill will do nothing to ease congestion and will likely lead to increased congestion as people who would\u2019ve otherwise rode their bike will now be sitting in their car causing more traffic. In what world does forcing people to drive for every trip they make reduce congestion? I know that critical thinking is one of Doug\u2019s many knowledge gaps but surely there is someone in Queens Park who can talk some sense into the people who want to continue down the road of forcing people to drive.\n"

        "comment": "I am all in favour of cautious planning when it comes to sharing roads. There is a much bigger problem than the loss of driving lanes to make way for bike lanes though, and this proposal will not address that. Currently, a large number of cyclists, e-scooter riders, and other types of mobility devices move between driving lanes, cycling lanes, and sidewalks based on which will allow them to move faster. This is a danger to themselves, motor vehicle drivers, and most importantly, pedestrians. Many of the cyclists and e-scooter riders aren't helmeted, which increases the danger.\nCycling routes should be everywhere and if they aren't on key driving arteries, they should be very close by and there should be enough lanes that riders don't feel they need to risk the multi-lane high-traffic roads or go far out of their way.\nIf cyclists and e-scooter riders were expected to register their vehicles (I'm old enough to remember having to do that when I was a child) AND wear helmets AND they faced real fines, etc... for infractions, I think that we would see a much safer and better commute for everyone.\nThis isn't a heads-or-tails situation. But unless the government also addresses the lack of regulations and safety around current cycling and scootering habits, all the lane changes in the world aren't going to make much of a difference because riders - unsafe and in a rush - will simply use the roads w/out the dedicated lanes and weave in and out at will.\n"

The idea that bike lanes increase traffic/congestion is empirically incorrect and has been well & thoroughly debunked by professionals, so I won't get into it too much here - if you take but a few moments to think it through all by your big self, it's quite obvious. Less cars on the road = less gridlock. Wow! It's simple. It's so so simple. Particularly in this time of climate collapse, you should be ENCOURAGING people to take car-alternatives such as safe bike lanes, transit, etc. You know what you accomplish with a bill like this? Stoking anti-cyclist rhetoric, which leads to violence (many cyclists have been /attacked/ just this month). Toronto already has an appalling road-rage issue, as well as a Terrible Driver Epidemic. Don't encourage it. Use your heads. Use your common sense. I beg of you.\n"

        "comment": "As a small-government conservative, I strongly oppose this bill because it represents unnecessary provincial overreach into municipal affairs and undermines local autonomy. Municipal governments are closest to their residents and are best equipped to make decisions about local infrastructure, including the installation of bike lanes. Forcing municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes adds layers of bureaucracy, delays, and inefficiency to a process that should be handled at the community level.\nThe bill also places an undue burden on municipalities by requiring them to submit extensive data and information about existing bike lanes, with the threat of provincial intervention if they don\u2019t comply. This not only diverts valuable municipal resources away from essential services but also assumes that the province knows better than local governments about how to manage traffic and transportation needs.\nIn addition, the one-size-fits-all criteria for bike lane approval fail to recognize the diverse needs and priorities of Ontario\u2019s municipalities. Urban centers like Toronto and smaller communities face very different traffic patterns, geography, and transportation needs. Imposing provincial standards will likely result in rules that do not suit the unique circumstances of each community, making it harder for municipalities to address gridlock and improve transportation efficiency on their own terms.\nFurthermore, this bill could stifle innovation in transportation planning. Bike lanes can be a vital part of reducing congestion and promoting environmentally friendly commuting options. Municipalities should be free to experiment with and implement solutions that work for their specific contexts without unnecessary interference from the province.\nAt its core, this bill is an example of top-down governance that centralizes decision-making in Queen\u2019s Park, rather than empowering municipalities to take care of their own communities. A better approach would be to allow municipalities the freedom to make infrastructure decisions while offering support and guidance when requested\u2014not mandating it from above. This would respect the principle of local control, reduce bureaucratic red tape, and allow for more efficient transportation solutions tailored to the needs of Ontario's diverse regions.\n"

It will inevitably result in injuries and deaths that would be entirely preventable.\nMy primary method of transportation to work, grocery shopping, and recreational activities is via bike or, on the few days a year where it is unsafe to bike (and probably drive a private passenger vehicle), I take the TTC.\nMy wife and I do not own a car. This is not because we cannot afford it. Our household income puts us in the top 5% in Canada. It is a choice. A choice made possible by the infrastructure currently in place. I regularly travel along the Bloor, Danforth, and University bike lanes.\nI stop at shops along the way. I visit my friends across the entire city. I invest in the local economy. I can only do this because of the cycling infrastructure that has been put in place over the last several years. This infrastructure has created a safe and reliable method for myself, and others, to support small businesses in our neighbourhood and the surrounding areas. If there is no safe infrastructure, I will not go there. Or if I go there, I will go there in a car. A car that would previously have not been on the road. I will be adding to the traffic you are seeking to reduce.\nIf the bike lanes are removed, there will be injuries. People will die. I know this from my experience as a personal injury lawyer and from my own \"near misses\" on roads without appropriate infrastructure. I have seen what happens when drivers fail to \"share the road\". I have seen the burden it places on our healthcare system. On the lost economic input because the victims can no longer work.\nThere have been six cycling deaths in Toronto this year already. There will be more. You can help prevent them. Studies repeatedly prove that bike lanes reduce all forms of traffic conflicts: https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/05/29/protect-yourself-separated-bike-\u2026\nPlease reconsider this course of action. This legislation is short sighted. It is not supported by evidence, or common sense. It does not reduce red tape. It will actively hurt Ontario residents, and my community.\n"
