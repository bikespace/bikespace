Don't tell cities how to run their streets! And what a waste of taxpayer money to build something, then tear it out! This reflects horribly on the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed law is cynical, wrong-headed and utterly disappointing. Cyclists are also citizens who have places to go. Cyclists don\u2019t just want to get to their destination in a way that doesn\u2019t cost them time, they also want to there in a way that doesn\u2019t cost them their lives.\nIf saving time by reducing congestion is the goal, encouraging cycling by creating a comprehensive network of separated, protected bike lanes is an evidence-supported solution. All this law will do is keep more drivers on the road, making conditions worse for all road users, while endangering cyclists and slowing down traffic by pushing them into car lanes.\n"

As someone who both cycles and drives, we should not be encouraging more driving with more highways and wider roads and should instead be investing in green forward infrastructure such as transit that works and cycling lanes. This government is taking us backwards and should not have the power to reverse the progress we\u2019ve made in recent years. Especially during a climate crisis.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a Torontonian, a motorist & pedestrian, and occasional TTC user. I stopped cycling about 10 years ago, after two friends died on their bikes in city traffic--one hit by  a drunk driver on a road with no bike lane, and the other hit making a turn on his bike on a stree with no bike lane. These were athletic men in the prime of life, much more experienced cyclists than I. Both wore helmets. Both left behind friends, families, and giant, unfillable holes in many lives and communities with their absence.\nWhen I commute to & from work 3 days a week, I drive mostly on streets with bike lanes. I notice absolutely no difference in commuting on a street with a bike lane and a street with one lane to drive in and one lane to park in, which is most of downtown (even between 7-9am and 4-6pm, when parked cars are supposed to be cleared out). Driving in Toronto is often an exercise in patience, and quite frankly, the endless shell game of construction--so little of it inspiring projects undertaken in the public interest, mostly condos condos condos--disrupts my route with MUCH more frequency than a bike lane ever could.\nI want to live in a city that cares about its citizens and their future. Bike lanes make commuting safer and lighter on the environment. They don't eliminate risk, but nothing will. All of the studies I've ever read show that traffic will fill all the space you give it, and that more lanes do not result in higher speeds. All of the streets in Toronto without bike lanes now will attest to this.\nI can't bring my friends back, but I can try and speak up, given the opportunity now, to unequivocally ask for NO removal of ANY bike lanes in my city or province. Thank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with Bill 212 for the following reasons:\n-> It is not evidenced based. More lanes doesn't alleviate congestion, it only leads to more cars on the road. Bike lanes save lives.  Modern cities like Paris, New York, London all have extensive bike lanes and have also made major improvements on congestion.\n-> It is the wrong remedy: The root cause of congestion is systematic under investment in public transit. We need scarce provincial funding to bolster public transit.\n-> Sovereignty -> voters in other parts of the province, who live in rural areas and areas outside of Toronto should not have a say in municipal affairs.\nFor all these reasons I strongly strongly strongly oppose Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous. Bike lanes contribute to safer transportation methods and DECREASE traffic as more and more people choose the option of active transportation. If you remove bike lanes, all that you do is reduce the possibility of people choosing alternate forms of transit and everyone goes back to cars. What's idiotic is that THAT will increase traffic and gridlock in Toronto, not decrease it. Toronto and Ontario as a whole NEED more bike lanes, buses, trains, subways, and other forms of public transit. Toronto and Ontario are not a map of highways but full communities which should be people-focused not car-focused. You are not solving the issues of traffic congestion by taking away alternate options from people.\nI cannot stress this enough - more SAFE AND AVAILABLE bike lanes will encourage people to CHOOSE biking over driving. The best way to reduce traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road!!\n"

        "comment": "I believe this bill is a massive overreach of provincial jurisdiction. Doug Ford and the provincial government should be far more concerned about building housing (don\u2019t think that we didn\u2019t see that the provincial government missed its target of 1.5M homes built), fixing the healthcare system instead of crippling it, and on actually improving infrastructure for rural and northern communities. Instead of antagonizing a city that desperately needs actual evidence based ways to improve congestion \u2014 which time and time again research has shown is improving bicycle infrastructure and more robust public transit options.\nBike lanes are not only better for traffic by providing people with alternate modes of transportation, they also take cyclists out of dangerous situations. This will just put more people in harms way. We cannot have a thriving, vibrant city if we do not move away from being so car centric.\nFinally, the most confounding part of this legislation is that the conservative government is proposing using additional taxpayer dollars to remove infrastructure that we have already paid for to put in. University Ave\u2019s bike lanes were literally just completed and now we are talking about taking them out? That is such a massive waste of taxpayer money and it is setting us back as a city. As a taxpayer living in Toronto, I am incredibly upset by this. We cannot have local infrastructure and city planning policies interfered by MPs who don\u2019t even live within the city.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is not based upon research, best practices or expert analysis on how to best reduce traffic congestion. It is an ideologically driven, cynical appeal to a certain demographic of voters in the next Provincial election.  This provincial government has abandoned urban residents, including many who choose or rely upon cycling as an option for transportation, in order to signal to suburban commuters in the vote-rich 905 belt, that they will be preferentially favoured.  We know that providing diverse transit infrastructure in urban areas, including safe bicycle infrastructure and affordable public transit, will do more to reduce traffic congestion than increasing the number of lanes to incentivize more people to drive their cars.  Main streets should not be made into expressways, at the cost of people's lives (cyclists and pedestrians killed by cars) and negative impact upon their quality of life and livability as communities, in order to facilitate a short-term temporary improvement in car travel time.  This Bill and regulation are a slap in the face to the people of Toronto, and our elected municipal government.  Leave it for municipalities to decide what transit infrastructure they want to create and maintain within their boundaries. Ford needs to stay in his own lane!\n"

        "comment": "While some of the bike lanes should be redesigned, this is a waste of taxpayer funds. Toronto has pursued densification and half of new households in the central area have no cars at all. Most of the rest have more than one commuter and only one vehicle.  I don\u2019t believe that there will be a lasting or material benefit to traffic flow and the evidence seems to favour that view.  In particular, the Bloor lanes between the Don and U of T are well used, even in poor weather.  I work nearby and it is common to see more bikes than cars at peak times.  At the end of the day, without a substitute, this will put cyclists at risk. Ideally, we could find side streets - but that has largely proven to not be practical given our geography (railways, cemeteries, etc).\n"

        "comment": "As both a driver and bike rider in the city I find your plans to rip up bike lanes we have waited years to have installed simply crazy. The idea that they are contributing to traffic is unfounded - the lanes occupied by bikes will simply become parking lanes once again. And the bikes will not go away - they will simply go back to having to weave around cars and their open doors. Dangerous. What is clear to anyone behind the wheel is that the congestion in the city is being driven by huge amounts of uncoordinated construction and lack of enforcement around gridding in intersections and a large increase in the numbers of food delivery people on e-bikes who ignore all the rules. In the downtown core where staffers have been assigned to help major intersections keep flowing, congestion has been greatly improved.\n"

Particular attention needs to be given to international studies of traffic alterations metrics after bike lane installations.\nMaking changes apart from reliable valid data doesn't help address root causes and can lead to worsening of the traffic flow problems instead of remedying them!\nOntario should not fall into the trap that Boeing Aircraft did after Boeing ignored engineers to listen to financial business people and not the process people that actually know how things work in the real world that we live in!\n"

This is obviously our premier pushing a culture war on bike lanes and the residents of Toronto to get votes from the suburbs.

The roads of this city should be made for the people who live here, not those who travel in to treat Toronto like a playground.\n"

        "comment": "In my adult life, I have relied on driving, cycling, public transit, and walking to get around Toronto. From  my perspective, the city should ensure that the roads snd sidewalks are safe  for all users, including for people of all ages  snd  abilities. The city of Toronto is striving hard to achieve that goal, including the installation of bike lanes on major streets, based on studies that justify the location of such bike lanes.\n    Although the provincial government argues that it has the authority to approve/disapprove or even remove bike lanes at its own expense, I  do not support this decision  and related portions of Bill 112. As an Ontario citizen and taxpayer, I view this as micro-management  and undermining  of the responsibilities and authority of municipal governments. It is also a huge waste of our tax dollars at a time when our public health and public education systems are being deprived of necessary funding and resources necessary  to function adequately and efficiently. Homelessness and its devastating outcomes  are also increasing.\n  Instead, the provincial government should focus on creating better policies and enriched allocation of our tax dollars for public health care,\npublic education, and addressing the real root causes and dire consequences of homelessness in Ontario.\n"
