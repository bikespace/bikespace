        "comment": "I live and work in Hamilton Ontario, I choose to bike to work. I work on site (McMaster University) three times a week and by biking, I remove a vehicle from the road and leave a parking space for someone who needs it more. The limited amount of parking and accessible parking is a constant issue on campus, as well as the city as a whole. I am also conscious of our deteriorating environment and the rapid need for society to be less reliant on fossil fuels. Removing bike lanes is a hazard to cyclists, it is environmentally irresponsible and it will cause more people to drive, creating more grid lock. I do not want to risk my life, in order to live a healthy, sustainable lifestyle in this province. The City of Hamilton Annual Collision Report - 2022 Statistics and Trends states that between 2018 and 2022 one collision occurs every 65 minutes and one collision involves a cyclist every three days. Please don\u2019t make a decision that could have me included in those statistics. Make the right choice.\n"

        "comment": "\"Saving You Time\", possibly a few minutes, but at the incredibly expensive waste of $48 million, not to mention the new de-construction road closures on those streets and the environmental waste in removal of these bike lanes.\nAre bicycles really that much of an impediment to moving around Toronto? Better that the Province of Ontario use our money to hire more doctors, build affordable housing to ensure all citizens are out of the cold, or invest in public transit. That is good public policy. I am not in favour of Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Vehicular congestion is absolutely everywhere including (and especially) where there are more cars and no bike lanes. Bicycle lanes don\u2019t cause the congestion. Politicians just need a target. Having safe bike lanes that support major downtown areas in all directions ( providing safe continuous pathways along reasonable distances) will encourage more cyclists to get out of their cars and use bicycles. I am 66 years old and have been biking in this city since I was in my 20s. I\u2019ve been hit twice by drivers in their cars, both times at intersections, long before bike lanes were even thought of. Today it\u2019s much safer biking in the designated lanes and is actually so much faster getting to my downtown destinations than driving. I\u2019m so tired of these provincial politicians wasting our tax dollars on municipal affairs. They should focus on health care, encouraging people to keep healthy and exercise, finding ways to save money for transportation which means not just keeping but expanding safe bike lanes throughout the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives. Why waste tax payer dollars that already went to putting in the bike lane just to spend more of our money ripping it out for no good reason??? Every news article I've read about bike lanes since this Ford announcement had included experts saying that bike lanes improve traffic and are a key safety feature for the infrastructure of any city. Why would a bike lane preclude a traffic lane anyway??? And why does this provincial measure seem to only affect the city of Toronto. Let Torontonians and their representatives at city council decide for themselves. This bill is ridiculous and should have no place in Queen's Park. The Ford government is clearly trying to distract the public from the rest of their record. Our memory is long. We are voting you out. Good riddance.\n"

It is a use of money that might be better put elsewhere.  It is a heavy-handed interference with the municipal government.\nI have few illusions about my ability to convince the Provincial Parliament not to pursue this course of action.

If the Provincial Parliament chooses to persist in this endeavour, please note that one more vote just went to the Liberals.\n"

Please let\u2019s not step back in time when we have so much more work to do to get world class bike lanes. Isn\u2019t that what Ontario should aim for - being a world class province?\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not benefit Ontarians, and it will not save them time.\n- To reduce car congestion, we should be investing in alternate methods of transport - this is what will reduce the number of cars on the road, by giving people better alternatives. If we remove alternate methods of transport, then people have no choice but to drive, increasing the number of cars on the road. Adding more lanes and reducing alternate options just means more people will choose to drive, which actually increases congestion.\n- The population of Toronto is continue to increase. There is a limit to how many car lanes we can add, so adding car lanes as a solution to congestion is also not a long term solution - as the population grows, if more of these people choose to drive, congestion will increase. We can prevent people from driving by investing in alternate forms of transit.\n- The province should not be overreaching into decisions that should be made by municipalities. Municipalities are best placed to make decisions about their own locales - they have the resources and the local knowledge. The province does not have the resources to look into municipal matters, this will make getting anything done more inefficient, and more expensive, which is the opposite of how an effective government should run.\n- Data shows bike lanes save lives. If we remove existing bike lanes, this will result in greater cyclist injuries and deaths. It doesn't make sense to have bikes and cars share a lane when they travel at very different speeds and are very different in their degree of vulnerability.\n- Bike lanes are also an accessibility and equity issue. Many people cannot afford cars, and biking or transit are their only means of moving through the city. Without these forms of transport, we are cutting people off from moving through the city - or adding to the time it takes to move around - the opposite of the name of the bill.\n- It is a waste of taxpayer money to remove existing, useful infrastructure. This could be better spent elsewhere - for example transit, if we want to help reduce congestion.\n- Bill 212 removes any need for an environmental assessment. This is very concerning for the future of our environment, and again is not a future thinking policy.\n- We also should not be allowing people to get kicked out of their homes for a highway, this is dangerous path to be going down.\nOverall I cannot see any data or evidence to support Bill 212 being the right move for Ontarians, and I absolutely do not support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212. It will not reduce gridlock or traffic congestion. It offloads the safety risks to cyclists and other active transportation users. Bill 212 stigmatizes, and it discriminates against people who choose these modes of transportation. This Bill leads to removing choices, and favours more costly modes of transportation and, consequently, it is inequitable as it makes it harder to choose more economical forms of transportation and counters governmental claims for making life more affordable for ordinary Ontarians.\nDecisions on local transportation issues, active transportation, pedestrian, cycling and other active transportation users' priorities and safety should be kept within the purview of the municipalities. Bill 212 is an overreach by the provincial government.\n"

Bike lines are proven to be a healthy way to move around cities and we need more emphasis on active transportation, though I understand the argument for some streets needing greater access to emergency vehicles. Also, as a daily cyclist commuter, having a separated bike lane is crucial to safety, greater education initiatives to both cyclists and drivers is important to making each better follow road rules / signs.\nRespectfully, I think you have bigger priorities, such as focusing on getting our economy moving towards more circular solutions, protecting our environment for future generations, and improving housing options for first time home buyers.\nI also want to add that I strongly do not support any other aspect of this bill, such as Highway 413. I do not support changing the rules around environmental assessments. I do not support seizure of peoples\u2019 homes for highway development.\nI appreciate you reading my correspondence and hope you are able to engage respectfully.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Your government claims that it:\n\"Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\nThe premise that new highways are needed is false. New highways induce sprawling subdivisions and car dependency, which leads to induced demand on highways which ultimately defeats the purpose of saving time and money. These facts are well documented in numerous traffic studies in all developed countries. The solution to motor vehicle congestion (which is not \u201cgridlock\u201d, the inability of vehicles to move in any direction in an urban area, a deliberate exaggeration on your part) is to build dense urban communities, not sprawl, and connect them within by local public transit and without by regional public rail transit.\nYour government claims that it:\nIs building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\nAt most, mere thousands, not \u201cmillions\u201d of drivers would use the new highway, and it is not \u201cimportant\u201d in the way that public investment in regional rail would be important. Your claims are false, based on ideology, not facts.\nYou are planning to regulate \u201cbicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. \u201c\nBICYCLES ARE TRAFFIC. The purpose of roads and streets is to move PEOPLE, not individual, single-occupant motor vehicles. Priority must be given to the efficient use of SPACE, not the efficient (and unattainable) movement of private motor vehicles. That means that public transit (e.g., buses holding dozens of people, and streetcars holding hundreds of people) must be given priority, while cyclists, using 1/12th of the space of private motor vehicles, are given the safe space they need to move. If you want to move people, not cars, public transit and cycle lanes are the OBVIOUS answer.\nYou say, \u201ca regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane and its return to a lane of traffic\u201d  \u2013 once again, I say: BICYCLES ARE TRAFFIC. They are just more efficient, and use far less space, than motor vehicles. It is simple GEOMETRY.\nYou include in your legislation an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\nand yet, you say that \u201cImplications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new and existing\u00a0cycling lanes.\u201d  The Environmental Assessment Act is the single most efficient and logical way to evaluate the effect of new and existing cycle lanes. A government that has created an EXPENSIVE MINISTRY devoted to \u201cred tape reduction\u201d should not be circumventing the Environmental Assessment Act to introduce a whole new level of bureaucratic red tape in order to implement an ideological agenda against active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes on Yonge Street and University Avenue is a regressive step that undermines Toronto\u2019s progress toward a more equitable, sustainable, and accessible urban environment. This decision, if implemented, will exacerbate transit, environmental, and urban injustices for the residents of our city, compromising the well-being of all who live, work, and travel in Toronto.\n1. Transit Injustice\nRemoving bike lanes deprives cyclists\u2014a vital and growing segment of Toronto\u2019s commuters\u2014of safe, reliable infrastructure. These lanes are not a luxury; they are an essential part of a balanced, multi-modal transit network. Without them, cyclists will be forced into unsafe traffic conditions, increasing the risk of accidents and deterring many from cycling altogether. This will push more commuters toward cars, further congesting Toronto's already overburdened roadways and public transit systems, ultimately making travel slower and less efficient for everyone.\nBike lanes empower residents to choose sustainable, cost-effective transportation options. Their removal disproportionately affects low-income individuals, students, and other marginalized groups who depend on affordable cycling infrastructure to navigate the city.\n2. Environmental Injustice\nToronto is already grappling with the climate crisis, and removing bike lanes directly contradicts the city\u2019s climate action goals. Encouraging cycling is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, a major contributor to urban pollution. The removal of bike lanes will discourage cycling, increase car dependency, and amplify vehicle emissions, worsening air quality and public health outcomes. Vulnerable populations, including children, seniors, and those living with respiratory conditions, will bear the brunt of these adverse effects.\n3. Urban Injustice\nBike lanes are not just functional infrastructure; they are a statement about the kind of city Toronto aspires to be\u2014one that prioritizes people over cars, community over congestion, and accessibility over exclusivity. Removing these bike lanes signals a retreat from that vision, favoring short-term political interests over long-term urban vitality.\nThe Yonge Street and University Avenue bike lanes are emblematic of a more inclusive Toronto. They provide a safer environment for people of all ages and abilities to move through the city, whether they are commuting, running errands, or simply enjoying their neighborhoods. Their removal erodes public space, limiting accessibility and mobility, especially for those who rely on non-motorized transportation.\n"
