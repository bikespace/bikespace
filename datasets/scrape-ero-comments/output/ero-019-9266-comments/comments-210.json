The municipality better understands its current and future vehicle and bicycle needs.\nAdding a provincial layer to these decisions would add unnecessary complexity, cost, and delay the implementation of bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed act seems to overlook the broader societal and environmental benefits of promoting cycling infrastructure. Research has consistently shown that enhancing cycling infrastructure can lead to significant reductions in urban traffic congestion. Studies in multiple cities have demonstrated that adding bike lanes decreases traffic congestion by offering more sustainable transportation options, ultimately lessening the volume of cars on the road. Furthermore, cities with comprehensive cycling infrastructure, such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, experience improved air quality, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a higher quality of life due to reduced pollution and active transport adoption. Thus, bike lanes can actually support the government\u2019s objective to fight gridlock, not hinder it, by encouraging a shift from car dependency to more sustainable modes of transport. Finally, the proposed legislation\u2019s requirement for municipalities to gather data for all existing bike lanes involving lane reduction could impose undue administrative burdens, diverting resources from more impactful infrastructure projects.\nI will ask the province to consider the following: The needs of certain road users, such as emergency responders, the disabled,the elderly, or tradespeople, who cannot use alternative modes of transport, are often cited as reasons to prioritize roads and highways over bicycle lanes or public transport. However, I would argue that these form a minority of road users. The majority of drivers on city streets are single occupant adults, commuting to or from their place of business. These drivers likely would take bicycles or public transit, if such methods provided equivalent convenience to driving. By reducing the number of these \"drivers by convenience\" (via viable alternatives to driving), we will actually be freeing up road space for the vulnerable users who actually have no alternative.\n"

We need to be making commutes safer and more environmentally friendly, instead of prioritizing convenience for those rich enough to own a vehicle.\nInvest in public transit instead.\nSee the recent cbc article that outlines that bike lanes REDUCE congestion instead of amplifying it. The more road space you create for cars, the more cars flock to the roads. The more road space you create for bikes, the more people are able to safely consider cycling as an alternative to car rides.\n"

She now relies on the bike lane to get to work safely.  This proposed legislation is endangering my family and is clearly wrong. There are mountains of evidence to suggest that bike lanes ease congestion and SAVE LIVES.  This vendetta against Toronto is so obvious and the transportation minister is so obviously corrupt. I am disgusted with this provincial government. I would rather they spend their (my) time and resources ensuring the completion of the Eglington-crosstown subway line that is bleeding the city dry. Do better.\n"

There are countless studies showing more lanes <> less traffic. In case you need help looking it up, see Braess's Paradox, which was first discovered 100 years ago.\n3.

The Ford government is acting in haste and quite frankly distain of the people of the province and should be ashamed of themselves. Have they spoken to any victims of collisions, families of cyclists lost?\nShaving mere minutes from drivers should not be a priority. Why not focus on project overruns on the Eglinton line, and improving public transit? That would vastly improve gridlock and would create a legacy much more positive than the one currently be put forward.\n"

They are the ones who will know what is needed within their boundaries.\nAlready it appears that with this change, Toronto may lose 3 major bike lanes. This small but significant progress has taken far too long and now sits on the precipice of being reversed.\nWhile major cities of the world, have or are looking at taking steps to reduce the need to drive and improve bikeability. Toronto, by virtue of Ontario, will be taking steps back.\nWhile major cities of the world, look to reduce carbon emissions. Toronto, by virtue of Ontario, seeks to increase the use of gasoline guzzling cars.\nWhile major cities of the world, look to protect citizens and provide safety for bikers. Toronto, by virtue of Ontario, seeks to actively put them in harms way.\nDo the right thing and keep municipal bike planning with the municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto continues to grow. There is no foreseeable time when it's population will be smaller than it is today. Similarly as bad as traffic is in the city today, it will never be better. Barring an aggressive change in the status quo like a congestion charge, which seems to be considered untenable, there will be more cars every year henceforth. More traffic. More gridlock. Ripping up a few bike lanes at taxpayer expense might provide some brief relief, but we know we will be back here again - likely within less than 5 years.\nAgainst this backdrop we know that it is necessary to enable more safe ways to travel in and around the city beyond the car, and that includes cycling routes that are safe and direct. Ignoring for a second the fact that the Province has as one of its top issues interfering with municipal governments on where they can put cycling infrastructure, if there is really such a strong intent to improve traffic why stop at cycling? Ban on street parking on major avenues as well. This takes up as much if not more space than the cycle tracks on these same streets and causes congestion each time someone needs to reverse into one instead of parking in a Green P of which there are many along routes like Bloor (which is also directly above a subway line).\nIf the province is serious about managing congestion in Toronto as the city continues to grow, then the focus should be on figuring out how to get more trips happening on alternate modes of transport (train, bus, subway, bike) not on how to remove those alternatives.\n"

Toronto should be at the forefront of this and did some great job to improve bike lanes in the last years. More and more people are using bikes including Uber eats bicycle. With electric bikes, the benefit of having safe bike lanes is obvious and is an effective way of reducing traffic as there are less cars on the road.\nThis decision to remove bike lanes is not based on any evidence and is clearly designed to please some lobbies.\nIt is very concerning that such a decision can be taken so unilaterally.\n"

        "comment": "To Doug Ford and/or his party members, I hope you have some the research to support this bill. Mostly because there is no research to support this bill so either you are a hypocrite or you do not care about the safety of your constituents. Which one do you choose? There have been so many cyclists killed on Toronto streets because there is a lack of sufficient bike infrastructure. And that means infrastructure on key roads that are accessible to cyclists. Firstly, reducing car lanes is a strategy that so many cities (including Toronto) have employed to improve the safety of everyone, regardless of bike lanes. It is safer to make streets narrower and reduce speed, yet you want to increase lanes? Next you'll say you want to increases the speed limits back to 50km/h because of congestion? Here's a hint, make transit work (like the Eglinton crosstown, or bloor subway, for examples). This will solve a congestion problem by, wait for it, reducing the cars on the road. Those in suburbs should not dictate how Toronto roads are designed, and we all know your votes come from the suburbs. So the right thing, not the \"Right\" thing. Please, use objective facts to make policies, not campaign promises.\n"

This would be the final nail in the coffin. Stop wasting my tax dollars and stop destroying business owners' livelihoods!\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford has access to countless research and data on traffic congestion and how it can be reduced. It has become undeniably clear, that the only way to reduce traffic is by reducing cars. The approach of expanding lanes to reduce traffic is not only outdated, but has also been shown time and time again to be highly ineffective in the long term. This shows that Doug Ford's interests do not lie in reducing traffic congestion, but rather an agenda, not unlike his late brother's, where he believes in an unsubstantiated \"war on cars\". This bill is a waste of time, money, and resources. This all couldve gone towards something to meaningfully better the lives of ontarians, but it seems that we've voted for a system run by a man-child who only sets out to do what his rich contractor friends tell him to.\n"
