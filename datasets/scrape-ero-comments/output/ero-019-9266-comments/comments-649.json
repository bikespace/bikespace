The traffic act also stipulates a minimum distance cars must give bikes when passing, this needs to be enforced, so what are you actually eliminating?  Simply trying to scare cyclists away?\n Will you eliminate bike share as well due to increased liability?\nHow about start by eliminating bike lanes on roads with street cars to enable better flow of traffic on those streets.\nThe debate is too heated and too partisan.  This only disrupts real solutions.  Do not pass this bill now.  Find some independent thought and strategic planning before spending money.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed legislation that seeks to remove existing bike lanes in Toronto and prevent development of necessary cycling infrastructure across Ontario\u2019s urban centres. This decision would have significant negative consequences for safety, traffic flow, and the overall quality of life of Ontario communities.\n1. Bike Lanes Save Lives\nBike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists by creating dedicated spaces for them to travel. Studies show that cities with protected bike lanes experience fewer traffic-related injuries and fatalities for all road users, including pedestrians and drivers (Marshall and Garrick, 2011; Chen et. al, 2011). Removing these lanes would force cyclists to share busy roads with vehicles, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries.\n2. Improved Traffic Flow and Reduced Congestion\nContrary to common misconceptions, bike lanes have minimal impact on traffic flow (Nanayakkara et al., 2022) and is a solution to traffic congestion (Thorsten and Rudolph, 2016, Hamilton and Wichman, 2018). By separating bicycles from cars, bike lanes reduce conflicts between the two, preventing slowdowns and congestion. When cyclists use designated bike lanes, drivers can maintain consistent speeds without needing to weave or stop unexpectedly. Well planned bike lanes may improve driving times by encouraging more people to choose a bike over a car.\nAdditionally, evidence highlights the positive association between increased bike ridership and connected infrastructure networks (Rietveld and Daniel, 2004; Schoner and Levinson, 2014; Xu and Chow, 2020). Removing bike lanes will likely increase congestion, as more cyclists may resort to driving.\nAddressing urban congestion requires multi-faceted solutions, including the promotion of sustainable travel modes like walking, cycling, and public transit. This legislation, however, undermines those efforts.\n3. Support for Local Residents Without Cars\nCycling infrastructure is vital for residents who do not own or cannot afford cars, providing an affordable and reliable transportation option. As transit systems face funding challenges and capacity constraints, cycling offers a practical alternative for avoiding overcrowded public transit during peak hours. Removing bike lanes would disproportionately harm these residents by limiting their transportation choices.\n4. Comprehensive Urban Mobility\nOne argument against bike lanes is that cyclists should use transit, but transit systems are designed to move large volumes of people across fixed routes and hubs. They often cannot take individuals directly to dispersed, specific destinations, such as small businesses, schools, or residential areas. Bicycles fill this gap, offering a flexible, point-to-point transport option.\nFurther, applying this argument selectively to cyclists ignores that the same logic can be applied to drivers. Yet, public discourse rarely advocates for drivers to switch entirely to buses or trains. This selective application creates a double standard and ignores the fact that active transportation modes, such as cycling, alleviate pressure on both transit and car infrastructure.\n5. Mismatch with Ontario\u2019s Housing Trends and Growing Demand\nAs new housing developments increasingly prioritize designs that do not accommodate car ownership, bike lanes and alternative transit options are critical for supporting residents. This legislation appears to prioritize non-resident commuters at the expense of local city residents, whose reliance on cycling is growing due to shifting housing and transit realities. Moreover, the number of cyclists in Ontario\u2019s urban areas continues to rise (StatCan, 2017, Liu and Allen, 2023), underscoring the need for safe infrastructure.\n6. Environmental and Public Health Benefits\nEncouraging cycling as a mode of transportation reduces reliance on cars, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Additionally, cycling promotes physical activity, which is critical for public health (Gu et al., 2016; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2011). Removing bike lanes would discourage cycling, undermining these vital benefits.\n7. Economic and Community Growth\nBike-friendly infrastructure attracts people to neighbourhoods (Monsere, et al., 2014), fosters local businesses (Volker and Handy, 2021), and increases property values (Liu and Shi, 2017; Conrow et al., 2020) . A commitment to sustainable transportation shows that our community values safety, accessibility, and environmental responsibility.\n8. Equity\nWomen are more likely to choose cycling as a mode of transportation if there is a dedicated bike lane. Dedicated cycling infrastructure increases both the number and share of women who choose to cycle in a city (AitBihiOuali and Klingen, 2022). Areas underserved by public transit (e.g., Scarborough, Etobicoke) and where car ownership is not financially feasible would benefit from the expansion of safe, dedicated bike lanes. Legislation that removes or prevents development of bike lanes, further entrenches care dependency, disproportionately impacting women and residents of lower-income neighbourhoods.\n9. Legislative Overreach and Local Autonomy\nThis legislation directly contradicts the City of Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero strategy, which prioritizes reducing traffic-related deaths and serious injuries through better infrastructure, including bike lanes. Toronto residents and local government have repeatedly supported cycling infrastructure to enhance safety, reduce congestion, and improve quality of life. The provincial intervention disregards local priorities, undermining democratic processes and local expertise in urban planning.\nAdditionally, many car commuters from outside Toronto use city roads without directly contributing to their upkeep through local taxes. Removing bike lanes unfairly penalizes Toronto residents while subsidizing the convenience of non-resident drivers.\nConclusion\nThis provincial legislation is misguided and counterproductive. Protected bike lanes save lives, reduce congestion, and provide an equitable transportation option that supports public health and sustainability. Rather than dismantling these gains, the provincial government should support the efforts of Toronto and other cities to create safer, more livable streets for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a terrible mistake as policy. It is a step backward. It will put cyclist's lives at risk, including mine, and is a disgraceful waste of taxpayer's money. Climate change demands that we incentivize people to get out of their cars and onto public transit and other low-carbon modes of transportation, including bicycling. Bill 212 is shameless political pandering to those automobile commuters, most of whom commute alone in heavy, carbon-spewing vehicles, who aren't willing to contribute to a collective solution to the existential problem of climate warming. It is cynical political symbolism. Real data demonstrates that bike lanes don't contribute to traffic congestion - construction crews contribute much more. Cities around the world are installing MORE bike lanes, not removing them. Toronto should not be the regressive outlier. And daily bicycle commmuters like myself should not have our lives put at risk for the sake of whatever political advantage the premier calculates that he will gain among auto drivers by expensively removing bike lanes, including brand new ones, at taxpayer expense. Shame on Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto needs to keep control over its own bike lanes. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to have to get approval by the province for something that is so significant and specific to everyday life of those who live in Toronto. Removing the bikes lanes proposed would greatly negatively affect not only bikers in Toronto but traffic in general since bikers would still use that road, but have fewer safe guards separating themselves from cars. Removing these bike lanes that were newly renovated will cost the people of Toronto too much money, hurt bikers, and not accomplish its goal which is supposedly helping traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I urge the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor Street in Toronto's West End. These lanes have eliminated an entire car lane, leading to longer commute times due to increased traffic congestion. Drivers are now forced to take longer detours, often through Dundas or Queensway, to avoid Bloor. In areas like Etobicoke, the bike lanes appear to be largely unused.\nIronically, the primary argument for bike lanes is to promote a more climate-friendly alternative to driving gas-powered vehicles. However, the increased congestion caused by these lanes may be having the opposite effect. As people spend more time in traffic, the overall environmental benefit is diminished. The congestion can feel like a punitive measure for drivers, prolonging travel times and creating economic ripple effects. For example, local businesses like barbershops may see fewer customers due to the difficulty of reaching their establishments.\nInstead of focusing heavily on bike lanes, I believe Toronto should prioritize strengthening its economy, ensuring it has the resources to fund meaningful climate initiatives that have a broader impact. While bike lanes have their place, the current approach seems to be backfiring and negatively impacting the city.\n"

        "comment": "Unfortunately, this proposal is a serious overreach from a government who claims to promote a small government approach. This is a clear example of how the province creates red tape for municipalities and slows down the development process and preventing updates to infrastructure and innovation. By slowing down the process for municipalities to make decisions for their own communities, you are ensuring that municipalities are blamed for mistakes at higher levels of government. Already, by not giving local governments discretion in things like ECAs, which take months for the province to review, the development process is extended unnecessarily, this is a further example of bureaucracy. It is absurd that Ontario is discouraging the development of active transportation infrastructure. It demonstrates extreme ignorance of the climate change crisis and shows that the Premier cares more about scoring political points than taking effective action to combat climate change or our genuine infrastructure issues. There is still time to reverse this decision and be on the correct side of history.\n"

Coming from one of the poorest areas of Toronto, North York, I think we should be increasing bike lines across the city and not just in the downtown core. The government is despicable and disappointing to even consider closures to get rid of bike lines. The closure of bike lines is a terrible use of tax money. Bike lines, pedestrian friendly streets, and TTC public transit systems make Toronto worth living in let alone traveling in \u2013 NOT car-centrism that only benefits few people who have nothing better to do in their lives than complaining about cyclists.

Taking them away is a terrible idea. In fact, we need more bike lanes, not fewer. Without them, cycling in the city becomes unsafe, stressful, and downright unpleasant.\nBike lanes give cyclists like me a safe space to ride. When they\u2019re not there, we\u2019re forced to share the road with cars, trucks, and buses, which can be terrifying. The risk of accidents skyrockets, and honestly, it makes biking feel like more of a hazard than a solution.\nI use my bike every day to get to work because it\u2019s affordable, efficient, and good for the planet. But the truth is, I wouldn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t feel safe\u2014and bike lanes are what make that possible. They also make exploring the city fun. Whether I\u2019m biking through neighborhoods or along the waterfront, knowing I have a dedicated space to ride makes all the difference.\nRemoving bike lanes doesn\u2019t just make things worse for cyclists\u2014it\u2019s bad for the whole city. It discourages people from biking, which means more traffic, more pollution, and fewer people choosing a healthy, green way to get around. Expanding the bike lane network would do the opposite: it would encourage more people to get out of their cars and onto bikes, making Toronto a better place to live for everyone.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014they\u2019re a must-have. Let\u2019s focus on building more of them, not tearing them down.\n"

There are also many food delivery workers who rely on bicycles to deliver food within the downtown core and they make use of those lanes.\nInstead of removing these bike lanes, the city should focus on more environmentally friendly initiatives and increase the public transit infrastructure!\n"

Any 'gains' in automobile speed from point A to B will be offset with increased accidents. Large cities should have the safety of all modes of transportation in the forefront of planning. Toronto has high traffic of all kinds, foot, cycling and automobile, along the busy streets proposed to remove bike lanes, like Yonge.\nRemoving bike lanes in congested, well traveled areas, is doing a disservice to anyone budget conscious, health conscious or environmentally conscious enough to make the effort not to use a car.

For me, cycling is the fastest and most enjoyable way to commute within the city and I cycle daily to carry out every day tasks. The bike lanes on major arteries make this faster and safer for me.\nI find the idea that \u201cbikes lanes can be moved onto secondary streets\u201d to be insulting and out of touch from reality. It implies that cycling is a leisure activity and that taking a circuitous route is somehow fine for cyclists. In particular, the bike lane on University that just opened has been a pleasure to use, and the wide divider makes me feel safer than I ever have biking in the city. I think it\u2019s precisely these types of bike lanes that make people feel safe enough to stop driving and to bike instead, reducing congestions.\nI feel that bike lanes are a municipal issue and that Premier Ford is strong arming the city on this issue to pander to his base. This is not a data-driven decision and it will not solve congestion - it will only cause more cyclists to die.\n"
