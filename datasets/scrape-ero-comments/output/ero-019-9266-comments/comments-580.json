        "comment": "This bill makes absolutely no sense and is incredibly dumb.\n1. Simply conducting 5 minutes of research online shows that adding more traffic lanes does not reduce road congestion.\n2. The snail-pace rate of construction is what's causing congestion right now downtown. Why don't you spend the money to finish that as soon as possible??\n3. It's way more likely that someone riding a bike will die in a crash because there's no dedicated lane for them than commute time will be reduced by any meaningful amount if you remove these bike lanes.\n4. Why not spend the money to improve public transportation in Toronto, which would actually reduce road congestion???\n"

        "comment": "Hi there, I really value the safety, affordability and health benefits of bike lanes in Toronto. For safety, the bike lanes on Bloor, Bay and University (and many others) have provided me a dedicated path that is usually high traffic. For affordability, having bike lanes has allowed me to bike to work consistently throughout the year rain or shine which has reduced my transportation costs in an very expensive city. For health, with my hectic work schedule, demands of raising a family, biking to and from work or on errands is my main form of exercise. The distance is too long to walk each time, as such not having access to good bike lanes for everyday use that have a direct route to work and shopping is key to building exercise into my daily routine.\nMy ask would be to improve snow removal on the bike lanes so I (and the many other people who live in Toronto) can bike all year around. I am not supportive of removing the bike lanes.\n"

The overwhelming majority of people want bike lanes.\nAs a taxpayer, I would rather the 48 million dollars he wants to waste removing bike lanes, be put into our medical. I am sick and tired of unqualified, corrupt, criminal men like Doug Ford using us taxpayers as his personal bank account to make illegal backroom deals with all of his rich friends. I am sick of the ass kissing he does to repugnant fools like Donald Trump, his obvious hero.\nNot one study confirms removing bike lanes is a good idea. It will do nothing to relieve gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "There are many reasons to encourage the use of bike lanes and to make it easier for municipalities to put them in place, mainly from the numerous and expensive externalities of cars. However, I oppose this act for a much simpler reason: it is a massively inefficient operation of government.\nFor good reason, governmental powers are distributed to smaller-scale governments that will have more understanding of local situations. It would be absurd for the federal government to approve every new traffic light in every town in the country, and it is nearly as absurd for the provincial government to involve itself in the decisions of where to put bike lanes.\nThis is especially true given the structure of the provincial government, where a single party is elected for the entire province. There is a diversity of political opinions within the regions of Ontario: typically, rural areas are more conservative and urban areas are more liberal. Thus, whatever provincial government is in power, large regions of the province are going to be opposed to that government's politics. A sensible government would allow each region to make locally relevant decisions, such as the presence of bike lanes. If a left-leaning government were in power, would it make any sense for them to mandate the addition of bike lanes in smaller rural areas where travel by bike is infeasible? Does it make any more sense for a right-leaning government to prevent the addition of bike lanes to dense urban centers where there is simply not enough space for everyone to drive?\nI don't think anyone wants their provincial government controlling local bike lanes, whether they are preventing them or adding them. And of course, the provincial government simply doesn't have the resources to understand the minutiae of traffic throughout the province, so this bill would mean the province makes the wrong decisions sometimes, whether that wrong decision allows a bike lane that shouldn't be, or prevents one that should. Who will voters blame when this happens? The provincial government, of course.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, specifically the \u2018framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\u2019, is not going to solve congestion, but it IS going to get people killed. Drivers, the people this bill allegedly \u2018protects\u2019, will have blood on their hands, and every MPP who votes in favour of Bill 212 will have blood on their hands.\nI have been riding a bicycle in downtown Toronto since the 1980s, when there were zero bike lanes. And yes\u2026there was traffic congestion back then (I was a professional courier for 2.5 years, so spent a LOT of time cycling in traffic, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year), and there were fewer cyclists. But the cyclists knew how to ride in traffic, and drivers were used to cyclists on the road. Since bike lanes have been installed (at great expense, and with careful planning) and implementation of the wildly successful Bike Share Program, the number of cyclists in Toronto has exploded. THOUSANDS of people use the Bloor St bike lane every day. These people are not going to disappear. They are not going to stop riding bikes. They will be sharing the road with cars, and I guarantee you, drivers do not want that, and cyclists even less.\nThere is not a single driver in Toronto (barring psychopaths) who think that reducing their commute time by 1-2 minutes is worth ending the life of another human being, or maiming someone. Yet Bill 212 will result in exactly this scenario: people trying to get to work by car, or home to see their families by car, or running errands by car, killing or maiming another person because the bike lane that that person used to ride safely in was \u2018ripped out\u2019, and suffering the trauma of that incident, when they never asked for bike lanes to be removed at all. In this same scenario, the family of a person killed is even MORE traumatized.. children losing a parent or a sibling, parents losing a child\u2026 all horrific, horrific scenarios. And every MPP who votes for this bill will have the blood and tears of these people on their hands.\nNo one is asking for this change. This is a petty, misguided knee-jerk reaction to distract from areas where this government is failing. I urge all MPPs (even Ford loyalists) to put human life over (allegedly) enhanced commute times for a tiny fraction of Toronto drivers (and an even tinier fraction of Ontario drivers!), especially when there is NO data that supports the conclusion that bike lanes cause congestion. None.\nMPPs outside Toronto may wish to consider the costs that THEIR constituents are paying, with their hard earned tax dollars, to \u2018rip out\u2019 safe transportation infrastructure in downtown Toronto, when the emergency room in their local hospital has an 18 hour wait time, or is simply closed due to lack of funding. Or their children\u2019s school is falling apart.\nIt does not escape me that \u2018cyclists\u2019 are not mentioned once in the Bill, nor have they been mentioned by the premier or his transportation minister in their numerous frothy press conferences. According to the Bloor-Annex BIA, over 8,000 people use the Bloor St. bike lane every day. Bike Share Toronto reported 5.7 million trips taken in 2023, and is on pace for more than six million trips in 2024. Along Bloor St. in the Annex, bike lane users currently make up 37% of rush-hour traffic. On a single weekday in October 2022, the City of Toronto counted 38,000 people biking through the downtown core. Are all those people just\u2026 not people, to this government? Or does the government consider these people expendable\u2026 worthless\u2026 and able to be sacrificed under the wheels of a car, in the name of a fantasy (which is a lie) of a faster commute? Have you asked the police and emergency services what they think? In the letter, \u201cLegislation that guides road design must prioritize safety over travel times\u201d, 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto say  \u201cResearch from many jurisdictions, including Toronto, shows that protected bicycle lanes reduce the risk of motor vehicle trauma for pedestrians and cyclists\u201d, and mentions the horrific consequences of collisions as well as that \u201cSurviving drivers involved in fatal collisions are also haunted by their experience, many suffering from life-long regret and psychological torment.\u201d. Haunted, suffering life-long regret\u2026 and these are the people Bill 212 allegedly helps?? Appalling.\nBill 212 is going to get people killed, and it will do NOTHING to reduce commute times for drivers in Toronto. Stop this madness. Put humanity before manufactured political culture wars, and vote against Bill 212, or you will have blood on your hands.\n"

        "comment": "On a recent visit to Toronto I visited a restaurant on Bloor street. Dozens upon dozens of bike riders rode by as I had lunch, making heavy use of the Bloor street bike lane. The province needs to stop this ridiculous campaign against bike lanes, and allow municipalities to do what is best for their specific traffic needs. Removing bike lanes will likely result in induced demand, with the new lane of traffic quickly filling up to capacity.\nLeave bike lanes alone. Build more bike lanes, build more transit. Make it really easy for people to leave their cars behind and you'll actually improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "My wife felt safe biking in Toronto, in the bike lanes mentioned in this bill. They enabled her to see more of the city (and to spend more money there). She does not feel safe biking in our hometown of Guelph because of the lack of bike lanes, and without a driver's license, she is significantly limited in mobility without there being more bike lanes for her.\nYes, without this bill there may continue to be delays in car traffic. But how much more car traffic will this bill afford by removal of bike lanes? And at what cost? For one thing, think about how many more people, and how many more kinds of people\u2014like my wife\u2014can move around the city when we keep the bike lanes. Not to mention the ability of municipalities to choose what's right for their communities. Or the noise and pollution implications. Or increased healthcare costs as more people sit in cars for more of their lives.\nLet's focus on serving all people, not on making more space for machines that serve some people.\n"

The claim that only 1.2% of road users are cyclists is from data over a decade old and includes the whole of the GTA. The actual numbers from a recent Toronto study show that almost half (44%) of all road users report being utilitarian cyclists.\nBike lanes can transport 7500 users an hour compared to car lanes at 900 (https://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/introduction/\u2026). The math just does not add up. It is clear bike lanes reduce gridlock not cause it, it would be foolish and false to suggest otherwise. Instead, we should be investing in more bike lanes and transit to provide safer streets for all users.\n"

The bike lane encourages the building and sustaining of community at a cost of only a few minutes to the individual driver. With lowering the speed limit to 40km in my opinion has created a safer environment for all of us using the roadway; pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike. Although I myself can't make use of the bike lanes due to physical limitations the rest of my family and many of my friends do use them and I am grateful that they are able to commute in a safer way. Please keep the bike lanes to keep many Ontarians, including my family safe.\n"

Every person going to work or school or shopping or to an appointment who is riding a bicycle is reducing gridlock. Remove the safe cycling infrastructure and forcing those people into cars will increase gridlock and waste more time.\nThis is not an evidence-based proposal but rather is a knee-jerk reaction to a problem that has been caused by poor planning and by failures to invest in transit and safe pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\nTraffic lanes induce demand and make gridlock worse. In contrast, safe cycling infrastructure has been scientifically proven to boost business, increase safety, and reduce car-dependence.\nThe province of Ontario should leave the urban planning to the experts -- the municipal planners, the municipal engineers and the municipal politicians who know what their communities want and need. This is an affront to local governance and will ultimately be deadly. Don't be the government that moved us backwards.\n"

I cannot believe this is even up for proposal.\nIf a reduction in traffic congestion is what your seeking, better cycling and walking infrastructure is the proven approach. Making cycling more accessible and safe for a broader range of people's trips, not just commuting, will reduce the number of people in cars contributing to traffic.\nAs additional benefit its much better for your citizens personal health and the climate.\nAdditionally what gives anyone the idea that stripping away safe bike infrastructure from a vulnerable minority of road users is going to improve anything? What impacts will the demolition / roadworks have on traffic?\n"
