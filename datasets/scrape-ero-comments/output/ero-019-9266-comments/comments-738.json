It's clear that the government knows it's in the wrong with the fast tracking of highways and land appropriations when it tries to hide it within equally bad legislation to increase traffic and congestion in Toronto by removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Transportation professionals endeavour to provide safe and healthy mobility options for people of all ages and abilities, including pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and motorists.\nAs cities across Canada face growing challenges related to traffic congestion, collisions, air quality, and public health, investment in active transportation (AT) is an effective solution that can significantly improve safety and mobility while enhancing the quality of life for all residents. Specifically, well-designed and dedicated AT space within the public right-of-way, such as bicycle facilities, provides many benefits for individuals, communities, and beyond. In contrast, wider roads and higher-speed infrastructure prioritize vehicle use at the expense of pedestrian and cyclist safety and induce more personal vehicle traffic, exacerbating congestion.\nRoad safety is a fundamental priority in the planning, design, and operation of transportation infrastructure. Studies show that bicycle facilities reduce traffic collisions and fatalities by separating cyclists from motor vehicles, contributing to safer streets for all.\nWell-designed AT infrastructure provides an affordable and accessible transportation option for people of all ages, abilities, incomes, and comfort levels, reducing reliance on personal vehicles in a manner that improves the inclusivity and equity of our transportation system. Providing AT infrastructure encourages a more physically active population, leading to improved public health outcomes such as reduced obesity, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses. Dedicated AT infrastructure also contributes to reduced emissions, improved urban air quality, and a more sustainable transportation network overall.\nBased on these and additional factors, providing dedicated AT infrastructure has proven to be an effective evidence-based practice in cities around the world. Transportation professionals will continue to consider this type of infrastructure as a key tool in the provision of safer, more efficient, and equitable mobility options for all users. Transportation professionals recognize that retrofitting our communities with well-designed AT infrastructure, where possible and on the streets with the most benefit, will contribute to more livable, vibrant, and prosperous communities.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident, parent and Architect who is a homeowner/business owner in Toronto.  I am against: any limiting addition of; or removal of existing bike lanes.  I have lived in Toronto for almost twenty years.  As a student at Ryerson University, biking around was the only form of transportation I could afford, even public transit was a lot to pay for, so I biked 12 months of the year.  At the time I biked in blizzards, rain, sun, extreme wind, it didn't matter.  There were no protected bike lanes to protect me from cars.  Even though I'm a very defensive biker who keeps an eye on cars all the time, there were a lot of near misses from passing cars that could have ended my life.  We have come a long way since then (although still a long way to go), and the number of bikers in the city has increased exponentially as bike lanes have been installed.  I feel much safer now biking, but there is a lot more work to do to make Toronto a city that is safe to get around through public transit and active transportation like biking and walking (the bonus is public transit and bike infrastructure is cheaper, and it alleviates some of the health care costs in ontario as it leads to healthier people) .  Please stop this bill from going through, it is based in mis-information and skewing of information (such as the stats of the percentage of people who commute by bike, which includes huge swaths of the city where public transit is poor and bike infrastructure is non-existant and people are forced to drive cars; or studies that were completed during the pandemic with inconsistent bike/car numbers).  Everyone I know downtown Toronto Bikes at least some of the time to get around recreationally and many commute to work and job sites by bike.  I have a family and we want to feel safe biking with our kids, on bike lanes this is possible, when biking on the road, it is not.  Also, the approach to put bike lanes on secondary streets with a stop-light every block does not work.  They tried this in some locations in Vancouver (Kitsilano) and I never used them as it would take twice as long to get somewhere then using the main street (bikers are trying to get somewhere efficiently and in a timely manner). We also have a car, but we bike 90% of the time and mostly use the car to get out of Toronto to go visit family or on vacations.  As an Architect, I bike to construction sites, client meetings most of the year, and take public transit to most of those in bad weather.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019ve lived at South Kingsway & Bloor for nine years now and was thrilled to see the bike lanes extended. I have four kids and have not used them once, and I still wholeheartedly support their existence. I honestly do not think traffic has been affected much by them. I see a much greater impact by the condominium construction at the Bloor/South Kingsway intersection, as well as the addition of the new left turn light at Jane/Bloor. Having a red light for cars turning north onto Jane, while the east/westbound traffic continues to move, often causes a massive back up down Bloor St during rush hour.\nAdditionally, we have a 40 km/h speed limit for a reason - drivers aren\u2019t meant to be able to speed across town. We are an area heavily populated with children. The bike lanes and related pavement markings have made drivers much more cautious and aware. Many of the concrete barriers have been planted with native plants. These are all great things!\nFinally, I would like to suggest that we take the money that would be wasted removing bike lanes and give it in the TTC. A subway runs under Bloor! Let\u2019s invest in it and make it better so more people want to take it.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am deeply disappointed that this bill forces cities across the province to remove bike lanes or prevents them from installing new ones. I use these bike lanes almost daily (paricularly in the Etobicoke Bloor West area) and they I look forward to the freedom and independence my children will experience with access to safe bicycle routes.\nA few notes:\n1. Removing bike lanes will not improve the flow of traffic. The simple fact is that there are too many cars trying to drive through urban areas. If the province wants to make traffic flow, get people who are making unnecessary car trips off the road. Promoting public transit and giving bicycles a lane frees up the existing roadways for the people who have no choice but to drive.\n2. Increasing the car infrastructure in urban areas gives preferential treatment to the people driving through, at the expense of those who live there. I can say with certainty that my quality of life will decrease if my family and I lose access to the Bloor street bike lane. The people who drive through my area don't pay property tax here. Why should my neighbourhood be built for their convenience?\n3. This is a huge governmental overreach from politicians who supposedly espouse the principle of less government intervention being better. This is a municipal issue, which city mayors are well-equipped to manage.\n4. Bike lanes are good for local business. People in cars drive through places and have to pay when they park. People on bikes can stop and shop with greater ease.\nThe povincial government has a lot of much bigger, more important things to worry about. Considering how dysfunctional healthcare and education systems are, this bill is a big waste of time.\n"

As a cyclist and citizen of Toronto I feel that this is a step backwards.\nI'll note that I'm also a motor vehicle driver and agree that Toronto gridlock is untenable. But removing bike lanes is NOT going to solve this problem. If anything, it will put more cars on the road as all those cyclist will have to get around safely somehow.\nAdditionally, allowing the province to remove bike lanes without opposition sets a terrible precedent because City councilors are elected to represent constituents. The province has no business in this matter.\nAs Coun. Josh Matlow said the legislation is not about bike lanes but about Ford's political interests.\n\"While Doug Ford is focusing on micromanaging Toronto, he's neglecting a healthcare system that needs improvement, schools that need fixing, vulnerable people across this province who don't have a premier who is for the people. But damn, we can go to 7-11 and buy a cooler now. Isn't that awesome?\"\n"

        "comment": "Fundamentally, this logic is flawed \u2014 greater infrastructure for cyclists, like bike lanes, reduces the amount of people needing to take a car, and increases the ability to ride safely.\nIf cyclists cannot ride safely, they will be less inclined to ride. ie, more cars, more traffic. Cars create gridlock, not bike lanes.\nThe great cities of the world know this and invest in diverse infrastructure. Toronto\u2019s narrow point of view here is more than disheartening. It\u2019s daft.\nA friend of mine died on her bike, on a major Toronto street without a bike lane, after being hit by two cars. Every morning I leave my apartment and walk past another memorial for someone who lost their life on my corner; a bicycle painted white, a constant reminder.\nBut sure. Spend the taxpayer\u2019s money dismantling existing infrastructure, and forget my 22 year old friend. Another Uber on the road is more important. Right?\n"

        "comment": "I am reaching out as a concerned taxpayer regarding the new anti-bike lane provincial legislation.\nAll emprirical evidence suggests that a multi-modal transportation network, including bikes, is the only long term solution to improve safety for ALL road users!!\nBike lanes are ESSENTIAL transportation infrastructure which help reduce congestion, stimulate economic activity, increase public transit catchment area, and provide alternative mobility options for those who cannot or do not want to drive. Safe bike lanes also encourage people to get more exercise, which helps to reduce the demands on our healthcare system.\nThis bill will add unnecessary costs and red tape while burdening communities who are trying to respond to changing mobility patterns. As someone who drives, walks, and cycles around my community, these street improvements are welcome as they reduce conflicts and provide all road users their own space.\nDecisions about local streets should NOT be made by Queen's Park. As we continue to grow and increase density in our cities, alternative transportation will be needed. Many Ontario neighbourhoods have cycling modal share of 10%-15%, and that\u2019s only counting commuting patterns. These figures have continued to grow as more infrastructure has been built, proving the success of these facilities.\nThe proposed removal of Bloor and Yonge Streets and University Avenue in Toronto is not supported by the City's data, Toronto City Council, or the desires of local constituents.\nOn Bloor Street, the local BIA supports these lanes as spending has increased along the corridor. On University Avenue, the hospitals supported their staff biking to work, demanding wide cycle lanes for emergency vehicles. Finally, Yonge Street has seen a dramatic increase in both cycling and pedestrian volumes since implementing the bike lane\nThank you and I look forward to seeing more bike lanes, not fewer, being built in our beautiful province, helping to ensure the safety of ALL road users. Too many cyclists are being killed and injured because of lack of cycling infrastructure. This proposed legislation, which has been opposed by ALL delegations to the Infrastructure Committee, will only make matters worse. Please reconsider this legislation!!\n"

I've even had close calls while in the bike lanes and eventually I will be buying a action camera to start recording all of the careless drivers to submit them to the police or media because it is a complete disregard of life for someone else's convenience of driving.

I am a resident in the City of Toronto, I work in Healthcare as a Registered Social Worker, and I commute to work using the Bloor/Danforth bike lane everyday. I travel from Landsdowne to Victoria Park, on the bike lane the whole ride. If this bill passes, my commute will become much more dangerous, and I may start driving a car, adding to congestion on the roads. Bike lines are life saving technologies that support multiple forms of commuting, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, creates healthier and happier citizens and cities, and reduces traffic congestion as people have a safe option to commute by bike rather than car (and many of us choose this option). The millions of dollars that would be used to remove bike lanes could be better spent on housing, healthcare, education, and other important public services that are deeply needed now more than ever. In addition, the congestion caused by months and months of bike lane deconstruction will be pointless, frustrating, polluting, and avoidable. Please do not take away our bike lanes, after a decades long battle to install them. They are so important to so many of us, and they save lives.\n"

It will delay infrastructure projects by creating a mass of red tape that municipalities will need to break through to build, upgrade, or maintain road and transit infrastructure. It will cost millions of dollars to remove existing cycling infrastructure, wasting taxpayers' money. It will actually increase gridlock by putting more cars on the road. It will endanger pedestrians', cyclists', and motorists' lives by making many types of safety upgrades impossible.\nThe best way to decrease gridlock is to get more people on bikes and buses so that there's more room for people who choose to drive. Removing transportation alternatives will have the opposite of the intended effect.\n"
