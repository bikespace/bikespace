        "comment": "On Danforth ave west of Victoria park, they removed a bike lane and increased the sidewalk for pedestrians at the expense of more congestion and limited to no throughway of car vehicle traffic especially during rush hour. they have incorporated many parking lots on the sides of the roads, but cars cannot even access them in a timely manner due to the increased congestion which makes those lots almost redundant. It seems like there is poor usage of the corridor and it can be better utilized. I don't think the answer is simply ripping up the bike lanes for the sake of doing it but, establishing a better system to fit more lanes of vehicle traffic, maybe less street parking with more off-street parking, extending the sidewalks a little further to accommodate lanes on the sidewalk. there is room for innovation , but all stake holders need to be accommodated, not just bikes.\n"

        "comment": "Please do NOT take out bike lanes from Toronto. Removing the lanes will increase car traffic and actually create more congestion in the city. Bike lanes are good for the city and the environment. They keep cars and bikes separate making the roads a safer place for everyone. The provincial government should be interested in what is good for its people, not government overreach. Doug Ford, stop trying to make our lives harder. Think about how much money it will cost to remove the bike lanes that could instead be used to invest in healthcare or education. With every announcement you make our lives get worse. Reconsider this and leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "No. Just no.\nIt is wrong for the premier to force his personal vendetta on Toronto (time and again) like being proposed in bill 212, even more so when doing it using outdated if not flawed info, such as the bike lanes' utilization rates, and while forcing Toronto to foot the bill. It is as if the province is waging a war on its largest city that is also the country's largest.\nIt is not in anyone's interest to force more work to undo work already done, emitting more carbon while at it, about a construct (bike lanes) that should be part of a comprehensive lower carbon infrastructure scheme. Only if the province doesn't care at all about emissions and climate change and have no intention to meet any carbon emissions objectives.\nRemoving bicycle lanes force cyclists into either vehicle lanes and be run over, or into sidewalks and knock pedestrians over and/or eat tickets. Cyclists will feel out of place in either case and deprived of a viable zero emission transportation mode for no good reason and no good alternative.\nReturning a bicycle lane to motor vehicle traffic is the same as adding a motor vehicle lane, and countless research has shown will only induce more driving and more gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Many Torontonians, including me, do not own cars because bike infrastructure makes car ownership an unnecessary expense. For some, the financial cost of car ownership is untenable. For others, not owning a car is a choice of convenience. Either way, the city is safe for cyclists thanks to a wonderful network of bike paths. No study has been conducted to indicate that the removal of bike lanes along Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Ave would in fact reduce traffic congestion. Without quantitative information on the effects these bike lanes have had on congestion, removing them is simply premature and makes moving around the city more dangerous for those of us without passenger cars who are actually reducing congestion by not owning vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are needed in this overcrowded city of Toronto.  It saves the life of cyclists and pedestrians, if the bike lanes are removed then cyclists would use the sidewalks and endanger pedestrians.  Before the bike lanes was installed many times I was almost hit by speeding cyclists.  My friend  who is 80 years old was hit by an e-scooter riding on the sidewalk and no one was around to help her after she fell to the ground.  In the area where I live many cars use the residential streets to avoid the heavy traffic on the main road that does not have a bike lane, so removing bike lanes would not make a difference.\n"

It\u2019s an expensive and wasteful bill, with logic born out of some terrible ChatGPT AI slop.\nImagine citing \u201c1%\u201d of people who bike as if there aren\u2019t polls screaming how more people wish they could bike, but the infrastructure and safety is not yet there.\nEveryone hates how reckless and dangerous driving in Toronto is, and some drivers have literally been exposed for buying their license at corrupt driving schools over showing actual driving competency.\nBut instead of cracking down on that, the solution is to add more lanes that will quickly get filled up in a year because apparently listening to conspiracy theorists over urban planning experts - who have seen induced demand embarrass the \u201cjust one more lane bro\u201d mentality, city after city, decade after decade, across the world - is great governance.\nWe need more transit options, not more red tape.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of the specified bike lanes will have no impact on reducing gridlock. The evidence is clear. Bike lane infrastructure reduces automobile volume and allows car traffic to move more efficiently by providing separation between bikes and cars. It also improves safety and encourages the use of eco-,friendly bikes and ebikes.\nThis effort to remove bike lanes is not supported by any evidence or data that it will have the desired effect. I oppose it strongly.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes are safe. They create a physical barrier which allows cyclists to travel through the city safely without fear of being hit by cars trying to impatiently beat traffic into the core of the city.  Ripping out bike Lanes will cause more accidents and more deaths.\nWe should be creating more bike Lanes to alleviate traffic into the city. Not encouraging drivers to bring more cars downtown, where there is already limited parking and significant congestion. We should be investing in more public transportation and bike Lanes rather than encouraging people from outside the core to drive downtown.\nIt's unfortunate that Doug Ford doesn't actually spend any time downtown and only thinks about what bike Lanes mean to him and his friends who live outside the city; without thinking about what bike Lanes mean to the Torontonians that live in the city.  It means safer streets for cyclists, less congestion, and less Pollution.\n"

Proposing to combat gridlock by reducing the infrastructure of higher efficiency modes of transport (walking, biking, public transit) or their expansion directly opposes core urban planning principles. This infamy of a populist policy cannot in any seriousness be considered to be in the interest of the Canadian people.\n"

These millions could be much better spent elsewhere - initiatives for affordable housing, education, health care and the opioid crisis. WHAT IS HE THINKING? Fewer bike lanes means more cars, MORE GRIDLOCK. Even businesses have reported more business with bike lanes. DOUG FORD YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE PEOPLE IN THE PAST. Please do so again. This is going to lose you big votes. Too many people are suffering with health care fiascos and a housing crisis, shelter shortages and education shortfalls. Please spend the money where it TRULY MATTERS. Get the subways built!!! Thankyou for listening.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply appalled by the provinces Bill 212 to remove sections of bike lanes in Toronto.\nThis shows a:\n-Lack of stewardship of taxpayer dollars - The 48 Million to remove the bike lanes is just the tip of the iceberg.  The provinces consistent focus on issues that do not advance the betterment of communities demonstrates a lack of effective leadership and avoidance in truly dealing with the issues faced by Ontarians while spending taxpayer time and money on initiatives that have benefits for a small group of wealthy stakeholders.  This is reminding me of the greenbelt fiasco - how much public money has been spent to enrich a few developers at the expense of people and the environment?  This is not only the hard costs but think about the staff time and the opportunity cost of not addressing critically important issues.\n-Complete disregard for public safety -  Research has shown that bike lanes protect individuals\n-Complete disregard for the climate crisis we are in - Active transport in an urban environment is critical to transitioning to a sustainable, socially just city\n"

Municipal representatives are closer to their constituents and better\nable to respond to the needs/wants of the community regarding both vehicle and bike\ntransit as well as growth and development in neighborhoods. Research from major cities\n(New York, Paris, Copenhagen, Montreal) shows that bike lanes significantly reduce car\ncommuter times.\n\u25cf Back municipalities' efforts to decrease emissions and acknowledges the impact of\nincreased bike ridership, as seen in Toronto, where bike trips rose by 4 million over eight\nyears. More cyclists can alleviate road congestion and reduce vehicle numbers,\ncontributing to lower emissions.\n\u25cf Highlight that cycling has a much smaller carbon footprint than cars, with the\nenvironmental impact of bike manufacturing offset within a year of use, making bike\nlanes crucial for combating climate change.\n\u25cf Remind the government that cycling is an affordable, sustainable lifestyle choice and\ncyclists are equally entitled as drivers to arrive safely to their destinations.\n\u25cf Raise concerns about relocating utility infrastructure potentially leading to the\nexpropriation of more agricultural and Greenbelt lands, which are vital for food supply\nand carbon sinks.\n\u25cf Call for thorough environmental assessments for Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass,\nensuring compliance with species at risk legislation.\n\u25cf Oppose the expropriation of Greenbelt and agricultural lands for highway projects and\n\u25cf Argue against transferring regulatory powers for towing zones from the Lieutenant\nGovernor to the Minister of Transportation, as this reduces accountability for the\nprovince.\nTherefore, I oppose Bill 212 as it currently stands\n"
