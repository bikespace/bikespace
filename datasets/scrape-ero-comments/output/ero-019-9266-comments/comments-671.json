I feel much safer now when I walk on the sidewalk on Avenue Road between Davenport and Bloor due to the bike lanes protecting me from cars. It is unconscionable to expose pedestrians to speeding cars mere inches from us when we are on sidewalks on that racing strip. It\u2019s dangerous and terrifying. Pedestrians have rights. Why is this city only concerned with cars!\n"

It's called induced demand.\nMeanwhile, every person on a bicycle (in a bicycle lane) is one person not in a car.\nYour anti-bike rhetoric is endangering cyclists, emboldening road rage, and confounding efforts to stop car dependency. You can't blame bike lanes for congestion and be serious about it.\nBike lanes are traffic lanes too.\nIf there are no longer bike lanes on BLOOR, YONGE and UNIVERSITY, I will be riding these streets in car lanes. I will not stop riding.\nThere is a joy in riding a bike to work that cannot be achieved sitting in a car.\nPlease don't take this province backward!\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m a cyclist in Toronto. I use the city bikes multiple times a day and find it to be the best way to get around Toronto. Having safe bike lanes is really important to me to choose biking over other modes of transportation. Drivers are not always aware of bikes. Often drivers try to take over street cars and in doing so they pass bikers at dangerously close distances and higher speeds. Having dedicated and separated  bike lanes create a lot of safety for us. I bike on bloor, college, Adelaide, Dundas, kings st and queen. There is a huge difference in perceived safety between streets with and without dedicated bike lanes.\nGoing east-west in Toronto is not possible on \u201cside streets\u201d.\n"

        "comment": "Removing currently existing bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St. and University Avenue is short-sighted, neglectful of the residents of Toronto who use it as an affordable and convenient method to get to places of employment, study, etc. as well as a huge waste of taxpayers dollars.\nThese bike lanes exist along routes that already have another major mode of transportation, namely, the TTC subway lines 1 and 2. There are numerous other routes that go north-south and east-west in Toronto that are more suitable for cars, and removing the one major, safe option for cyclists for each direction, out of the many routes those available to cars, unjustly limits and penalizes those who cannot afford a car or a TTC pass.\nMost streets in Toronto are already unsafe for cyclists due to the high volume of cars and the large number of areas under construction. Gridlock is being caused more by all the people who insist on driving rather than taking transit, as well as the poorly planned roadwork that seems to block most convenient routes all at the same time and get delayed due to poor planning.\nAs well, leaving the decision of bike lanes in the hands of people who may not even live in the city is ill-conceived and does not bring the necessary experience of those who use the roads in Toronto to the decision-making process.\nInstead of punishing cyclists, let\u2019s find more incentives for people to leave their cars at home and plan construction more appropriately to keep the roads clearer for those who do drive and bike.\n"

It is essential that residents have a voice in decisions that directly affect their communities. Local councils are best positioned to understand the unique needs and priorities of their constituents, and this bill diminishes their ability to govern effectively.\nI urge you to respect municipal authority and allow local governments and their residents to make informed decisions about transportation and infrastructure. Protecting local governance is crucial for fostering communities that reflect the values and needs of their citizens.\n"

        "comment": "We, once again, are becoming the laughing stock of progressive cities.   Premier Ford, you were elected not just to support suburban voters but all Ontarians including those of us who live in the city of Toronto.  What we need are a safe interconnected and protected series of bike lanes.  Before you decide to tear up the existing bike lanes, please do us all a favour and travel to Copenhagen where you will see thousands of people of all ages travelling on safe protected bike lanes.\nYour proposal will put so many lives at risk.  Perhaps, the car continues to reign supreme when designing policies and regulations.  The congestion on so many roads leading to the Gardiner Expressway every single evening has absolutely nothing to do with bike lanes.  Take a trip to your own suburban area and count the number of cars in driveways.  It is all related to pure volume and bike lanes have nothing to do with the current gridlock.\nThe current voting system is putting governments like yours in power with less than 45% of the vote and permitting you to ride roughshod over the wishes of the people you are supposed to represent.  Appalling!\n"

        "comment": "I've been a resident of Mississauga for 26 years, and recently became a homeowner. I have seen first hand how narrowing Rathburn Road and introducing bike lanes over the past year has made the area safer. I've recently made it my goal to use my bike for as many trips as possible for environmental and physical/mental health reasons, and I'll be using the bike trails to do my grocery shopping. They also connect me directly to visiting my dad, and let me easily access other parts of the cycling network like Chechalk and Etobicoke trail, and the multi use path that runs along Burnhamthorpe.\nWe previously had problems with street racing due to the street being overly wide, and now that the street is narrower and designed to prevent speeding, I'll feel so much better about my future kids crossing it. There are lots of schools and seniors' homes in the area, and crossing the road will now be a less daunting task for dozens of children and elderly people each day. Cyclists (including kids biking to school!) will be much safer too. The new street makes the neighbourhood look more inviting, and like a real community rather than just a way to get to another place. I've talked with 3 of my neighbours who had positive thoughts on the project as well!\nThis is just one example where removing a car lane made sense, because the street was too wide. Cities know their streets best, and it doesn't make sense that the provincial government could tell the city that they can't undertake a project like this. I think it would be an overreach of provincial government.\nI know that each street will be decided on individually, and this is not a blanket ban, but I believe that moving these decisions up to the provincial level removes accountability. As a citizen, I have direct contact with my councilor and city committees. If they make a decision I disagree with, I can talk to them, and they will have time for me. If the provnice makes such a decision, they likely wont have as much time for citizen engagement for a relatively small municipal project, and it will be harder to be heard.\nGiven all this, I urge you to please reconsider provincial interference in city planning regarding bike lanes, for the safety and well being of our communities.\n"

Improving public transit and encouraging alternative methods of transport -- including bicycles -- is the only way to relieve car pressure on crowded city streets, and this has been proven in major cities the world over.\nThe number of people using bicycles will not decrease, but they will no longer have safe and efficient ways to get around the city. No one wins.\nThe cost to remove existing lanes based on false information is egregious. Better to spend that money to actually finish some of the longstanding transit projects within the city.\nIt should not be a decision by the Province to interfere with complete street planning within municipalities.\n"

If it's so difficult to drive, then just don't drive! Take the train or bus, or walk or bike, or use a wheel chair, scooter, or your favourite mobility aid. I'm 56 and have lived in Toronto since 2003; I don't even have a driver's license. If I can manage, so can the vast majority of people who choose to drive today, most of them in far better physical shape than me. And I have to pay for their road and highway maintenance with my taxes. It's just so unfair. Pure socialism. I just hate it.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern regarding recent discussions about removing bike lanes within our city. This decision appears not only shortsighted but counterproductive to the larger goals of environmental sustainability, efficient urban mobility, and economic growth. Bike lanes have repeatedly proven to be a valuable infrastructure investment, facilitating cleaner transportation options, reducing emissions, and promoting healthier lifestyles.\nBike lanes are not the root cause of our city\u2019s traffic congestion. Rather, the primary contributors to gridlock are well-documented: our reliance on personal vehicles, limited alternative transit options, and construction and infrastructure projects that remain incomplete or nonfunctional. For instance, major highways like the 401, the Don Valley Parkway, and the Gardiner Expressway are consistently congested, regardless of the presence of bike lanes in the downtown core. It is these thoroughfares, alongside the delayed completion of projects like the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, that exacerbate traffic, not the availability of bike lanes. Without sufficient alternative transportation options, our reliance on personal vehicles will only continue, further intensifying traffic concerns.  Based on the logic that bike lanes create gridlock, then roadways that don't have bike lanes should have fewer delays. However, the data does not support this.  The data does support the idea that roads with bike lanes have fewer accidents involving cyclists than roads that don't, and the volume of cyclists on these bike lanes is higher!\nMoreover, data consistently supports the positive impact of bike lanes on city infrastructure. Cities that invest in bike lanes see reduced vehicular traffic, lower emissions, and increased economic activity in areas accessible by bike. Bike lanes offer a genuine, sustainable alternative to car dependency, and removing them would set back our city\u2019s progress in reducing carbon emissions and promoting public health.  You only need to look at other major cities such as London, New York, and Paris, where no one would ever drive to the city centre and, in some cases, charge a surcharge to do so.  This has not harmed this city; quite the opposite, it makes these cities more walkable, and increases tourism and spending in the local economy.\nWhile I understand the frustrations of those who sit in traffic and perceive bike lanes as impediments, I would urge you to consider the broader picture. Merely because a bike lane appears to move faster than car traffic should not warrant its removal. Instead, we should focus on expanding and improving our transportation infrastructure as a whole, offering residents viable and efficient alternatives to car travel.\nI respectfully request that the province refocus its efforts on improving public transportation infrastructure and empowering local governments to make decisions on transit needs. Our city\u2019s residents deserve a say in shaping the future of their transportation options, and we cannot afford to take a step backward on a matter as crucial as urban mobility.\nThank you for your time and consideration of this important issue. I hope we can work together to create a transportation network that supports all modes of travel and keeps our city moving forward.\nSincerely,\nOntario Resident\n"

        "comment": "I do not bike to work, I drive and take public transit within the City of Toronto. I am against the supposition to remove the control of bike lane infrastructure from the City of Toronto. In my opinion, such a bill would be an unlawful amendment to democratic representation, and would remove the right of the residents of the City of Toronto to have their chosen representative enact city planning, on their behalf. Further, the exorbitant cost to remove already established bike lane infrastructure, would be a complete waste of tax payer's money and an act of flagrant disregard for the citizens of Ontario, and the acute issues we are facing due to high cost of housing, a lack of climate change initiatives, etc. Lastly, reducing bike infrastructure will only increase air pollution and lead to a more unsafe city for all, especially the children and the elderly. Bill 212 will only make traffic worse, and reduce the livibility of the City of Toronto and southern Ontario, it should not be passed.\n"
