        "comment": "It\u2019s definitely a mistake to use taxpayer money to remove established bike lanes, especially when these lanes promote sustainable transportation and community health. Instead of dismantling these vital resources, we should be focusing on expanding them. More bike lanes can encourage increased usage year-round, and with effective snow removal strategies in place, people would feel more comfortable riding in colder months. Investing in infrastructure that supports cycling not only benefits individual commuters but also helps reduce traffic congestion and lowers carbon emissions. It\u2019s about creating a more bike-friendly environment that serves the community as a whole.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a clear cut example of government overreach and it completely undermines municipal governments. There are plenty of real issues that Ontarians are facing in terms of cost of living, housing, etc. Doug Ford's government should try addressing those issues instead of bogging down capital works and infrastructure projects with additional red tape to satisfy his vendetta against bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212.  Removing cycling lanes will only contribute to the issue of gridlock in large populated cities.  This bill is creating a blanket resolution to all cities as opposed to offering to support to the necessary cities where it is the issue - Toronto!  There are many cities in Ontario that have reduced roads to add cycling lanes and this is not the problem.  Why can't the Conservative Government consider adapting the Bill so as to allow municipalities to make informed, data-driven decisions based on their communities needs and wants. Requiring a broad stroke against all municipalities is punishing those cities where this has worked.  Especially if you are considering removing the existing cycling lanes.\nAgain...I am not in favour of this bill as it stands.\n"

        "comment": "The purpose of a road is to allow for transport, both of people and of goods. Roads pre-date cars by a long shot (\"All roads lead to Rome\"), so while the prevailing view is that \"Roads are for cars,\" this is a relatively new phenomenon that gives a specific method of transport the ownership of basically the entire roadway.\nThere are many downsides to cars:\n-Environmental impact, both due to their carbon emissions, as well as the damage caused to roadways (therefore they need repair and maintenance more often)\n-Danger due to crashes, both to drivers and to people outside of vehicles (in 2022, there were almost two thousand deaths via car crash, and almost 120 thousand injuries in the same year)\n-Space inefficiency, both in terms of how much public space must be dedicated to cars, as well as how few people are generally in a given car. Some of even the most bike friendly areas of Montreal need less than 5% of the width of the road, compared to ~65% for cars (driving lanes and parking).\nThere are many upsides to biking:\n-Health benefits from more frequent exercise\n-Environmental benefits from reduced carbon emissions\n-Neutral or positive impact on local businesses\n-More affordable, given the price of gas, maintenance, parking/storage, and insurance for vehicles\n-Much better for the public book-keeping, in terms of how much it costs to maintain bike infrastructure compared to car infrastructure.\nWe are facing a climate crisis and a housing crisis. To tackle those things, we need to reduce emissions and build more housing. Getting rid of space efficient transport and environmentally-friendly options to force people to drive, which requires wide roadways that take up space and force sprawl between plots where housing can be built.\nBiking is a much better way for people to get around, as shown by numerous studies looking at a variety of factors. Not everyone is capable/can afford driving, and creating spaces for other options so that Ontarians can choose what method they want to use is the best way to go forward and be as fair as possible.\nDon't make it harder to build bike lanes. If you remove bike lanes, the bikes won't go away, they'll just force cars to go more slowly by riding in the car lanes. No one wins in that scenario, as bikes are then in more danger of being hurt by drivers, and cars are stuck behind the slower bikes.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed policy is a detriment to the residents of the City of Toronto, increases dangers to both cyclists and motorists and will  increase strain on existing infrastructure.\nI am a resident of the City of Toronto and someone who relies on my car as my primary method of transport. Bike lane infrastructure has been a boon whenever I travel around the city as it decreases significantly the conflicts in speed caused by motor vehicles and cyclists using the same infrastructure. Where they exist I am no longer required to slowly follow a cyclist or give them space while trying to pass on tight city streets.\nThe mixing of usage will lead to an increase in accidents leading to higher insurance premiums, higher healthcare costs and most importantly more dead Torontonians on it's streets.\nThe plan to put the bike lanes on secondary roads is nonsense as these are not the primary roads people wish to go to. This logic is not extended to vehicle or transit options so the singling out of cyclists seems like a nakedly political actions. Individuals travelling by bike will not follow nonsensical slow routes when direct routes exist. This legislation effectively will waste money on infrastructure that is poorly used and do little to help with gridlock faced by the city.\nThe proposed removal of bike lanes will also increase usage of transit and motor vehicles through the busiest parts of the city as people abandon bicycles due to safety concerns. Any capacity increase will quickly be filled through induced demand and we'll be back at the same car commute times with a more dangerous, monetarily wasteful and slower city.\nThe proposed legislation is naked politiking masquerading as policy. No planner would approve these changes and that Doug Fords proclamations to tear up specific bike lanes while his Minister argues that they will be studied indicates that this legislation is a foregone conclusion and this comment period seems like a perfunctory legal requirement that will be ignored for the Premier's wishes.\n"

        "comment": "I wish to respectfully plead for this bill to be turned down. Why? Because I am a cyclist who rides my bike year round.\nPlease advocate on my behalf. We need more bike lanes, not less!\nPlease focus on building effective and connected cycling networks. Trust me, people will use them! I will use them! My friends will use them!\nI currently use the pathetic amount of cycling infrastructure that currently exists and the rest of the time? Guess what, I\u2019m using the car lane! Slowing down the cars! Yup! Give me a bike lane and I\u2019ll get out of the way! Take away my bike lane and I\u2019ll get more in the way!\nPretty obvious but I\u2019ll say it anyway, building more cycling infrastructure will improve car traffic speeds and reduce gridlock.\nRemoving cycling infrastructure will not improve vehicular traffic speeds but I will continue to ride my bike regardless. No bike lanes means I ride in the car lane and slow down cars. It\u2019s actually hilarious because it\u2019s so ironic; this bill is going at the problem completely backwards.\nJust so you know, I also own a car.\nI\u2019m not one of those fanatic cyclists who think cars shouldn\u2019t exist.\nI\u2019m just providing a simple solution to improving car traffic.\nThe solution is, provide alternative modes of transportation and thereby reduce the amount of cars on the road. It\u2019s that simple!\nHowever, it must be said, the cycling infrastructure MUST be effective, connected, safe, complete and, in an perfect world, separated from the dangerous car traffic in order see the FULL potential of transportation by cycling.\nPlease do your absolute best to prevent Bill 212 from going through.\nYou have the ability to improve my life or make it far more dangerous. It\u2019s your call.\n"

        "comment": "The idea behind making bike lanes more difficult to create in order to reduce gridlock throughout the province does not seem to be the most effective way to accomplish this task. A large reason people don\u2019t use bikes in Ontario is that there isn\u2019t the infrastructure in place to support it. You are often required to ride on the side of the roads, which are generally in poor condition and dangerous due to the close proximity to vehicle traffic beside you. Another route to improve this problem would be to create safe and well-constructed bike lanes, incentivizing people to use bikes more often. In Lindsay, Ontario there are no bike lanes and this makes it almost a must to ride your bike on the sidewalk which could prove to be more dangerous to people using these footpaths. There is also mention of the Ontario government considering environmental implications regarding to the development of new cycling lanes. I find this to be partially redundant. While I don\u2019t think we should carve a bike lane through a wetland I do believe that if better infrastructure was created then more people would use bikes and would in turn reduce vehicle emissions which could prove to be much more beneficial long term for the environment.\n"

        "comment": "I urge the Premier's office to reconsider this proposal from intent to impact, and to reverse course entirely. The evidence shows that the bike lanes protect people, improve business. Cars are what causes gridlock, not bike lanes and not bikes. The University avenue bike lanes protect hundreds of hospital staff who bike to work each day! It's neither good policy nor an effective use of taxpayers' money to remove any existing infrastructure involving bicycle lanes.\nTo this point in my comment I have remained fairly impersonal. However, I also am passionate about this as a parent and homeowner in East York, Toronto -- an area primarily impacted by the proposed changes. Our main streets thrive because of our infrastructure that makes room for bikes. Please reconsider as well so that I'm not unsafe when I, a wife and mother, ride my bike to get groceries for dinner, or pick up the kids from school.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

In fact, Bloor is much better to drive on now, honestly. It's the right speed now. People would drive stupidly on Bloor before. Much better design.
