Please respect that critical democratic process.\nOn a personal level, I try to use the 15-minute rule.  I live in South Etobicoke.  If it's only 15 minutes away, I take my bike.  That means I use the Kingsway bike lane 2-4 times a week.  I would miss them if they were gone.  I also bike downtown to work 2 days a week.  For that drive, I use the Martin Goodman trail, which is very busy.  Biking is great exercise, and bike lanes make it safer and encourage more biking.\n"

Removing bike lanes would exacerbate that, both in a physical sense and by signaling that cars are more important.\nThere is also the issue that it's a waste of taxpayer money to remove these bike lane projects, some of which were just completed. It's clearly a step in the wrong direction to remove bike lanes. If we truly want to improve gridlock, it would make more sense to encourage people to commute via cycling, taking public transportation, and walking rather than incentivizing more people to drive.\n"

It is utterly inappropriate that the province should attempt to meddle in municipal matters, and to force such measures through in a timeframe that does not allow for proper consultation. The provincial government should be encouraging the country's largest city to work for all its residents and not discriminating against a significant group of road users for \"reasons\" that are easily revealed for being inaccurate and, apparently, spiteful.\n"

Municipalities are empowered to address issues on local roads and are in the best position to determine priorities concerning the use of municipal right of ways. Requiring provincial approval adds a further level of bureaucracy and seems a very poor use of governmental resources. If the province is concerned about the issue, surely they could develop standards for the conversion of roads (which presumably they will need to do in any event). I think this government should not disturb the current decision-making structure - which allows for the decision-makers at local levels to make decisions that affect local road users. The existing process provides for local accountability and allows municipalities to reflect local values.\n"

        "comment": "Studies have shown that adding car lanes only helps congestion for a brief moment, and then makes it worse once people realize there are more lanes. Studies have also shown that adding bike lanes decreases congestion, through reducing the number of cars on the road. In genera, while the city has lots of people commuting into the city for work, it needs to make getting around the city better for those in the city too. This will involve safer and more bike lanes, more frequent public transportation, and getting rid of some of the cars in the city-not adding. I suggest limiting the street parking on large streets, and using that space for safe bike lanes instead.\nI recently traveled to Europe and had an eye opening experience in realizing how behind Toronto is. Everyone there was biking, transit was fast, those who drove could do it safely because there were fewer cars on the road and more safety protecting bikers from cars. Seeing all this while knowing Toronto is on the verge of making such a tragic decision genuinely made me feel that maybe, Toronto can't be home yet, maybe Toronto will be safer for us in the future, but if this goes through, it will be several steps backwards.\nSigned, someone who bikes, drives, and walks in the city.\n"

Bike lanes in many European countries prove to be very useful and extremely when the network is established and continuing to construct this network will lead to a reduction of gridlocks.

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal. As a resident of Toronto, I am a pedestrian, a driver and occasionally a bicycle rider. I support bike lanes even when they reduce the drivability of streets for cars. It is wasteful of tax dollars to remove bikes that have already been installed. I say this as a tax payer in Toronto but also Ontario. Lastly, the bike lanes that are currently being considered for removal do not have viable alternatives for replacement. Bloor Street, for example, has no equivalent side street that runs parallel. I have tried to ride to High Park with my children using side streets as I was worried about their safety, but I was unable to find a route. So we used the bike lanes on Bloor Street West. They were the only way that my children and I could safely bike to High Park. Removing the bike lanes will decrease our access to our city. With the popularity of e-bikes, we will need even more bikes, not less. I urge the provincial government to stay out of the City\u2019s decision-making on bike lanes.\n"

The bike lanes added to the city of Toronto, including across Danforth, Bloor and University have made it safe for me to cycle to work in a much shorter timeframe.\nBefore the Danforth, Bloor and University lanes were installed, if I wanted to bike to work safely, I had to take a circuitous route, off the main roads, that made my commute about 45 minutes one way (compared to about 30 minutes by subway). With the bike lanes installed, I can do it in 25, which makes it much more likely that I WILL bike.\nPeople have been killed on my bike route, even WITH bike lanes. I will not ever ride on main arteries without lanes because it's simply not safe and I want to be able to arrive home alive for my two boys. Drivers are barely awake in the mornings, and in the evenings, they are angry and rushing to get home. No drivers are paying attention to cyclists on shared roads and it is dangerous for everyone. I am a driver as well, and having bike lanes to separate bikes from traffic makes it easier to drive in the city - it's much more predictable and thus, safer for all.\nThe addition of bike lanes made safety for cyclists and drivers so much better. During peak commute times, they are FULL of cyclists, which suggests that they are needed and promote people to be active. Every one of those cyclists is potentially a car that is OFF the road because they can bike.\nI am appalled that Doug Ford would rip out infrastructure installed by the city. This is a gross overstep of his authority and completely inappropriate. Worse is that he is literally taking away infrastructure that promotes active living and the safety of citizens. This is a terrible look and I'm ashamed that he is the leader of our province.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who commutes using bike lanes, I feel it important to maintain and foster bike corridors. If not only for staying mobile within gridlock and accessing areas inaccessible by TTC for those who do not own cars, growing bike corridors makes for a contribution to lowering our carbon footprint and making Toronto a more walkable city. Toronto suffers from an incredibly poor pedestrian experience, and an already precarious biking experience, removing further bike lanes only takes us a step back from making Toronto an accessible city and taking meaningful action to reduce our emissions. Instead of removing bike lanes, please foster safer driving (many incidents arise from dangerous driving common in Toronto) and actual regulative infrastructure for bikes (safer turns regulated by bike lights, more physical barriers between bikes and cars). I think viewing bikers as the problem is the result of misdirected frustration at poor city infrastructure, not bike lanes and those who use them.\n"

They are important for me to be able to arrive on time and safely.\nThese bike lanes are important for residents of Toronto to able to circulate quickly and easily within the city.  Separated bike lanes expand the pool of people who can safely and quickly commute in town and are key the reducing friction between motorists and cyclists.  I expect the number of people using these bike lanes to steadily increase as they become aware of their convenience.   They have only been in place for a couple of years which is not enough for people to realize their utility.\nThe lanes such as those on Bloor are of particular importance as they are key connectors in creating a network that can allow cyclists to safely navigate across most of the city.  Absent these connectors the remaining bike lanes would be discontinuous and lose much of their value in day to day commuting and utility.\nThe construction of the bike lanes is the result of much study and discussion between politicians and the community and real investment to time and money by all.  I think taxpayers money can have much better uses than to reverse these positive changes.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nFrom an economics perspective, removing bike lanes and returning those lanes back to cars doesn\u2019t reduce traffic jams due to latent demand. That is, when there is only one car lane, there are fewer people whose marginal cost of a trip is higher than the marginal benefit (and thus people undertake the said trip). Increasing the availability of car lanes by returning another one means that now more people will be in the situation where their marginal benefit is higher than the marginal cost, thus undertaking the said trip. This will increase the number of cars, which will mean we are back to the gridlock. Clearly this is not the solution. In order to reduce the gridlock, fewer people need to ride cars into Toronto. The way to achieve this is two-fold: 1. Increase the marginal cost of the trip, for example, by introducing tolls to enter the city centre (London, UK is an example); 2. Providing alternatives such as public transit and bikes. Therefore we need more bike lanes and bike infrastructure, not less.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto driver, I think this legislation is ridiculous. I drive on all three of the streets singled out for potential bike lane removal and the traffic along them is no worse than it has been for the last 5 years in a big city. What has delayed me is construction along these routes to build bike lanes, but that was worth it because I\u2019m now less worried I\u2019m going to hit and kill the many cyclists that use these roads both before and since the lanes were installed. The bike lanes have therefore reduced my stress as a driver. If another several months of construction starts to REMOVE those lanes and make my travel MORE stressful I would be a lot less serene about it. Furthermore, the city process for deciding where and when to install bike lanes has been totally appropriate in my opinion, and it\u2019s been efficient. The construction to make them was some of the fastest and least disruptive I\u2019ve experienced and the full routes were completed very quickly. I don\u2019t want future construction to be more complicated and go through a longer approval process by two levels of government, costing more of my taxpayer dollars when the city is doing just fine on its own. Save my hard earned money and let them handle it, and don\u2019t undo perfectly good work that already got done!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to request the reconsideration of Bill 212. My concerns relate to the provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure (i.e., bike lanes). There are five areas of benefit that bike lanes provide: (1) improved safety for all road users  (including decreased dooring collisions, sideswipe, and rear end collisions) , (2) increased economic outcomes for local businesses  and governments , (3) reduced greenhouse gas emissions , (4) decreased access gap for equity-seeking populations , and (5) improved physical and mental health.  I will now focus on the health, equity, and safety implications of providing protected bike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is a key factor in reducing numerous chronic health conditions and improving individuals\u2019 mental wellbeing. ,   Physical activity, such as through active transportation \u2013 walking, cycling, or other active modes of travel \u2013 is an effective way to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines that show increases to health, well-being, and fitness. Specifically, bike lanes can increase the total distance traveled by cyclists and the overall ridership of residents.  By replacing some car trips with cycling, research indicates that people can gain an additional nine life-years.  Moreover, by not incorporating physical activity into Canadians\u2019 lifestyles, the healthcare system is estimated to spend $6.8 billion per year due to the impact physical inactivity has on chronic diseases.7\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately impacts equity-deserving populations such as racialized persons, people living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and Indigenous peoples. For example, lower income neighbourhoods have historically been poorly designed with increased safety and health risks. However, when active transportation is included into the neighbourhood design (i.e., sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit, roadways) social and health inequities are reduced.6 Given transportation options, individuals can select the affordable and safe travel mode to participate in the workforce, access grocery stores, recreational facilities, and healthcare services.  This research is not unique as researchers and governments globally have identified that high-quality multi-modal infrastructure increases the use of active transportation, and its\u2019 associated social and health benefits. , , ,  Additionally, when individuals have affordable transportation options, they have more money to spend on necessities such as food and rent, or extras such as goods from local business.7\nThird, safety of all roadway users increases with the installation of bike lanes. As outlined by the Canadian Paediatric Society ,  cycling infrastructure that is well-connected (\u2018cycle tracks\u2019) has a halo effect where collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists decreased in a 500m surrounding area. Additionally, protected bike lanes are the safest option for all roadway users compared to painted lines, protected right of ways, and elevated lanes.\nHigh-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more people walking and cycling. Active travel has many proven physical and mental health benefits and impacts chronic disease prevalence. These investments need to be distributed equitably so that every community member can enjoy the benefits of active transportation.\n"
