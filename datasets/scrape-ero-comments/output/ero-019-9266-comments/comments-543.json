        "comment": "This is such a terrible idea, I don't know where to begin. There is so much evidence that bike lanes do not cause gridlock and that they better support local business. Bike lanes save lives, reduce congestion (these riders are not driving or taking transit), and improve air quality. Every other major city in the world is adding bike lanes (NY, Paris, etc.) and is better off for it. Toronto is just playing catch up to other more successful cities. It is so incredibly backward to be removing them. I pay property taxes in the city and use the bike lanes all the time. How many drivers in Toronto actual live here and pay property taxes!?. I do not want the lanes taken away or other ones planned to be cancelled. Cycling is my primary mode of transportation.\nStreets are for everyone, not just cars. Premier Ford clearly hates Toronto and will do anything to delay and destroy it's progress and line the pockets of his business associates (see Ontario Place and Science Centre corruption). He doesn't understand how transportation works and is taking out his frustrations on cyclists. He should be concerned with properly funding transit so it is a better option for many drivers. My husband drives daily to get to the east end of Toronto because he can't rely on transit to get him there on time. Give the TTC more operating funds (not capital!).\nThe Province should also not be taking away municipal rights to design their own streets to make them safe for their most vulnerable users.\nI am so disgusted by this proposal. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n"

This is a nonsensical proposal tailor-made to stir up divisions for political gain.\nRationally, by removing bike lanes, this will remove a key complement to public transit. Without multiple transit modes bundled together in this corridor, many will be forced into cars who currently are not driving. Then, in short order, when all the cars rush back, gridlock will be back, too. Who will bear the costs of this? Locals and folks who are doing their part to support a sustainable path to prosperity for everyone. Cyclists need more support and more separation from traffic, for the good of everyone.\nMajor cities around the world are taking steps away from downtown car congestion.

The City of Toronto has built its bike lanes without any regard for the practicalities of automobile traffic. The city seems to believe its bike lanes will force people out of their cars by making it difficult to travel. This is totally wrong headed . It has resulted in the unbearable gridlock which is bad for the environment and the health of drivers. There are many secondary roads that could be used to accommodate and encourage cycling.\nEven more importantly the resulting grid lock creates life threatening situations when emergency vehicles \u2026ambulances, fire trucks, police \u2026 cannot navigate through the city on these major arteries that  have been congested by bike lanes\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing as a deeply concerned citizen to oppose Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. This bill threatens the heart of our communities, the environment, and the safety of Ontarians. By exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, this legislation allows irreversible harm to sensitive Greenbelt lands, which are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. Environmental Defence has shown that this highway will destroy over 400 acres of critical natural habitat.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion\u2014it will make it worse. Experts around the world have proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need smart, forward-thinking solutions like better public transit and bike lanes. Every bike on the road is one less car, which means less pollution, less noise, and safer streets for everyone.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a huge step backward. These lanes don\u2019t just help cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Plus, local businesses benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Why would we take away something that helps people get around safely and supports our economy? We are now seeing more people riding their bikes than ever on streets like Bloor, University and Yonge. If bike lanes are in place, more people will ride bikes. Period. The Ontario government claiming that < 2% of people in Toronto ride bikes is no longer accurate as this study was completed in 2011, prior to the implementation of numerous bike lanes across the city. A study from 2019 however, found that 44% of Torontonians will bike in good weather to get to school, work, shop or visit friends, on top of an additional 26% of people who only bike for fun or fitness. Through induced demand, more bike lanes have lead to more people riding bikes. Getting rid of the bike lanes and adding more lanes for car traffic will inevitability lead to more cars on the road due to the same principle. The solution to congestion is not removal of bike lanes. In fact, bike lanes are an integral part of the solution, in addition to improving our public transit services. The solution to congestion is not adding more lanes onto the road, as that only encourages more people to drive. Taking away our bike lanes is a temporary fix to a long term problem. Having additional lanes for cars on Bloor, University and Yonge will temporarily address congestion concerns. However with continued population growth and lack of alternative options, the streets will inevitability become congested with cars once again and we will be back at the same problem as we are having now.\nPlease reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that brings people together, not policies that divide us and harm our future. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-centered transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\n"

        "comment": "As a daily commuter by bike, the removal of these bike lanes is sickening and a considerable mis-use of my tax dollars. I've been a bike commuter in major Canadian cities for a decade, and a resident of Toronto for the last 3 years. I believe strongly in bike commuting as I am devoted to a healthy lifestyle, and biking is one way to passively get some exercise during my commutes. I also believe it reduces the number of cars on the road, contributing to less gridlock.\nThis brings me to the next point, that this bill seems to be entirely political, and not based on any evidence that the removal of these bike lanes will contribute to less gridlock. I'm tired of politicians playing politics, and serving their own desires, instead of serving their communities. The truth is, this is a big waste of money with only negative outcomes, and though you can say that is my opinion, the provincial government has presented no data to the contrary.\nAs someone who is fortunate enough to earn a decent wage, I pay a lot of taxes to the province of Ontario, and bills like this make me embarrassed for our government. Bill 212 is a big step back for Toronto and the province as a whole. I wish our premiere would stop trying to be the Mayor of Toronto.\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize a variety of transportation options that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives.\nThe ones in Toronto have barely had the chance to exist, let alone show their benefits. Removing them is a lovely way to benefit the privileged folk with vehicles, but for those who care for the environment and are trying to reduce their emissions footprint, or would otherwise use ttc because they cannot afford a vehicle, these people would be losing out. Denmark has implemented a wonderful bike system, Montreal has integrated theirs as well - both work very well.\nToronto should commit to making safety and environmental footprint a priority. If gridlock is the result, then fewer people might be inclined to drive and May switch to using a bike when possible. Like hiking interest rates to prevent recession, some tough times are needed in order for adjustment to be made in the longer term. If we keep the bike lanes, which result in greater safety for cyclists, than more people will adopt biking as a means of getting around - older people and younger children might be able to feel more secure on the road.\nAs a person who has been hit by vehicles while they cut off bike and don\u2019t check their blind spot - I implore you to keep the bikes. I was on a road with no bike lane, helmet on, lights on.\nAs a person whose uncle was hit and was killed by a driver while he was cycling, I plead you to make roads safer for cyclists. He was on a road without a bike lane, helmet on, lights on.\nAs a person who is lucky enough to share a vehicle with their spouse, and who does get caught in traffic, I still urge you to keep the bike lanes. Expanding them would be even better!\nPlease keep our bike lanes and our cyclists safe.\n"

        "comment": "In recent decades the City of Toronto has listened to its residents and sought to create a more vibrant and equitable public realm. City planners know that it's essential to build infrastructure for a greener, healthier future for future generations. The available data indicates that easing traffic congestion is about giving people more safe and sustainable transportation options, not fewer. Due to recent improvements in our city\u2019s cycling network, people have discovered that not every trip to school, to the store, or to work has to be taken by car. This shift in mindset and behaviour is a direct result of thoughtfully planned and executed pilot projects, consultations, and observations of what works or doesn\u2019t work in other cities. I object to Bill 212 because it interrupts this shift towards a more sustainable and equitable model of transportation, and I am deeply concerned about its potential impact in both the short and long terms. This new legislation will put so many transformative projects at risk and will allow a small minority of voices to block progress on our growing cycling network here in Toronto. And, in communities across the province that are just beginning to embrace the benefits of complete streets, this anti-bike lane legislation could indefinitely pause progress.\nPeople who ride a bike to get around do so for different reasons. Some cannot afford a car and their public transit options aren\u2019t optimal. Others prefer to get some exercise while commuting to work or school. Still others are traveling short distances around parts of the city as they drop a child off at school, then go to work, and then pick up some groceries on their way home. The connectivity of Toronto\u2019s cycling network has now improved significantly, so much so that many people have changed their minds about biking in the city and now choose to hop on their bike for most trips. These people have told anybody who will listen that they started biking because they felt safe on protected bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and other streets they need to use to get around. I was thrilled to see increased bike route options effecting positive change in people\u2019s lives, including improvements in both their physical and mental health. It felt as though people who were previously ignored by city planners were now finally being acknowledged as residents with valid needs. And also, I felt that Toronto was at long last acting on its promise to transform the city into a progressive and sustainable urban centre.\nA dangerous perspective is currently being promoted \u2013 one that pits bikers against drivers. As a seasoned commuter cyclist, I have recently felt a change of attitude from other road and public space users, including drivers, fellow cyclists, and pedestrians. People are on edge. When our leaders point to bike lanes as the cause of gridlock, and therefore the cause of anxiety and/or fear people experience when moving around in the city, they ignore the many real factors at play. The faulty reasoning behind the scapegoating of Toronto bike lanes is damaging to everyone, including drivers. Adding (or bringing back) more lanes for cars will not make gridlock disappear. Perceiving that traffic will be lighter with the addition of a lane, more people will choose to drive, resulting in approximately double the number of vehicles on that arterial route. And disturbingly, people who are now choosing to bike will get back in their cars because they don\u2019t feel safe. The result: gridlock, again. This supply and demand principle has been demonstrated in countless studies and is summed up clearly in this report by UC Davis\u2019s Susan Handy.\nIn Toronto, space is tight. While I would love to see all arterial roads become complete streets, I realize that scenario is unrealistic. Bike routes that meander through neighbourhoods can be effective, and personally I have benefited greatly from the Winona/Shaw north-south route. While traveling on this route I often see over 100 other people biking in the 8 minutes that I\u2019m using it. There is an absence of north-south routes west of Winona/Shaw so in order to be safe, bikers have to go quite a long way around to get to their destination. I can work with that, and I think most Toronto residents understand that since we all need to share available road space, we can\u2019t expect protected bike routes on all major roads. Advocates and regular Toronto residents worked tirelessly with the City of Toronto, residents\u2019 associations, and BIAs for years to secure protected routes on key roads, including Bloor/Danforth. People who use bike lanes are prepared to be reasonable, but when we hear that an alternative route will be created to replace the Bloor bike lanes we fought so hard to get, we must speak up and request our right to a viable route. Any other route will take up to a decade to put in place (and that\u2019s if everything goes smoothly), and it will not be direct since there is no equivalent east-west street running parallel to Bloor within a reasonable distance. So many bikers depend on this route, including University of Toronto students, people commuting to work or running errands, and people delivering food or other services. While it\u2019s true that some of these residents could take the subway, they choose to bike for some of the reasons mentioned above including sustainability and optimal health, and that choice should be applauded. To ease congestion, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to encourage people in single occupancy vehicles to choose TTC instead?\nI sincerely hope you will take my views into consideration. In closing, I would ask you to take a moment and consider the bigger picture. When we think of Toronto in 50 years, in 100 years, even in 200 years, what kind of city do we envision? If we expect this city to survive and thrive, we need to support sustainable development. We can\u2019t encourage people to make sustainable choices if the infrastructure is not in place.\n"
