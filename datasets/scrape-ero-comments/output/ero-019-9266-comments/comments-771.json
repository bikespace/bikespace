        "comment": "Bike lanes are crucial to a healthy, and environmentally friendly downtown core. Most importantly, bike lanes in the City of Toronto should be a discussion that remains municipal. To have the province holding power over something that is inherently municipal is extremely unfair, and bias. For instance, why is Toronto being treated differently than any other municipality? Should the province be given the right to decide where certain bike lanes are allowed in Oakville?\nAdditionally, to remove bike lanes is inherently  bad for environment, and a waste of resources. The environmental impact from forcing people to drive or transit would already increase, but the environmental impact of having to go and remove bike lanes is dastardly.\nAs a born and raised Torontonian, I do not support this bill. Let the people who live in Toronto have ownership over what happens in their own city.\n"

        "comment": "Submission By:  Women in Urbanism Canada\nOn October 21, 2024, the Honourable Prabmeet Sarkaria, Minister of Transportation, introduced Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 in the Ontario Legislature.   Bill 212 is an omnibus bill that would introduce and amend several pieces of legislation. This submission focuses on Schedule 4: Amendments to the Highway Traffic Act (HTA), specifically as they relate to the province's proposed Bike Lane Framework.\nWithin this framework:\n\u2022 Municipalities would be required to seek Provincial approval to allow for new bike lane construction where the design for the bicycle lane would reduce the number of marked lanes available for travel by motor vehicle traffic.\n\u2022 Municipalities would be required to submit information to the Ministry about existing bicycle lanes, where the addition of the existing bicycle lane reduced the number of marked lanes for motor vehicle travel. Municipalities would be compelled to collect and provide information about existing bike lanes on a set / periodic basis.\nWomen in Urbanism Canada, is a women identified and led community working to transform Canadian cities into more equitable, enjoyable, and sustainable places for everyone.  We inform, inspire and mobilize women identified and led transformations in Canadian cities. As such, Women in Urbanism Canada resolutely believes this legislation would have negative impacts on countless women, girls, gender-diverse people, and their intersections of age, ability, class, and race, as they navigate their communities by bicycle and other mobility devices. Women in Urbanism Canada strongly encourages you to discard Schedule 4, of Bill 212 - the Bike Lane Framework of the legislation, and highly invest in active transportation infrastructure for everyone. The cost to taxpayers in municipalities should be concerning to your government at this conjecture, and even moreso, the costs of lost lives due to unsafe road ways cannot be understated. Data from the City of Toronto indicated that In the past ten years (2015 \u2013 2024 to-date), 28 people have been killed and 380 people have been seriously injured while cycling in the City of Toronto. 68% of these collisions took place on streets without safe cycling accommodations.\nThrough Bill 212, the Province has stated they are seeking to \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\" but research and experiences from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating traffic congestion in a growing city, while improving safety and mobility. People who rely on motor vehicle travel also benefit from bikeways when enough other people choose to leave their car at home. It is well-documented that small reductions in the number of vehicles on a road can produce large improvements in traffic flow. Investing in convenient alternatives to driving, such as bikeways and public transit, is a necessary component of a successful traffic congestion management strategy. Those traveling by car also benefit from bikeways due to the increased safety and comfort when people cycling are not operating in mixed traffic.\nThis proposed legislation also risks reinforcing a car-centric approach to urban planning that prioritizes vehicles over pedestrians and cyclists. Limiting bike lane installation and removing environmental assessment processes for major highway projects does nothing to reduce gridlock. In fact, it actively ignores the growing demand for more affordable, sustainable, safe, and diverse transportation options.\nTransportation and Equity\nMany people across the province rely on cycling as an essential mode of travel, including in areas currently underserved by safe cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. Many studies in urban centres across the province have identified the lack of safe cycling infrastructure in their neighborhoods as an important, unmet mobility need. The absence of bikeways has a disproportionately negative impact on low-income communities, seniors, women and gender-diverse people, Indigenous, Black and other communities of people of colour.\nCanada's first large-scale count of people cycling by gender, age, and race found that there were twice as many men cycling than women. Numerous studies on this gender gap have cited safety concerns as the number one reason women do not cycle and/or do not cycle as frequently as men. Research has shown that women may actually be at greater risk while cycling. A field experiment found that drivers were significantly more likely to pass a woman cycling within 3 feet than a man cycling, with 73% of the studies\u2019 reported encroachments happening to women. Furthermore, this experiment found that passing distance was greatest on roads with protected bicycle facilities, with none of the reported encroachments occurring on the protected bike lane. In another study, women were found to be almost twice as likely as men to be the victims in \u2018near miss\u2019 incidents while cycling.  Women already face unequal access to transportation options, as they are less likely than men to own a personal vehicle or to travel by car. Supporting more women to cycle and travel by other safe and sustainable means helps to reduce congestion, saves families money, and supports local businesses.\nThis proposed legislation would not help to address this cycling gender gap, but would instead expand it further. If the bill slows down, stops, or even goes as far as reversing the implementation of cycling infrastructure, this would cause significant harm to people of all ages, races, and genders, and would be most harmful to those who already face transportation barriers.\nWe hope you\u2019ll reconsider how this bill would impact women, girls, youth, gender diverse people, seniors, low income, racialized and persons with disabilities as well as everyone else, before you hit the gas on this dangerous legislation.\nResources:\nBicycles, Gender, and Risk: Driver Behaviors When Passing Cyclists https://genderpolicyreport.umn.edu/bicycles-gender-and-risk/\nPedal Poll/Sondo V\u00e9lo 2021: A Community Science Project on Who Cycles in Canada\nInvestigating the rates and impacts of near misses and related incidents among UK cyclists - ScienceDirect https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140515002236\nNational Travel Survey England 2014 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uplo\u2026\nMen and women make different travel choices \u2014 understanding those is key to achieving pollution and climate targets\nhttps://www-politico-eu.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.politico.eu/article/\u2026\nTransportation in the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/koch_wp13jk1.p\u2026\nMore women commute by public transit than men, census data shows https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/11/29/more-women-commute-by-publi\u2026\n"

The Danforth feels safe and it's a great ability for people to be able to get to Toronto core from Danforth East within 30 mins on bike lane. Faster than the TTC, GO, and even if there were 2 car lanes, the way Queen St E has, the bike lane is the quickest.\nI'm a pedestrian, a bicyclist, a car and motorcycle rider, as well as one that takes any transit lines available. If you want more kids to be buying into the city, you have to make it sexy. Being stuck in traffic ain't sexy, and additional lanes for cars isn't going to fix it.\n"

Getting rid of this bikelane among all the other ones scares me as already I have been hit by cars in other street without (and with) bike lanes. Bike lanes keep bikers safer and by getting rid of them the rise of accidents and deaths is sure to go up. This will also cause more traffic as bikers will be forced to ride on the road with cars. I am genuinely scared for what will happen if these lanes are removed but I assure it will not solve traffic problems.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation will do very little regarding gridlock in the urban centres and may even worsen gridlock. There is no evidence provided by the minister regarding the causes of gridlock in the municipalities. Some of the Minister's public comments were even evidently false. There is gridlock on the 401 without any bike lanes, there are many intersections in the cities without bike lanes that have gridlock. As a matter of fact, you are more likely to find a bank branch or a coffee shop at an intersection with gridlock than a bike lane.\nStudies in many parts of the world have shown that merging and braking are the main causes of gridlock. The gridlock on the 401 is for a large part caused by aggressive drivers who constantly switch lanes forcing other drivers to brake to maintain a safe distance, and by the design of the 401 where the right lanes often turn into exit lanes forcing drivers to merge if they need to stay on the 401.\nIn urban centres, a single lane of vehicles with dedicated left and right turn lanes (and thus no merging) has less gridlock than 2 lanes without those dedicated lanes. In theory, two lanes of car traffic can hold more vehicles and subsequently, people assume that traffic will go faster. In reality, every 4-lane street with vehicle parking during off-peak times will have cars stopped during peak times leading to unnecessary merging into the left lane. When merged in the left lane, the driver will be stuck behind a left-turning car. More than half of the year, many of the 4-lanes streets in the cores are reduced to 2 lanes anyway to provide outdoor dining options for the restaurants on those streets.\nThe streets with dedicated bike lanes have dedicated left-turn lanes, so drivers will not get stuck behind a left-turning car. They also have dedicated parking spots, so people can legally park and grab money from the ATM or a coffee at Tim Horton's. I drive quite regularly on the three streets where the premier and minister want to remove the bike lanes. Most of the time when there is gridlock, an illegally parked vehicle is blocking both the bike lane and half of the live traffic lane or a vehicle is trying to make an illegal left or u-turn. I also remember the situation before the bike lanes were installed and density was lower; I always tried to avoid driving on those streets as travel times were unpredictable: Christy to St George could take anything from 4 to 35 minutes and sometimes even longer. Now with the bike lanes, it takes between 5 minutes in normal traffic to 8 minutes in heavy traffic. The longest was 10 minutes when the subway was closed down and buses were added.\nAs much of the gridlock is caused by bad traffic behaviour, common sense would dictate us to increase enforcement and tighten driver licensing. This would result in more driver's licenses being suspended, but those drivers will still need to go from point a to point b and need to find an alternative mode of transportation. Where the removal of bike lanes will result in less options.\nHow can we improve traffic in urban areas? The easiest solution is to have dedicated left- and right-turn lanes AND signals. Especially in urban centres with a lot of pedestrian traffic, dedicated right-turn signals will allow motorized vehicles to make safe right turns without impediment. The simultaneous left-turn signals for N->E and S->W can have dedicated E->N and W->S right-turn signals for the most efficient use of an intersection. Another option would be to focus on transferiums: parking options outside the urban cores where transit fare to the cores is included in the parking rates.\nWe also need to plan for the future. The government's policy in urban areas is to increase densification, especially near Mass Transport Stations. This means more pedestrians and cyclists as the new developments have no minimum parking rates anymore. In midtown Toronto, one development submission has 6 resident parking spots for 357 dwellings. The residents who don't have a motorized vehicle as a mode of transportation will use micro-mobility besides public transit. Even if they only act as pedestrians, they will be in the intersections to go to the TTC entrances adding to the gridlock.\nTens of thousands of people are moving into the downtown and midtown cores. They will shop locally as they do not have access to vehicles to go to the big box stores and monster plazas. They will shop on the main streets in the cores, they will work in the offices in the cores. Many cyclists on Bloor, Yonge and University work and/or shop on Bloor, Yonge, or University. The BIAs in the cores confirm this. They know that most of the motorized vehicles on Bloor, Yonge and University are not bringing business and just passing through. The BIAs know that pedestrians and cyclists are the ones who bring business and allow the businesses to survive. When vehicular traffic increases, less pedestrians will frequent those shops.\nMany of the malls in the suburban areas with minimal gridlock are currently suffering. These are easily accessible by motorized vehicles. That raises the question of whether removing the gridlock in urban centres will remove the economic losses of an estimated $11B or result in different, even larger economic losses.\nLastly, a small comment regarding safety. Every year, many pedestrians and cyclists die on our streets. No economic gain justifies the enormous loss of life. The two options I provided for easing gridlock will also prevent unnecessary and unacceptable loss of life. The Minister claims that he feels the pain of people from Brampton travelling by car into Toronto, I wished he would feel the pain of the families whose loved ones are killed by drivers.\n"

        "comment": "We strongly believe bike lanes along major streets, particularly Bloor, should be removed. Traffic congestion and blocked intersections- due to a combination of reduced driving lanes, long term construction such as Riverview / Bloor and diverted buses from Jane subway create an enormous hazard for pedestrians. Particularly for anyone with baby strollers or walkers. I was almost hit by a car turning at Bloor and Riverview which didn\u2019t see pedestrians, due to the change in intersection design to accommodate bike lanes.\nJust look at the statistics!\nRefer to the City of Toronto cycling stats on bike and car volume up to June 2024.\nAt Durie / Windermere, Westbound, there was a daily average 8772 cars and 407 bikes.  So bikes making up about 5% of total traffic are allotted 50% of the roadway. There are no stats on pedestrians, but general observation indicates far more pedestrians than bicycles. This clearly shows the City is catering to a minority group, which is unacceptable. These stats also show use of bike lanes are increasing - and so is vehicle traffic. So the City\u2019s claim that increased use of bikes allows for a greener city is unsubstantiated along this stretch of Bloor, perhaps other areas too.\n"

As a resident of Huntsville, I believe this proposed legislation would have far-reaching negative consequences for my community, our environment, and our overall quality of life.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure that promote safer and more sustainable transportation. They encourage active commuting, reduce traffic congestion, and contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions\u2014critical goals as we confront the challenges of climate change. Furthermore, bike lanes improve road safety, not just for cyclists, but for all road users by creating clear, predictable spaces for each mode of travel.\nIn addition to their environmental and safety benefits, bike lanes support local economies. Support of small businesses is a consistent talking point from this government, and I believe this proposed law would negatively impact businesses in my community. Studies consistently show that bike-friendly areas see increased foot traffic, which benefits small businesses. By discouraging active transportation through this ban, we risk stalling progress in building vibrant, livable communities.\nI urge you to reconsider and oppose Bill 212. Investments in sustainable infrastructure, including bike lanes, are investments in our province\u2019s future. We must prioritize policies that foster health, safety, and environmental responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "am a driver and a cyclist. Traffic is very bad in Toronto, but removing the Bloor bike lanes will not solve that. Studies show that bike lanes are a good thing, and increase business! If the MOT wants to make a positive economic impact (as he claims removing lanes will do) we should actually build more. Yes it can be inconvenient as a driver, but that doesn't mean they should be removed. Bike lanes feel more comfortable to bike safely through the city. Meaning one less person driving or using public transit. One less car parked somewhere. These bike lanes are essential.\nIt's also incredibly frustrating the Premiere of Ontario thinks he should be making municipal decisions. He should not. He should leave it to the city government. I understand people in Etobicoke are frustrated by the bike lanes, but people in Toronto like them and use them. The Minister of Transportation continues to cite decades old stats to try to back up this bill, when in reality I'm sure he and the Premier know that today's stats wouldn't support removing the lanes. Drivers will always be angry and frustrated by traffic, removing bike lanes will not change that. The Premier will still receive calls from angry drivers until the end of time.\nOther major cities are building more bike infrastructure, not removing it. Why? Because they increase business for local shops and increase safety for cyclists (and drivers!) among other proven positivies. Toronto (and Ontario) should continue moving forward to the future, even if it's not always by car.\n"

        "comment": "In response to Bill 212, it's important to highlight the numerous benefits of incorporating bike lanes into city infrastructure. Dedicated bike lanes significantly improve safety by reducing the risk of accidents between cyclists and motor vehicles, making roads safer for everyone. Encouraging cycling can also decrease the number of cars on the road, easing traffic congestion and reducing commute times. Bicycles produce zero emissions, helping to reduce air pollution and the city's carbon footprint. Cycling promotes physical activity, which can improve cardiovascular health, reduce obesity rates, and enhance overall well-being. Additionally, bike lanes can save cities money on road maintenance, as bicycles cause less wear and tear on roads compared to motor vehicles. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop locally, which can increase foot traffic and revenue for local businesses. Bike lanes contribute to a more livable city by promoting a cleaner, quieter, and more pleasant urban environment. They make cycling a more viable transportation option for a wider range of people, including those who cannot afford a car. Furthermore, bike lanes can foster a sense of community by encouraging social interactions and community events centered around cycling. Lastly, cities known for their bike-friendly infrastructure can attract tourists who prefer to explore by bike, boosting the local tourism industry.\n"

This tragedy is just going to become more and more common if existing bike lanes are removed. Taking bikers of the streets is also simply going to increase the vehicular congestion on our roads and overcrowding in the subways.\nI imagine Premier Ford won\u2019t heed any of this common sense feedback however, as this comment process is solely to assuage regulatory procedures and not actually consider what the vast majority of what downtown residents want.\n"
