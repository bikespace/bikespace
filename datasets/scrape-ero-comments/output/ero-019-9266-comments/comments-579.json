        "comment": "The bike lanes in the downtown core do not change the fact that downtown was never built\nfor the amount of cars that it sees on a regular basis. Poor planning in building so many condominiums without the proper infrastructure has lead to the situation we are in right now. Removing the bike lanes in the downtown core will solve absolutely nothing. In fact, the addition of bike lanes is the first bold move towards a change in mindset for sustainable transportation, especially in the congested downtown areas. The number of bicyclists has more than tripled since this change has been implemented. Instead of going backwards, why don\u2019t we consider what  incentives we can provide to those who chose to bike. And what message are we sending our next generations in term of sustainability and healthy choices? It\u2019s time for the provincial government to really stop managing the province like a business and find innovative ways to propel Ontario forward.\n"

        "comment": "With all of the people I've spoken with, nobody wants bike lanes anywhere. It's a waste of money and resources to build these bike lanes. I've heard the argument that they have them in Europe and other parts of the world. Obviously, those who make these statements are na\u00efve about the development of European versus North American cities. North American cities never had conquering armies marching up or down Yonge Street. Or march along Bloor Street or any other street. China is much in the same boat as Europe. Except, in China the vast majority were poor, who could not afford cars and therefore used oxen carts and bicycles.\nBesides, all of these major routes have a great subway system, that all can use, whether your pre-teen or elderly.\nAnd, since when do we have an elected dictatorship? Once people are elected, they then start telling the people what they (the elected are going to do). Not what they were chosen to represent. A great example is in Mississauga, over 3,500 people signed a petition to stop the bike lane along Bloor Street. The elected body is ignoring the will of the people and are charging ahead to do what they want, not the people of the riding.\n"

This effort will simply worsen congestion, risk the lives of vulnerable road users and exacerbates division in society. We need a vision for the future that promotes fast, affordable and sustainable transportation, along with healthy living not costly regressive policies. If you want improve the experience for motor vehicle users and all other road users, a good starting point would be to police aggressive driving and the use of vehicles as a weapon of intimidation.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is excessively heavy-handed, ungrounded in any apparent objective evidence or data, and an entirely unnecessary exercise in fixing something that, in addition to not being broken, is in fact working well. It is furthermore an unnecessary, infuriating and inexcusable intrusion by the province into the domain of municipalities that attempts to overturn the latter's careful planning, study and consultation for no other reason than the fact that the Premier has been angered by traffic on Bloor Street close to where he resides.\nIt is hard to understate the illegitimacy of formulating policy and legislation in the manner that this bill has been abruptly pulled together based on the Premier's personal priorities and pushed through the legislature with no consultation of evidence or stakeholders and with an exemption from the normal environmental review process. The approach being used does not align with Ontario's or Canada's democratic traditions or values. It will be a low and shameful moment for Ontario if the bill passes, and another depressing example of a bullying, intransigent government acting on its own angry prerogatives that have minimal connection with what Ontario citizens actually want or with how they should be served by their elected representatives.\n"

        "comment": "Re Bike Lanes on Sheppard Ave. E. At an additional cost bike lanes on this street would be welcomed if no lanes of road were closed. This could be accomplished by widening Sheppard Ave. E. Using parts of bolelevards and moving sidewalks.Iy appears there are very few Cyclists using the street now and in winter probably fewer still. The wider street could then accommodate the same traffic flow and make Cycling safer. The street is already congested due to the increase in car traffic and with the amount of new development coming on stream, traffic congestion and pollution will only increase.\n"

        "comment": "Let Toronto make their own decisions about bike lanes. The city cannot function if we all have cars it doesn\u2019t work. We need transit and bikes to work like other large cities in Europe.\nBoston, New York and LA have proven that more lanes do not equate to less traffic. Robert Moses who created all the highways in new York, kept on adding more highways to ease congestion, and it never works it invites more cars. You learn this in civic planning class 101 it\u2019s such basic facts it is so crazy the government thinks this.\nWe need alternative transport for a densely populated city.\nSuggesting that getting rid of bike lanes to help drivers is so poorly researched and is based on just assumption. Human behaviour is more complicated.\nMore lanes more traffic, it\u2019s been proven over and over\nI drive on Bloor to get to work, and I have not experienced any negative effect from the reduction of lanes. Some dumb driver was always stopped on the second land anyways causing more gridlock and aggressive drivers, plus sharing the road with those bikes and Uber delivery? No thanks\nToronto isn\u2019t designed for people to come out of town and be able to drive around and go home it\u2019s not designed for you. People who live here get it. People drive down in their huge oversized cars and expect the parking to be available and easy, it\u2019s not designed for you it\u2019s designed for the millions of people here.\nBike lanes need time to establish a culture of bikers. If we have safe lanes over a generation people will choose it over expensive and slow moving cars.\nThanks I hope this helps in some way. Very frustrated to see such poorly researched plans\n"

It is much simpler and safer for cars and bikes to be separated, having bike lanes allows this.\n5. Bike lanes support transit options, allowing people to safely reach Public transit hubs from further away. This greatly increases each transit hubs range.\n6.

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not improve traffic. Our city is not built to handle the volume of cars we have and a few extra lanes will not change that. What Will improve traffic is reducing the number of cars on the road by improving infrastructure for alternative methods of transportation (eg. Subway, BIKES), which is the exact opposite of removing bike lanes. All this accomplishes is endangering commuters and wasting our tax money. Is there any question why our government wants people buying cars and gas? \ud83e\udd2d\n"

        "comment": "Stop removing bike lanes in Toronto and beef up public transit.\nIt\u2019s horrible to drive in the city but that\u2019s the fault of an increase of cars post-pandemic. So reduce the number of cars.\nI was a long-time resident of Toronto and when I lived there I rued the weekend when an influx of cars from the suburbs would arrive and make my weekend errands hell. Hopping on my bike was a huge relief. I could avoid car traffic and still get around the city to do what I wanted. Did I take my life in my hands? Yes, because until recently, my presence on the road was not protected. I enjoyed the city and my commute and my errands much more once my bike and I were segregated from car traffic. Residents of the city (and vistors who hop on bikes to get around) need safe, car-free lanes.\nPost-pandemic there is little incentive for suburban visitors to leave their cars at home. Make the Go cheap on weekends. Make it easy to get around the city by increasing the available public transit (Post-pandemic I\u2019ve waited 45 mins for a Dundas streetcar).\nI\u2019m now a resident of Hamilton, and I\u2019m happy to leave my car at home and come in to the city via GO. I\u2019d come in more than just for work if there was a good reason to (e.g. an event, a weekend special Price for the GO, extra train trips to make coming in and getting out easier).\nFinally, roads like Queen West or Dundas West where there are no bike lanes (pre- and post- pandemic ) were and still are slow moving. People park their cars so you only get one lane for traffic anyway.\nStop pandering to drivers (it\u2019s not the 1960s) and start doing what\u2019s best for a modern Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Removing and preventing the construction of bike lanes would significantly decrease safety for cyclists, especially impacting those who have no other option to get around, like people who cannot afford a car, or food delivery cyclists who need to ride a bicycle for work to deliver food quickly within the city. Additionally, it would make it slower and more complicated for me as a driver to get around by car if bicycles are sharing the lane of travel I am in, instead of being in a safe, dedicated lane. Also, this legislation would not achieve its intended goal of reducing car congestion, and would actually serve to decrease road capacity, since the number of cars required to cause congestion in a motor vehicle lane is much smaller than the number of bikes required to cause congestion in a bike lane. Not to mention the induced demand for extra cars on the road from would-be cyclists without a safe option to ride their bikes, and the associated pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, the removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue would come at a cost of millions of dollars, cause significant disruption and traffic during the transition, and needlessly send brand-new building material to the landfill.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes in the City of Toronto keep cyclists safe. Taking them away will put more lives at risk. Torontonians need multiple transportation options to move through the city, including cycling infrastructure.\nThe only way to reduce congestion on city streets is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. That means investing in all forms of transportation including cycling and public transit. No matter the cost to remove the bike lanes, that is a cost to undo something that doesn't need to be undone. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars. The city approved and installed the bike lanes and they have been well used. Every single time I drive across the city, especially along Bloor/Danforth, there are many cyclists using the bike lanes. I myself would never cycle on a bike-lane free Toronto street.\nAs a car driver, I feel better that cyclists have their own space. As a car driver, the things I see that cause congestion are BAD DRIVERS (distracted, causing accidents, blocking intersections, illegally parked) and construction. Bad drivers block/park in bike lanes now. Any new lanes of traffic will just be full of the same, illegally parked cars blocking traffic. It will not make a difference.\nAny construction to remove bike lanes will cause more congestion and risk harming accessibility to local businesses. Local BIAs have made statements that bike lanes have improved their community.\nI hope the government listens to the people of TORONTO and those who would be immediately impacted by this decision. This should be a municipal decision and it is aggravating that the provincial government is even taking the time to discuss this when there are so many more important issues at hand.\n"

In Canada, vehicle pollution contributes to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.\nEvery person we incentivize to take transit, cycle, or walk over driving is a win for public health. Cycle lanes make it safer for cyclists and pedestrians. Frankly, we need to make driving less convenient so fewer people do it.\nAs the province increases in population and becomes more dense, there is not enough space for everyone to drive in a car. A car takes up too much space. Converting existing bike lanes into car lanes is not a long-term, or even near-term solution. You will never be able to add enough car lanes for our projected growth. The only solution to congestion is to make it easier to take public transit, walk, and cycle.\nI'm eagerly looking forward to more cycle lanes and active transport in my city. Please do not stop my city from doing that.\n"

Removing bike lanes that are already there will cost the tax payers an enormous amount of money, money that could be used to increase transit infrastructure for low income individuals that do not use cars. Allowing for more cars will make the roads less safe, increase congestion and cause more environmental harm. Bicycles and transit should be the priority of any infrastructure bill, not cars. Shame on you Doug Ford for this proposal.\n"
