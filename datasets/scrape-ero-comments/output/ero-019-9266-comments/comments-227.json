        "comment": "I strongly oppose this change to prioritize car traffic over bike lanes for a number of reasons:\n1. Studies have shown repeatedly that adding lanes to reduce girdlock only creates short-term improvements before it returns worse than before\n2. Increased car traffic on city streets makes them worse places to be (loud, smelly, unsightly), which is particularly harmful to small businesses\n3. Traffic is a local issue, and I don't believe the province should be able to restrict how municipalities can tackle local issues\n4. Removing bike lanes forces cyclists onto the road (where they are at high risk of injury from cars) or the sidewalk (where they create a hazard for pedestrians)\nUltimately the only sustainable solution to gridlock is going to be removing cars from the road by giving people good alternatives to driving. This shortsighted policy change is only going to exacerbated the existing issues with gridlock and lead to an even less sustainable future.\n"

        "comment": "Unfortunately, Mr. Ford's pledge to remove bike lanes in Toronto is a cynical, populist ploy to his motorist suburban base. None of this pledge is grounded in actual evidence based study. Numerous articles and studies, for example this CBC article and another show that bike lanes are not\u00a0the cause\u00a0of congestion and in fact contribute to a city's ability\u00a0to foster diverse modes of transportation\u00a0in an urban setting that is cheap, healthy and green. As a Toronto resident who cycles to and from the office and uses cycling as their primary mode of transport, this bill puts my safety and my ability to transit the city effectively at risk. Mr. Ford is circumventing my (and many other Toronto residents') municipal democratic rights by overriding what was overwhelming Toronto City Council's (21-1) choice to implement more bike lanes in the city. He has previously disregarded Torontonian's democratic\u00a0rights by cutting our city council in half using the notwithstanding\u00a0clause, a tool which should only, if ever, be used in extreme emergency situations, not as a petty vendetta to punish those who didn't vote for him. Mr. Ford is not the Mayor of Toronto and should stay in his lane, so to speak. He should worry about the problems that plague this province that actually fall under his purview to govern. We do not need more cars, and more grids to lock in this city. We need to become a modern, global city that fosters walkable, bikeable and transit friendly communities and that isn't obsessed with urban sprawl and suburbia.\nIn order for Toronto to effectively deal with its congestion problem, we need to use real, innovative methods that are grounded in evidence. My observations and suggestions as a long time Toronto resident:\n1. Like many other global cities with this issue, Toronto needs to implement a congestion tax / toll to drive in the city. I know Mr. Ford is allergic to the \"T\" word, but the only way to address this problem is to have LESS cars in the city, not create grounds for MORE.\u00a0Driving should not be the primary mode of transport for people to commute or get around the city, it should be leveraged as one of many options, and those who choose to drive in the city who don't live here and pay city taxes should have to pay to drive in the city.\n2. As I am sure you are well aware, Toronto's public transit needs to be more effective. As it stands right now, our streetcars are too slow and obstruct driving. On the other hand, too many cars in the city obstruct effective movement of streetcars. I can't think of any other city where trams make traffic stop and let people directly onto the road, not only is it dangerous, it causes massive delays in the flow of traffic. Streetcars need their own dedicated lanes with the platforms included therein (for example, the Spadina and St. Clair routes, when in operation). I know this is an ideal state and may be difficult to fully implement, but it should inspire new solutioning.\n3. To assist the above, we then need to remove street parking on major streets. Why do we give up a whole lane on busy streets for parked cars? I don't see Mr. Ford scapegoating pointless and excessive street parking. A regular feature of driving in Toronto is two lanes being squished into one with no warning because street parking begins on a major street. If we limit the amount of cars in the city, we wouldn't need this much parking. It defies logic to allow parked cars to limit flow on major arteries - it certainly isn't the fault of bike lanes. People can park their cars on side streets, and we can make carve outs for those whose actual residence is on a major street.\n4. Allowing yielding left turns at major Toronto intersections is\u00a0a constant cause of congestion and dangerous driving. Because we have so much traffic and so many pedestrians, it is often the case that one or two cars get through on a yellow, while everyone behind is trying to swerve around these cars into the right lane, only to have to swerve back left because of street parking begins with no signs or warning (see point above). This hardly makes any sense. Eliminates left turns entirely at intersections that are busy and don't have dedicated turning lights and lanes. Furthermore, we should be striving toward models in other cities (for example Montreal) that only allow right turns on green lights. Right turn behaviour on reds causes dangerous driving and threatens both pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers.\nThe model in Toronto for major streets, or some version of it, should strive toward effective transit with its own dedicated lane and platforms, car lanes unobstructed by street parking, and protected bike lanes alongside. This would allow for a diversity of transportation methods in the city without having to villainize or scapegoat one particular stakeholder. This, along with a congestion tax for those who CHOOSE to drive into the city, would go a long way. Right now, Mr. Ford is cynically and unfairly blaming inner city folk for Toronto's problems, just because we are not part of his base. I am sure there are many who are part of his base as well, who use bikes to get around our city.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation requiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval to implement new bike lanes that would remove existing car lanes is based on flawed assumptions about how to address traffic congestion. The approach fails to acknowledge evidence from urban planning and transportation studies, which show that more roads and highways do not resolve congestion. Furthermore, it overlooks research demonstrating that bike lanes do not increase congestion but rather provide substantial benefits for local economies, public health, and community connectivity.\nCounterpoints to Proposed Legislative Objectives\n1. Increasing Highways and Roads Does Not Reduce Congestion\nThe notion that new highways or expanded roadways reduce traffic congestion has been consistently debunked. The phenomenon of \u201cinduced demand\u201d shows that increasing roadway capacity only encourages more driving, thereby returning congestion to prior levels or even worsening it over time. Research in Texas, California, and New York has shown that adding highway lanes or constructing new highways initially reduces congestion but leads to increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the long term. Specifically, studies from the University of California, Davis, and Texas A&M Transportation Institute show that adding new lanes leads to a nearly proportional increase in traffic within five years \ufffc \ufffc.\nInstead, municipalities worldwide have achieved congestion reduction by investing in multimodal transportation solutions, including cycling infrastructure. For instance, Paris and Amsterdam have reduced road congestion by emphasizing active transport and decreasing car dependency through extensive networks of protected bike lanes and pedestrian infrastructure. In these cases, cycling infrastructure has led to substantial decreases in traffic volume and an overall reduction in congestion.\n2. Bike Lanes Alleviate, Not Contribute to, Congestion\nBike lanes can actually alleviate traffic congestion by offering residents a safe and efficient alternative to driving, particularly for shorter trips, which constitute a significant proportion of urban traffic. Cycling infrastructure allows for more people to be transported within the same space, moving more people while using fewer resources than car-centric transportation. In Toronto, the Bloor Street bike lanes have improved transportation efficiency and safety without increasing congestion. Data from the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation show that businesses in the area experienced economic growth after bike lanes were installed \ufffc.\nFurthermore, studies from New York and Minneapolis show that bike lanes can reduce pressure on existing roadways. New York\u2019s protected bike lanes on major routes like 8th Avenue have led to a reduction in car traffic volumes by facilitating quicker, safer travel for cyclists, in turn reducing vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and incidents, which are major contributors to congestion \ufffc.\nImportance of Multimodal Infrastructure Over Car Dependency\nExpanding multimodal infrastructure\u2014such as bike lanes, public transit, and pedestrian spaces\u2014reduces dependence on cars, which is crucial in addressing congestion in growing urban environments. Cities that prioritize multimodal transport options see lower rates of gridlock. For instance, Copenhagen and Barcelona have reduced car traffic and congestion by investing in integrated cycling infrastructure and transit systems. These initiatives have made transportation more efficient and accessible for all residents while cutting down on emissions and improving air quality \ufffc.\nEconomic, Health, and Environmental Benefits of Cycling Infrastructure\nIn addition to alleviating congestion, cycling infrastructure provides significant economic, health, and environmental benefits. Studies from Portland State University show that retail sales along streets with bike lanes often outperform those without them, as bike lanes increase foot and bike traffic that benefits local businesses. This is evident not only in international cities but also in Canadian settings, such as along Bloor Street in Toronto, where businesses have reported increased or stable customer visits and sales following bike lane installation \ufffc.\nCycling infrastructure also promotes public health by encouraging active transportation, reducing car-related air pollution, and improving mental well-being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), active transport options, including bike lanes, are essential to addressing public health crises related to air pollution and sedentary lifestyles.\nStop planning around cars and plan around people\nThe proposed legislation restricting municipalities from implementing new bike lanes contradicts evidence-based transportation and urban planning strategies that demonstrate the value of cycling infrastructure in reducing congestion and enhancing community livability. Instead of mandating approvals for bike lanes, the province would benefit from supporting municipalities in creating multimodal infrastructure that provides residents with safer, more efficient, and healthier transportation options. A comprehensive approach that includes bike lanes, pedestrian areas, and public transit investments will foster a resilient, economically vibrant Ontario equipped to meet the demands of a growing population.\n"

I am an Ontario resident residing in Toronto (York).\nI wish to comment on the proposed Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\", and voice my oppoisition to it.\nGiven the nature of rapid climate change and its effect on the food chain, extreme weather events, forest fires and population migration, I feel it is unwise to oppose any effort to increase the number of Canadians using non-vehicular forms of transportation. Bike lanes keep cyclists, and increasingly users of electric scooters safe from vehicle traffic, reducing the number of cars on the road and the amount of CO2 gas emitted into our atmosphere. Reducing the number of cars on the road is the only way to reduce the gridlock the province and GTA in particular are experiencing - the bill falsley presents cyclists as a cause.\nFurthermore, I believe traffic management and road planning is best handled by the municipality where much more scrutiny can be applied. Cities and towns have a flow to them that isn't always apparent to outsiders, and their traffic planners are in the best place to decide when and where to install bike lanes.\nLastly, the use of this bill to push Highway 413 without appropriorately taking the time to do a full and transparent environmental assessment is unhelpful at best.\nFor these reasons, I oppose Bill 212.\nSincerely,\nA Toronto, Ontario resident.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is appallingly destructive, ill conceived, and dangerous.\nIn 2021, I had my leg broken in 4 places by an SUV and a distracted driver, while riding a bike on a city street near my job at a hospital. My bright clothing and plastic helmet were no match for automotive steel. I needed multiple surgeries and many months of physical therapy to learn to walk again. As a result of my injuries, I will live with chronic pain forever. Honestly, I was terrified I\u2019d never be able to go back to my job as a nurse.\nSafer infrastructure protects people from such injuries. So far this year, 6 people have been killed riding a bike in my city, and 12 pedestrians have been killed by cars. Sadly, many of the people getting hurt are kids and older people - and these are preventable injuries and deaths. Street design determines who lives and who dies when collisions occur. And we can do better to keep people safe.\nPublic safety matters. I'm a nurse at one of Ontario's biggest hospitals, and I ride a bike to work sometimes. As both a healthcare professional and citizen, I hate seeing more people get injured the way that I was. Nurses are trained to advocate for the safety of communities. And removing safer infrastructure is incredibly harmful to public safety. It\u2019s also an appalling use of our tax dollars, since some of the routes being discussed were only recently built - at great expense.\nThe safety of kids and young people matters. I'm also a parent, and I'm concerned about more kids and young people being hit and injured by cars. Young people and students are getting killed by dump trucks and other vehicles - along the route that I take to the hospital I work in. I can only imagine the anguish and grief their families must be going through.\nOf course we all hate traffic gridlock. It\u2019s stressful to navigate, and an enormous waste of time and money. However, real problems require real solutions - based on the best available evidence for what will protect us. This is how doctors and nurses are trained to make decisions, and more public policy needs to be based on good evidence.\nInduced demand is real. It has been a well understood idea for decades, among urban planners and professionals who study how to make cities work better. The more lanes that we add to roads and highways, the more people decide to drive. This generates an endless feedback loop that just increases traffic. The 401 has up to 18 lanes in places, and it\u2019s one of the biggest highways in North America. No matter how many lanes we add, there\u2019s always more traffic.  If adding more lanes was going to solve traffic congestion, this solution would have worked already. Cities like Los Angeles have been adding lanes to roadways for generations, and the biggest result has been notorious traffic jams.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just stuck in traffic. You are traffic.\u201d The only proven way to reduce traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road. This requires giving more people better options. It requires investing in transit, so that it can get more people where they need to go. It means building more communities where people can walk, ride a bike, or catch a bus or train to work or shopping. Millions of people driving individual cars everywhere is the least efficient system of mass transit ever created.\nEnvironmental health matters. As a parent, I worry about the safety of the world I am leaving my children. Cars create noxious smog and fine particulate pollution that cause respiratory diseases like asthma. Wildfire smoke regularly causes dangerously poor air quality during summers now, as climate change lengthens the fire season and drives more dangerous disasters. News stories are filled with stories of scores of people killed by hurricanes and towns demolished by floods. Most cars on the road burn oil, which is actively accelerating these problems, and making our world less predictable and our future less safe. The more fossil fuel we burn, the more headaches and danger we leave to our children.\nActive transportation - including walking and biking - is healthier than driving. Too many people have to drive everywhere, because they have no alternatives. Too many people live largely sedentary lifestyles. And as a result, North Americans live with epidemic rates of obesity and diabetes. Sitting around all day every day is incredibly unhealthy - and contributes to diseases that are very expensive to treat. What if more people got 30 minutes of exercise every day while doing errands? What if more people could walk 15 minutes to a transit hub and easily get to work? For people with borderline hypertension or diabetes, regular exercise can mean the difference between needing medication and just building a healthier lifestyle.\nOntario needs so, so many other things. We desperately need to invest in affordable housing - and too many people are miserable because they can\u2019t find decent homes. We need to allow the creation of denser housing, in walkable neighbourhoods served by usable transit - and real zoning reform is painfully overdue. Our transit systems are underfunded, and sheltering far too many homeless people. Our schools are understaffed and need repairs. Millions of people in Ontario are waiting to find a family doctor. Our hospitals are understaffed - and priorities like Bill 124 decimated healthcare staffing, just when nurses and clinical professionals were most desperately needed. Too many people have suffered and are suffering because we neglect these problems.\nThis proposed legislation will make life more unsafe for vulnerable people. It will solve zero problems, and drag things backward. And it is not based on any real evidence for anything that can possibly solve our problems or protect public safety.\nWe can do better.\n"

        "comment": "The stated aim of this bill is to reduce congestion. If this bill were made in good faith, it would recognise that cycling infrastructure is one of the principle ways to reduce congestion. Bike lanes encourage bike usage and create safe conditions for cycling. People use these to commute, and more recently bike delivery has created a new avenue of revenue for restaurants and other businesses. Instituting new regulations which require provincial approval for bike lanes threatens cyclist safety and encourages car usage. In Toronto, approximately 150,000 people use bike lanes to commute; were each of these people to switch to car commuting, congestion would be atrocious. By proposing this bill, the government is once again demonstrating its callous attitude towards the lives of cyclists. In the city of Toronto, five people have been killed this year, yet the province is proposing measures which contravene any possibility of improving this problem. As a regular cyclist, I see that one of the main causes of road congestion are roads shut down to enable condo construction. The rapidity of this construction is doing nothing to improve Toronto's housing crisis, since these homes are unaffordable and are not subject to the provincial cap on rental increases. If congestion is to be reduced, slowing condo construction projects is one way to do it. Since the average income of Torontonians is $40,000, the prospect of obstacles to cycling also places more financial pressure on people in a time of economic crisis. Using the Toronto transit system adds an extra $160 to a person's costs, and car usage is even more costly. As such, the provincial government should stop wasting its time creating reactionary bills which lack evidential basis, and take meaningful action to improve the conditions of working people in Ontario.\n"

Remember, the more people on bikes (and not in cars), the faster it will be to drive along Bloor West.\nAlso, has everyone forgotten there is a subway line (with a SOGR backlog of however billions of dollars) underneath Bloor West. I mention only Bloor West because I am not naive, and I know that this doesn't actually have anything to do with any other municipality or bike lane.\nAnyways, like I said, bike lanes are inevitable on major roads- whether this generation or the next, who cares.

Lacks Investment in Public Transit: To seriously reduce traffic, we need to make public transit a real alternative to driving. Bill 212 doesn\u2019t prioritize accessible, affordable, or reliable transit. Without strong investment here, we\u2019ll keep seeing more cars on the road because people don\u2019t have other viable options.\n2. Bike Lanes Are Essential: A major flaw in Bill 212 is that it fails to recognize the critical role bike lanes play in easing traffic. We need more dedicated bike lanes on major roads to provide safe, reliable options for cyclists. Removing bike lanes\u2014or failing to build more\u2014only forces more people into cars, increasing gridlock and making roads more dangerous for everyone. Building up our bike lane network is a proven way to reduce car dependency, decrease traffic, and make commuting more efficient and sustainable.\n3. Supports Environmental Goals: Without dedicated bike lanes and increased transit, Bill 212 risks increasing emissions rather than cutting them. Bike lanes give people a green, affordable option, which supports Ontario\u2019s environmental goals by reducing reliance on cars. A traffic solution that overlooks environmental impact is a missed opportunity for meaningful change.\n4. Short-sighted, Quick Fixes Don\u2019t Work: Bill 212 relies on short-term solutions, like more traffic enforcement or road widening, which do little in the long run. These \u201cquick fixes\u201d may ease congestion temporarily but usually just lead to even more cars on the road. Real traffic reduction requires forward-thinking investments in transit, bike lanes, and sustainable transportation options to provide long-term, effective solutions.\nUltimately, Bill 212 misses the mark. We need a balanced, sustainable approach that invests in public transit, strengthens bike lane networks, and builds a foundation for lasting, effective traffic reduction.\n"

Increasing vehicular traffic instead of rapid mass transit and emission-free modes like biking will simply accelerate these changes. As a regular user of the cycle lanes in Toronto, I strongly believe that the local municipal ward and council members are best positioned to understand and respond to their residents' needs. If the cycle lanes are removed, I would consider that road far less safe to cycle on, and so would many of the people I know. Removing cycle lanes will result in two main outcomes - cyclists will still need to reach businesses and services on those main streets, so they will share the lanes with cars and add to congestion; or cyclists will feel unsafe and use cars/taxis instad, again adding to congestion. Cycle lanes actually improve traffic flow by encouraging fewer cars on the road and discouraging cyclists from using the same lanes.\n"

If there are other option made safe and accessible then many people will migrate to the use of those options, resulting in fewer cars on the road.\nThis bill will make it possible to remove the little infrastructure the city currently has for cyclists which is NOT congruent with the objective of alleviating traffic, and it is not conducive to improving general quality of life in this city.\nI do NOT support this bill.\n"
