        "comment": "I would like to express my strong support for the implementation of more bike lanes in Toronto and not removing any bike lanes. The addition of dedicated bike lanes offers numerous benefits for our city, including:\nImproved Safety: Bike lanes significantly reduce the risk of accidents between cyclists and vehicles, creating a safer environment for all road users.\nReduction of Traffic Congestion: By encouraging more cyclists to use the roads, bike lanes can help alleviate traffic congestion, improving commutes for everyone.\nEnvironmental Benefits: More cyclists mean reduced greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment.\nPublic Health Improvements: Cycling is an excellent form of exercise, which can enhance public health and reduce healthcare costs for the city.\nEconomic Boost: Increased cycling can lead to greater business for local shops, as cyclists are more likely to stop at nearby establishments compared to drivers.\nIncorporating more bike lanes aligns with Toronto\u2019s goals of sustainability, health, and effective urban planning. I urge decision-makers to prioritize this initiative for the benefit of our city and its residents.\nThank you for considering this important matter.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal shows that the Ontario government has a fundamental misunderstanding about factors that impact congestion. When we consider Toronto's population and the amount of space available for roadways it is literally impossible to prevent congestion by increasing lanes for vehicular traffic. The only hope to reduce travel times is to provide commuters with options that are faster than driving. This can be down by increasing bus/subway service or by INCREASING the number and IMPROVING the connectivity of bike lines. This will bring down average travel times and encourage more people out of cars and onto buses, trains and bikes thereby reducing congestion.\nAlso, places like Bloor, Yonge and University are not just throughfares but also destinations. So anything that increases the percentage of people who are able to easily stop into a store or restaurant the better it is for the neighborhood. This is why the local BIAs are against the removal of the bike lanes since revenues for the local businesses have increased since the lanes have been installed.\nPlease, please, please listen to traffic planners who almost universally admit that adding more lanes will not solve congestion as well as to the local BIAs who actually see the day-to-day impact of the bike lanes.\nThe TLDR is that this proposal is a terrible idea and the sooner that it is scrapped the sooner this government can move to more serious work.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver & occasional cyclist who has a young adult child who cycles the city - I am strongly OPPOSED to removing bike lanes. I\u2019d rather sit in traffic than risk hitting a cyclist. There are so many positive reasons to keep bike lanes - cyclist safety, reducing pollution, avoiding the cost of removal. This could be a city that values cycling and cyclist lives enough to explore other solutions to traffic congestion than removing bike lanes. Look to Copenhagen or Montreal to know it\u2019s possible. Removing the Main Street Yonge, Bloor & University bike lanes will surely put lives at risk. I invite Ford to consider his own child cycling without the safety of a bike lane - and consider whether putting cars first is worth that feeling.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI live in Toronto. I bike to work because I can't afford a car and biking is the most convenient, safe, and fun alternative. I could take public transit, but that extends my commute by up to half an hour each way. Giving up an hour of every workday is a lot, and I cant afford to be late to work; I have a mortgage to pay.\nTherefore I'm going to continue biking to work regardless of this bill. If this bill passes, Toronto will have less bike lanes, and my commute will become less safe. In addition, I question that we'll be able to fit a whole lane of traffic (or even space for streetside parking) in the space gained from removing bike lanes without effecting sidewalk space or the amount of foot traffic you get into the businesses along those major through ways.\nI hope this bill is reconsidered; the costs are pretty steep to me and the communities I spend my time in.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in the City of Toronto (or anywhere) will not improve traffic. Instead, more people will elect to use cars because they don\u2019t have a safe bike option and traffic will worsen. And of course, there will be more cyclist fatalities at a time when we are trying to get to zero.\nThere is no evidence behind this proposal. It\u2019s shamefully knee jerk. I live in the affected area (Toronto\u2019s west end) and I also see traffic as a problem. Nobody likes the current traffic situation in Toronto. This proposal won\u2019t fix it and is a giant waste of time and taxpayer money. Please design policy that will fix the issue and use taxpayer money appropriately.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes in downtown Toronto is short-sighted and goes against evidence-based urban planning principles. Bike lanes are crucial for creating safer, more sustainable, and more efficient urban transportation networks. Here's why we should keep and expand bike lanes:\nSafety: Bike lanes significantly reduce cycling injuries and fatalities. A study in Toronto found that streets with bike lanes had 89% fewer crashes per kilometer cycled compared to those without.\nIncreased ridership: The installation of bike lanes leads to increased cycling. For example, after the Bloor Street bike lanes were installed, cycling volumes increased by 56% during morning peak hours.\nEconomic benefits: Contrary to claims of harm to businesses, studies show that cyclists spend more money in local shops over time compared to drivers. A study on Bloor Street found that customers arriving by foot and bicycle visited more often and spent more money per month than those who drove.\nReduced congestion: Bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow by encouraging mode shift. In New York City, the addition of protected bike lanes on 9th Avenue led to a 49% decrease in commercial traffic travel times.\nEnvironmental impact: Promoting cycling through infrastructure helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Toronto's TransformTO climate action strategy relies on increasing cycling mode share to meet its emissions reduction targets.\nPublic health: Increased cycling leads to improved public health outcomes. The health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks by a factor of 20 to 1, according to a study in the British Medical Journal.\nEquity: Bike lanes provide an affordable transportation option for low-income residents who may not have access to a car or public transit.\nThe right to safe cycling infrastructure is fundamental to creating a livable, equitable city. Instead of removing bike lanes, we should be expanding and improving our cycling network to create a more connected, safe, and accessible system for all road users. Let's make evidence-based decisions that benefit the entire community, not just those in cars.\n"

        "comment": "Removing these critical cycling lanes will have a direct and serious impact on my family\u2019s safety. We live in Harbord Village, and our children attend Ecole Elementaire Gabrielle Roy in the Garden District. Each day, we rely on the Harbord/Hoskin cycle track, which connects to the University lane and then continues east on the Gerrard Lane. This network of lanes lets us travel across the city safely and efficiently, keeping us away from high-risk areas like Bay Street, where speeding and unsafe passing are common hazards for cyclists. In essence, these cycle tracks act as the \u201cseatbelts\u201d for urban cyclists, providing essential protection and structure in a busy urban environment. Removing them would strip away these protections and expose my family, and many others, to needless danger.\nThis proposal also overlooks the widespread benefits these lanes provide to the local economy. Many Toronto restaurants and food businesses rely on online delivery platforms to sustain their operations. The cyclists who deliver for these platforms depend on the cycle tracks to navigate the city safely and efficiently. Without these lanes, delivery times may slow, safety risks will increase, and businesses may face declines in service efficiency, negatively impacting both local commerce and customer satisfaction. For a province that purports to pride itself on supporting small businesses and vibrant neighbourhoods, removing this infrastructure is counterproductive and risks undermining local economic growth.\nAs a car owner, I use my vehicle for some trips and have observed no impact on my drive times due to these cycle tracks. In fact, by offering an alternative for cyclists, these lanes actually help to reduce congestion on the roads, creating a more harmonious balance among all road users.\nThe proposed regulations lack a rational connection to the stated policy objectives. They not only compromise the safety of cyclists but also overlook the economic value that cycle tracks add to local businesses. Removing this critical infrastructure is an anti-safety and anti-business measure that risks reversing years of progress in creating a safer, more accessible, and more economically vibrant city for all residents.\n"

However, removing bike lanes is a bandaid solution to a systematic problem, which will help in the short term but as population in Ontario keeps on increasing, just adding 2 new lanes to a high is not going to be a solution.\nKeeping the bike lanes, enabling additional funding for public transport, and developing high network is the way to go.\nI do not approve of this bill.

        "comment": "Please dedicate your efforts to providing more GO trains. The data does not support this decision.\nBike lanes move more people per hour than car lanes do. Ripping out bike lanes to make room for more cars will only have more cars stuck in traffic.\nBefore the bike lanes, Bloor was far less pleasant a place to be during rush hours when it was four driving lanes. It was legitimately uncomfortable to have cars racing through the Annex, Bloor West, etc.\nSince the bike lanes, Bloor is a far more peaceful and enjoyable place to spend time. This is what we lose by prioritizing cars. Why should we make the place worse for the people that live there, only to give more road rage to the car drivers.\nWe're not in the 1970s anymore. Driving comfortably to work from the suburbs requires half the population to stop existing. Solutions of the past will not work today. Let's get 15 minute all day service on the GO lines instead. This will actually help and is backed up by data, not feelings.\n"
