        "comment": "Decades of evidence show that the best way to reduce car gridlock is to provide safe, viable alternatives to driving cars. Because of the Bloor-Danforth bike lane, my family (husband, wife, and two kids) recently moved to a nearby home. We bought a Dutch cargo bike (bakfiets) which we use to drop off our kids each morning at school and kindergarten- something we would not do without the protected bike lane. My wife and I both use the bike lane to get to work, which for both of us is along the same corridor. Because of this, we rarely used our car, and decided to sell it, saving us hundreds of dollars a month (now using a carshare service when needed). Please do not upend our lives, and the lives of our likeminded neighbours, by removing options for letting us safely get around the city with our family. If you\u2019re worried about emergency vehicles, bike lanes should be widened (and vehicle sizes upgraded to international standards) so that bike lanes are comfortable and wide enough for children, adults, and the elderly to use them together, and for emergency vehicles to use them as well, as needed. More, better bike lanes is a win-win for all Torontonians, including car drivers, making the city a healthier and safer place to live. It is also essential for helping Ontario\u2019s cities meet our net zero climate commitments.\n"

        "comment": "As a parent who bikes regularly with my kids, I strongly believe that bike lanes are essential for the safety and mobility of families like mine. They allow us to choose a sustainable, active way to get around without fear of sharing lanes with cars. Even though I drive at times, I would never want to see bike lanes removed. They are a faster, healthier, and more environmentally responsible option that benefits everyone by reducing traffic and pollution. Removing or reducing bike lanes would be a step backward, making our neighborhoods less safe and less livable. I urge Ontario to prioritize and protect cycling infrastructure as a key component of a sustainable and family-friendly city.\n"

This is the most infuriating piece of legislation I\u2019ve read in my entire life and is a spit in the face of all residents of Ontario.

        "comment": "Oh, where do I even begin with this proposal? It\u2019s almost as if someone took a look at Toronto\u2019s congestion crisis and thought, \u201cYou know what we need? More cars! Let\u2019s just ignore the fact that they\u2019re the problem in the first place!\u201d It\u2019s like trying to fix a leaky faucet by pouring more water on it\u2014brilliant!\nLet\u2019s talk about bike lanes for a second. The proposal acts like they\u2019re some sort of villain in this traffic saga, but let\u2019s be honest: before these lanes were added, the second vehicle lane was a parking lot masquerading as a road. If anything, bike lanes have turned that chaos into something resembling order. Now, instead of dodging parked cars and cyclists weaving through traffic like they\u2019re in an obstacle course, I can actually drive without feeling like I\u2019m in a game of bumper cars. Who knew safety could be so controversial?\nNow, let\u2019s get to the real kicker\u2014our tax dollars. Instead of wasting our hard-earned money on this farcical plan that sounds like it was concocted in a brainstorming session gone horribly wrong, how about investing in something that might actually make a difference? Improving GO and TTC services would give people real options for getting around without relying on their cars. But no, let\u2019s throw money at a proposal that does nothing but pander to car culture while ignoring the obvious solutions right in front of us.\nIn conclusion, this proposal is a masterclass in missing the point entirely. If we want to tackle Toronto's congestion crisis, we need real solutions\u2014not this half-baked nonsense that reads like a bad joke. Let\u2019s stop pretending that ignoring the issue will make it go away and start making decisions that actually benefit our city!\n"

        "comment": "The proposed policy to tear up bike lanes in Toronto is one of the most horrible policies this government has ever done. It will increase the number of deaths, as bike lanes have shown to save lives, it will increase pollution by encouraging more car use, it will not even significantly decrease car traffic as all studies have shown (including the ones commissioned by the Ontario government).\nI take the bloor bike lane to work every day and you will be making my commute risk death by taking away bike lanes. I just might have to drive, which will only increase traffic.\nIf you want to decrease traffic you need to get people out of cars and onto transit, bikes, e scooters. Adding lanes is not backed by evidence or science.\n"

While most developed countries such as Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Germany, etc. are moving away from car dependency, providing safe modes of transportation for everyone, and promoting sustainable urban development, Ontario is forcing Toronto to move backwards, taking Torontonians freedom away.\nIn the face of climate change after Toronto had several floodings, putting more people in cars is not going solve congestions. More cars = more traffic.\nToronto is a vibrant city that needs sustainable modes of transportation. Ontario should priotize regional and urban rail growth to help congestions instead of forcing Torontonians to depend on their cars.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely crazy. This unnecessary red tape and overreach from the province. All the evidence says that this helps traffic flow - you will never get cyclists off arterial roads because Bloor Street, for example, is the only continuous east/west corridor through the city that isn't the waterfront!!\nYou say \"put bikes on the side roads\" but that's where parking is most important, and in Toronto especially the roads don't connect. If you want to keep traffic moving on bloor, encourage people to bike in order to get cars off the road! Invest in more transit! Get rid of on-street parking because there are lots and side streets all over the place!\nThe province needs to focus on finishing the Eglinton crosstown, on delivering better healthcare, and many other things. It's absolutely appalling that they would try to scrap lanes that were just built. Give people time to use them - more people biking means cleaner air, less cars on the road, and the neighbourhood where I live (bloor West village) has never been safer for pedestrians or more accessible, because the bike lanes provide numerous new accessible drop-off and pickup points, and make it easier for trucks to load and unload into stores. That's why the city built them!!!!!\n"

        "comment": "Removal of the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University is not at all supported by the data on traffic times.  The volume of traffic has increased with return to office mandates and increased travel times are reflective of that, not of impact from the bike lanes.  This government is engaging in blatant targeting and undermining of Toronto city planning.  The government needs to focus on provincial responsibilities and leave city planners to do their jobs.\nThis move will make cyclists less safe and push people back into cars.   It is the exact opposite direction we need to be moving to counter climate change and build livable cities.  The Conservatives are stuck in a 1950s fantasy of car-centric, suburban development.\n"

They have caused gridlock, made it impossible for people with disabilities to be dropped off or access the businesses especially south of St. Clair.  Limited parking spaces have exacerbated this problem.  Turning onto the residential streets is very difficult and dangerous as well.\nBloor Street from Sherbourne to Bathurst is a nightmare.  Commute times on this stretch have become untenable.\nI believe bike lanes do serve a purpose in our city but on adjacent routes that are not as commercially busy.\nIf it takes the provincial government oversight to remedy this situation then I support their vetting of new bike lanes and removal of impractical existing routes.\n"
