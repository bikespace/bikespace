        "comment": "Getting rid of what is usually the fastest way to get around the city and spending extra taxpayer dollars to do so is ridiculous. The cyclists who use these bike lanes will either end up driving cars (increasing traffic), not make the trip (reducing economic activity) or cycle in the same vehicle lane as cars leading to more injury and death. Neither people driving cars or biking want to be sharing the same lane of traffic, literally no one wants that. All the studies on this topic and all the data show how much more efficient, more safe, more environmentally friendly it is to encourage cycling over car travel. Let's not move Ontario backwards\n"

More importantly, the research shows that within 2-3 years after a new highway lane has been constructed, gridlock returns to it's previous levels.  We do not need more traffic lanes, we need more public transit, more bike lanes.  Please rescind this Bill....\nL\n"

It's Big Government going unchecked.\nInstead of focusing on priority transportation items like investing in public transit or road safer for everyone, the Ford Government is creating more red tape, rolling back environmentally friendly initiatives, and ignoring experts and community advocates in order to shave seconds off of commute times.\nThis is clearly anti-bike, anti-environment, and anti-Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limited the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario and remove existing lanes in Toronto. This decision is not just shortsighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nEvidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those who rely on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without access to vehicles. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the\u00a0environment.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212\u2019s framing of bike lanes as a cause of traffic congestion is misleading and appears to be an attempt to sow division rather than address the real causes of gridlock. Studies consistently show that bike lanes do not significantly contribute to traffic but instead provide alternative, sustainable transportation options that can reduce car dependence and, over time, lessen traffic congestion.\nThe bill\u2019s push to exempt Highway 413-related projects from the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) is far more alarming. This exemption bypasses crucial environmental reviews meant to protect Ontario\u2019s natural landscapes, water quality, and biodiversity. Disregarding these assessments for Highway 413 opens the door to severe ecological harm, threatening wetlands, farmland, and wildlife habitats without considering the long-term consequences. This tactic seems aimed at fast-tracking development while shifting attention away from meaningful environmental and community concerns, risking both Ontario's ecosystems and the health of its communities.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is rooted in ill-informed decision-making. Removing already existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer dollars and goes against logic. Cyclists will always exist and removing bike lanes will not stop people from cycling on main streets. The reason bike lanes are on main roads is because people naturally take the most convenient route - the less direct the route is, the less likely people will use it. Otherwise why aren't we telling drivers to drive on these apparently empty secondary streets instead? Why are they willingly sitting in traffic?\nRemoving the bike lanes will force cyclists to take the lane. This will cause congestion to increase, while increasing the risk of fatalities of cyclists. It's disgusting this government would make policies that will kill people. If the province actually wanted to reduce congestion, perhaps remove the parking lane that exists on these main roads, or encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes and public transit.\nWhat happens when the province implements this policy and congestion does not improve because the actual cause of congestion stems from Toronto's population ballooning without additional transportation options to compensate? Transit has become increasingly unreliable due to the Province's aversion to providing operations funding, and now the Ontario Line construction is literally the cause of traffic.\nLets take advice from urban planning experts, who all agree bike lanes are the way to go and designed these bike lanes after researching best practices from around the world and publicly consulting the local community, not Doug Ford brainstorming efforts to improve his personal commute.\n"
