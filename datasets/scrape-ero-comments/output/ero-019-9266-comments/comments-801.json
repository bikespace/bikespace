        "comment": "On: PART XII - MUNICIPAL BY-LAWS AND BICYCLE LANES\nThe province knows that active transportation and alternate forms of transportation including bicycles does not affect vehicular traffic or restrict flow- vehicular traffic causes gridlock.\nBicycle lanes provide safer routes for bicycle users (who may at other times also be motor vehicle users). Separated bicycle lanes and bicycle signalisation provide the safest option for all commuters and contribute to a healthy, vibrant city.\nIt is a despicable overreach and poor policy for the province to target laws and dictate changes to municipalities that intended to satisfy outdated views of few.\nLeave the bike lanes alone and focus on building transit, faster and better.\nExpert options attached.\n"

        "comment": "Totally opposed to bike lanes on Bloor St. They are an unmitigated disaster. I regularly observe mid-morning bumper-to-bumper eastbound traffic stretching onto the Humber Bridge. All that carbon monoxide from basically parked cars spewing into our air. Northbound S Kingsway backed up to Worthington or worse because vehicles can't turn onto Bloor E because of perennial gridlock at Jane St.\nThat's just two examples.\nThe process of deciding to put these ugly monstrosities in place was done seemingly without consultation and without common sense. Unidirectional special interest groups were the only ones served. Local representation did not engage, but that's the norm with our disconnected and dismissive councillor. Where was the thought process to route these lanes through secondary and tertiary network where traffic is light and where cyclists would be safer?\n"

They stay in their lane, I stay in mine, and I don't have to feel nervous that I'm going to accidentally hit anyone.  Put money into fixing the HUGE problems with the TTC and more people will use it. Currently people don't trust it because there are problems every day and no one can get where they're going on time. Fix the TTC, and there won't be as many cars on the road every day.\nAnd please don't be building more highways on prime farmland. Southern Ontario will soon be a concrete corridor. Leave it as is and get more train service. So many people would prefer to take the train! From Windsor to Montreal, there's no excuse for not having as many trains as in England. If you build it, they will come! People will fill those trains.\nI'm all for increasing broadband.\n"

        "comment": "As a road user who primarily cycles and occasionally drives or takes transit to make a living I find it absurd that this bill proposes to reduce bike lanes. This is infrastructure that ensures safety and also reduces congestion. Removing existing infrastructure for bike lanes and safer streets is an insult to taxpayers and anyone who has suffered injuries or lost loved ones due to unsafe driving and roadways. This government should focus on safety above convenience.\n"

        "comment": "my thoroughfare to/from home is Yonge Street between Davisville and Bloor.\nbefore the bike lane were installed a few years ago, I had too many years biking up and down Yonge taking my life into constant threat\u2026 either from condo construction thwarting traffic movements, from careless drivers turning while distracted on their phones, and cars speeding on the steep hill as if it was a highway.\nIF the dedicated bike lanes are removed off Yonge, I will be forced at this point to ride down the entire right lane so as not to risk my life against the curb\u2026 this will indeed congest traffic.\nthe actual problem regarding traffic congestion on Yonge (besides condo construction sites) is that too many people are driving downtown when they should be taking transit, many driving solo with no passengers\u2026 the government needs to concentrate on restricting downtown traffic before it gets worse, rather than penalizing bicyclists who are doing something beneficial, and rather than risking their lives.\nI pay my taxes to this government and I have a right to safety on my city\u2019s streets.\n"

        "comment": "I think more should be done to educate people about traffic flow and understanding what it means to be part of an expanding city. Having alternative modes of transportation should be top priority for the province. Ensuring people can reliably get from place to place is at the top of my mind. Whether driving or cycling or transit - there should be reliable and safe ways to use all of these modes. Unfortunately taking out bike lanes is not safe for any user.\nI use the bloor bike lanes from Runnymede to Islington to get to work at Cinespace studios. Turning down islington there is a very big difference of safety until I get to Norseman. Bike lanes make a huge difference. Adding more connecting bike lanes will encourage people to use them ! Unfortunately sometimes that means taking out current lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is wasteful and disrespectful to the people (taxpayers) of Ontario. Highway 413 will cost $10 billion or more and offer at best marginal benefits to a small number of commuters (far from \"millions\"). The government's own estimates show that commute times on the existing 407 would be shorter than on the 413, which will do absolutely nothing to improve gridlock in the GTA - indeed, it will likely make it worse.\nThe same can be said for removing bike lanes. Contrary to the government's claims, the bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge did not significantly change commute times for cars, and local businesses saw more customers after they were installed. Removing them will not improve traffic, but it will harm businesses even after the lengthy and expensive construction work is completed. This is to say nothing of the increased danger to cyclists, many of whom are delivering packages from local businesses on e-bikes. The words \"safe\" and \"safety\" do not appear anywhere in the government's proposal, as if human lives are not an important consideration.\nLastly, this bill is anti-democratic and shows tremendous disrespect to the people of Toronto, and indeed all Ontarians who value their local government and have no interested in out-of-touch suits in Queen's Park dictating municipal policies.\n"

        "comment": "The data doesn't align on this issue with the proposed actions.  Wider roads mean more cars.  The speed of the road will normalize based on the inconvenience factor.   We have set up a system of Democracy that if ignored and trounced upon enough times will produce citizen who will give up on democracy and stop voting and not caring or will rise and revolt if disregarded for their elected body to do its work.  Wasting taxpayers' dollars installing and then removing bike lanes is disrespectful of tax-paying citizens.  Please reconsider this political stunt.\nFinally, if  the Provincial Government doesn't know how to stay in its lane.  Maybe the PG should refrain from driving in the City of Toronto.  If anything, the PG should be encouraging more biking in dense cities not discouraging it.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply opposed to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, especially the framework that would allow for the removal of bike lanes to reinstate traffic lanes. Since arriving in Canada nearly two years ago, the Bloor Street bike lane has been a vital part of my daily life. I rely on it almost every day of the year for safe, reliable transportation. I use it to get to work, to go the gym, to get groceries, and to see my friends. Removing bike lanes like this one not only compromises the safety of cyclists but it also undermines the progress that Toronto has made in building a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.\nThe idea that removing bike lanes will reduce gridlock is fundamentally flawed and is not supported by evidence. Numerous studies from cities worldwide, such as New York, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam, have shown that adding protected bike lanes encourages more people to cycle, reduces car dependency, and ultimately improves traffic flow by taking cars off the road. Removing bike lanes discourages cycling and forces more people into cars or public transit, worsening congestion rather than alleviating it.\nBike lanes are essential for creating a safer, greener, and healthier city. They encourage active transportation, reduce emissions, and create safer streets for all road users. Removing a bike lane to prioritize cars sends a regressive message about the kind of city we want Toronto to be, a city for cars, rather than a city for people. Instead of dismantling progress, the Ontario government should invest in expanding and improving cycling infrastructure, which benefits everyone, not just cyclists.\nI urge the government to reconsider this bill and focus on evidence-based strategies to reduce gridlock, rather than taking away the infrastructure that makes Toronto more livable, sustainable, and accessible for all.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. I believe this act is regressive and will not have the desired effects of reducing gridlock or saving time.\nI firmly believe that building highway 413 will encourage more development farther away from where people work, leading to increased traffic which will quickly overwhelm any new highways. Furthermore, there is already an underutilized highway, Highway 407, which could be used at far less expense to the Province of Ontario. Building Highway 413 will take years and will not significantly reduce commute times. It is well known that the best way to move large numbers of people quickly and efficiently is by mass public transit. Therefore, I urge the Province of Ontario to invest the money they would spend on building highway 413 on increasing GO Transit service and finishing the transit projects in the City of Toronto that have been dragging on for years. Investing in public transit over car infrastructure will save precious Greenbelt land and preserve habitats for many species while ensuring that pollution is not increased by increased numbers of car on Ontario roads.\nI also want to comment that I do not believe the Province should be interfering with the decisions of municipalities to build bicycle infrastructure. It is up to cities and the people who live there to decide how they want space to be used. Bicycle infrastructure is very important for people who do not own cars, are unable to drive, cannot afford cars, or choose not to drive. Bicycle lanes provide a safe way for people to get to work, school, appointments, public transit and other destinations that does not make noise, cause pollution, or take up a lot of space. Where there are no bike lanes, people who need to use bicycles to travel are in constant danger from faster and larger cars and trucks. Any city that is looking to the future will be investing in active transport and micromobility, and it seems that the Province wishes to go backward in time. Furthermore, removing already existing bicycle infrastructure is a huge waste of money and resources that will result in more traffic and reduce quality of life for the people who live in cities.\n"

Research indicates that the more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\nIn reality, traffic would improve if changes were made to traffic conditions, not bike lanes. Removing on-street parking and putting in additional left-turn lanes, NOT removing bike lanes.\nFurthermore, if the Ontario government would like to improve the economy, it would not only retain the existing bike lanes, but actually increase the number of lanes. Research shows that bike lanes increase spending at local businesses.\nPlease do not remove these bike lanes from the city's streets, because they are not making commuting any more difficult or longer for those who drive. There are other interventions that could be done to improve the lives of drivers in Toronto, without endangering the lives of Toronto's cyclists and pedestrians.\n"
