        "comment": "It is very negligent of the Ford government to waste money on removing the bike lanes that have already been placed in vital portions of the city.  It is very clear that he is being biased toward high earners, mainly in the etobicoke area. As many of the commuters in the area do not use bikes or public transit, these high earners are mainly concerned over their commute time. But with the current planned housing projects, these bikes lanes will be vital to move people around the city. If you look at the current plans of most proposed new builds, they may have under 100 parking spaces and over 50 story buildings. How does the Ford government think these new residents will get around the city. In summation, please stop the Ford government from giving into the demands of his privileged constituents, especially when it is at the cost of every other non-car driving citizen of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I am shocked that removing bike lanes is even a topic of discussion when it comes to city planning and accessibility and creating a good city environment. The benefits of biking in a city are tremendous it reduces congestion. It\u2019s a fast way to get around. It\u2019s a clean healthy way to get around and we should be building more lanes in my opinion and making it more accessible to bike around the city.\n"

        "comment": "It is clear this is not an evidence based policy.  There is no large city anywhere in the world that has fixed their traffic by endlessly building larger roads. I urge the government to present even a single example but they cannot as dense cities will never have the space to accommodate hundreds of thousands of personal vehicles.\nIf another car lane is truly needed all three of these lanes being marked for removal have street parking that can be removed to create that additional lane.\nFinally this policy will lead to deaths, if we truly want everyone home safely and in one piece this legislation needs to be voted down.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is doesn't seem to be based on any kind of logical argument. There is no evidence to suggest that removing these bike lanes will decrease congestion. In fact, research shows that widening highways is more likely to induce demand so that congestion will stay the same or even get worse, with all the added negative effects that come with more cars on the road. So I have to wonder, what reasoning is this proposal even based on?\nWe don't need to get drivers where they need to go faster - we need to get EVERYONE where they need to go EFFICIENTLY. We have millions of people to move every day - why are we privileging a mode of transport that is so inefficient? Our number one focus should be on mass transit, and we can't afford to waste any more time when it comes to expanding and improving it. We've already dangerously underfunded the TTC for years, and now we're letting Metrolinx get away with outrageous delays on opening desperately needed new routes. It's literally impossible to add enough lanes to get everyone where they need to be by car. Instead, we MUST to encourage commuters to switch to mass transit and other alternatives by making them more convenient and appealing.\nThe way people live and work is changing, like it or not. I would ask the provincial government to please reconsider this proposal, stop wasting taxpayer money on unnecessary projects, and give your heads a shake. Ontario needs to prepare for the future. We're not even prepared for the present.\n"

        "comment": "What a waste of tax-payer money. Why should the province interfere in the decisions of cities and municipalities and cause more traffic and congestion by ripping up existing bike lanes? Cities have already spent our tax-payer money on plans and traffic studies for putting in bike lanes and then the provincial government is going to swoop in and decide for communities instead? I'm so disappointed Premier Ford is wasting his time and our money on weird stunts like this.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this proposal.  Driving in the GTA is horrible and that is why I chose to live in Bloor West Village when moving to Toronto 2 years ago.  I was attracted to this neighbourhood primarily by the close proximity to the Subway, the bike lanes on Bloor and how easy it was to walk to the local businesses.\nThe reality is that trips in my neighborhood are faster and easier by bicycle than any other mode. (parking is never an issue and it is always free)  The councilor that I elected knows this and that is why they have consistently voted to provide the infrastructure to keep cyclists safe.\nWe need to balance the priorities that make sure that moving people is a priority.  Single occupancy cars are the least efficient way to move people around  and without alternatives the problem is only going to get worse.  The capacity of a municipal road is determined by the throughput of the intersections.  Removing bike lanes and adding back driving lanes mid-block will do nothing to improve the travel times for those using Bloor.  For many cyclist Bloor is the only way to efficiently cross the Humber River.\nI am opposed to the loss of democratic process that this legislation represents.  20 of 22 councilors voted to extend the bike lanes on Bloor and now the Minister of Transportation will have unilateral power to reverse the will of the local people.    The people of the city voted overwhelming to support candidates that believe in Vision Zero.\nThe infrastructure around bike lanes are designed to slow traffic and make everyone - including people in cars safer.  Removing this infrastructure will surely result in more serious injuries and death.   Too many residents of Toronto have been killed by cars this year.  Going for a walk to the grocery store should be a safe en devour but the removal of the complete street infrastructure will surely make it less so.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycle lanes help to reduce traffic congestion by encouraging people to travel by bicycle rather than by vehicle. Research has shown that they do NOT increase traffic congestion. The proposed legislation does not cite any evidence for its proposition that bicycle lanes on major roads cause traffic congestion. Therefore, I believe that it is a stupid piece of proposed legislation.\nFurthermore, I believe that the proposed legislation arises largely from the misguided prejudices of Mr Ford, not from any rational study of the evidence.\nPlease withdraw this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This is not going to solve traffic issues on any of these streets. Cars will still be stuck behind bicycles and illegally stopped vehicles in the right lane regardless. With the increasing popularity of food delivery, the bike lanes are more important than ever. This is not only a gigantic waste of money, it is going to actively endanger cyclists and is a step in the wrong direction for our already flailing healthcare system. Adding another lane of car traffic on these streets will make a temporary marginal difference. Can we please focus on actual scalable solutions instead of pandering to people with misdirected rage towards cyclists? It is completely naive to think this will make any meaningful difference in traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am providing these comments with the hopes that the provincial government will re-consider its position on bike lanes and leave those decisions in the hands of the municipal governments. I have reviewed the framework for Bill 212 and would like to provide feedback on the proposal details:\nCOMMENT: We need to make decisions based FACTS, EVIDENCE AND DATA - not anecdotal accounts from the premier and his Transportation Minister. I find it astonishing that there is no actual data provided in this proposal to back up their claims of bike lanes causing traffic yet this government is ready to proceed with removals? Based on what? Assertions of first responders \"pulling their hair out\", fire trucks not being able to get across the road due to barriers/bike lanes and the streets being \"an absolute disaster/nightmare\" are simply untrue and highlight a government that hasn't done any serious research on the impacts of bike lanes on these particular streets. The truth is that there are multiple confounding variables that contribute to traffic. The many construction projects. Road closures. Car accidents. Events around the downtown Toronto core that occur frequently. Toronto is one the fastest growing cities in North America and I feel given how restricted we are in expanding the roads downtown, the best way to tackle this problem is to encourage people to use other forms of transportation (i.e. bikes, subways, buses, walking) NOW. It's great for the environment! We also need to invest in these alternate forms of transit. By not doing this, as our population begins to expand, we're going to continue to see more and more cars on the downtown Toronto streets which will only make traffic worse, given that we don't really have much capacity to expand the downtown roads. If the bike lanes are removed, do we really think one lane extra lane is going to solve our problem? What if all of those on bikes now turn around and decide to drive? What if those who bike decide to bike on the road with the cars (a very unsafe situation)? We should be following what other world-class cities have done (i.e. Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen). The bottom line is this provincial government once again is making decisions based on personal anecdotes so without any substantial evidence to support their claims, I don't want them making any decisions about bike lanes and am strongly against Bill 212. If you're so concerned about bike lanes in municipalities, do your own research and assessments and PRESENT THEM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC for scrutiny before you try and pass a bill.\n"

        "comment": "Every major city in North America and Europe has well established bike lanes within the city limits. New York one of the most car dependent cities I would think on earth has one of the best downtown bike lane systems I\u2019ve ever witnessed and minimally, disrupts, traffic or parking or anything. We should be striving to meet the benchmark that these cities present instead of removing useful infrastructure to just allow more cars on the road. Toronto has a car issue and removing bike lanes is not gonna fix that.\n"

They help ease congestion. Why is the government so keen to ignore the data and operate on feelings alone? It\u2019s no secret the premier doesn\u2019t like bikes, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to make the decision for the rest of us. The province should focus on improving public transit and getting the LRT open instead of maliciously targeting torontonians and their enjoyment of the city. Bike lanes provide a safe and enjoyable way to commute around the city, not just for work but for general every day life. They\u2019re good for exercise, they\u2019re good for getting around the city, and they\u2019re good for giving people alternatives to cars. Incentivizing people to use cars to get around just increases congestion. The province should focus on the construction blocking lanes, bad drivers blocking the box and causing congestion, and construction on the Gardner slowing down traffic. Why should the opinions of bad GTA drivers be the deciding voice on issues directly impacting the life and safety of torontonians? Shame on this provincial government, you\u2019re actively making the lives of ontarians worse with your poorly thought out decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will NOT reduce gridlock or save anyone time.\nThe government of Ontario should trust municipal governments like Toronto to make decisions on how infrastructure to serve its residents. This is gross overreach and removing bike lanes in Toronto is such a shortsighted approach to making our lives better.\nWhy is the Ontario government only trying to \"get drivers where they need to go faster\"??? Many people are drivers AND, cyclists, AND pedestrians AND public transit users - I am one of those multi-users. Why isn't the approach to solving gridlock a holistic one that invests in better public transit, safer cycling infrastructure, increased pedestrian safety? As someone who uses all modes of transportation, I know for a fact solving gridlock requires a multi-faceted approach that frankly this bill does not consider.\nMoreover, as someone who was hit by a car while cycling on Bloor Street, pre-bike lanes - I strongly disagree with Bill 212 due to the safety issues it would cause in the city (see most recently: https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/a-crisis-on-our-streets-shocking-video\u2026 and https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/female-cyclist-24-dead-after-being-str\u2026 ).

I will not forget this massive error and misjudgment when the next municipal elections occur.   Thank you.\n"
