        "comment": "Bike lanes encourage cycling, which reduces vehicle traffic. Slowing down the process of approval for creating new bike lanes in municipalities and of removing existing cycling infrastructure will put more cars on the road and more cyclists in danger. My family lives in a downtown area of a mid-sized city. Because we don\u2019t feel safe having our small kids share the road with cars where there are not constructed bike lanes, we drive much more frequently than we would like to, and we are part of the traffic problem. The creation of new bike lanes would save us time in traffic, money on gas, and emissions. Please consider the broader impact of this Bill on families, individuals and entire communities.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a complete farce intended to appease suburban conservative voters with no consideration for people who actually live in cities and utilize bike lanes in their daily lives. Bike lanes make roads safer, reduce the number of cars on the road, are good for the environment and improve the quality of life for those living in areas with large amounts of congestion. If the Ford government was actually interested in lessening the amount of gridlock in Ontario, they would be choosing to invest in increasing the accessibility and efficiency of public transit in the province, not stripping cities of their bike lanes and proposing a billion dollar tunnel under the 401 so that Johnny Ontario from Markham can get his F150 downtown 10 minutes faster.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not create gridlock or slow traffic down, it's a false belief.  Too many vehicles and obstacles (please read traffic studies) are what slow traffic down.  A cyclist is one less car.  Walking and cycling are rights, driving is only a privilege.  I bicycle daily all year, and the $1,000 a month I would have spent on a car is spent in the local economy instead (proven data that bicycling is great for local shopping).  I am not anti-car, I am just pro-saving money and getting in shape.\nHow will poor people get to work if not by bicycle?  That costs our economy tons of money.  Who is going to pick up my car-less brother from Grimsby to work in Hamilton?  So then he goes on social assistance because he can't afford a car or even public transit.  It's a war on the poor.\nBicycle lanes actually increase flow of car traffic...otherwise bicycles are left fighting for space on the road and that slows traffic down.  We must get out of cars, not only for the environment, but for the economy, our health (Canadians are getting very very fat and out of shape), fighting loneliness (a massive social issue, and when you bicycle, you end up making small talk with crossing guards, other cyclists).\nDon't forget that part of the reason traffic is bad in Toronto is because Rob and Doug Ford cancelled the amazing public transit plan that was created and ready to go by former mayor David Miller.  This traffic issue is Doug Ford's own making.  He did that.  Bicyclists aren't going away, and we have the right to ride safely.  Taking away the hard-fought lanes will take away that right.\n"

It will have the opposite effect, given that many studies show that increasing bike usage decreased traffic. It will cost money to have an additional level of government involved in planning, and it is blatant overreach on the part of the province on a clearly municipal matter. This legislation would make biking less appealing and safe while also making traffic worse and costing money.\n"

I have always been safety conscious, but have had many close calls riding my bike.\nBiking is healthy, non-polluting and non-traffic-generating.  In the past decade, bike lanes and other safety structures have made biking in the city much more safe and accessible to many.  As Toronto and other cities continue, necessarily, to grow and accommodate more people, it is important that we provide safe options for people to bike and use public transit to navigate the city safely.\nThe bike lanes in Toronto (and other cities), save lives and increase healthy communities.  Let\u2019s keep expanding bike lanes and public transit options and safe lives and decrease pollution and traffic headaches.\n"

        "comment": "The existence of bike lanes provide a safe and reliable mode of transportation for both cyclists and drivers. Being able to easily replace car lanes with bike lanes will increase the quality of life for all residents as bikes produce less pollution (noise, emission and light) and encourage healthier and safer communities.\nWhen bike lanes are built they have been demonstrated to shift demand away from cars towards greener modes of transportation. Having more cyclists leads secondary benefits such as having healthier population and reducing the strain on our health care system. Additionally bike lanes do not impact emergency service response times and require less maintenance than car lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes of in favor of more car lanes will not improve traffic due to induced demand. Removing bike lanes to widen existing car lanes will make streets more dangerous as cars tend to drive faster on wider lanes. Both of these approaches will make streets more dangerous for and pedestrians.\nGoing forward Ontario should be making it easier to build bike lanes, not more difficult. Everyone benefits from a larger portion of the population travelling by bike.\n"

        "comment": "I SUPPORT ONTARIO BICYCLE LANES\nPLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THEM AND ENSURE THEY REMAIN PROTECTED\nThey get me and several others in my professional and social circles, to and from their destinations safely and as a business owner, the lanes provide a convenient option when our cities are gridlocked (which is nearly constantly). In instances like Toronto, TTC is not a valid option as several times per day, it is broken and or not working. Busy professionals CANNOT rely on this.\nI would not be able to run my business effectively without bicycle lanes and neither would some of my employees be able to work. These bicycle lanes help to drive Ontario's economy.\nWe're in a crisis here in the GTA and wider Ontario where we lack multiple modes of transport. Prioritizing car lanes will not solve the issue short term and it certainly will NOT do so over the long term. The issue is that the only dependable way to get around is by car. Bicycle lanes offer some sort of alternative to that and it would be a very backwards and illogical move to revert.\nWe need dependable options outside of the regular GO, VIA & TTC. That infrastructure is already at its capacity!\nPlease do the logical thing, Mr. Doug Ford. Please protect Ontario bicycle lanes and ensure they are not removed and the new ones are strategically placed to ensure the safety and mobility of cyclists.\nYour next election and political credibility will depend on it.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to many of the provisions in this bill and saddened by the political culture wars that are driving this. When you let hate out of pandora\u2019s box, it is hard to reign it back in. That is what this bill is trying to do by pitting drivers against cyclists \u2013 I am both a driver and a commuter cyclist.\nThe road and bike lane components of this legislation are short-signed, fiscally irresponsible and politically driven. Had they been advanced decades ago, before we knew better, perhaps the government could be forgiven for being na\u00efve. We are in 2024, however, and the evidence is ample that building more roads and car-centric infrastructure is not the \u201croad\u201d to reducing congestion and saving time.\nRoads and highways are extremely expensive -- they cost the province hundreds of millions to build, operate and maintain. While adding roads improve congestion in the short-term, in the long term it makes it worse -- induced demand means those gains quickly disappear. If the province were serious about affordability, fiscal responsibility and saving people time, it would be investing to support the development of a connected and safe complete network to support alternative transportation (biking/rolling, walking and transit). In Toronto, something a \u201csimple\u201d as Bogota\u2019s Bus Rapid Transit might even work on the 401 if one lane were devoted to high frequency buses ever 1 minute (but again, that should be a municipal decision but the province needs to support transit capital and operational funding). Also, rather than build the 413, the province should buy back the 407, which should never have been sold off in the first place. That would do more to help commuters than building another brand new highway.\nThis bill's provisions on bike lane are a massive over-reach into municipal jurisdiction -- something this government seems to want to do a lot (I think of housing, municipal boundaries etc.).\nI am both a driver and a commuter cyclist. We only have one vehicle. When I don\u2019t have our car, I depend on transit and my bike to get to work, pick up my child, do groceries, etc. Whenever I am in my car, when I see people on transit or cycling, I know that it means that these people are not in their cars contributing to congestion. If we didn\u2019t have the measly bike infrastructure that does exist, I would never be able to bike. Even as it is now, I am often terrified when I go out because our bike network is sub-par --- painted lines on high-speed roads, lanes that suddenly disappear or spit you into traffic etc. But these are municipal problems, and the municipalities are working to develop better bike lanes (and area where provincial leadership would be valued is to improve the standards and regulations for bike lanes and infrastructure so that unsafe bike lanes are not built). I have had many close calls, even when I am towing a kid behind me. We need safe bike infrastructure.\nI also want my kid to be able to bike around to get where he needs to go \u2013 school, friends, activities, etc. He won\u2019t drive until he is 16, but bikes offer kids freedom. Bike lanes are also used by people who \u201croll\u201d and use wheelchairs.\nI implore the Minister and Government officials to take a few trips to some world class cities that have achieved miracles with better alternative transportation infrastructure. Please use our tax dollars to visit Cophenhagen, Amsterdam, even Bogota \u2013 and here in Canada Vancouver and Montreal. See that there are alternatives to the 1950s model of car-centric tall and sprawl that got us into this predicament in the first place.  They will see that the answers are NOT building more expensive and expansive highways, but offering a range of possibilities. I may add that this also ties into the housing crisis, but the current government seems determined to continue expanding sprawl. It also links to our healthcare and obesity crisis.\nIn sum, I beg you to NOT move forward with the provisions in this bill around bike lanes. It is a terrible idea, it is provincial over-reach, and it is politically motivated. I recognize there is little hope anything will change because our decision makers seem motivated by politics and to stoke culture wars and foment division and hatred between various groups, when these groups are not so clear-cut (many, many people are cyclists, transit users and drivers). We already have so many things in our society that don't work and so much hate and animosity, we don't need our politicians fueling the flames more with non-evidenced based bills and political hate mongering.\nI want to be able to get around quickly, safely and efficiently, and connected and safe bike networks and transit are ultimately how that will be achieved. It will provide alternatives to some \u2013 taking them OFF the roads, and then those who wish to remain in their cars will be able to do so and will have less congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes allow cyclists to move more safely throughout the city. They stop easily preventable deaths and also provide a buffer between pedestrians on the sidewalks and the fast cars on the road.\nStreets where bike lanes removal a lane of vehicle traffic are usually chosen where that vehicle lane is parking anyways. Nobody drove in the rightmost lane of Bloor before the bike lanes were installed because you couldn't go ten meters before reaching a parked vehicle. Having the lane be dedicated as parking doesn't even change the amount of traffic that could move through it because it was already essentially dedicated parking anyways.\nRemoving lanes that are already built is a huge waste of taxpayer money. Bloor and University were just finished within the last year, and squandering more money to undo that work is reckless and wasteful.\n"

Urban environmental health impacts human wellbeing through air quality, noise levels, safe spaces for active transportation and community interaction, etc.\n- Bike lanes contribute to a healthy urban environment by creating safer streets for cyclists, reducing local air and noise pollution, and building livable human-scaled urban environments.\nThe proposed framework\n- contradicts multi-modal transportation goals laid out in the SEV\n- contradicts the policy position that active transportation reduces traffic congestion\n- gets in the way of municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could reduce gridlock\nThe Environmental concerns included:\n- air quality reduction\n- noise pollution\n- stormwater runoff due to leaks, tire particles and microplastics, brake dust, road salt, other sediment and debris\n- increase of gas emissions, pollution, etc.\nThe SEV creates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure. Imagine if the roles were reversed, and municipalities were required to justify every car lane with data showing it reduces congestion, or if they had to prove that maintaining car lanes was better than converting them to bike lanes? It may \"seem obvious\" that adding car lanes reduces congestion, at least temporarily, but there are many studies showing that more car lanes increase traffic in the long run, and make the streets (now \"stroads\") more dangerous to anyone not in a car.\nThank you for not proceeding with the proposal of bill 212. Keep the bike lanes, actually increase the number of bike lanes and keep the people safe!\n"
