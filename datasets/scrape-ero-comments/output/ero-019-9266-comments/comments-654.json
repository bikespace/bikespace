        "comment": "The planned removal of bike lanes in Toronto is wrong headed and overreach on the part of the provincial government. The estimated $48million to remove said bike lanes could be used for much better purposes such as healthcare.\nRemoving of these lanes will inevitably lead to increases cyclist/automobile incidents that will result in injury and potentially death.\nThis entirely knee jerk decision needs to be revisited in terms of public policy vs political expediency.\n"

        "comment": "This makes absolutely no sense. The installation of bike lanes has cost the province over $50M and is now a tangible way of keeping people safe. To remove them is to spit in the face of everyone whose taxes contributed to their construction, and a direct message to cyclists in Toronto that their safety does not matter.\n"

        "comment": "I am a West Bend resident, and our household is car-owning and both myself and my partner are cyclists too. Bloor Street is my main route for commuting, whether that be in a car, by Line 2, or by bike.\nSince 2017, I have been a bike courier and dispatcher in Toronto. As someone with a lot of experience working in traffic, both before and after many of our city\u2019s bike lanes were installed, Bill 212 will put the lives of cyclists at greater risk. This bill\u2019s aim would increase the risk for working bike couriers, as well as parking enforcement and police on bikes.\nStreets like Bloor/Danforth, Yonge, and University are busy commercial streets and cyclists are there for some of the same reasons car drivers are - to get to and from the many businesses, offices, and residences on those streets. Furthermore, forcing the city to remove these bike lanes will not remove the cyclists from these streets, but instead will put them at increased risk of collisions with reckless drivers.\nPlease remember that bike lanes on these roads were built after numerous unfortunate cyclist deaths and injuries from collisions with cars (Avenue and Bloor is an example). Removing bike lanes is saying the added risk to cyclists is worth less than a driver\u2019s time - and that\u2019s not a fair trade.\nThere are many reasons why bike lanes are good for public safety, local businesses, the environment, and even reducing traffic congestion by giving commuters safe alternatives to driving when they can. I think that Bill 212 is also provincial overreach - forcing solutions on municipalities who themselves are best suited to decide what works for their cities. My elected officials in City Hall have the mandate for those decisions - and not the provincial government.\n"

Bike lanes are great, they make the city more livable, and research shows that adding more lanes on an urban road doesn't even reduce congestion long term.\nI am also very much against extra red tape requiring municipalities to consult the provincial government on how they design their own municipal roads.\n"

        "comment": "Counterintuitive, useless, and dangerous proposal. Adding back one lane will have absolutely zero impact on gridlock in the city, and puts cyclists in greater danger by forcing them to share traffic with cars. Further, adding cyclist traffic into car traffic will slow down the overall speed of the traffic since lanes will be blocked by slow-moving traffic. Waste of taxpayer funds that will worsen our roads and have no benefits on traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a frequent cyclist and driver in the city of Toronto for many years I have seen the positive outcome of the creation of bike lanes. The separate bike lanes have created such a safe and reliable way to get around the city and I appreciate them while driving my vehicle as well. It gives me confidence as a driver to know that the bikers are in their own lane and not have to worry about potentially hitting a cyclist in my lane. Safety should be more of a concern than relieving traffic conditions that will barely help. It\u2019s not about the bike lanes it\u2019s the sheer amount of vehicles on the road. With less bike lanes means more people will chose not to. It\u2019s especially dangerous and irresponsible to do this with the amount of vehicles on the road especially during rush hours. I think this bill should not be pushed through.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes should be kept in place and more lanes of traffic should not be added. Adding more lanes for motor vehicles has been shown to promote induced demand, and does not solve gridlock. This bill would only further endenture Ontario in investing in motor vehicle infrastructure, when the use of such vehicles exaserbates the climate crisis, and worsens air quality for all ontarians.\nBike lanes offer incredible benefits by moving more people per area than a traffic lane, encourages exercise, and enables low income ontarians to access a more accessible mode of transportation.\nDo not pass this bill.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who started riding a bike because of the accessibility that the Bloor bike lane provided me as a student at the University of Toronto, I find the proposed bill despicable. Spending taxpayer money to remove an asset used daily by hundreds of cyclists year-round is counterproductive and antisocial.\nThe removal of the bike lane would come after a year of a mounting death toll from bike-related accidents and is totally tactless and disrespectful to the families of those victims and everyday cyclists. The removal of the bike lane would not cause Bloor to become a two-lane road. Rather, it would promote more on-street parking, further causing traffic and endangering cyclists as they are made to weave around and navigate much closer to vehicles than previously.\nIn recent years, the bike culture in Toronto has escalated as more people access the lanes as families, for their livelihood, to transit the city in an eco-friendly manner, and as a hobby. It is regressive, disrespectful and dangerous to make the changes proposed in the bill.\n"

Most drivers in Toronto are not from Toronto- they have no idea what it feels like to bike and they don't care. You will be risking injuries to millions of people.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to oppose Bill 212\u2019s proposal to subject new bike lanes to ministerial approval and existing bike lanes to ministerial review and removal orders.\nThe Minister should leave these matters to municipal governments like the City of Toronto, which has conducted extensive consultation and planning in deciding where and how to implement new bike lanes to help Toronto residents commute and get around their city. It is overreach for the provincial government to step in as proposed, particularly to remove existing lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge streets. As a regular user of the first two sets of lanes, I have seen how long it has taken to finish the careful construction of infrastructure in support of these separated lanes. They are much more than simple paint on the roads; they are part of a carefully designed streetscape involving space for pedestrians, cyclists, parking and automobile traffic. Removing these recently completed bike lanes is a complete waste of taxpayer money and will only serve to generate more congestion given the construction that will be necessary to remove them. Based on my observation, these lanes are well used and the protection they afford will only lead to more use, which is of course part of the goal of providing people with safe travel options in the City (which is particularly important for novice cyclists).\nOntario needs to look at what every other major city in the world is doing to reduce traffic congestion. None of them are removing bike lanes or subjecting them to oversight by a higher order of government. Instead, they are reducing traffic volumes through transit initiatives, more dedicated bus and cycling lanes and congestion charges. In Toronto, attention could also be given to building projects which spillover into traffic lanes for years on end. Removing bike lanes will make Toronto a case study in poor urban traffic and transit planning.\nThe government needs to rethink Bill 212\u2019s bike lane provisions and should remove them from this law.\n"

        "comment": "I feel that bike lanes should be shared with walking paths and not divided in the traffic lane as it leads to cogestion and chaos. Bikes are good alternative as it helps humans fit and healthy , consumes no fuel but the issue is that the bikers dont follow rules and are difficult to handle when they are peddling along the shared road. If they peddle on walking path, atleast they will no speed up and will work with walking pedestrians\n"

Toronto has a vibrant and growing cycling culture, which is great for resident health, local businesses, community, reducing traffic, and pollution. The removal of bike lanes will make the roads more dangerous for everyone, by forcing cyclists onto the road, ultimately creating more congestion and distractions for drivers, and putting cyclists in harm's way. Instead of spending taxpayer money on construction to remove these vital pathways, the province and city should be supporting their continued expansion for a safer, greener future.\n"
