        "comment": "Unfortunately, the Ford government is trying to divert attention from the many problems Ontario suffers from, i.e. collapse of health care system, shortage of affordable housing, shocking rise of food bank usage, by a meaningless plan to attack bike lanes.\nThe charge that such lanes cause congestion and/ or gridlock have not been supported or explained by any research or data which is not surprising given how often Conservatives have governed without any regard for real world evidence.\nHopefully court challenges will prevent this nonsensical distraction from ever taking place, in the same manner the outrageous wage suppression tactics for health care workers were defeated.\nThank you for providing this space for citizens and members of the public to voice their legitimate objections to the latest spate of misrule by the current government of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Could anything be more idiotic than this proposal? Aside from the fact that the provincial government has no jurisdiction over city roads, all planning research has shown for decades that THE ONLY WAY to stop car traffic gridlock is to get people out of cars. Several strategies can be deployed to do this, but the best is rebalancing road access to promote more effective modes of transportation. One expected outcome from this is that car travel becomes less desirable relative to other travel modes, which nudges the shift to increased use of other modes. If gridlock is slightly worse now, this means the plan is WORKING - so let it work! Over time, public transit, bike, and other modes of travel will be increasingly used, car gridlock will ease slightly (but never much - which is the point; you are trying to discourage this exceptionally inefficient mode of moving people through a city).\nAssuming all this makes no sense to the provincial government, the obvious question is: what\u2019s next when killing bike lanes doesn\u2019t help with gridlock (it won\u2019t): remove sidewalks? Maybe after that, the buildings lining the street? Why not just go straight to that solution, and convert Bloor into a six lane expressway. Sound dumb? Exactly.\nIdiots.\n"

        "comment": "I live in uptown Toronto. I am in favour of the removal of the bike lanes, as proposed by the Premier.  In particular, I am in favour of removal of the bike lanes on University Avenue (and other main arteries in the City such as Bloor, Yonge Street and now Avenue Road).  The placement of a raised lane and, in any event, restricting traffic to a single lane on Hospital Row was extremely ill-conceived and possibly life-threatening - there is no way that an ambulance could quickly attend to anyone in an accident on University or access the hospitals from University with the modifications that have been made.  As a cyclist, I would not feel safe riding on a major congested artery with frustrated drivers and I favour placing cycling lanes on less busy secondary streets.  Further, I am a lawyer who has worked in Bloor West Village for the past 31 years - I can count on my hands the number of cyclists who ride on Bloor Street in that area between Runnymede and Jane in particular.  The bike lanes are detrimental to area businesses as street parking and the flow of traffic have been impacted, making people think twice about whether to venture into the area to shop.  As for the bike lanes on Bloor Street in the annex area - these are a nightmare for pedestrians - bikes do to stop or even slow down for pedestrians trying to cross the road or cross the small space from a parked car to the sidewalk.  I have been verbally abused, had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit and when driving have had my car pounded on, kicked and otherwise damaged by belligerent cyclists who are completely unaccountable for their actions - unlike drivers, they have no license, no insurance and unless they are home owners contribute nothing to the expensive creation and upkeep of the bike lanes.  I am not impressed that bike lanes are plowed of snow before my own road and sidewalk, for the handful of people who venture out on a bicycle in winter.  I have no problem creating a safe infrastructure for cyclists in the City but placing bike lanes on main, already excessively crowded streets feeds into the seeming unspoken agenda of City Council to attempt to limit car traffic in the City.  With the non-stop building of condos and influx of new residents, this is completely unrealistic and has created an untenable situation for everyone - whether trying to drive, walk or cycle.  I strongly support the removal of these bike lanes from our main City streets.\n"

        "comment": "Remove the bike lanes and along Yonge, Bloor and University Avenue to free up the roads for cars. Congestion along Bloor West is awful and rarely do I see many bikers. They block parking and look ugly. Residents and business owners were not consulted before bike lanes were implemented. Take them out.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is problematic for so many reasons:\n1. Countless traffic studies have shown that adding more car lanes incentivizes driving over using bikes or mass transit and does not actually improve traffic flow. Bike lanes allow for higher-density movement of people, and Torontonians are finally starting to change behaviour to use them given the more comprehensive network that's only recently been built and is now under proposal for being removed again.\n2. All the money spent on bike lanes will have been a waste, and it will cost even more to remove them again.\n3. This is a disturbing overreach of the provincial government, and is a blatantly selfish move by Doug Ford to shorten his commute. This is a municipal matter specific to Toronto and must be decided by Toronto itself. If Ford wants to make decisions that specifically only affect Toronto, he should run for municipal office, but he can not have it both ways. Municipal government exists for a reason.\nHave you considered removing parking lanes on Bloor Street instead? Get rid of a couple hundred parking spaces, and have those drivers park on side streets instead. This is clearly a bigger waste of physical space and thus a greater impediment to car traffic than the 2-foot-wide bike lanes that move hundreds of people per hour and thousands per day.\nToronto has the opportunity to be a leader on clean, efficient commuting, and has finally started taking steps to make systemic improvements to that end. Don't throw it all away so that Ford can shorten his drive by 5 minutes.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am 100% against removing bike lanes in Toronto.\nHas this government heard of climate change?   We should be giving people options to get out of their cars, such as bike lanes.\nThe irony about Bloor, Yonge and University is that the subway is below those roads, so car drivers (poluters) have an option to get out of their car and take TTC, but they choose not to.  Instead, they act like its 1950 and complain to their government (who also act like its 1950).\nThis government is enabling car drivers (poluters), making climate change worse, flooding worse. This government is enabling climate change.\nAll research shows that the more car lanes that exist, the more traffic you will have. Therefore, increasinng traffic lanes does not solve traffic problems, so why do it? Possibly to appeal to older voters who insist on driving everywhere they go?\n"

        "comment": "This is an awful idea. I live at Yonge and St Clair, the bike lanes are in use constantly. If those bikers moved into the car lanes, traffic would be slowed immensely. Adding one more lane to get around bikers will not stop traffic, it will create traffic as drivers have to drive around a bicyclist.\n"

        "comment": "I am of the belief that the provincial government shouldn't have final decisions on what municipalities decide is best for their city's bike lane inferstructure. The cities go through many different processes to ensure whatever change they are making is made for the betterment of the city. This is the job of the municipality and jurisdiction of the city. The bill is a strict overreach from the provincial government to undermine those processes strictly based on the location of the legislative building in Toronto. This bill has been proposed on zero basis of fact and only anecdotes from the parties involved. It is a fact that any individual car take up more space on the road. It's an illusion that cars are moving more people around the city than bicycles. These lanes are enjoyed by many cyclist in the city and allowed for more development and growth of renting bicycles around the city. Any forceful removal of the bike lanes by the provincial government is a step in the opposite direction. Attached is a link of a YouTube video that counts the amount of cyclist and cars that go through the intersection of Avenue Rd and Bloor st w. These lanes are being used much more frequently than it looks.\nPlease do better\n"

Over the past couple of years more Bike lanes have been installed, and the results have been impressive. As a senior, I can only bike in bike lanes. More individuals feel safe riding in bike lanes. Parents with their children like safely in Bike lanes. Without them, there are fatalities, I have had an accident myself. The bike lanes make me feel safe. Congestion by cars causes accidents. Bike lanes help emergency vehicles get through quicker. Please reconsider this removal Bike lines for everyone, safety and security.\n"

It is the only way to move around our neighborhood without biking on a street with cars.\nRemoving these so that people not from our neighborhood can save seconds on their commute is backwards. People travelling on Bloor should increase their usage of the subway beneath it.\nOur family drives and we are massive supporters of the bike lanes.\nIF any child is injured due to removal of bike lanes or lack of installing more, we will personally hold the Ford government responsible for putting politics above family safety.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a waste of city resources and represents moving backwards versus towards a better future. It is not an equitable second only benefits car owners. Doing that makes it less safe for bikers and makes living in those areas less appealing because people don't feel like they can move around freely and safely. Cars should never be prioritized in a huge city, it is more cost effective and safe to prioritize other methods of transit as you will never see a day where there is no traffic in Toronto. Climate change is a huge concern and reducing fossil fuel consumption is beyond important for reducing emissions. Therefore other forms of transportation should always be prioritized as they are the way of the future.\n"
