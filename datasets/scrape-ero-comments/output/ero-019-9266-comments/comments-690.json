        "comment": "As an owner of 2 cars, and living in the City of Toronto, I don\u2019t believe this proposal will alleviate road traffic issues in the city. It will also take away a useful resource to (more) safely traverse the city on a bicycle, which is an effective way for me to move around Toronto. I will continue to cycle on Yonge Street and Bloor Street and rely on my rights as a cyclist under the Highway Traffic Act when doing so, but will miss the protections of the separated bicycle lane on these streets.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes help to reduce congestion by providing a safer alternative to cars; suggesting their removal is absolutely ridiculous. All that will result from this is higher instances of cyclist injury and death and more cars on the road creating more pollution. I am a cyclist who uses these lanes daily, year-round. I also have a car which I elect not to drive in favour of a faster and more sustainable alternative.\n"

        "comment": "To punish cyclists for an infrastructure problem that should be resolved without reducing their safety on the street is ludicrous. Doug Ford spent so much money putting bike lanes in to improve the flow of bikes in certain areas of the city \u2014 Now, they\u2019re going to waste all of our taxpayer money, rip out the lanes and create even more uncertainty for the safety of cyclists??!! Where is the rational? If has been proven that doing this would NOT help the flow of traffic on those streets. Perhaps they need to look to other cities around the world whose infrastructure not only supports cyclists but also drivers. Why are we so far behind in this area? The Ford government needs to do better! Instead of pandering to the likes of those who line his pocket, how about actually looking at the infrastructure of an urban city and trying to improve it for everyone. Very disappointing.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes as outlined in Ontario Bill 212. This proposal represents a significant misallocation of taxpayer funds and poses several critical issues.\nFirst, removing bike lanes is a massive waste of taxpayer money. The City of Toronto has recently invested substantial funds into installing these bike lanes. The Ontario government's plan to remove them not only negates this investment but is also an egregious of additional taxpayer money. This is a clear example of the provincial government overstepping its jurisdiction with a shortsighted, politically motivated proposal.\nAdditionally, removing bike lanes will reduce the safety of commuters, particularly those with lower incomes who rely on bicycles to get around. Bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, and their removal could lead to an increase in accidents and injuries.\nIt's also important to note that there have been no studies conducted by the Ontario government to suggest that bike lanes increase traffic congestion. On the contrary, numerous studies indicate that bike lanes can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. For instance, research from the Wuppertal Institute (https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026) supports the notion that bike lanes contribute positively to traffic management.\nAs both a driver and a cyclist in Toronto, I would be devastated to lose the bike lanes. They are an essential part of the city's infrastructure, promoting healthier lifestyles and providing a viable alternative to car travel. The removal of bike lanes is an example of counter-productive and grossly inefficient governance.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider this proposal. The removal of bike lanes is not only a waste of resources but also a step backward in terms of urban planning and public safety. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being of all commuters and make evidence-based decisions that enhance, rather than hinder, our transportation infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be focusing on municipal road construction or bicycle infrastructure projects. Municipal governments are in the best position to implement and identify road infrastructure development in conjunction with local communities and citizens. The province should fund a robust public transport system to reduce traffic congestion in major metropolitan areas by encouraging people to get out of their vehicles. Bicycle lanes and road design is best left to the experts and not provincial premiers. STAY OUT OF MUNICIPAL POLITICS.\n"

We should be looking to cities that people want to live in - Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich for example - for inspiration. The changes proposed by this bill send Toronto in the wrong direction. This is the kind of moment that people will look back on in 50-75 years and comment \u201cwhat were they thinking??\u201d. We should aim to have better ways to live in our city, not worse.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this bill in the strongest possible terms. Removing these bike lanes is a callous, wasteful, and utterly reprehensible decision that will put Torontonian lives at risk, lead to a rise in accidents, and cost millions of taxpayer dollars.\nIf this proposal goes through, cyclists will lose access to some of the only protected lanes that exist in this city, with no realistic proposal for alternatives. Cycling in Toronto is dangerous enough as it stands (six cyclists have been killed on our roads this year alone) and the government's proposal will increase this risk even further. It's not an exaggeration to say that should this pass, people will be killed. Innocent people \u2014 trying to get to work, get to school, or make deliveries \u2014 will die in the street.\nStudies have shown time and again that adding lanes of traffic does not reduce congestion. Instead, we'll spend millions of dollars to remove these bike lanes, only to see the same continued gridlock, but with a greater incidence of bicycle-related accidents. Nobody wins.\nIn truth, this bill is some of the most despicable political theatre I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing in this city or province, and I hope everyone involved with proposing it feels a deep sense of shame. It reduces public safety, spends public dollars, and offers no appreciable benefit to anyone.\nThis is a shameful, wasteful bill, that threatens the safety of tens of thousands of Torontonians. It must not pass.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential part of the transportation system in Toronto. As someone who occasionally drives in Toronto, I am much more comfortable driving on roads that have good, safe bike lanes, rather than on roads with shared lanes. Safe proper bike lanes help support active transportation, reduce the number of cars on the road, and are an environmentally concious choice. We should be working towards reducing the number of cars on the roads as a way to reducing traffic congestion, rather than reducing the number of bike lanes.\n"

There are no bike lanes on the DVP.\nMy drive up Woodbine in my car is regularly smooth and just as quick as it always was. I also frequently use its bike lane.\nCars are the cause of congestion. Getting people out of their cars will reduce that congestion. Bike lanes will help do that.\n"

The infrastructure is growing year over year and I\u2019m curious where you think all these bikes will go? In the same lanes to cause serious accident or in cars which will only make traffic worse.\n800 million to make traffic worse or the same when you are destroying our healthcare and schools. I hope you have to run on this change after people realize it makes no positive effect on drive times.\n"

People (namely, cyclists) are going to die. Secondly, this is a waste of money. It will cost so much more to remove the bike lanes than it did to put them in to begin with.\nI\u2019m beyond tired of this province wasting my tax dollars, especially in the name of social regression. This is just another example of Ford wanting to set us back rather than make any sort of positive change.\n"

        "comment": "It seems that the name of this bill, which includes \"Saving You Time\", belies a prejudice in favour of car users. If it were a bill for the good of all, not just for car users to whom it seems to be addressed, it should then also include \"and Making Your Commute Safer\" which would be the necessary nod to cyclists and other road users. And the concern about public safety ought to be at the top of the minds of public officials. The preference in favour of car users, demonstrated in the bill's name, can be seen on the roads that are filled with four lanes, a visual statement that other users of public space have less priority.\nWe know that the car is problematic. We keep adding them while the downtown streets aren't getting any wider. At some point, either now or in the near future, with densification happening car use will need to be discouraged. And it's not just a question of space. Private cars are unsafe, they contribute to a degraded environment and to climate change, and their use requires an extraordinary allotment of natural and public resources.\nGovernments will be remembered as good not if they just blindly serve the majority. Rather, they are truly good if they aspire to a vision for the future that makes the system better: more fair, more responsive to the environment, safer, and one where the city is a flourishing hub of rich social interactions. Unfortunately, favouring cars in the way proposed by the bill will be a step away from such a better future.\n"
