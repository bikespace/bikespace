        "comment": "How about spending the money used to tear out bike lanes be used to improve public transit given that almost every study on traffic proves additional lanes dont fix it long term.\nWhy are cities allowed to build their own public infrastructure but not allowed to build their own bike lanes? What do bike lanes have to do with provincial matters?\nThe premier of Ontario should deal with provincial matters and not micromanage cities.\nAlso, please remove irrelevant sections of bypassing environmental studies and approval before projects can proceed. This should be its own seperate issue Not buried behind divisive topics.\n"

        "comment": "I have 6 points to share about this proposal as a resident of Toronto:\n1. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase Transportation options.\n2. I use bike Lanes every day and consider them essential Transportation infrastructure like sidewalks.\n3. We need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users, instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road.\n4. When I drive around Toronto, I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes.\n5. Bike Lanes encourages people to use public transit by using it as a complement transportation option, such as using it as the \"last 1 km\" option of getting to the subway stations.\n6. Removing the bike lanes especially the one in Bloor that has been thoroughly designed and constructed just adds unnecessary construction cost that just doesn't make sense and makes the users and residents along the street struggle in a never ending cycle of construction work. To be honest, doing the construction work of removing it is just plain ridiculous and stupid.\nI hope the proposed removal of the bike lanes in the 3 major street doesn't go through. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am a regular cyclist in Toronto and the bike lanes you are trying to destroy have been crucial for protecting my safety as a citizen of this city.  The lanes in question don't slow traffic or cause gridlock - traffic movement times have not been impacted in any major way, and data shows that businesses have seen increases in foot traffic.  Getting rid of protected bike lanes in the city will mean one thing: MORE DEAD PEOPLE KILLED BY MOTORIZED VEHICLES.  And won't really resolve any of the gridlock issues we are seeing.  There is much that could be done better with road construction schedules (and if the province would bother to do this re: their own mega-projects, a lot of the problem regarding gridlock in Toronto would be solved.)\n"

        "comment": "I use my bike every day to commute to work. I'm lucky in that my route to work includes utilizing a pedestrian & bike only street, the west end rail path. The bloor west bike lane is also a part of my commute.\nOn the other side of the rail-path my route includes Davenport and St Claire (west of Caledonia). Biking in these areas is difficult because:\n- there's little or no bike infrastructure\n- roads are congested with parked cars and lots of through-traffic\n- the side streets are not continuous, forcing me to use the main roads.\nI feel much less safe biking in these areas.\nGrade-separated Bike infrastructure is harder to saturate with traffic and, requires less maintenance compared with motor vehicle roads, and provides traffic free pathways for emergency vehicles.\nIt's frustrating to me that the province wants to spend administrative resources reviewing already built and future bike lanes. The literature is quiet clear that it would be more economical to build more bike lanes to induce bike traffic demand and reduce car traffic. And that is without accounting for the time spent administering this new department.\nPlease drop this bill. Bikes are not just for recreation. They are a viable alternative to car travel that costs the province less money to maintain. And please publish the reports that were generated by your staff to support this bill. I would hope it's not written based of the anecdotal stories of a few constituents.\n"

        "comment": "Eliminating essential traffic lanes for a mode of transportation that is neither widely used by the majority of citizens nor is safe year-round is an IRRESPONSIBLE decision. This will only longer commute times, decreased productivity (a problem for this country), and heightened road rage, among other issues. Moreover, we lack an efficient or safe public transportation system as a viable alternative. BILL 212 will NOT reduce gridlock, DO NOT PASS THIS BILL.\n"

        "comment": "There is zero evidence that removing a bike lane will ease car congestion. Zero evidence.\nWhat it will do is suddenly make the roads more dangerous for those on bicycles that used the lanes in question. Removing bike lanes is not only a waste of tax money, it's regressive. Every thriving major city in the world knows that more bikes on the road = less car traffic. Why are Ontario cities different?\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is a deeply regressive measure that will restrict municipal autonomy and discourage safe, sustainable urban planning. Requiring provincial approval for bike lanes on streets where car lanes would be removed ignores the reality of urban transportation: bike lanes are vital for reducing congestion, promoting environmentally friendly travel, and providing safe alternatives to car-dependent commutes. Cities like Toronto have invested in bike infrastructure not to hinder traffic but to create a balanced transportation network that serves everyone.\nThe argument that bike lanes have a \"negative impact on vehicle traffic\" overlooks data showing that cities with comprehensive bike networks experience decreased traffic congestion over time. Instead of stripping local governments of their decision-making power on transportation matters, the province should be supporting local plans to diversify commuting options and reduce car reliance.\nUsing isolated concerns, such as slower traffic on specific streets, to justify an overarching ban on bike lanes prioritizes convenience for drivers over the safety and sustainability of our cities. The government\u2019s approach to data collection, dismissing usage during winter or on rainy days, is clearly aimed at minimizing the value of bike lanes instead of offering a holistic view of their benefits. The time and money should instead go toward expanding transit and cycling infrastructure and addressing actual transit issues like the delayed opening of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT.\nOntario should focus on solutions that truly tackle gridlock through multimodal transportation, not by stifling progress on safer, more sustainable streets.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is absolutely ridiculous, I was involved in an accident where a driver refused to share the road while I was on my electric scooter in my bike lane. They drove in my bike lane pushing me off the road and into a polecausing me to be off work for over a year. In which time frame I struggled financially and now have life long damage. We need safer bike lanes not less. 2 other people in my appartment were also hit by cars not sharing the road. For a country that wants less emissions I fail to see how putting more cars on the road will help that agenda. We need more public transit We need better means other than driving. Bicyclist will just hold up traffic and take up full lanes now instead of having there own. This makes no sense and it's clear ford is thinking with his pocket and not his brain.\n"

The bike lanes are a distraction from the real meat of the bill which is what is happening with the 413, including exempting it from environmental assessment, granting the provincial government the right to take your land for a highway. and the right to create an easement across your property for broadband.  I would encourage everyone to read the bill.  The backward thinking of the Ontario conservatives will set this province back twenty years.\n"

They have been proven to reduce congestion in the long run, by encouraging people to get out of cars and get onto space and energy efficient vehicles - bikes!

        "comment": "If the goal is removing congestion on roads then the solution cannot possibly mean removing a viable, green way for people to travel through the city. I live in Toronto and our bike lanes are vital to providing an alternative, convenient method of travel. Without them we lose a safe way to move about the city and may have to use vehicles (meaning more cars on the road, causing more congestion) or an overcrowded TTC to get around.\nBike lanes are essential to keeping bikers safe, especially as our streets have also become congested with e-bikes from food delivery drivers. Removing bike lanes increases the liklihood of accidents between cars and bikers, which puts people's lives at risk and does nothing to solve road congestion problems.\nWhen we imagine what greener, more commuter friendly cities look like, it's not cities with more cars and less bike lanes. This proposal is archaic in its logic and is not moving us towards a better future.\n"
