        "comment": "My family lives in Summerhill-Rosedale (north of Bloor, south of St. Clair) in one of the many \"landlocked\" neighborhoods that rely solely on Yonge Street as the only means of ingress and egress. Neighborhood pockets on the east of Yonge are blocked on the east by the Yellow Creek Ravine that runs parallel to Yonge while those pockets west of Yonge have intentionally closed off road access connections to/from Avenue Road in order to prevent cut through traffic between the major streets.  There are no secondary north-south streets in this area where bike lanes could be installed.  We have no choice but to take Yonge to go anywhere like dropping off our children to school or for my daily commute to the suburbs for work.\nWe have seen noticeable improvements in traffic flows from when the Yonge Street bike lane pilot was introduced with more dedicated left hand turns lanes or wider passing areas. I recall some advanced green traffic signals were added to help with high traffic left turns as well.  However, there is still room for improved traffic flows where traffic planners and engineers can continuously address design issues based on constructive user feedback.  For example, one of the main causes of northbound gridlock on Yonge is due to the left hand turn at the non-signalized intersection at Yonge & Delisle just north of St. Clair. A vehcile turning left here can cause cascading traffic back-up all the way down to Bloor.  If this left hand turn is banned then traffic would flow much better during peak times. The traffic immediately north of Delise passing Mount Pleasant Cemetery to Davisville generally flows very well.  A little bit of tweaking like this will make traffic flow better.\nIt is unrealistic for people to expect that the traffic will flow as it once did with two lanes in each direction but this comes at the cost of making Yonge Street much safer for cyclists, pedestrians and drivers.  I believe the narrowing of Yonge Street to a single lane of traffic in each direction along with the visual and physical constrictions due to the bike lanes has had the effect of slowing down cars even outside of peak times. I rarely see vehicles dangerously speeding along this section of Yonge Street anymore like they typically do on Avenue Road or Mt. Pleasant.\nWe are a biking family.  We often bike our children to school and, on weekends, we explore the city on bikes.  It was terrifying biking on the old Yonge Street before the bike lanes were introduced. As a landlocked neighbourhood, we had no choice but to venture toward Yonge Street to get anywhere.  We would always avoid Yonge Street itself and bike on the sidewalks instead.  Occassionally pedestrians would yell at us to get off the sidewalk but it would be suicide to risk our lives biking on the old Yonge Street.\nThe Province and City needs to ensure that families like ours can get around the city safely on bikes, on foot and in our vehicles and I believe the Yonge Street bike lanes has achieved this objective for all three modes of travel.\n"

        "comment": "This is wasteful and outrageous.  Toronto voters voted for mayors and councillors who supported bike lanes for a reason.  For some of us, including me, cycling is our main means of commuting downtown.  The provincial government is requiring me to go into the office in person, which is already a waste of time and resources, and now you want me to do that in a more expensive way and spend an extra half hour away from my family stuck in traffic, or risk getting hit by a car in shared lanes?  Do you really hate your citizens this much?!\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad idea. The character of the neighbourhoods have become significantly better since the introduction of the bike lanes. The safety of the neighbourhoods are much improved too.\nMaking more decisions for cars and for the commuters who don't come from these places is short-sighted and unfair.\nMoreover, the idea that saving 1-2 minutes for individual commuters over all the people who live in these places is incredibly mean spirited.\nToronto doesn't need more cars. It needs more transit. This won't fix anything.\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the most important East-West bike lines in the city, you never see bikes on the bike line, cause there is no such thing as \"traffic on the bike line\", the people voting against it are clearly not bike riders. Also you won't remove the bike traffic, you'll move it to the car lines becoming mix traffic making it more dangerous to drivers and riders.\nThe issue is that traffic is made by cars, 3 or 4 lanes of traffic won't help, we need better public transport more subway lines and busses, long busslines and local ones, get ride of the streetcars.\n"

        "comment": "This is my first time commenting on any government matter, but I find the bike lane changes in this bill untenable.\nResidents of Toronto had the opportunity to elect a mayor committed to removing bike lanes. Instead, Olivia Chow was elected, with anti-bike lane candidates receiving less than 10% of the popular vote. This clearly indicates that people living in Toronto want bike lanes. If this is in question, the Conservatives should hold a referendum in which only Toronto residents can participate.\nI understand that many non-residents visit and commute in Toronto. However, as they are not residents, they should have no say in how the city manages its local streets. Imagine if the province mandated the removal of all cars from Courthouse Square in Goderich simply because visitors preferred a quieter space; it would be absurd.\nI drive in Toronto, and I've never biked here. Removing bike lanes will not reduce congestion. This legislation adds red tape, incurs unnecessary spending, and pushes those with the means to relocate to more progressive cities to actually do so. These earners are precisely the type of people Ontario should aim to attract, instead their taxes will be collected by Quebec or British Columbia instead.\nSincerely,\nJacob\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI'm a Toronto resident who has started using a bike to commute to work. I have only started commuting via bike because of the implementation of bike lanes along the route. I never felt confident or safe enough to bike without them and it has been a huge improvement to my travel time, mental and physical health biking so often. I am so disappointed that the province is overstepping and removing the bike lanes. Please leave them alone. I don't understand how a government who says they are fiscally responsible would spend money undoing something that has been so recently built.\n"

        "comment": "There is no sound, academically supported economic, political or social argument in favor of reducing bike lanes. Indeed, the evidence points in the other direction. This is nothing more than a machiavellian political charade to appeal to a subsetbof voters and donors who are angry about a problem that doesn't exist. Maybe a bike ride would blow off some steam for those people and they'd see the physical and mental benefits... but to do that, you need a bike lane framework. Stop being selfish, Doug and put the city first.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of road infrastructure, and it encourages commuters to use bicycles rather than driving a car. This actually helps reduce traffic. Furthermore, many people will continue to use bikes even without a dedicated lane. This will decrease the safety of bicyclists and cause them to take up a full driving lane when they are on the road.\nI am completely OPPOSED to the proposal which will allow the provincial government to remove existing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 39, which limits the decision-making authority of municipalities regarding street safety and infrastructure. This bill disrupts the autonomy of local governments and undermines their ability to make informed decisions that best serve their communities. Municipalities understand their unique transportation needs and are better positioned to create solutions that address gridlock and improve the quality of life for residents.\nBike lanes and active transportation infrastructure are not only essential for safe, sustainable commuting but also help ease traffic congestion by offering alternatives to car travel. Limiting municipal powers to implement these initiatives will have negative consequences on our urban mobility and environmental goals.\nPlease reconsider Bill 39 and support policies that respect municipal autonomy and promote sustainable transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I live on Indian Grove, right near Keele and Bloor. I regularly travel along Bloor by car, walking, cycling and using the subway. I would ask that you please not remove the Bloor St bike lane between Jane and the Don Valley Parkway. I regularly take my children on the back of my bike in the bike lane to their various after school activities in the Annex. I would not be able to do this without the bike lane as the street would not be safe to travel on with my kids. My experience driving on this section of Bloor is that the traffic generally moves fairly well, even during rush hour, and so I don't really see the bike line as much of an impediment when driving.\nI have no issues if you want to remove the bike lane west of Jane as that section does not seem very useful or well travelled. I also agree that the University bike lanes should be removed and am ambivalent about the Yonge St ones. There is no real east-west alternative to Bloor that allows one to gets across the City in a separated bike line and it would be devastating to lose it and drastically impact my ability to travel with my children by bike. Thank you for your consideration of this comment.\n"

        "comment": "This is an egregious waste of time, effort, and money. Removing out bike lanes in dense areas is absolutely backwards; biking saves carbon emissions, reduces the amount of people travelling by cars, and promotes healthy living. In the face of the climate crisis, prioritizing a mode of transit that pollutes our air and atmosphere is outrageous. Perhaps the province, instead of preventing the construction of new bike lanes and actively removing ones that are well-used and already built, might consider spending its money on more efficient modes of transit like high speed electric rail projects, which would move significantly numbers of people cheaply and cleanly.\n"
