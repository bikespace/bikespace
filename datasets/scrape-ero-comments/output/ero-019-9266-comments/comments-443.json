Biking supports public transit infrastructure, and it also supports business along bike routes. As a pedestrian I would much rather walk to a business located on a street with a bike lane than one with an additional lane of car traffic hugging right up against the sidewalk.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the passage of this law.\nIt is important to encourage all alternatives to driving in Ontario communities for many reasons, including: more biking means fewer cars on the road; better bike infrastructure keeps people safe; some people (youth, the elderly) cannot drive and should have a safe way to get around (i.e. separated bike lanes); the cost of car ownership is high and getting higher - sometimes a bike is the only option; it's a healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around.\nTaking out bike lanes would be a waste of money and a real step backward for the people of this province. Please reconsider this course of action.\nHere are some resources for more information (See \"Further Reading\" at the end of the article): https://cyclingfallacies.com/en/12/cycling-causes-congestion\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act,\" particularly the mandate to remove bike lanes on major Toronto streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University, as well as the overarching framework that discourages municipalities from developing bike-friendly infrastructure. This proposal is not aligned with Ontario\u2019s climate and transportation goals, nor does it prioritize safety, accessibility, or equitable transportation choices.\nFirst, reducing bike lanes undermines safety. Bicycle infrastructure provides cyclists with dedicated space, protecting them from cars and reducing accidents. Removing these bike lanes will force cyclists into closer proximity with vehicles, making streets less safe and potentially increasing collisions and injuries. This is especially concerning on high-traffic streets, where cyclists and pedestrians are already vulnerable.  Simply put, I don't want to have to deal with cyclists while I am driving, nor do I want to be in constant danger of being hit by a truck when I'm cycling.\nFrom an accessibility perspective, cycling lanes empower individuals who cannot afford a car, giving them an affordable, convenient way to navigate the city. The proposed bill would limit accessible transportation options for these individuals and discourage environmentally friendly commuting habits. Reducing bike lanes also impacts people who rely on adaptive bikes or e-bikes, further marginalizing individuals with mobility challenges.\nEnvironmental implications of this proposal are equally troubling. Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transport that directly supports Ontario\u2019s climate goals. By discouraging bike infrastructure, the province risks increasing vehicle emissions, exacerbating urban air pollution, and contributing to the climate crisis. Bike lanes are not only essential for reducing carbon emissions but also improve air quality in densely populated areas.\nThe proposal also neglects equity in urban planning. Toronto, like many cities, is home to diverse socioeconomic groups, including people who rely on active transportation. Bike lanes level the playing field by offering a cost-effective, independent form of mobility for lower-income residents, students, and young families. Removing these lanes privileges drivers at the expense of vulnerable populations, further entrenching social inequities.\nFinally, promoting car-centric urban design, especially in a city with congestion issues, is counterproductive. Encouraging active transportation, such as cycling, is a proven way to reduce gridlock by shifting some demand from motor vehicle lanes to bike lanes. Reverting to car-centric streets does not \u201csave time\u201d long-term; it simply redirects congestion while removing healthier, more sustainable transportation choices.\nBill 212 fails to consider the comprehensive, long-term benefits of dedicated bike infrastructure. Instead, it prioritizes short-term car convenience, which comes at the expense of public safety, accessibility, environmental health, and equity. I urge the Ontario government to reconsider this proposal and to promote policies that foster safe, accessible, and sustainable transportation options for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is ludacrious for multiple reasons. Firstly, these bike lanes are still new. The traffic along Bloor has finally lessened due to the newly installed bike lanes. And Bloor can finally be used again as its been under construction for the past year. To undergo ANOTHER few seasons of construction in the same area makes no sense when so much more infrastructure needs attentions.\nFurther west along Bloor the potholes on the main road are terrible- not even discussing how under maintained those bike lanes are.\nThis city will always have bikers, and making it less safe for them to mobilize will only create more frustration for drivers as they will be forced to share the lanes.\nAs someone who bikes everywhere as their primary transportation, I can attest that even if there are no bike lanes, as there aren\u2019t in many sections of Torontos main streets, that bikers will still continue take the most direct paths.\nPlease focus on other areas and streets that need more maintenance and leave these brand new bike lanes for now. Especially removing then right before Winter with the amount of bike delivery drivers that use these lanes is just against common sense.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a step back on long-term infrastructure that can sustain the growing population. In addition, the removal of cycling infrastructure is against what evidence and data has proven, that cycling does help improve congestion in neighborhoods. In addition, the use of protected cycling ensures the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicle users. The cycling infrastructure provides further benefit to the community by increasing traffic to local businesses.\nHowever, beyond the discussion of cycling infrastructure, Schedule 3 of the Bill 212 document specificaly states for \" exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nThis is a clear indication that Bill 212 is not focused on addressing the safety of commuters, but instead is a means to shortcut through specific process to speed up Highway 413 and other related projects. In other words, this is intended to harm fragile ecosystems and communities within Ontario, with no consideration for long-term effects.\nIn summary, Bill 212 ignores evidence and data that prove improvements to gridlock, commuter safety, and benefits local businesses as a whole. The exemption from environmental assessments further emphasize that this bill is not meant for the improvement of gridlock in congested cities, but instead as a means to cut through important regulation that exist to protect the health and well-being of the enviroment and the community.\n"

        "comment": "As a motorist I believe components of Bill 212 are a terrible idea for several reasons.\nRegarding the proposed \"addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\". We are always one lane away from solving \"traffic congestion\". You want to induce demand for alternative modes of transportation such as bicycling, or public transit to prevent and reduce motor vehicle congestion. This addendum should be removed. Additionally, where is the evidence that these specific changes will reduce traffic congestion? I have not seen anything that shows this is an evidence informed decision.\nRegarding the component \"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\"bike lanes\") that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation\", why would you want to add another layer of policy regarding local traffic planning? These decisions regarding bike lanes should stay within the jurisdiction of municipal government. The provincial focus should be highways.\nI do not believe this is an effective use of provincial resources and the province should focus on other sections of the act that accomplish their goal to \"get drivers where they need to go faster\", which should realistically be changed to \"get PEOPLE where they need to go faster\". This effort should not be limited to one mode of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I live and work near Bloor Street in the Annex and use the Bloor bike lanes every day to commute to and from work in the Bloor West / Dundas area, and to attend business meetings in the downtown core every week. I also use them evenings and weekends to shop in my neighborhood, attend exercise classes, and collect my kids from school.\nI used to drive to work every day, spending $30/day on parking, because although I would have preferred to cycle, it was too dangerous for me to do so. The bike lanes have been a game changer for me, allowing me to get exercise and save thousands of dollars per year on parking. They keep me safe, they keep my 3 kids safe, and they encourage a lot more commerce along Bloor because I often stop in at local businesses along Bloor on my commute home, something I never did when driving.\nThe bike lanes are very well used year round, and I often count more cyclists than cars on Bloor every time I ride. Ten people on bikes take up a tiny fraction of ten people in cars,\nSo who is really causing the gridlock?\nRemoving the lanes will put cyclists in danger and I oppose their removal in the strongest possible way. The street parking is the real problem; carving out a whole lane of traffic so four cars can park on a whole city block is absurd.\nI strongly oppose the arbitrary removal of these lanes to score political points. This government is illogically pushing for MORE cars in the city which will never solve the problem of traffic congestion. Focus on what every other great city in the world is doing: mixed mobility solutions that make roads better for ALL users.\n"

This will result in more political bureaucracy and delays to make any meaningful change in a reasonable time. The city's problems are related to over population plus the lack of reliable public transportation. Reducing a mode of transportation ( biking) is not going to solve the problem. Perhaps think about re-purposing the bike lanes in the winter time as there is less use but removing them altogether doesn't solve anything and makes things worst.\n"

First of all, the provincial government should not be micromanaging municipal issues, such as bike lanes. Although I am a car user and do not commute by bike, I fully support the presence of bike lanes throughout Toronto, even on major roadways. Saving myself and other car commuters a few minutes of traffic is not worth the dangers of cycling through the city without dedicated lanes.\nI urge the government not to remove any existing bike lanes. Instead, they should invest the money in expanding bike lanes throughout the city and improving public transit, which would reduce reliance on cars as the primary mode of commuting. I strongly disagree with the government spending taxpayers' money to remove bike lanes that have already been installed.\n"
