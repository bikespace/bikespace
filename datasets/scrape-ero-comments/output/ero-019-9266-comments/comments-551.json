I view not taking my 5m long SUV into daily traffic is doing my bit, but clearly some of my neighbours don't think this way. The pollution and carbon footprint from all those slow moving cars can be avoided.\nI don't think it's fair for the government to focus the eye of Sauron on people who ride bikes as the cause of our congestion right now. There are a lot of factors coming together to result in more cars on the road. There aren't very many things getting cars OFF the road. Creating an us-vs-them dynamic is dark politics and doesn't solve the very real problems that went unaddressed for decades.\nMoreover the provisions for building highways through the greenbelt that is stapled to this nonsense of provincial overreach into municipal politics strikes me as dark politics in the extreme. People need to calm down and get off the rage politics.\nFinally, I would like to object to the greenbelt paving.\n"

I started a year ago and really got into it in 2024, because the system was only available to my area recently.\n-Biking helps me reach TTC subway stations fast, which cuts commuting time by half.\n-Biking improved my mental health drastically because it got me to exercise more, hesitate less to go places because I no longer had to wait for public transport\n-Biking made me discover new shops and cafes I had never seen when taking TTC.\n-Biking became a thing I would do with friends, which brings a sense of community.\n-Biking helps me save money. I no longer need Uber when TTC isn't offering decent transport covering, which results in less traffic.\nI found myself doing a lot more, which means spending more, which means improving our local economy.\nBiking allowed me to feel less trapped, in a city where public transportation hasn't kept up with the city demographics.\nWe need more safe bike lanes, more bike share docks, more consideration for alternative solutions to traffic rather than going back to what wasn't working.\n"

        "comment": "I want to voice my disapproval and rejection in the strongest possible terms of \"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\". The title alone is patently misleading as it will neither reduce gridlock nor save me, or anyone I know, time. As someone who cycles around Toronto as my primary mode of transportation and comes from a family of cyclists and drivers, I use the bike lanes on Bloor on a near daily basis, as do other members of my family and community at large. They have been invaluable for me both in terms of saving time, and in being safer on the roads. Those I know who drive have not been bothered by them in the slightest, and approve of their installation. It is true that traffic has gotten worse, but removing bike lanes will only make the problem even less manageable. If people who are currently cyclists switch to driving, traffic will get more congested, not less. The roads have also been incredibly dangerous, and removing these bike lanes will cost lives, full stop. Let me repeat that again: people will die, because of Premiere Ford's bill 212. Not to mention the fact that these bike lanes were installed at great cost to the city's tax payers, and removing them would be a massive waste of money. Their removal would also hold up traffic, due to the amount of construction involved in the process, the exact thing this bill is saying it will avoid.\nPremiere Ford should remember his prior claims of wanting smaller government and less interference - his hypocrisy in this matter is glaring to every single Torontonian and Ontarian. This seems like a pandering bid for popularity that is fooling no one, and if any other politician attempted to encroach into municipal politics on a provincial level, and waste tax payers' money so wantonly, I'm sure he would be the first to try to stop it. This is simply unacceptable behaviour, and something I and my fellow Ontarians will remember come election time. DO NOT pass this bill. Lives are at stake, and while Premiere Ford has shown time and again that human lives are not something he's particularly interested in improving, he should at least stick to his own promises and stop wasting valuable money and time by meddling where he doesn't belong.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is flawed in so very many ways. Take my town, Guelph for example. We have a cycling master plan that went through exhaustive public engagement & has been in place for nearly 12 years. In that time we have had 3 civic elections and if there has been any negativity during these campaigns, those who opposed the master plan have been defeated by the citizens of Guelph. Due to downloading and increased costs to our city by this present government, we are now paying significantly more in property taxes, & agreed upon time lines for things like implementing the cycling master plan are being pushed further into the future. This legislation will further hamper the city of Guelph to implement our masterplan & leave significant gaps in the planned for system. The result of this will no doubt result in more fatalities here in Guelph. Frankly, this legislation does not allow for study but arbitrary action & seems aimed to make the current Premier's ride in the back of his taxpayer funded limo a couple of moments faster. The reason we have public hearings & study is to reduce whims and waste of resources. Removing bike lanes without proper study or consultation is a waste of money, time & resources. Respectfully I'm requesting that this legislation be either withdrawn or amended so taxpayer have a say based of evidence and REAL public consultation.\n"

According to the survey this is a significant increase from 29% which was reported in 2009.\n"

In the Waterloo region, our municipal and regional government has spent a great deal of time and tax payer money planning for future growth. Their plans are well researched and well thought out and adapted to our local needs. All urban planning research indicates that bike lanes reduce traffic and save lives.\nAs a driver I feel much more comfortable driving when cyclists have their own lanes, traffic signals etc. The roads are safer and less stressful to drive.\nThis government\u2019s one size fits all approach to urban planning is inappropriate and ill conceived. Regulations that might work in Toronto will not suit inhabitants of other municipalities. We have a division of government services for a reason. Local governments understand the needs of their communities. Allow them to do their jobs and stop wasting tax payer money changing well thought out plans and policy at the local level.\n"

How are they suddenly a traffic concern? I have been a bike rider for over 20 years in Toronto. I did not feel safe without the bike lanes and we now have enough downtown that I can get around safely in a protected lane. Some parts of Bloor Street with these bike lanes never had more than 2 lanes of traffic. It was parking on both sides and 2 lanes of traffic. The City studied these routes before installing the bike lanes. At the very least, do another study with the city to see what effects ripping them out will have.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m strongly opposed to Bill 212. As a regular cyclist, I support having safe roads for vulnerable users. While cycling, I often already deal with aggressive drivers even with physical barriers/lanes. Removing them will make drivers even more aggressive and agitated, and even more dangerous for cyclists. With bike lanes, car drivers will feel more comfortable knowing that cyclists have enough space to bike next to them. Cycling also contributes to the Paris Agreement goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is already having negative implications on the world, and having more cars on roads is just making things worst. We should be encouraging greener commuting alternatives like cycling. When you build cycling infrastructure, people will start using them more. The evidence is in the Bike Share statistics. Usage rates have skyrocketed in recent years. Vulnerable users deserve to have safe roads to get from point A to B.\n"

        "comment": "I'm strongly opposed to this bill as a downtown Toronto resident who commutes daily using a bike. Bike lanes provide a safe, efficient form of transportation for me and many others, which means I do not need to buy a car or rely on taxi/ride shares to get around and thus reducing congestion. Further, as a biker, I would need to use the main lanes designated for cars to bike, which could likely increase congestion. People need as many transportation alternatives to cars as possible to reduce congestion.\nBike lanes are critical infrastructure in the city of Toronto to reduce congestion and dependance on cars,  increase safety both for bikers and pedestrians, and facilitate efficient, carbon-friendly transportation within the city. Expanding and maintaining bike lines should be a top priority for a city. Removing bike lanes would be costly, waste critical investment and have minimal impact on improving congestion (if any).\nSome alternative considerations to address the problems of congestion could include removing/reducing street parking on critical streets, introducing congestion taxes for drivers and expanding public transportation options.\nMy tax dollars should be used to improve the city's infrastructure and not wasted to remove critical infrastructure that my tax dollars helped pay for. Many drivers in Toronto are not even residents of the city and should not be prioritized over the needs of many Toronto residents that live without the need of a car.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI strongly object to this Act and urge the government to scrap it in its entirety. The whole thing is contrary to the principles of environmental protection.\nFirst, the Act is itself founded upon poor data. The Minister and Premier have stated repeatedly that only 1.2 percent of people in the GTA bike to work. This figure should not be used because it includes the entire Census Metropolitan Area, rather than Toronto proper, and people also cycle to do errands and shopping, visit friends, etc. It's not just for work. A 2019 study by the city showed that about 70 percent of Torontonians cycle in some capacity. Cycling rates are higher when there is safe infrastructure. If you build it, cyclists will come.\nSecond, there are no workable routes on side streets that could replace the Bloor, University, and Yonge bike lanes. That is obvious to anyone who looks at a map. Personally, I never cycled on Bloor or University before the lanes were installed. Now, I do it all the time. Which allows me to stop and check out anything interesting on my way and easily patronize local businesses. Even if it was possible to put the lanes on secondary streets, most of my destinations are on major roads. The bike lanes should get people where they want to go safely.\nThird, these changes to remove bike lanes and prevent new ones from being installed will get people killed. Streets with protected bike lanes are safer for all road users - pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. We are already at a record high of 6 cyclists killed in Toronto in 2024. As someone who rides a bike, I don't think it's too much to ask to be able to get around without constantly risking death.\nFourth, this is a huge overreach of provincial powers. The whole reason we have municipal governments is that local government is best positioned to make decisions about local issues, like road design.\nAnd finally, there is no evidence that doing this will ease congestion at all. If the focus of transport infrastructure is on cars and maximum possible throughput of cars, you're going to get more cars. The 401 is a perfect example. At its widest, it is 18 lanes, one of the widest highways on the continent. But it's still congested. If 18 lanes isn't enough, what is? Instead, the focus of transportation planning needs to be how to get the maximum number of people around safely. There simply is not space in Toronto for everyone to drive everywhere they need to go. It's an intractable geography problem. Instead, safe infrastructure for active transportation (and robust public transit) allows people to use other modes and frees up space for those who need to drive.\nSo I urge you to scrap this whole bill and leave cyclists alone.\n"

I am a student from the University of Toronto who rides Toronto Bike share on University and Bloor daily to get to class, soccer practice, or the library.\nThere will only be bikers if the bike lane infrastructure in the city is safe and well-connected, which is what dedicated bike lanes provide. It is an ignorant thing to say that there are few bikers so there is no reason to invest in bike lanes. Over 50% of people in Toronto say they would like to travel by bike more. We should be investing in infrastructure which incentivizes people to bike more. Toronto Bike share members have increased to their highest numbers in the past couple of years.\nBuilding more bike lanes can incentivize drivers to opt for biking instead, removing traffic from lanes and reducing congestion. A larger number of bikers reduces carbon emissions and is more economical and sustainable than driving. I, along with many bikers, use biking coupled with public transit, which is also better for the environment and decreases the number of people driving cars. Removing bike lanes will not improve congestion on the roads and the proposal and policy will have many negative effects on Torontonians, specifically students in the city.\n"
