        "comment": "Keeping the bike lanes is integral to creating a city that is both sustainable and functional.\nAs the city is growing and will continue to grow there is no way that opening up a few bike lanes will help improve traffic flow. And from the data I\u2019ve seen traffic has not slowed significantly where there are bike lanes.\nThe fact is when you force bikes and cars to share the road, traffic will slow to match the slowest vehicle. As a cyclist commuter, I will continue to cycle on those streets, as busy as they are, where you remove bike lanes. And all those cars will have to drive slowly behind me or pass going into another lane. This solution will only cause further tensions between cars and cyclist and increase the number of accidents.\nLarge cities in Europe have built up public transit and bike lanes as an effort to reduce car traffic in their city core. They recognize that as cities grow, there is just not enough space to accommodate those additional cars.\nFrankly, the emotional and irrational proposals here in this law are disturbing. The fact that the bike lane removals are being combined with removing environmental and personal protections for building a highway reads as manipulative.\nWhat would solve traffic congestion? If more people took public transit or biked to work.\n"

I am also a motorist in the City of Toronto and Province of Ontario. I drive regularly on Yonge Street, Bloor Street and University Avenue as well as Highways 401 and 407.\nYou are proposing to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles. This would be a waste of my money. Please stop wasting my money.\nYou are also proposing to give the province the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes. This would be a waste of money. Please stop wasting my money.\nYou are also proposing to expedite the construction of Highway 413.  The province already has Highway 407 that services the same area and that is underutilized.  The construction of Highway 413 would be a waste of my money.  Please stop wasting my money.\n"

If you really want to improve traffic flow on streets such as Bloor, remove the on-street parking.  It is telling that this government doesn't want to address the real problem - parked cars - but instead wants to take on a fake problem by declaring war on cycling, all while most metro areas in North America are *expanding* bike lanes.\n"

The government is being shortsighted and clearly has an ulterior motive with this proposal. This is a waste of money and will get more people injured or killed.\nLeave bike lanes alone.

        "comment": "Bill 212 is completely illogical.\nIt will waste excessive amounts of money. Both by undoing projects that municipalities (the people who actually live in the area) already decided they wanted, and by needlessly increasing the bureaucracy and paperwork required to complete new bike lane projects.\nIt will put millions of bikers across the province including myself and my friends and family at a greater safety risk; forcing more situations where bikers have to take the entire traffic lane for their own safety (and therefore not reducing vehicle traffic congestion).\nDiscouraging biking will also reduce citizen's physical fitness and quality of life, be bad for businesses along bike lane routes, and be bad for the environment (and traffic congestion), when the people that can afford to do so switch to driving to work along those same congested roads.\nSpeaking of the environment and citizen impacts, the shortcuts introduced by the Building Highways Faster Act and the Highway 413 Act are also quite concerning. There is a reason \"red tape\" exists - to protect people and the environment. It would be a sad day for our province if those protections could just be bypassed\n"

        "comment": "I drive a car in Toronto.  I have not ridden a bike in thirty years and rarely use transit.  Bike lanes are essential to safe streets.  Removal of bike lanes will not reduce congestion -- there are many studies which confirm this and also note that our fire and ambulance services have stated that bike lanes do not reduce their response time.  Bloor St now moves more quickly than it did before the dedicated bike lanes.  It is safer without the possibility of drivers weaving in and out of lanes.  Even if traffic flow is more important to this government than lives, it should be recognized that without bike lanes, accidents will increase.  Each accident will cause traffic delays and more congestion.  Nor is it reasonable to state that bike lanes should be on secondary roads.  There is no reasonable alternative to Bloor St for east/west travel.  Removal of bike lanes will not remove cyclists but will make our streets more dangerous and slower.\n"

        "comment": "I am not a bike rider, but I totally oppose this bill, for many reasons\nFirst as a tax payer, I don't approve you use my money to rip out a project that we already spent thousands of dollars on . Again my tax money.\nSecondly, although I am a car driver, I know that these lanes have made it easier and safer  for bike and vehicle to share the road. Before these lanes where placed it was a mess.  The fact is you remove the lanes, these bike commuters will still use these roads.  Many their only means to get0 about.   They used to do it before the bike lanes and it was a miserable experience for all.  They will continue.  Because these roads identified, are the centre of the city ..\nToronto, unlike other Ontario cities has a growing number of bike rides that utilise their bikes as means of commuting, not as  luxuries & recreation like the urban areas.  It's a greener, economically Viable for those who can't afford buying a car or two, less time wasted in finding parking in downtown ( which discourages many from going downtown) and now with the bike lanes it's so much safer.  You see families commuting this way.\nIt doesn't make sense, that the core of Toronto loses the lanes, as it is already very challenging to  visit these businesses on these roads with limited transportation alternatives.\nToronto needs to give it's expanding population more safe alternative means of transport, rather than limit it.\nEveryone loses when people don't have choices .\nFinally, I am proud that my city has a growing number of bike lanes.  I personally don't use them, but atleast I know that those who chose to use them are safer.\nThere alternative solutions, to the grid lock downtown, like encouraging more hybrid work days .. (an amazing work concept that I wish I had when my family was younger),   allocating no car zones downtown..solely buses and non-motorised means of transport ,  allocating essential workers only access to downtown, everyone else uses public trans. Or bikes, walks scooters in ...\nThere are alternatives out there to our problems , let's look at what other cities in the world have done.  Please don't throw good money after bad on same project just because the political colours of the day have changed.  Let's have continuity , so we succeed as a city .\nThx\n"

Furthermore, it once more reiterates the hypocrisy of the Ontario Conservative government, by not only further intruding into municipal matters without any logical reasoning, but by also creating an indefensible cost to taxpayers without any discernible benefit.\n"

        "comment": "Our apartment overlooks Bloor Street at the Humber River so we get to see the gridlock caused by the bicycle lanes. During the morning rush \"hour\" (8 AM through 9:30 AM) and the evening rush hour (3:30 through 6:30 PM) the traffic is solid across the Humber bridge and moving very slowly. At any time of day our driving time has doubled in either direction. And yet during these periods we see only a few bicycles going in either direction. We have also seen ambulances and fire trucks having difficulty making headway because the lanes are not wide enough. And what happens when it snows? Where does the snow go - on the side walks? Who is bicycling in the winter anyway. This was a badly thought-out decision that has cost tax payers a fortune. A  total waste of time and money to create a huge inconvenience for the majority of people in our community.\n"

The government has no reliable statistics to back up their notion that removing bike lanes will make any noticeable difference to the commuting times for car drivers.\nBicycling is better for fighting climate change and improves people's health (which is very important  given the heath care crisis we are currently in) so if anything, the provincial government should be funding more bike lanes not forcing Toronto to remove them.  It is such an absurd waste of taxpayer money.\nShop owners say that bike lanes actually improve business for them as more bicyclists stop to buy goods than car drivers do.\nThis proposed legislation will not reduce gridlock or save time for car drivers and is moving the province in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove bike lanes. Our high school student travels to school from Brock to Bathurst every day via bike. It promotes her health and gives her autonomy. Having myself been doored on Dundas where there are no bike lanes, she wouldn't be riding her bike without a safe bike lane.  I ended up in the hospital.\nTraffic flow technologies would be my suggestion for managing traffic. We've experienced changes in traffic lights for cars at Bloor and Dufferin which leads to a huge back up travelling west on Bloor because there is left turn lane at Dufferin but the left turn arrow isn't used on weekends, so there is often a huge back up along Bloor between Dufferin and Ossington. This has nothing to do with bike lanes, and everything to do with traffic technology not being optimized.\n"
