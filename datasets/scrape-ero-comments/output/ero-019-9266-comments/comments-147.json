Bike lanes are SO CRITICAL to making this a viable option for me. Without bike lanes, I wouldn't feel safe biking, and would likely drive, making congestion even worse. Please, PLEASE, keep the bike lanes and add more.\nThere are businesses and attractions in the city that I frequent way less often than I would otherwise because I can't bike to them (safely, IMO).\n"

        "comment": "The proposal for bike lanes has been presented with no evidence to support its necessity. Decisions about bike lanes should remain in municipal hands where constituents can hold local politicians to account. If bike lanes are unpopular in a specific town / city, then voters can elect leaders who promise to control bike lane installations. Alternately, if they feel bike lanes make sense in specific jurisdictions, then politicians can run on that platform, and get elected, or not. The provincial government should have no control over such decisions at the local level.\nFurther, claims that bike lanes are a significant contributor to traffic woes is obviously being greatly exaggerated by Doug Ford, who has a weird love affair going on with cars. I mean, really? A tunnel under the 401, new highways, removal of bike lanes? It's time to share the love and the infrastructure budget with alternate, climate-friendly, health-enhancing forms of transportation. If we make it safer and more enjoyable to be on bikes, fewer people will be in cars, and that will reduce traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing bike lanes is wasteful spending and will increase traffic (not reduce) by more people needing to drive, and cause more accidents and cyclist deaths.  I\u2019m also concerned about increased air and noise pollution that more cars on the road will create.\nThis is one of the worst ideas ever.\nRemoving the lanes takes resources, such as labor, materials, and money. How is spending money on this a priority? What projects don\u2019t get completed as the result of bike lane removal?\nHighway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph is still single lane in each direction despite incredible volume of daily car commuters. Money spent removing bike lanes would be better spent expanding essential corridors such as Hwy 7.\nWhere I live the presence of transit and bike lanes has reduced travel time in certain parts of the city, even with more residents.\nWill municipalities be compensated for the money they spent on bike lanes?\n"

        "comment": "I am very much against this policy change for so many reasons.\n- Cities are in the best position to make decisions about how to serve their citizens. Centralizing these decisions at the provincial level removes decision making power from those best positioned to make the trade offs. It used to be, at least according to their own press releases, that conservative governments supported small government with local accountability, not central planning.\n- The policy posits, even in the title, that removing bike lanes will reduce gridlock while numerous studies have shown that is not true. Adding lanes to roads and removing bike lanes can temporarily improve flow but even if they do the effect is short lived and soon overwhelmed by the addition of more cars. This government seems to have a knee jerk preference for cars and their drivers, often from the suburbs, at the expense of all other users. I have two sons both of whom live in denser parts of Ottawa and Toronto and neither own or use a car. (For studies see: (https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026 for example)\n- Cars, bicycles and pedestrians are in competition for increasingly scarce space in dense urban settings. Cars should not be winning that competition. Bike lanes, increased walking space and other measures make streets safer for people and invite greater use. Business associations have seen the results of these improvements which is why the Bloor BIA for example is asking that you keep your hands off their bike lanes.\n- To achieve our climate goals we should be putting more energy into encouraging greener transportation options like bikes and walking as well as investing more in mass transit. Any effort to increase the use of cars is a very short sighted choice. Even if you don't care about or believe in climate change just the extra health damage from vehicular emissions and micro-plastics from tire wear should be enough to desire a reduction in our use of cars. A similar argument can be made for traffic fatalities.\n- The policy does not appear to be based on any research, or detailed planning work, instead it seems to be the personal preference of a few senior politicians. This is not how our government should work, governments should be making decisions based on policy proposals backed up by research and best practices from around the world.\n- Bike lanes and bike shares are finally starting to get the kind of traction they deserve. The massive increase in use of the Toronto and Montreal bike share programs over the past few years show just how popular this transportation option is. The people using bikes to get around deserve to be able to do so safely and enjoyably every bit as much as drivers do.\nTo sum up, MORE BIKE LANES NOT LESS, and certainly never remove those that have finally and at great cost been installed.\n"

        "comment": "I hate your proposal. The solution to gridlock isn't more highways, it's better infrastructure and investment for public transport. It's very clear that no consideration is given to the environment either. This scale of construction is going to be destructive to the environment and ecosystems no matter what. This will cause long term impacts on the health of the environment and ultimately of all Canadians, not just the ones living nearby. This will absolutely make the country worse. Our nature is interconnected and interdependent. You can't solve cutting down a million trees by installing a bike lane.\n"

This will return both sides of the street parking which effectively keeps single lane car traffic. All this is saying is that he values parked cars more than people. I am daily shocked at the absolute disregard for the people of Ontario and the blatant corruption and theft of their money. My kid can\u2019t go to the science centre based upon entirely fake reasoning. I can\u2019t bike on bloor based upon entirely fake reasoning. You use my money to build lanes, then remove them and expect me to be thankful?\n"

When I am forced to ride on the road due to an illegally parked car, I am terrified for my life or I walk on the sidewalk.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives on Bloor St E between Church and Jarvis, I can attest to the popularity of these bike lanes. On my walk down to the subway on weekday mornings, between 8-9am, the volume of bicycle riders is significant (rain or shine). Removing these bike lanes would not only be a massive waste of public funds, but it would eliminate a safety route for thousands of daily commuters. If it weren't for this bike lane, many of these cyclists would undoubtedly shift to commuting by car which would only increase traffic. In the suburbs, I agree that the pendulum towards bike lanes may have shifted a little too far; however, in the downtown area, adding bike lanes reduces traffic.\nAs a previous PC-Ford voter, going ahead with this policy would likely kill my support for the party and Ford. This is a political gesture aimed at scrapping a few marginal votes by scapegoating cyclists. I would welcome the PC party to consider ambitious projects such as adding more subway lines (Dufferin Liberty Village to St. Clair would be great) or at the very least improving existing subway facilities.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives and reduce traffic! Research on induced demand makes it very clear that adding extra lanes of traffic will create more car traffic. Additionally, if we lose safe infrastructure then the same cyclists who are in protected bike lanes will now be taking up an entire lane of the road. With 6 cyclist deaths in Toronto so far this year, this is a dangerous proposal that will lead to injuries and deaths. Protected cycling infrastructure saves lives. It is better for the environment, better for traffic reduction, and contributes to happier and healthier communities. Each jurisdiction has different bike infrastructure needs and should be able to plan long term solutions to traffic congestion that meet the needs of their constituents, with priority given to sustainable solutions that limit unnecessary vehicle usage and that protect the environment.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford claims that his intent is to encourage bike routes to be installed on side streets rather than main streets. However, as currently written, this act would also prevent the installation of bike routes along side streets, and would enable the Province to cancel any qualifying cycling project without justification.\nTo enable quiet street bicycle routes to be implemented without creating an unreasonable burden on Ontario Taxpayers, the act should be adjusted such that review is only required on roadways with more than 5000 cars per day.\nTo ensure that cycling projects are only cancelled if the Province has actually reviewed the information provided by municipalities, the act should be amended to provide a maximum response time following the receipt of documents from a municipality. If the Province fails to provide a response within that timeframe, the municipality may consider the project to be approved.\n"

        "comment": "Requiring new bikes lanes (if they replace a lane of traffic, ugh) to be approved by the province seems like an overreach of the province into municipal affairs and seems like a massive waste of time and resources for both levels of government. Municipalities are fully capable of doing the required studies to confirm a bike lane is a good idea as they've been doing up to this point in time.\nI also fully disagree with exemptions to the Environmental Assessment Act for projects related to HWY 413.  Hwy 413 seems like a fun way to waste money to save approximately 30secs on trip times for most commuters (ignoring the new congested created by inducted demand once new lanes are created).\nThe most effective way to reduce gridlock is to provide effective alterative ways to travel that will get cars off the road. This would include more bike lanes, and more investment into public transit (particularly between cities).  For example, I regularly travel into Toronto from SWO to visit friends, and need to take my car even though I rather take a train. Particularly since I want to consume alcohol with my friends, unfortunately I can't take advantage of beer being in gas stations since I have to be sober to drive everywhere instead of being able to get sh -t faced with my friends and take transit home like some many other are able to do in most developed countries.\nBill 212, does not seem like the solution gridlock and I would rather the provincial invest the money and resources into infrastructure projects like finishing the Eglinton Crosstown and more trip and routes on the GO.\n"

        "comment": "This is such a waste of taxpayers money.  The cost of taking down these essential bike lanes is not what the province needs right now or ever.\nBikes reduce congestion of cars on the roads, this is not going to fix the issues with traffic.\nBike lanes like the ones on University Avenue allow cyclists and motorists to coexist on the road with less chance of accidents, harming the lives of the cyclist and the property of the car owners.  Removing these bike lanes in Toronto will cause more accidents, and more traffic with the chaos of the cyclists, e-scooters, & e-bikes that will then be joining the lanes with the cars.\nMay I remind you that accidents also cost more money from the taxpayers for OHIP costs, aside from the personal costs to the citizens including physical and psychological harm.\nAgain, what a waste of money, which could be going towards more essential things like the healthcare crisis, the affordable housing crisis, the homeless crisis, etc.\nI am a driver and a pedestrian, just to make it clear where I stand as a Torontonian on this issue.\nIt would be nice if Doug Ford's government could do something good for Ontario for once, this is not it.\n"
