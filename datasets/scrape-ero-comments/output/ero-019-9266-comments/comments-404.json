There is countless data to support that. Government should help people choose what way of transport they want to use instead of forcing them to use cars by removing a big part of already very little  cycling infrastructure. People also like to save money, time and want to stay healthy by riding bike, using transit buses and subways to go around the city. Government should stop playing politics on these issues and make more bike lanes and even better transit system. Bike lanes are neither left nor right wing's choice, it is people's choice. Chow won because she promised better transport, which only support the fact that people do want this that's why they voted for her. Learn why Netherlands has much better transportation systems than US. How one more lane will never solve traffic, Do not be an ...\nI will not link anything as it is Government's job and they get paid to do research, a better research than normal citizens like myself, before making decisions willy nilly. The decision which will affect thousand of people and future of this city and others in the province.\nOn a separate note, I would also like to see High speed and high frequency trains around the province, especially going from Ottawa to Niagara through Hamilton and also to Windsor with sort of a T-Point of rails in London or Kitchener.\n"

As a grad student, I get around everywhere with my bike - I commute to work/campus, I bike to the grocery store and bring my weekly groceries home in my basket, etc. If major bike lanes were removed here in Waterloo I would have to resort to walking or taking public transit, both of which take so much longer than biking. Taking out bike lanes is impinging on people's freedom to choose how they travel within the city.\n"

When you provide people with viable alternatives to driving they will use those instead and that means there are less cars on the road and less gridlock.\nBike lanes provide people a safe and easy way to get around the city and the for every bike that uses the bike lane it means there's one less person driving.\nFurthermore, if the Premier is tired of seeing people bike past him while he's stuck in traffic he is absolutely free to use the bike lanes himself so he can zoom past everyone stuck in traffic while he gets to work faster.\n"

Biking is not only a sustainable choice but a necessity for people like me who depend on safe, reliable bike routes to get around. Expanding roads for cars may seem like a solution, but it actually adds more traffic and pollution, making our communities less livable in the long run. I urge the government to consider the many residents who, like me, rely on biking to reduce our carbon footprint and stay healthy. Let\u2019s focus on building a future that supports active, environmentally friendly transportation rather than going back to car-centric planning.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has grown up in Toronto, I am very familiar with the city's car-centric culture and long-standing resistance to adapt its transportation culture to provide efficient and safe routes for users of all transportation modes. Bill 212 would continue this harmful tradition and cause more harm than good. While there are overarching issues and other examples of this, it is obviously important to focus on the current bill at hand. Additionally, it is important to remember this affects all other municipalities in Ontario, although the focus of the bill is clearly on the city of Toronto. If Bill 212 is passed, it would add additional bureaucracy to local governments, take away infrastructure that provides equity to all road users, create an unsafe environment for both cyclists and drivers, slow our progress towards a sustainable province, and not even fix the problem it aims to solve.\nBy adding provincial mandates to all new bike lanes taking away a lane of traffic - even in smaller towns and on side streets - local governments are forced under additional bureaucracy, preventing them from providing additional transportation options. This slows progress of transportation infrastructure and takes away power from locally elected government officials who understand the needs of communities better than provincial officials.\nBy reducing the amount of bike lanes installed, and taking away existing bike lanes on University Ave., Younge St., and Bloor St., Ontario would be taking away essential infrastructure for bike users, who have a right to infrastructure as much as any other road user. To put it in perspective, there would be much controversy to remove a hardly used sidewalk on a traffic packed road because the people who do use the sidewalk would be left without a safe choice for travelling down the road. Specifically in Toronto, bike infrastructure has been improving so much in recent years. The true scale of how much bikes will be used in the future is yet to be seen because the bike network is still very young and incomplete (however, where it is more complete there is far more usage) which is why it looks like biking is hardly in demand (because it's still very difficult for most people to bike safely). One example of very tangible success is the increase in ridership on Toronto's ride-share program, which has exploded in ridership and continues to break records as of late.\nBy removing bike lanes and reducing the amount installed in the future, both bike and car users would be left in an unsafe environment. People will still have to use Bloor St. for biking, and the likelihood of ending up with another fatal collision such as the one involving 58-year-old grandmother Dalia Chako at Bloor and St. George will drastically increase. Mixing cars and bikes is difficult and unsafe for both users. As a frequent driver, I would much rather have cyclists separated in their own lane then have to overtake and worry about them in my own lane, even if it means sacrificing a lane of car traffic. Additionally, removing bike infrastructure puts children in jeopardy. Census data does not consider the volume of children under 15 biking to school or events, and while the impact on children will be little on the major bike corridors being removed, slowing the addition of bike infrastructure in communities where children frequently bike will be costly to their safety and well-being.\nPollution is an ever pertinent topic when talking about transportation. Toronto's vast public transportation system, though in dire need of improvements, has done immeasurable good for reducing the population in Toronto and helping the environment. Bike infrastructure is the next step in reducing the amount of cars and the reliance on cars to get from point A to point B in order to reduce the impact all Ontario municipalities have on the environment. Adding red tape to cycle projects and removing the identified bike corridors in this bill sets our progress backwards and forces people to rely on cars even more, which is harmful for both the environment, people who can't afford cars, and the safety of car users as well (more cars=more collisions).\nFinally, this bill wouldn't even succeed in its goal of reducing gridlock in the downtown Toronto area. Bloor St. was bumper to bumper before the bike lanes were even installed, so it isn't like that would change all of a sudden. The simple idea of induced demand (which is why you can't just add 3 lanes to a highway to solve traffic) would create even more traffic. All the people who used bike lanes will have to switch to cars, and our traffic woes will continue.\nTo conclude, it's important to remember that the bike lanes to be removed and bike lanes in general are installed for a reason, and fixing traffic by adding more reliance on cars in not a solution. Focusing on creating diversity in transit options and reducing the reliance on cars is a necessary step in solving gridlock issues and creating a cleaner and safer Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Yonge street is no longer Highway 11 and Bloor is no longer Highway 5.  That decision was made in the 90's: control of these streets was downloaded to the municipalities.  As such, it has been municipal tax dollars and municipal decisions that have developed these streets to their current state.\nNow, we are to understand, the provincial government wishes to unilaterally undo the careful and methodical changes that were developed, with all due process and local involvement?   Doug Ford might have claimed in the past that the City of Toronto was too dysfunctional to successfully remove unwanted bike lanes in the past.  But since he has halved the size of council and mandated strong-Mayor powers.  As such, the citizens of Toronto are more than ever able to vote in changes that they desire.  Further, we have seen with Jarvis that bike lanes can be removed if they are undesired.\nThe correct place for bike lanes to be determined is at the municipal level.  The people of the city are those who pay for the lanes, the people of the city are those that drive beside and bike on the lanes.  We know how they affect our communities, for the better or for the worse.\nIn particular, this legislation is completely tone-deaf on the question of if we WANT Dundas or Yonge to be highways.  We don't.  We live, work, and shop on these streets.  Bike lanes benefit extend beyond that of bikers - the very reduction in vehicular volume makes the streets more approachable, improving local businesses.  No one commuting across a 4 lane through-fare is going to shop at a local business!\nThis legislation also implies that merely increasing volume (by increasing number of cars per meter of road) will improve congestion.  This is well known to not follow directly.   Four lanes of stopped cars moves as fast as two lanes - not at all.  Traffic simulations can show that adding lanes of traffic may actually slow the net speed through the city.  This is why the bike lanes were not installed haphazardly, but as a result of considerable study and examination.    My own anecdotal evidence is that Danforth became a smoother drive after the bikelanes had settled into place - the reduction to two lanes results in more efficient flow, so I can get to my destination faster than when there were more lanes.\nThe proposal to remove them, especially coupled to the public statements of the office, makes it clear that it is felt by the minister that no such studies are required.   It was bad enough when this legislation was bureaucratic red-tape to slow the addition of bike lanes.  The fact perfectly functioning lanes, lanes that have demonstrably improved my neighbourhood's character since their introduction, are now in the sights is distressing.  But it doesn't even seem science based - the tweets make it clear it is a purely vindictive \"anti-bike\" crusade?  This is not how we should be enacting policy.  Traffic infrastructure is a complicated problem - people get their PhDs in this field for a reason.\nWe also need to decide if our province serves people or if it serves cars.  If it serves people, we should not merely count \"commuters\" as the only users of the roads.  When I walk my dog, walk to a local store, bike to a transit station, or drive to an appointment, I may not be \"commuting\", but I'm doing something more important to a healthy city: living.\n"

        "comment": "We/Toronto/people/communities need the current bike lanes of which we should be so proud.  Although initially they took some getting used to, and learning new rules of safety, they are now an essential part of our communities and have increased safety for all. For example, Yonge Street is no longer a freeway in a city but instead a regular road in a community. It is wonderful to see the bike lanes so well used, and thereby cutting down the number of cars on the road. It is heartening to see the food deliverers on two-wheel vehicles delivery food to local homes, including the elderly, in a timely and environmental way. These service jobs both provide work and services that people in our community need.\nIt is also terrific to be able to cross now a two-lane Yonge street in safely and with ease. It is an advantage to be able to hold conversations on Yonge Street with the great reduction in traffic noise. It\u2019s a benefit for all the businesses in the community in many ways. It would be appalling to remove these bike lanes that were implemented by our own community after much study and at great expense. It would also be fiscally and otherwise irresponsible for the province to take this retrograde step.\nYou are good at admitting when you are wrong.  Please reverse your position on this.  This comment applies with even more force to University Avenue, which should continue according to the plan to the benefit of patients, hospitals, emergency vehicles, tourists, Torontonians and a litany of others. People need to find a better way to commute - ie perhaps you could focus on finishing those commuter trains that are within your area of responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "The extent to which the provincial government is determined to spend my provincial tax dollars to dictate municipal policy on behalf of single-digit anecdotes from people who don't live in downtown Toronto is absurd.\nI moved to Toronto in the first place under the eroding belief that a modern city accommodates multiple modes of transport and levels of accessibility and protected bike lanes made me finally feel safe enough to bike. But in general, people driving in Toronto have not demonstrated their ability to facilitate this without dedicated paths for cyclists and pedestrians, and yet they continue to receive preferential treatment. I wish I could be half as rewarded for my frequent and demonstrable incompetence as the average Toronto driver.\nIf we're setting policy based on anecdotes then I submit the 2-4 police officers regularly required to direct traffic at the routinely blocked intersection of Front St and York (where there are no bike lanes!) are indicative of the fact that Toronto drivers do not understand how to drive, are not capable of sharing a road, and are not fit to be behind the wheel of two-ton vehicles on open streets.\nIf the provincial government is determined to meddle in local politics in order to turn Toronto into Phoenix or LA rather than an actual world class city, I will simply finish nursing school and move to Phoenix or LA. It will have the same congestion which will persist no matter how many lanes are added, but as least I will make significantly more money.\n"
