        "comment": "I am in strong opposition to Bill 212.  This bill do nothing to reduce traffic times and will make the streets less safe for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike.  If passed, this will discourage children and youth from using active transportation to commute and will only add to the amount of cars on the road.  Local cities and municipalities know what works best in their own respective regions and should remain in control to determine what will work best in their communities.  I am also discouraged to see that the provincial government is looking to spend taxpayer money to remove existing bike lanes in Toronto.  This is a fiscally irresponsible move as our money will be used to remove something that is already built and also will be spent in reviewing bike lanes throughout the province.  With all of the challenges that we face from health care to education, I would expect the provincial government to focus on actual issues we are facing rather than creating problems and bureaucracy where non are required.  Please follow the actual science and studies done in cities all over the world and support active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Being a retired Health and Safety Professional with 2 professional designations and an avid rider of the bike lanes around Toronto, my professional opinion on this proposal to remove any bike lane only results in a high risk situation for bike riders with consequences of high severity injury to the riders, not the drivers. The car always wins; it doesn't matter who is in the wrong. Keeping cyclists separated from moving vehicles is ideal. If the Minister's comments about 1.4 percent of commuters are on bikes, that would mean for every 1.4 riders, it would equate to 98.6 cars commuting. When I sit at the intersection of University and Bloor at 500pm on my bike, and see more than 2 dozen cyclists, I most certainly do not see the other 98.6% of commuters (approx) 1576 cars in this intersection. In fact, that many cars would completely clog countless intersections in the surrounding blocks. Cyclists reduce traffic downtown, not increase it. Doug needs to 'stay in his own lane' and leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist in Toronto for 15 years now, and have lived in several different areas of the city from High Park to North York to Riverdale. When I first moved here, I don't know if there was a single dedicated bike lane anywhere. Now there is a wonderful network of them making it so much easier and safer to get around the city. I started a new job earlier this year and without fail, everyone who found out that I biked to work said to me 'I'm terrified of biking downtown', and I would tell them there are bike lanes now and they'd say 'oh, well that definitely helps, less chance some idiot uber driver would run me over'\nThe lanes are being used, it's keeping people safer, it's REDUCING TRAFFIC - would you really rather those cyclists be in CARS? the subway is already massively overcrowded in rush hour. And of course, it's better for the environment. Doug suggested moving them to side streets but that's just not a viable option. I'm adding a link that explains how if you replaced the entire bloor st bike lane with side street bike lanes, the same trip would take TWICE as long for cyclists. Would it really help car users get where they were going twice as fast? Is that really a fair trade off? Not to mention all the money that is going to be WASTED removing from main streets and reinstalling on side streets.\nThis just doesn't make any sense and should not be done.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto, like many modern big cities, encourages alternatives to cars, like cycling and public transportation to get around. This reduces traffic jams and poor air quality.  We need to continue investing in cycling infrastructure and public transportation. This is the way of the world. Unfortunately Toronto appears to be way behind. So we need to encourage more not less in terms of cycling infrastructure. The idea that taking away bike lanes will reduce traffic is clearly backwards thinking. Mostly what taking away bike lanes will do is decrease safety on streets. For both pedestrians and obviously cyclists.  We cannot bring suburban dreams of the past into our city of the future. Visit any big city like New York or Paris or even a smaller Canadian city like Montreal to understand how cities of the future work. They include bike lanes. Lots of them. Build them, and they will ride.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nWhereas the stated purpose of this act is to reduce gridlock, it encourages bike lane removal and discourages adding bike lanes. Yet, bike lanes reduce congestion by providing another form of transportation, increasing the efficiency of transportation. As well, bicycles take up much less space per person, especially as the majority of personal vehicles used by commuters are single-occupancy vehicles (SOV).\nEncouraging more SOV on the roads means more car parking lots and space will be needed at the endpoints of journeys, taking up more area when compared to bicycle parking. This has a knockon effect of further increasing congestion.\nAs the province lacks a coordinated plan for building a bike network, thorough mapping with a bike lane transportation coordinator, giving the province oversight of these matters is highly inefficient, as municipalities have this work under their purview. If, for example, the Ontario government decided to create a department for cycling infrastructure under the MTO whose goal was to maintain and coordinate all bike lane infrastructure in the province, that would be a different matter. However, I doubt that the current provincial government is interested in funding a new initiative based on past actions. In such a case, I oppose this bill and prefer that municipalities remain in charge of bike lane infrastructure.\nI support bike lane infrastructure.\n\"Better cycling infrastructure was the number one controllable reason Canadians cited for not cycling more.\" (https://www.caa.ca/news/lack-of-proper-infrastructure-a-key-barrier-to-\u2026)\nSome may argue that we have weather that is less conducive to cycling than, say, European countries. But this is becoming less true over time. Everyone has noticed how we no longer wrap kids in snowsuits underneath their Halloween costumes. People are waiting later and later each year to put on their winter tires, and we're getting less and less snowfall in March and April. March break used to be a reliable time to go for 'the last good ski' and instead it's turning to the first week for a bike ride. With the cycling season ever-expanding, building more bike lanes makes sense.\nBike lanes also encourage short to medium trips, boosting local, small businesses. Cycling creates a more vibrant, local community with these shorter trips, rather than everyone flocking to the same few stretches of large stores that must be driven to (or take a long time to get to by walking, or taking public transit).\nWith the introduction of separated bike lanes, I have seen kids back out cycling, similar to how it was decades ago, as these kids can now safely make short trips on their own using the bike lanes. Without bike lanes, the roads are simply too fast and full of vehicles for all but the most experienced of cyclists. And, as cycling on sidewalks is illegal, dangerous (for pedestruans and cyclists), and uncomfortable, that is not a viable alternative.\nThere are many other reasons to support cycling infrastructure, such as reducing carbon emissions. Since emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to meet the Paris Agreement (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition), growing cycling infrastructure (not reducing it) is a logical step in bringing the province in line with this agreement as well as United Nations 'Sustainable Development Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts' (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/).\nThere is more I could write, but I will wrap up my comments by re-stating that I strongly oppose Bill 212, with some reasons described in this comment.\n"

There is always congestion on my streets. I have to leave for work two hours earlier because of the reduced lanes and I have damaged my car multiple times in attempt to park because of the bike lane bollards that are situated along my property with no space to maneuver a vehicle in and out of my driveway, all while holding up traffic on a single lane. Drivers are stressed and frustrated. The traffic on my street not only impacts the drivers travelling through it, but, also other areas of traffic in Toronto when people have to find alternative routes, those then get congested too.\nWe know that Toronto is the third slowest city in the world, along with the reduced lanes and seemingly never ending construction there is no way drivers can get around. Bike lanes and more specifically bike lane bollards are not the solution to our city's problems, its not  preventing people from driving. People who travel far to work and can afford a car will drive, if we take a look from an environmental perspective the bumper to bumper traffic is causing more pollution then moving vehicles.\nMore importantly , emergency vehicles have a difficult time getting to people in danger and time-sensitive situations, literally life or death . My elderly neighbor was a victim of this, he made an emergency call during rush hour and paramedics could not get to him on time, he is currently on a ventilator fighting for his life.\nI like Bill 121, and I speak for all residents on Broadview and Cosburn, please have the city remove the bike lane bollards.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is dangerous and demonstrates lack of awareness of what life is like in Ontario municipalities.\nAs a pedestrian, cyclist, and transit rider in the city of Ottawa I routinely feel unsafe by the unbound traffic cutting through our downtown and adjacent neighbourhoods (large commercial trucks included). Streets have become increasingly dangerous with drivers speeding, disobeying traffic signs and signals. Telling bikes to share the road with this unchecked traffic is a death sentence.\nThis bill increases already volatile dissent among drivers toward cyclists, leading to verbal and physical threats. Ride a bike around any city, you'll see what I mean. Law-abiding cyclists are cut off, squeezed, threatened, and put in imminent danger by entitled drivers, and this bill gives cars impunity to worsen this entitlement they believe they have to our city streets.\nCyclists reduce traffic. My partner and I both cycle or take transit to work, that's two fewer single-occupant cars on the highway. But failing transit in Ottawa and removal/reduction of bike lanes will put two cars back into traffic.\nCity streets should be for pedestrians (walkers and cyclists) and busses and streetcars full of people. Downtown businesses benefit from this kind of safe, accessible, and welcoming environment. Trash this dangerous, ignorant, fiscally irresponsible bill.\n"

        "comment": "Are you seriously considering increasing automobile dependency by removing existing bicycle paths or restricting their creation. Considering that bike paths allow pollution free transportation with much reduced physical foot print taking up less driving space and parking space than heavy cars. Removing established working bike paths will automatically increase car congestion and pollution. You need to provide alternate transit options, geared to the mixed transit needs of the people. A mix of mass transit, cars, bikes and pedestrian paths. Optimally it is the government's ethical duty to keep it's people safe no matter how they move about, this means keeping bike and foot paths free of cars, and to keep car traffic free of bikes and foot traffic. Forcing people to drive next to bikes is causing anxious drivers and bikers both. Increase the use of dedicated bike paths to 1) reduce car congestion as people can take alternative transportation. 2) reduce pollution as people can take alternative cleaner transportation, 3) reduce stress as people are out of danger of being killed, 4) reduce the death tolls as less pedestrians are killed, 5) Show Paris and other cities increasing bicycle infrastructure that Toronto is not backwards in reducing bicycle infrastructure.\n"

Ironically, removing the bike lanes will make traffic worse during construction.\nI would love to see the Ministry conduct the environmental assessment before opening the comment period. Or even a traffic assessment on what the proposed removals would actually do to travel times.\nThe policy requiring provincial approval for bikelanes oversteps, but removing bikelanes without consultation of the people who rely on them for safe transportation is egregious, financially wasteful, and makes life in the city worse.\nWhile the proposed policy suggests replacing bike lanes on main roads with residential street networks, cyclists would not be able to safely access actual businesses and services. These are not on residential streets in Toronto. It would decrease cycling, and ironically, increase demand for car infrastructure.\nI use the Bloor bike lane several times a week, and would use it every day if I didn't work from home. Multiple studies have shown that cyclists make up close to a third of commuters during rush hour on the Bloor corridor. Removing the bike lanes I rely on would make my life either more dangerous or more expensive and time consuming if I have to sacrifice bike travel.\nCyclists are taxpayers too, I pay my taxes and I deserve to have infrastructure that supports my needs. I don't drive at all, and more than a third of Torontonians don't. This policy proposal is actively antagonistic to the safety and transportation needs of this massive segment of the population. I'm ashamed of this government and worried for my friends and neighbours who rely on their bikes.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal does not justify what expertise the provincial government has which would allow it to make decisions on bike lanes in Toronto. Residents of Toronto choose to bike since it is an effective way of commuting in a city that has failed to prioritize public transit until recent years. These cyclists use bike lanes for safety. Procure the Toronto Bike Share user data from the last 5 years and it will be extremely evident that biking has increased drastically. To remove the only north/south bike lanes linking the city\u2019s financial district to the communities these people live in does not make sense. Traffic simulations often prove how more traffic lanes do not improve traffic flow, particularly on roads with traffic signals. If all cyclists choose to then take a vehicle or Uber, gridlock would increase. It does not make sense to add barriers to residents choosing methods that reduce gridlock, rather, there should be incentives to choose commuting options that reduce gridlock.\n"

I have been impacted by the building of a bicycle lane - but tweaks since the lanes were put in have reduced that impact. It may be that more tweaks are required and I will continue to provide my input to my Councillor. There are other ways to address the problem, including removing of on street parking along Bloor St. W which would permit reversion to two lanes for cars. What should not happen is the removal of the lanes for bicycles, and whatever happens it should be done through the municipal government through the ongoing consultations. This is not an Ontario problem!\nThe Premier has suggested that bike lanes should be on side streets. This is is likely the musings of someone who has never ridden a bicycle in the city. Side streets are narrow, have limited continuity and often many 4-way stops. They have parking on both sides of the street, and congestion due to construction projects on houses, parcel deliveries, lawn care trucks and garbage pick up every week. Finally, the Premier seems to forget the existence of the river valleys associated with the Humber River and Mimico Creek.\n"

They are the most efficient and safe way for me to travel between home and work. I used to ride along Bloor for many years in the 90's but then had to stop because it felt too dangerous. Instead I had to add 15 mins to my commute and either go along the Martin Goodman Trail or up to Annette and Hallem and Lapin (both routes still had scary sections). Since the Bloor bike lane has come in my commute has felt so much safer and is much quicker and so I am encouraged to ride even more frequently.  Rather than make cycling harder we need to reward and encourage cycling in every way possible. Its the least we can do for our health and the health of our planet.\n"

        "comment": "I would highly recommend that both the Eglinton Avenue East and West bike lanes be removed immediately especially those running just east and west of Yonge Street.  Metrolinx installed them though and because that falls under the Provincial Government, I  am not sure if you will follow through in removing these ill advised ones that have reduced Eglinton Avenue East and West down to one lane each of traffic in each direction, but I am challenging you to do the right thing and still remove them!  Anyone who lives and travels along there as well knows that the traffic congestion has grown 100% in a very short time due to the bike lanes that NO ONE TAKES. Too many people live along there to have their commute doubled and tripled in trying to get home to their families after a long work day.  No wonder no one wants to return to the offices either.\nI understand the rational behind it was thinking that once the LRT is opened up that most people will take it along Eglinton Avenue East and West instead or take the TTC buses along there, but it is 13+ - 14 years and not only has the LRT not open yet but the bus routes along there are still very much needed to run on Eglinton as the majority of them do not just stop at Kennedy or Eglinton Avenue West but turn onto many other connecting streets all along Eglinton.  So this would be the first major point in removing them as many people still need to take the bus along there and their commute have doubled or tripled in time.\nI am a long time transit rider of the TTC in this City and it is a very unreliable service and I believe the LRT will be as well especially in inclement weather.  On a Friday night in the summer months of all things I have witnessed myself 7 buses backed up all in a row along Eglinton Avenue West.  I have clocked the time on the bus myself and it now takes 30 - 40 mins. on a Sunday in non-rush hour traffic just to get from Eglinton Avenue West station now to Yonge and Eglinton with the lanes reduced down to one lane in both direction running along there.  Therefore many many people are still stuck on the bus especially in congested traffic that was never an issue along there until these bike lanes were installed.  I believe that there is also an Accessiblity lawsuit by a Lawyer due to those lanes on Eglinton Avenue West given how they were built as for visually impaired people can not differertiate between the lanes and the sidewalk, plus you have to cross into them to actually get on the bus which honestly with e-bikes electric scooters and everything else is very dangerous.-=\nMy next major point is that everyone knows that Eglinton Avenue East is very much the route that emergency runs are made along to Sunnybrook Hospital and now both our Police, Fire and Ambulance are all held up with life saving seconds to spare in congested traffic along there as they can not move to get around the cars stopped and backed up from Yonge Street to Holly street to Mount Pleasant.  Meaning many lawsuits in the future for both the City and Provincial Government.  I witness myself the Fire Trucks having to stop dead along Eglinton Avenue East between the very short distance between Yonge and Holly Street while rushing to an emergency.  They are then not even able to turn onto Holly Street themselves given they need the width of the street to make the turn but impeded now by the bike lanes also if traffic is on Holly and parked vehicles they have no where to go down as they now need the whole street now itself to make their turn and to travel along there.  I have watched myself as the Fire Trucks are stopped dead along Eglinton Avenue East as they approach Holly Street, and in trying to make their turns that they have been given no choice but to have had to stop in the middle of a congested but live lane of traffic or in the middle of a turn to offload their Fire Personnel as seconds due count in an emergency to have them walk into the street to the location of the emergency with all their gear.  This is not the CITY I want to live in when we do not think that emergency routes those travelled the most by our Fire, Police and Ambulances should be reduced down to one lane of travel in each direction just to have bike lanes installed along them holding all of them up.  Not when critical seconds count in an emergency in saving someone's life and not when many lawsuits when be generated just from that fact alone when someone dies given they were held up in saving their life.\nYou need to talk to those with lived experience and I can tell you that any fire routes and ambulance routes running anywhere by a Hospital as well should not be impeded by bike lanes!\nThere is also an uptick in traffic now on residential side streets as well as those drivers of the cars rushing to make blind turns onto residential side streets all through the area now (where people are living whether in homes or condos trying to safely raise their children and family members including the elderly) since these bike lanes have been installed, as people try to find other ways to get through the side streets just to get around the traffic backed up on Eglinton Avenue East and West and now with no turns at all at Yonge Street it has made it even worse. Also, there is a major uptick of illegal parking along residential side streets all through that area now as well, and right off of Eglinton Avenue East at Holly Street where people are trying to live and raise their children safely but we all now see an uptick of delivery vehicles from UBER, SKIP, FEDEX, UPS to large transport trucks making deliveries to the restaurants and stores near by because they have no where to park anywhere along the main streets (Eglinton Avenue East) where these businesses are located.  And I am totally against 24/7 delivery times just because of this fact as it disturbs people's sleep which becomes a major health concern and another lawsuit for you.  All of this is compounded by these delivery companies both online and food ones which needs to be stopped or gotten under control.  You can not have bike lanes, congested traffic, all of these uptick in delivery vehicles and drivers and not think that there will be major residual affects to our streets.\nAlso with Eglinton being reduced to one lane both in each direction is a horrible idea seeing how the street runs to the Highway and through many residential areas.  Not only has it made it impossible to get onto the Allen but also the DVP and backed up traffic all along there where there once was no congestion.\nThank you!\n"

The current bike network is far from a complete system so it makes sense that ridership is currently low, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to support a higher ridership, so the solution is adding more bike infrastructure, not taking it away. More people biking will also mean less people driving, so congestion will get better. People on bikes also stop at stores more often than people in cars, so it boosts local economies.
