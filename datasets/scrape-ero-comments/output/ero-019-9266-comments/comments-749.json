        "comment": "I\u2019m writing as a concerned citizen of both Toronto and Ontario.. It seems the Ford government is intent to interfere with municipal politics without proper consultation or studies conducted in the removal of bike lanes.. I\u2019m confident this will cause cyclists to die unnecessarily and discourage people from riding in the cities networks.. it also seems, as is often the case, Ford is doing this largely for personal reasons as he seems focused on Toronto and not anywhere else in the province in concern to the removal of bike lanes.\nAdditionally, I feel the expropriation of land to construct to roads and highways without adequate consultation or environmental risk assessment, seems like it\u2019s largely intended to appease major campaign donors and developers who lost out on deals the Ford government who\u2019d lost out due to public outcry/ scandal.\nI feel this bill should be axed as it is a gross overreach of powers by the province and seems intended to mostly appease developers and to cater to the whims of Doug Ford regarding the removal of bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This is a joke of a policy proposal in so many respects. Not only is the government willfully ignoring the existing evidence and the democratic will of Toronto council, it is also doing so at the taxpayer's expense. This is supposed to be the fiscally responsible government? We spent enough money to install the bike lanes, why should we waste more money to tear them back out? And who will pay for the government's legal fees when they inevitably get sued over this legislation?\nBike lanes save people's lives, reduce conflict between cars and cyclists and promote a healthy, viable alternative transportation option for people who don't own cars. My first suggestion to the government is to leave it up to the democratically elected municipal council to determine what is best for its citizens. I'm sorry you didn't win the mayoral election in 2014, Mr. Premier, but you shouldn't be legislating for Toronto from Queen's Park. My second suggestion is to pursue evidence based policies that will actually improve people's travel times. (Commissioning a study about digging a hole under the 401 and then telling us that you're planning to do it regardless of the study doesn't count). We need more transit, we need streamlined approvals to build medium- and high-rise housing in dense, transit-serviced neighbourhoods, and we need actual enforcement of our existing transportation rules. Bill 212 does none of this and is a waste of everyone's time and money on some manufactured culture wars issue.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 would be an overreach by the Government of Ontario, and it would stifle the ability of municipal governments to build out much-needed bike infrastructure in their cities. Increased bike infrastructure can induce a greater amount of bike usage in a city, which in turn leads to less cars on the road and fewer emissions. In my opinion, a more appropriate strategy for \"reducing gridlock\" and \"saving you time\" is to increase investment in forms of transportation such as bikes and transit, which will take cars off of the road.\nMunicipal governments are better equipped to make informed decisions on the specifics of where bike lanes do and don't belong, and adding the provincial government to this process will unnecessarily consume further resources from both levels of government. This waste of resources is exemplified by Bill 212's requirement to remove sections of bike lanes already built in the city of Toronto. The cost of these removals, along with the additional resources that will need to be spent by both governments to determine the particularities of the removal, are a wasteful drain of the city's and province's budgets.\nFor these reasons, it is my opinion that Bill 212 should not be passed.\n"

In fact, it will do the opposite, while making the streets more dangerous and less accessible for people who cannot afford to or physically unable to drive a car. This borderline violates one's freedom of mobility. If the Ontario Government wanta to put the best interests of the public first, I recommend they first keep up with the times and propose solutions that take us to the future, not the past.\n"

        "comment": "The province's plan to limit new bike lanes and remove some existing bike lanes should not move forward, as it is not consistent with the province's latest planning policies. The province's recently released Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 indicates that \"all major transit station areas should be planned and designed to be transit-supportive and to achieve multimodal access to stations and connections to nearby major trip generators by providing, where feasible: infrastructure that accommodates a range of mobility needs and supports active transportation, including sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and secure bicycle parking\" (section 2.4.2.6).\nThe province's plan to remove bike lanes on University Avenue, Bloor Street, and Yonge Street in Toronto contradicts the policies contained in the Provincial Planning Statement. All three of these bike lanes pass through major transit station areas, and provide connectivity to transit stations. These bike lanes help accommodate a range of mobility needs and support active transportation.\n"

The current bike lanes along Bloor St offer a safe alternative to commuting via private automobile or public transit.

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives, bottom line. Many of my loved ones have been injured by drivers while cycling. I saw my sister get her front top and bottom teeth smashed out by a person who opened their door without looking. A friend was involved in a hit and run, he was thrown off his bike and now has brain damage and needed to get reconstructive surgery on his face. Another friend was T-boned by a driver, her leg was badly damaged and she couldn't work for months. Another friend was hit by a driver and now has a permanent back injury, he was unable to work for 2 years. This should not be the norm! I don't want to see more of my loved ones get injured.\nI have daily unsafe encounters on roads without bike lanes: drivers speeding within inches of me, squeezing me between their cars and the curb so I can't get by, nearly turning into me on left and right turns, drivers running stop signs and red lights. I should not have to put my life at risk just because I don't use a car to commute.\nI use the Bloor bike lane everyday to get work (even in the colder months), I feel safer having a barrier between myself and cars, and it is about the only option for a safe, continuous east-west route as Dupont, College, Dundas, Queen, etc. do not have proper, divided bikes lanes and are extremely unsafe for cyclists.\nIf the government was truly committed to reducing gridlock in the city, the money would be invested in public transit. Our transit system is poor, unreliable and disconnected. If people were able to rely on transit to get them to work on time, traffic would be reduced. I've lived in the city for over 20 years and have seen the density of folks moving here increase year over year and the transit system has barely changed.\nI urge the government to focus their efforts elsewhere. Removing bike lanes is not it.\nIf you want a \"world class city\" you need to increase other ways of getting around and make it safer to do so: like cycling, walking and transit. NOT more cars.\n"

        "comment": "I am not convinced that this bill will save us any time. Instead of cracking down on alternative modes of transport, how about restricting NIMBY traffic measures like speed bumps and 30km/h zones like on King Edward Ave in Ottawa . As a driver these are more problematic to me than missing lanes that are usually blocked by delivery vehicules anyway.\nAs a cyclist, the most important thing to me is a continuous corridor that flows with traffic. Being raised or separated might make some people feel safe, but that is a false sense of security. It makes them more difficult to see as a driver and those lanes are often designed to stop at every intersection when car traffic keeps flowing. In the end, regardless of whether I'm in my car or on my bike, it's the stop and go that makes things go slow\nTreat bikes the same as you would cars. When I ride my bike it's to avoid traffic. Stopping and getting back up to speed makes this less efficient. Scenic indirect routes that attract walkers and runners make this less efficient.\nLet's focus on the efficiency. Having good, efficient alternative bike infrastructure is the way to make this happen.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is a terrible step backwards for the safety of cyclists in the city of Toronto not to mention stifling a viable means of transportation within the city center and beyond.  It has been flushed out in study after study that bike lanes do not hamper traffic or impede business but rather improve them on both accounts.  This bill is ridiculously short sighted as the way of progress will dictate that these bike lanes will be the future of any big city transit solution so removing them now to replace them at a later date is fiscally irresponsible and a waste of hard working tax payer dollars. Focus is needed on a plethora of provincial problems, not the micro management of city/municipal decisions.\n"

Removing bike lanes does not remove the cyclists. Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\n"

My daughter is enthusiastic about biking.  I am feeling better about my health.\nYou have got to know that taking away bike lanes will only make traffic worse.

        "comment": "I am very concerned about the proposed legislation from the Ontario government that would deny municipalities the ability to install new bike lanes on major streets without provincial approval. If passed, the new rules would severely limit municipalities\u2019 ability to protect all road users, fight climate change, and ease congestion.\nAll of Ontario\u2019s municipalities are struggling to address road safety, congestion and its negative impacts on local economies, public health, the environment and climate. Limiting their options - and forcing them to seek provincial approval for local decisions - will only make the situation worse and create more time-consuming government red tape, and worse, will lead to an increase in traffic fatalities. Bike lanes allow more people to travel in less road space, in addition to improving safety for all road users.\nMunicipalities in Ontario need the power to implement the Transportation Master Plans they have developed for their context.\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) stated that bike lanes are crucial for urban transportation planning and road safety, and requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach.\nAMO has further emphasized the importance of local knowledge and community input to develop transportation plans that balance traffic flow with priorities like active transportation and environmental protection.\nI strongly urge the government to reconsider this legislation and allow municipalities to freely undertake their responsibility for transportation planning.\n"

Bike lanes are the arteries of forward-thinking cities.\nMaintain the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University. I am opposed to any legislation that would remove them.\nThank you.\n"
