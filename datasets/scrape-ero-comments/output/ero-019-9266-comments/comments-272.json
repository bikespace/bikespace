        "comment": "One of the most ridiculously backward proposals I've ever seen.\nQuestion posed: What could possibly be causing congestion on our roadways?\n(Incorrect) Solution posed: It must be those bikes! You know, the mode of transport that takes up 1/20th the space of ANY automobile.\nWhy have alternative modes of transport that reduce the total number of cars ON the road when we could uproot them and\n- increase the number of cars on the road (more cars than any number of extra lanes could support, mind you) further increasing congestion\n- decrease the safety for cyclists who (like it or not) will still be commuting by bicycle on those exact same routes, causing more accidents, requiring health and safety services on the scene that will end up closing lanes\nWhat a great idea (...to idiots and payed shills)!\nSeriously. Get your heads out of O&Gs tailpipe and work towards solutions that DECREASE the number of cars on the roads, and you'll decrease congestion. It's not rocket science.\nNew York did it.\nDarn near every major EU city did it.\nMontreal's doing it.\nVancouver's trying to do it.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea for Ontario and the city of Toronto.\nThe removal of bike lanes downtown Toronto will not decrease gridlock, and increase the incidence of accidents involving cyclists and motorists.\nRemoving a bike lane does not change the number of cyclists on the roads. These cyclists will now be using traffic lanes, as is their right. This puts cyclists at risk of distracted drivers, and  drivers with road rage, causing the incident of cyclists injured and killed by vehicles to increase.\nThe bike lanes as is are small, but most provide a slight barrier between traffic and cyclists. They also are a physical reminder for drivers to look for cyclists in the lane.\nBike lanes improve safety of Ontario citizens and improve the flow of traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly, viscerally, oppose this bill. I live in the city. I\u2019ve walked, biked, cycled, and ran this city. I\u2019ve taken every form of commute in and out. And I\u2019ve lived on Bloor for years. The proposal to override municipal bike lane plans, and worse, to remove already completed lanes on university and Yonge, without evidence, despite the outcry, ignoring years of research, is unconscionable. I would like the provincial government to reconsider, and actually listen to the municipalities. This seems like an overreach and abuse of power, to appease a vocal few, while making life harder for those actually impacted by it.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes fight climate change. They reduce\npollution; they are literally a net zero way to get\naround. Removing bike lanes will put cyclists who\ncame out of their cars thanks to safe bike lanes,\nback into cars. This proposal will likely cause cyclists\nto get catastrophically injured and possibly die. It is\nnot evidence based, and is the wrong move in the\nface of a climate emergency. I am stunned we are\ntalking about removing bike lanes in the year 2024.\nThis is absolutely wrong and should be stopped.\n"

        "comment": "Extensive research shows that protected bike infrastructure consistently saves lives. Studies from Toronto, Vancouver, and numerous international cities demonstrate that bike lanes also boost local business revenue, with increases of 15-30% commonly reported as cyclists make more frequent stops at shops.\nThe argument about traffic delays deserves perspective: studies show that properly designed bike lanes typically add only 1-3 minutes to vehicle commute times. We must ask ourselves: is saving a minute or two worth sacrificing both public safety and economic benefits?\nMoreover, the funds used for removing bike lanes could be better spent on improving public transit service. Enhanced transit funding would give residents more transportation choices, reduce congestion, and create a more efficient transportation network for everyone. Rather than spending money to remove infrastructure that makes our streets safer, let's invest those resources in expanding transit service and frequency.\nThe data clearly shows that bike lanes and robust public transit create more livable, prosperous, and safe communities for everyone. This isn't about cyclists versus drivers - it's about building a transportation system that works for all Ontarians.\nI strongly urge you to maintain and expand our bike lane network, not remove it. This is an evidence-based investment in Ontario's future.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a backward step to fix traffic congestions and gridlocks. Removing a safe, protected lane for bikes will only result in people seeking for alternative modes of transportion, I.e. more cars, and increased risk to cyclists who will inevitably still use those major streets. This bill is absolutely abhorrent to Toronto cyclists and drivers. Closing University is especially egregious since the municipal government just reconstructed the protected bike lanes. Please DO NOT APPROVE THIS BILL.\n"

        "comment": "I believe that this proposal goes against the common goal of making Toronto a safer and more inclusive city for all our residents. It also continues to prioritize and increase our reliance on cars. As our population grows, it is unrealistic and unsustainable to continue to gear all our infrastructure towards drivers. We need to incentivize alternate modes of transportation and cycling is one of the healthiest, most efficient and cost-effective modes imaginable. The proposal to remove the already-installed bike lanes is baffling considering that the majority of them did not remove a traffic lane but rather a parking lane. Why are stopped cars a higher priority than the safety of cyclists?\nIt is hard to understand why Premier Doug Ford believes that he is governing the City of Toronto considering that we did not elect him as our Mayor. Please, Ford -- stay in your lane. Focus on improving our health care and education systems and leave our city alone.\n"

I\u2019ve seen people get hit by cars and have myself almost been run over. It\u2019s really disappointing how the provincial government thinks removing bike lanes is progress. I do NOT agree with this. It\u2019s really sad.  I suggest you look up the term \u201cinduced demand\u201d. You\u2019re not solving anything. Just using people\u2019s lives for political gains. Shame on you Doug Ford.\n"

In a dense city like ours, I don\u2019t think cars should be the only mode of transportation; they take up a lot of space.  Streetcars and buses are often unreliable and unpredictable with timings. Bikes on the other hand are very convenient, take us whenever and wherever we need especially within downtown. Keep us healthy and the air clean as well!\n"

Bike lanes are an important way for cyclists to safely and quickly travel on busy streets, and they encourage more people to cycle rather than take a car. They do not increase automobile congestion. This bill does not appear to be in good faith. As an Ontarian, I find this action from the Ontario government to be very concerning.\n"

As someone who drives much more than cycling, it\u2019s absolutely not true that bike lanes causes traffic congestion.\nIt\u2019s the lack of proper public transportation and the lack of traffic violation enforcement.\nIf anything, there should be more bike lanes AND they should be protected lanes where idiots in cars can\u2019t block it.\nStop all this bullshit and come up with some bills that actually benefit society.\n"

Climate change is wreaking havoc around the world and is already harming our community: You should do everything in your power to REDUCE driving and encourage cycling instead of implementing this cruel plan. All you will do is maim and kill cyclists, aggravate drivers who will have to go back to sharing the road with cyclists, and cause Ontario residents more inconvenience. I wish I believed in an afterlife, because you truly deserve to go to hell for your destruction of this province's healthcare, education, and environment.\n"
