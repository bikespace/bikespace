        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be a significant step backward for the city\u2019s commitment to sustainability and safety. Contrary to to goal of this proposal, removing bike lanes would only increase traffic congestion and as a result of having more cars on the road, would also increase greenhouse gas emissions.\nDedicated bike lanes make cycling a safer and more attractive option for commuting. In places like downtown Toronto, cyclists can often navigate traffic more easily and find quicker routes than cars. As more people opt for cycling, this can lead to shorter travel times for everyone, reducing overall congestion. When more people choose to ride bikes instead of driving, it decreases the number of cars on the road, leading to less congestion.\nBikes take up significantly less space than cars. In downtown Toronto, road space is extremely limited. By providing bike lanes, we can move more people through a given area without requiring additional road space.\n"

WHY ON EARTH would our provincial administration, REMOVE bike lanes protecting the lives of the citizens of Ontario? Wake up. Grow up. Smarten up. Look at other cities of our size around the world and what makes them successful. Lead with intelligent design, not asinine behavior based on zero research. DO NOT tear up bike lanes. DO EVERYTHING to build more bike and transit infrastructure.\n"

Because of the good bike lane infrastructure, especially the separated lanes, I switch to my e-bike. In the past 3 years, my odometer is over 2000km - all downtown Toronto travel. The Bloor lanes are critical for me to get from Danforth across to the rest of the city. Taking away the lanes would either endanger my life, or make me add to traffic by driving again. If the bike lanes are removed and I get injured, I would hold Rob Ford accountable.\n"

        "comment": "The division this issue has caused in our city is heartbreaking. It is known globally that the best way to reduce gridlock in a city is to increase bike lanes and bike infrastructure. An efficient bike lane moves far more people per day than a lane of traffic. I promise you, if you make biking the most efficient choice, you will have less traffic, and a healthier and happier community. It is the only way forward. Please do not take us backwards.\nAdditionally, the number of cyclist deaths and injuries in our city, should be more than enough to prove their necessity. If the presence of bike lanes slows our many dangerous drivers in Toronto, then not only will cyclists be safer, but pedestrians and other drivers will be safer too.\n"

The city has already signaled its stance by rejecting the current premier in his unsuccessful bid for mayor - he needs to stay out of municipal affairs.\nAs a lifelong conservative voter, if this passes, I will be voting for the NDP.\nI also intend to take up an entire lane of traffic and cycle at 20 km/h, letting drivers navigate around me - it's safer than trying to share a lane with cars and trucks.\nI have friends who will go back to driving, which will only add to the traffic on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Recently, there has been a lot of big news regarding bike lanes. As somebody who has relies on my bike for transportation, I believe that the limitations imposed by Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act) on new bike lanes will decrease the safety of not only cyclists, but also drivers who will now have to accomodate cyclists riding on the street, and pedestrians who have to get out of the way of cyclists riding on the sidewalks.\nBike lanes have been proven to not contribute to vehicular traffic, contrary to Premier Ford's claims. However, the TTC is becoming filled with bikers who have no cycling paths between Davisville Ave. and Finch Ave., contributing to busier trains. Removing existing bike lanes and limiting new ones will only push more cyclists onto the TTC, resulting in overcrowding during peak hours.\nBike lanes are extremely important for cyclists, whether that's as a hobby, gig job, or part of a daily commute. When we start limiting and removing bike lanes, the province will see higher numbers of cyclist and pedestrian injuries as a result.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes in Toronto are essential for creating safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly urban spaces. They protect cyclists by clearly separating them from motor vehicle traffic, reducing accidents and encouraging more people to choose biking as a viable mode of transportation. My self, my children and grandchildren use bike lanes.  This shift helps to alleviate traffic congestion over time, as more people cycling means fewer cars on the road, leading to quicker commutes and reduced emissions. Additionally, dedicated bike lanes promote a healthier lifestyle, as families feel more confident choosing an active form of travel. In the long run, bike lanes contribute to a greener, more livable city, supporting sustainable urban growth while making streets more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. In addition a bike friendly city encourages tourists and elevates our standing as a world class city to visit.Think of our future.\n"

        "comment": "I'm adding my voice to the chorus of concerned Ontarians who urge this provincial government to keep their hands off local municipal decisions. The cycle tracks that would be removed because of this irresponsible overreach have been keeping vulnerable residents safer when choosing sustainable and affordable transportation.\nEver since the introduction of the University Ave bike lane it has filled a major gap in the Toronto cycling network. I have taken that bike lane to and from errands and attractions multiple times per week continuously since it was introduced. There is simply no replacement for how amazing this option has been. Prior to that lane I had to mace a choice between detouring by over 1 km, or fighting aggressive drivers in mixed lanes on streets such as Bay St or Church St.\nThe Yonge North bike lane has also filled an important gap, simply by way of the fact that *there are no alternatives*. There simply is no bike-safe side street that parallels Yonge from Bloor to Eglinton given the city's unique geography. Cars have plenty of alternatives including Mount Pleasant (which is VERY dangerous for cyclists) and Avenue Road. The Yonge lane also adds an important cycling access point from the downtown core to the excellent Beltline trail.\nThe Bloor West bike lanes have enabled cycling in a part of the city that has also has no viable alternatives, again because with the city's geography *there are no parallel sides streets*. Before those lanes, riding that stretch of Bloor was like fighting highway traffic.\nI want to take a moment to bust open the fallacy that removing these bike lanes will do anything to relieve traffic. In recent years the gig economy has seen an explosion of delivery workers on the road for services such as DoorDash and UberEats. There are both cars and bicycles facilitating these deliveries. Most of the shops where they are picking up their deliveries are *on main roads*. So when these roads have bike lanes, cycling becomes a viable way to execute these orders.\nWhat do you think will happen if the bike lanes are removed?? The gig workers will feel less safe cycling to deliver these orders. But the order volume won't be going down. So what will happen instead is, more of these orders will be serviced by cars. What do you think will happen to rush-hour traffic volumes on the road if all the bikes delivering your dinner suddenly turned into cars?\nAnd how many people will decide, when their safest bike route has been destroyed, that they may as well just hop an Uber or a Lyft to their destination instead of bike there? What do you think will happen to rush-hour traffic volumes on the road if everyone who would have hopped on a bike share suddenly becomes another car on the road?\nI urge this government to stand down, listen to actual experts, and retract this disastrous bill before it creates more traffic on the road and causes more cyclist deaths.\n"

        "comment": "As an avid cyclist and environmentalist I am strongly against this bill. Building and maintaining bike lanes encourages people to cycle, keeps them safe, and eases overall traffic. By reducing noise and pollution from cars, it also improves quality of life at street level, encouraging foot traffic and boosting local businesses.\nAdditionally, the stated goal of \u201csaving you time\u201d seems at risk, given the traffic delays that would be caused by the construction required to remove the bike lanes in Toronto.\nRather than saving \u201cyou\u201d time, this bill seems  purpose built to benefit Doug Ford personally, given its focus on particular bike lines in Toronto close to his home and workplace. I cannot believe that the government would have the gall to act in such a nakedly self-serving manner. Please stay out of municipal issues like this one and focus on things more relevant to your mandate, such as improving our ailing health care system.\n"

        "comment": "This is a disappointing bill. Bike lanes do not cause congestion. This has been studied all over the world. The only ways to reduce congestion are by giving people viable alternatives such as accessible transit, safe and connected bike infrastructure or walkable communities. Cars take up a lot of  space bikes, don't. The removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge will not improve traffic congestion. Studies from all over the world indicate this. We have also seen this before with the Jarvis bike lane which when removed resulted in increased traffic times. They will however increase the likelihood of death of cyclists and pedestrians. As someone who utilizes bike lanes in this city it is frustrating that the province doesn't view myself, or the countless others like me, as worthy of basic personal safety and choice in how we choose to transport ourselves.  Furthermore this bill in reference to highway 413 is disgusting. Removing environmental protections is a dereliction of authority and spitting in the face of future generations in the middle of a climate catastrophe. The proposed highways best case is saving drivers 30 seconds at a cost that is not in line with the alleged time savings or severe environmental impacts. Please reconsider and do not build this highway.\nStop removing peoples choices, bikes and transit are the solutions to traffic issues.\n"

        "comment": "It is fairly well established world-wide that adding lanes to roads and highways only leads to more congestion.    There is no need to cite any Canadian literature or articles on the subject because Canada is very behind in terms of road infrastructure and the lack of tolls on roads is the biggest indicator.\nRemoving bike lanes (and poorly built ones at that) won't get cars to where they need to go any faster.  I have included links on the topic as it is well researched and in fact cities with intense congestion such as Mexico City and Los Angeles are adding bike lanes to improve transportation.\nThere is also a link to this paradox discovered in 1920.   I am sure the province already knows this but here is more information on the discussion:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox\nAdditionally, just to prove I am not pro-anything, here is a well balanced look at toll roads in the US where there are far MORE drivers and less congestion:   https://www.ibtta.org/publication/debunking-myths-highway-tolling\n"

As well, I have not been shown any study that shows that removing these bike lanes actually increase commute times, independent of construction which is a constant in Toronto these days. I believe that the actual solution to the gridlock in Toronto is to have alternatives to driving. I am happy about the progress of the Ontario Line, and am looking forward to the opening of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Finch LRT.\nAs a voter who has voted conservative in the past, and could be convinced to vote conservative in the future, this will ensure that my vote is lost.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to voice my strong opposition to this bill.\nThe cycling infrastructure on Bloor was instrumental for me as a young professional commuting to work and accessing the city. The removal of such infrastructure (and the friction for new bicycle friendly developments) would directly hurt the accessibility of the city for me, and many others.\nI strongly believe this bill will have rapid negative consequences, for cyclist obviously, but also for drivers. Many current cyclists are traveling via bicycle because it is their best option, and they will continue to try and do so - only it will be interspersed with motor traffic and be more dangerous, while also getting in the way of motor traffic.\nAs induced-demand has taught us again and again, any new car lanes will fill up nearly instantly and lead to the same levels of congestion that are currently experienced. Cars are required for certain types of trips, but are the least space efficient way to transit people at scale. The correct focus for reducing congestion is to improve scalable transit options and move people off of the roads with viable alternative options (Subway frequency, bike lanes, bus routes, walk ways, etc.).\nThis top-down provincial bill will also hurt the city's ability to respond to local changes and issues. It is adding more steps in the way of local government listening to its people and enacting the changes which benefit the community.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolute joke of a bill, and yet another example of this government's lack of evidence-based policy making. As the climate rapidly warms as a result of carbon emissions, we need to get more cars off the streets, which, opposite to the supposed logic in this bill, requires more bike lanes and investments in public transit to incentivize the community to seek car-alternative travel options. Further, it is apparent (highlighted by its idiotic obsession with building more highways and the 401 tunnel) that this government has not heard of the proven concept of \"induced demand\".  Removing bike lanes will only incentivize more drivers to travel on these streets and will quickly cause the same amount of, or more, gridlock. Again, this points to the need to get cars off the road.\nIn a city as dense as Toronto, for example, travelling by bike is more efficient, and if more investments were made into bike infrastructure that increase the safety of bike commuting, even more people would consider it. Bike lanes are also cheaper to maintain than roads primarily travelled by car.\nCyclists should have the right to travel on their bikes, as motorists do in their cars, to their destination SAFELY while using the most direct route, which means major roads. This government needs to repeal this legislation and stay in their lane.\n"

This will add red tape to the process of building active transportation networks. The province should be supporting the development of complete active transportation networks giving residents of the province the ability to choose different means of getting around their community that suit their budgets, and lifestyles. This proposal will make our streets more congested as more people are forced to drive. It will make our streets more dangerous for those who will continue to not drive for whatever reason.\nThe province should not be taking a top down authoritarian approach to city planning, and trust planning professionals to work with municipalities, to design streets that meet the needs of their communities as a whole, and not just drivers.\n"

        "comment": "This is such a move backward for Ontario. As someone who\u2019s been hit by a car cycling, the proper infrastructure on main roads is so important on saving lives. The data shows now that these bike lanes have made it safer for cyclists, and increased business for those on Bloor and Yonge. Additionally to this, if we actually want to reduce congestion, we have to follow the fact that induce demand is a proven phenomenon and that more lanes for cars does not help traffic get better, it does the opposite. We need to invest in these alternative modes of transit, not just bike infrastructure but also better buses, streetcars and subways as well. This is more cost effective, efficient and the only way we are going to move toward a zero carbon future. In addition to all of this, I find it ridiculous that a conservative government which is supposed to be for small government interference, and less spending, is interfering with municipalities and wasting money undoing an investment that was already made. We\u2019re going to spend millions of dollars undoing an investment into cycling that already cost millions of dollars and then we\u2019re going to have to re do that investment again years in the future. We need to let communities govern themselves and the province needs to be more focused on serving the individual needs of her communities. This is a horrible bill, not only because it endangers people\u2019s lives, is bad for the environment and won\u2019t solve the problem, but because it\u2019s a further waste of the tax payers time and money.\n"

Bikes need to be protected, we frequently see news reports of bikers killed by automobiles, this bill would only cause more injuries and deaths. Even if you don't care about the human cost of bike infrastructure, and only care about getting people moving as fast as possible bike infrastructure makes more sense, it has higher capacity than roads and is much more accessible to those of limited economic means. On that note, when car prices and gas costs are soaring, when Ontarians are struggling to make ends meet, why are we 1) using tax payer dollars to tear out brand new infrastructure to 2) make the cheapest mode of transport less viable. The province needs to stay out of municipal affairs and let local democracy make the decisions local communities need.\n"
