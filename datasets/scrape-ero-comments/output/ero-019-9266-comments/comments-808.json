Removing bike lanes will endanger my life and those of my loved ones.\nResearch has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse\nWe need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and encouraging people to bike is an important part of this reduction\nRemoving bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money, and businesses will also suffer from reduced traffic.\nOntarians need more options to get around, not fewer. If I can't bike somewhere, that means I am driving. This is another car on the road.\nLastly, the Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities. Especially a political party that is supposed to stand for small government.\n"

        "comment": "TLDR: Disgustingly undemocratic, please stay in your lane province by focusing on issues of your scope. Keep local input, local. Calculate the costs here properly.\nFor the record, this is the first time I have gone through the process to provide comment on a provincial bill, which should be taken into consideration as the passing of this bill would bring about several negative and direct detrimental affects to my quality of life and well-being.\nAs a resident and frequent user of the bike lanes along the affected corridor, the lack of local consultation that this sweeping bill appears to display is palpable and despicable.\nIt is also without logical justification (other than it's connection to being on the Premier's commuting route from his home to his office at Queens park!!), that such moves which benefit local small businesses in aggregate, local health and safety, and even real estate values have been factored into its consideration and analysis.\nThe bundled provisions limiting consultation and engineering as it relates to the under construction highway seems equally disingenuous and undemocratic.\nTo what degree have the health effects on local air pollution been quantified? To what degree have the safety impacts of protected bike lanes been studied and cross referenced with relevant data? Increased accidents between vehicles and cycles, leading to increased hospitalizations have very real and material costs to the province. What are their costs?\nFor lower income residents, the bike lane represents increased freedom of movement and economic viability and vitality for potential customers and employees along the corridor. It is often the most economical routing on a per unit basis for many trips, and can provide positive compounding economic effects that span increased tax revenue from sales taxes, increased total volumetric throughput, and protection of the users of alternate modes of transportation.\nWhat other international examples exist where non-local governments intervene in such hyper-local decisions, skipping extensive consultation across stakeholders which have often already taken lots of local consideration into details.\nInstead, this government decides that the input of local residents and users of its infrastructure don't matter. This without even accounting for the costs of making such changes.\nPlease, provincial government. Spend your time and energy on the issues that are within your direct jurisdiction and responsibility (such as health care, tertiary education, assisting Metrolinx and other provincial entities in timely and effective execution and delivery of projects in motion).\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212, which seeks to remove bike lanes in Ontario. This proposal undermines the safety of cyclists, the sustainability of our transportation system, and the well-being of all Ontarians.\nSafety Concerns:\nBike lanes are critical for protecting cyclists from vehicle traffic, reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities. Without designated bike lanes, cyclists would be forced into general traffic lanes, increasing the likelihood of collisions and endangering both cyclists and motorists.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nEncouraging cycling as a mode of transportation is essential in the fight against climate change. Bike lanes promote eco-friendly travel by providing a safe and accessible option for those who wish to reduce their carbon footprint. Removing them sends the wrong message at a time when we should be investing in sustainable infrastructure.\nHealth and Economic Benefits:\nCycling offers significant health benefits by promoting physical activity and reducing healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles. Additionally, bike-friendly cities attract tourism and foster local businesses by making streets more accessible and welcoming.\nCommunity Connectivity:\nBike lanes enhance community connections by making streets safer and more inclusive for all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. They contribute to vibrant, livable urban spaces that prioritize people over cars.\nI urge the committee to reconsider this bill and instead focus on improving cycling infrastructure to support safety, sustainability, and community development. The removal of bike lanes would be a step backward for Ontario.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I hope to see Ontario continue to prioritize safe and sustainable transportation solutions.\n"

        "comment": "I am absolutely against this bill.  It is a waste of time and money to remove newly installed bike lanes that are only just starting to have an effect in making this city more bike-able.  I have had a much better and safer biking experience in other cities such as Calgary - Toronto's bike route infrastructure is piece-meal, disconnected, and often convoluted but it is getting better.  Also it is the city's responsibility to manage its infrastructure and this frankly just feels like meddling.  If the province would like to help with building more bike lanes to increase safety and decrease the number of cars that need to be on the road that would be great and would be much more effective at improving traffic flows.\nI am also absolutely against the building of the highway 413.\n"

It includes things like expropriating land from people to build highways and avoiding all environmental protection checks and balances for building highway 413.\nHighway expansion has been proven time and time again as a failed method of reducing traffic! This will not benefit the working people of Ontario or our future, our children, and the land and infrastructure we actually need to sustain us.\nIt also hugely oversteps on municipalities when addressing bike lanes and is not based in any research or evidence.\nPlease do not pass this bill.\n"

Bill 212 needs to be rejected!  The cost of removing lanes from Bloor St is real and it\u2019s asinine to pay to rip something out that has so recently been implemented, not to mention the gridlock that will be created while the bike lane is removed.  We know that there are benefits to bike lanes, from faster commutes, lowering CO2 emissions to a healthier population.  The province should not be interfering with the city\u2019s bike lanes and removing the benefits of our growing cycling culture.\n"

We have few cyclists when the weather gets cold and icy yet the lanes stay in place. Idling cars throw off toxic fumes while we sit in gridlock.\nThe city should have bike lanes but not on every major thoroughfare. Thank you for your understanding.\n"

        "comment": "This is the most regressive bill I've ever read about in recent months.\nThis is absolutely absurd. The construction to remove these bikes lanes alone will cause more traffic. We don't need more construction on busy streets.\nWE WANT A BIKEABLE CITY!!!\nWE WANT A PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY CITY!!!\nWE DON'T WANT MORE CARS!!!\nWe want more public transportation. We want MORE bike lanes so we can feel safe when we bike. There will not be less bikes on the road if this is pushed through. We will have a less safe road where bicycles are forced to share the road with cars.\nPlease....for God's sake, let's have some common sense here. Canada is so far behind in terms of public transport and bike lanes compared to nations in Europe and Asia. Let's focus on putting money into public transportation so that people's need to drive are reduced on roads that cause congestion for emergency response.\nMORE ROADS does NOT equal to less traffic\nMORE HIGHWAY LANES does NOT equal to less traffic.\nThis has already been studied and researched.\n"

This leads to idling cars and excessive greenhouse gas emissions - something the environmentalists claim to be trying to solve.  Shame on Toronto City Council for misrepresenting the facts related to the continued installation of this congestion causing infrastructure.  And shame on Toronto City Council for wasting so much money to build this under utilized network of ridiculousness.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212.\nThe proposed changes are deeply concerning, particularly regarding bike lanes, taxpayer money, and broader implications like environmental impacts and provincial overreach. Here are my key concerns:\nBike Lane Removal Jeopardizes Safety\nRemoving bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University will drastically reduce safety for cyclists, including my children and me. Data from the City of Toronto shows a 56 percent reduction in cyclist injuries after the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street, despite a 40 to 90 percent increase in cycling activity. Removing these lanes will reverse this progress and make our streets more dangerous.\nNo Real Traffic Improvements\nThe argument that bike lanes cause traffic congestion is not supported by evidence. For example, Montreal has successfully integrated an extensive bike lane network without negatively impacting traffic flow. Studies from Montreal demonstrate that well-designed bike lanes separate modes of transportation effectively, reducing conflicts and making streets more efficient for all users. City staff in Toronto also reported that removing bike lanes will result in minimal improvements in vehicle travel times, while the construction required for their removal will disrupt traffic for years. Removing bike lanes will discourage cycling as a viable transportation option, likely increasing car usage and further exacerbating congestion.\nWaste of Taxpayer Money\nThe estimated cost of removing the bike lanes is at least 48 million dollars\u2014a staggering waste of taxpayer funds. These funds could be better allocated to projects that genuinely improve traffic flow, such as enhancing public transportation or repairing existing infrastructure. As a taxpayer, I am frustrated that my money is being directed toward dismantling infrastructure that has proven safety and environmental benefits.\nEnvironmental Concerns\nBill 212 proposes fast-tracking highway projects, such as Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, by bypassing environmental assessments. These exemptions threaten local ecosystems and ignore the long-term consequences of increased vehicle emissions and habitat destruction. Removing bike lanes and prioritizing car-centric policies contradict the province\u2019s stated sustainability goals and will worsen urban pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nProvincial Overreach\nThe bill undermines local governance by requiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval for bike lanes that reduce vehicle traffic lanes. Municipalities know their unique transportation needs better than the province and should retain the ability to make these decisions without interference. This overreach erodes trust in local leadership and sets a dangerous precedent for provincial control over municipal planning.\nConclusion:\nBill 212 is a regressive step that prioritizes short-term, car-centric policies over long-term, sustainable, and community-focused solutions. It puts my family\u2019s safety at risk, wastes taxpayer dollars, and disregards environmental and local governance concerns. I urge the government to reconsider and focus on strategies that benefit all road users and protect our environment.\n"

Since the bike lanes were installed in our neighborhood traffic and congestion on residential side streets has increased. Drivers are veering off of the main artery (Bloor) and weaving through residential streets because of traffic delays caused by the removal of traffic lanes on Bloor.\nCan you please also address priority bus lanes? The city of Toronto is looking to reducing Jane street by one lane in each direction.\n"
