They make my daily commute safer: when I am not on a bike lane, I am constantly fearing for my life. I ask that we consider safety for everyone on the road.\nOn a same note, the bike lane on Bloor St/Danforth is the only one bike lane crossing the city without forcing me to change my direction at one point or another (unlike Dundas st for instance). As for car driver, the same principle applies here: the faster way to get somewhere is the direct one. The government should let it that way and focuses more on public transit to incitate people to leave their car at home.\n"

        "comment": "This effort by the province to take over what should be a municipal process is clearly a political stunt at best and a mean-spirited bullying act by the Premier.\nWorld class cities like London and Paris are building bike and pedestrian infrastructure to ease congestion and prepare for climate change, and study after study, in cities in many countries show that increased cycling and pedestrian infrastructure increase road safety and increases visits to local businesses.\nEach Ontario city must have the power to assess its own needs and make its own decisions on bike lanes, informed by data and local input. Shifting this power to the province is a purely political stunt that will set our cities and our province back in terms of quality of life, economic interests, health and safety, and wise use of tax dollars.\nI strongly oppose this action by the province to remove local control of bike lanes.\n"

There are even children on board bicycles. Tragedy aside (if that doesn't bother you), do you want to burden the healthcare system with more road trauma.\n2. Do you want to discourage people from using bicycles as a means of transportation?\nThen you will find these people in cars and you can watch traffic and parking issues in the city (which are already at crisis) become exponentially worse, not to mention environmental pollution and issues around gas sustainability.\nYou should be encouraging cycling as a means of transportation. You should not be discouraging it by threatening the safety of cyclists.\n"

It is eating up precious time and money to propose this and to enact the removal of lanes and prohibit the creation of more. The research CLEARLY shows bike lanes do not have a substantive impact on congestion and in fact IMPROVE travel times. I encourage the conservative party and especially Doug Ford to educate themselves on causation vs correlation. Post-covid car trips are up everywhere! People are driving at all times of the day. Bike lanes did not cause this phenomenon. To actively choose to remove and prohibit the creation of new lanes is an affront to public health. People will get injured, people will die. Removing lanes on Bloor will not stop cyclists from using Bloor. There are no alternative \"side road\" networks that are feasible/sensible. This government is creating unnecessary conflict to draw criticism away from the fact that they have not built any housing, homeless rates are increasing, wait times are increasing. Do your job! The government is more worried about their base having to drive beside bike lanes than the housing and health care crisis. I am embarrassed by the lack of decency and maturity by this government.\n"

        "comment": "I'd like to add my voice to what is hopefully a widespread call for the Government of Ontario to reconsider this ill-conceived plan that is 1) inconsistent with existing research on how best to manage traffic flow and ease congestion, 2) a needless, wasteful, and meddlesome use of public funds, and 3) a misguided attack on vulnerable road users that need more safe infrastructure, not less.\n1) Extant research on how best to ease traffic congestion does not, in any way, support the idea that bike lanes are the cause of congestion, nor that their elimination would ease congestion. Indeed, the only effect on traffic that bike lanes have been found to have is to moderately slow existing traffic (which increases public safety for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists alike). Congestion is caused by more cars on the road, which is in turn caused by the existence of car infrastructure to the detriment of alternatives. Investing in public transit and active transportation would do more to ease congestion than any road widening or new road projects.\n2) The Government of Ontario's pledge to limit further bike infrastructure construction and to pay for the elimination of current infrastructure is misguided and wasteful. It also introduces uncertainty into existing municipal planning and development, intruding on projects that cities in our province have planned for years. Considering that car infrastructure is more costly to install and maintain than cycling infrastructure and produces costly and dangerous environmental externalities, failing to invest in alternative and active transportation is wasteful, unnecessary, and very poor environmental stewardship.\n3) Cyclists and other vulnerable road users rely on separated, safe infrastructure to keep them moving and out of harms way. The rise of distracted and dangerous driving, coupled with increases across the board to the size and weight of private passenger vehicles has made high-quality bike lanes a public safety necessity, over and above their environmental and economic benefit. Eliminating these lanes, let alone failing to invest in further expansion, puts vulnerable road users at serious risk of harm.\nI hope that, with time and serious thought, this government will recognize that this legislation is not only unwanted and unnecessary, but misguided - and that investments will instead be made where they can effect positive outcomes for congestion, the environment, and for public safety.\n"

        "comment": "Hello! I live in downtown Toronto and I vehemently oppose to Bill 212.\nThere is a multitude of reasons why congestion has never felt worse in Toronto, many of which have nothing to do with our very scant bike infrastructure. Historic construction projects, namely those related to the Ontario line, have stretched street capacities to their absolute limit. More drivers than ever are packed onto streets that were built decades ago. The chronic underfunding of public transit has undermined the delivery of efficient service. But one more lane for cars will not solve those problems, and it'll take visionary thinking at Queen's Park to create solutions. Simply saying \"No\" to bike initiatives that have been consulted on, approved and are in the process of implementing builds roadblocks instead of express routes to solving congestion.\nOn a philosophical note, what kind of city do we want to become? Toronto has longed looked to more progressive European countries for inspiration, or even a bit to the east in Montreal. They both embrace a proliferation of bike lanes, thought to enhance quality of life, reduce car dependency and benefit the environment. Urban planning enthusiasts love to talk of 15-minute cities \u2014\u00a0bikes and other alternative modes of transit, as well as the infrastructure that allows them to get around, make that possible. Bike lanes are always part of the ideal progressive city, but now we find them scapegoated and used as a political wedge.\nFor bike lane detractors, specifically those who urge cyclists to \"use side streets,\" I would challenge them to get from the west end of the city to the east end of the city (or vice versa) safely on a bicycle. The sole bike routes are on Bloor and on Lakeshore \u2013\u00a0the rest force cyclists onto roads that are extremely busy and deeply unsafe, especially with construction and proximity to street car tracks.\nI urge those in approval of Bill 212 to reconsider their position and consider the kind of city we want to become. We're a city for people, not cars.\n"

        "comment": "City Of Toronto\u2019s implementation of bike lanes are evidence-based. They depend on traffic analysis and proven benefits on travel behaviour and transportation equity. Ask any expert and they will say we need bike lanes to reduce congestion. More people in cars means more traffic. It\u2019s that easy.\nThis is provincial overreach over an obvious municipal issue. And those who drafted this are not misinformed or stupid - they just don\u2019t care about those seriously injured or killed or those who can\u2019t get around with a car. This is a deliberate decision to jeopardize community safety for the convenience of many people who do not live in Toronto\u2019s denser areas.\nThis was done because a new project will affect Ford\u2019s neighbourhood. This is not evidence-based. It\u2019s silly that the Minister of Transportation complains about bike lanes in Ontario but is obviously targetting effective ones in Toronto ONLY such as those on University, Bloor, and College. Stop putting more people in danger only to win an election. The lives of people are at stake. 50 years from now history will judge you.\n"

Bike lanes are proven to decrease traffic times and increase in usage over several years, as new reporting shows: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nI live in the Niagara Region, where cycling is critical for tourism and lower-income residents\u2014including temporary foreign workers, of which we have many, in fields such as agriculture and hospitality. The province has a duty to improve transit options for our diverse community, which includes promoting cycling, improving the GO network and helping build walkable communities.\nThis bill is a distraction that focuses too much on the City of Toronto and would push the province backwards toward a mid-20th-century idea of car supremacy, which the rest of the world (Asia, Europe, much of the United States) is moving away from.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nAs a cyclist and an active member of Ontario's transportation community, I wanted to share my concerns and perspectives regarding your recent proposal to require provincial approval for the installation of new bicycle lanes that involve the removal of a traffic lane. While I understand the province's desire to fight gridlock and improve transportation efficiency, I believe this framework risks undermining the progress we've made toward creating safer, more sustainable streets for all road users.\nCycling is an essential mode of transportation for many Ontarians, offering an affordable, environmentally-friendly alternative to driving, while also reducing traffic congestion. Prioritizing vehicle lanes over bike lanes fails to account for the long-term benefits of cycling infrastructure: fewer cars on the road, reduced emissions, and healthier, more active communities.\nRemoving or delaying the construction of bike lanes also has serious safety implications. More bike lanes mean safer streets for cyclists and, by extension, for pedestrians and drivers alike. Compelling municipalities to undergo additional layers of approval only increases the time and administrative burden required to build infrastructure that has been proven to save lives and promote road safety.\nAdditionally, the environmental impact of prioritizing highways and vehicle lanes over active transportation solutions like cycling needs greater consideration. With climate change as a pressing global issue, any transportation policy should focus on reducing emissions rather than continuing to incentivize car-centric infrastructure.\nInstead of viewing bike lanes as a barrier to traffic flow, I urge the province to recognize them as part of the solution. Expanding cycling infrastructure encourages more people to get out of their cars, reduces congestion, and promotes a healthier, greener Ontario.\nI hope that in future consultations, the ministry takes into account the long-term benefits of cycling and active transportation and works with municipalities to foster a more balanced, sustainable approach to transportation.\nThank you for considering my input. I look forward to future discussions on how we can build a more sustainable and equitable transportation network for all Ontarians.\nSincerely,\nOntario Voter\n"

The biggest reason people in cities say they don\u2019t want to (not can\u2019t) cycle is because they don\u2019t feel safe doing so. We should make cycling safer for everyone by expanding the use of protected cycle lanes, not limiting them.\nI live in Toronto and use my bike for most trips between 3-20km, then use my motorcycle or car for anything further than that. This is the best way to get around the city. This bill will make me use my car more, thus making traffic worse for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Good morning,\nI am strongly opposed to a reduction in proposed or existing bike lanes.\nI have been a bike commuter in\nToronto since the early 80s. During that time I have seen a big increase in the number of cyclists travelling on main roads during both rush hour periods. Also a big increase in cars and car traffic. I am now retired but use my bike for errands, shopping and visiting friends. I also use TTC and would much rather see money spent on transit than taking out bike lanes.\nPoor land use planning and induced demand have resulted in more traffic in the city. With many thousands of new people moving in and around Toronto traffic will only get worse if we do not improve our regional and local transit systems.\nBike lanes make more people feel comfortable about cycling in the same way I do. I feel much safer on a bike lane when I go about my business but it does have to take me where I need to go. No sensible person is going to go miles out of their way to use secondary road for cycling if there are no lanes on main road. That puts cyclists at risk.\nFinally, I pay taxes the same an everyone else and deserve to have a safe way to get around.\nThanks for accepting my comments.\n"
