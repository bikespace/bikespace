        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which imposes restrictions on the construction of bike lanes that require the removal of a traffic lane. This bill threatens to undermine the many benefits that well-planned bike lanes offer to urban mobility, public health, and the environment. There are several objective reasons why bike lanes should continue to be prioritized, even if it requires the removal of a vehicle lane.\nContrary to the notion that bike lanes increase congestion, studies show that dedicated bike lanes can actually reduce overall traffic congestion. Cities like New York and London, which have significantly expanded their cycling infrastructure, have seen reductions in car traffic as more people choose biking as a viable mode of transportation. One vehicle lane can move only about 1,000\u20132,000 cars per hour, while a bike lane can accommodate 5 to 10 times that number of cyclists in the same amount of space. This is especially critical in dense urban areas where road space is limited.\nProtected bike lanes have been proven to reduce accidents for both cyclists and motorists. A study in Toronto found that streets with protected bike lanes saw a reduction in all types of accidents, not just those involving cyclists. By creating safer, dedicated spaces for cyclists, we prevent dangerous interactions between cars and bikes, leading to fewer accidents and less road rage. This directly enhances public safety for everyone, not just cyclists.\nBiking is a zero-emissions form of transportation, and promoting cycling over car use is critical to achieving climate targets. The transportation sector is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing vehicle miles traveled is essential in the fight against climate change. Removing traffic lanes to make room for bike infrastructure is a small but important step in shifting people towards cleaner modes of transport. Studies estimate that cities with extensive bike lane networks can reduce carbon emissions from transportation by as much as 10-20%, which is vital as we work towards sustainability goals.\nEncouraging cycling has clear public health benefits. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. According to the World Health Organization, increasing cycling in cities could save billions of dollars in healthcare costs over time. Moreover, fewer cars on the road can lead to better air quality, further improving public health outcomes. Prioritizing bike lanes\u2014even at the expense of vehicle lanes\u2014is an investment in the long-term health of the population and will lower healthcare costs for all.\nBike lanes also have significant economic benefits. Numerous studies have shown that cyclists are more likely than drivers to stop at local businesses and shop, including studies conducted in Toronto. Reducing vehicle lanes to add bike lanes can actually support vibrant, livable streetscapes that attract both residents and tourists. Cities with robust bike infrastructure, like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, are globally recognized for their high quality of life and economic dynamism.\nBike lanes provide affordable transportation options, especially for low-income individuals who cannot afford a car. Many residents rely on bicycles for daily commutes, and restricting bike lane development disproportionately impacts those who do not have access to other forms of transportation. Removing a vehicle lane to create a bike lane is a way to provide equitable transportation options that benefit a broader segment of society.\nIn summary, I strongly urge you to reconsider the implementation of Bill 212. Rather than reducing bike lane development, we should be accelerating it to create a safer, healthier, more sustainable, and economically vibrant urban environment. While removing a traffic lane may feel counterintuitive, the benefits of investing in cycling infrastructure far outweigh the costs. Cities that have embraced bike lanes have consistently reported lower traffic congestion, fewer accidents, better air quality, and stronger local economies.\nThank you for considering my perspective, and I hope you will act in the best interest of both current and future generations by opposing this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am both a city driver and cyclist and this is ludicrous. What do the highway goals have to do with bike lanes which are largely of city streets. Traffic is terrible in the city because of terrible construction plans and terrible public transport, every time I get on the subway, there's a delay or issue. Our population is sedentary and developing chronic symptoms because of it, you should be encouraging and developing infrastructure that encourages healthy living. This government is backwards and wasting our money\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto who walks, bikes, takes transit, and drives depending on the specific needs of my trip. This legislation is wildly shortsighted and unsubstantiated by research. The only way that this province can adapt to our growing population is to adopt a multi-modal transportation strategy. We need alternatives to car travel rather than making it the only viable mode of transportation. If we continue to prioritize car traffic, we will only ever add more cars to the road.\nAdding more lanes increases traffic congestion through induced demand. This has been a well documented concept for decades and yet the Ontario government continues to see widening roads as a viable solution to traffic. You can't fix car traffic without alternative options. Making travel by foot, bike, bus, or train easier and safer will have a more positive impact on traffic over time than any additional lanes for car traffic.\nBike lanes are narrower than car lanes and can move as many people per hour. Transit can move even more in the equivalent amount of time when given dedicated lanes. Car traffic is inherently inefficient as a means of mass transit and cannot scale the meet our growing population demands. Cars simply demand too much space and make navigating on foot uncomfortable with wide roads, high speeds, and massive parking lots. We should be building for people, not for cars.\n"

        "comment": "Cars causes congestion. Less cars = Less congestion. You get less cars by offering good alternatives to cars suchas  Bike lanes and Public Transit - not this narrow minded \"one more lane\" and \"one more road\" nonsense.\nAbsolutely idiotic and bad-faith take from our provinial government. Once again proving they are not serious about governing or serving, just picking a scapegoat and pandering to further an agenda that only serves a select few and ignores the majority of the province.\n"

        "comment": "The recent push in Ontario to remove or limit new bike lanes undermines the principles of sound urban planning and contradicts global trends toward creating safer, more inclusive streets. Cities around the world are recognizing the importance of enhancing cycling infrastructure as a means to promote sustainable transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and improve public health. By investing in bike lanes, municipalities not only encourage cycling as a viable mode of transport but also foster a culture of safety and accessibility for all road users, including pedestrians and motorists.\nMoreover, the removal of bike lanes sends a troubling message that prioritizes car-centric infrastructure over the well-being of residents. In numerous cities, such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, dedicated cycling paths have led to a significant rise in cycling rates, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. These cities exemplify the benefits of integrating bike lanes into urban planning, as they create vibrant, livable environments that cater to diverse transportation needs. Ontario\u2019s decision to limit bike lanes risks stalling progress toward these sustainable urban ideals.\nUltimately, embracing safe streets for all is not just a trend; it is a necessity for future-ready urban development. By limiting bike lanes, Ontario would be neglecting the opportunity to build a resilient transportation network that accommodates the needs of all citizens while fostering economic growth and environmental sustainability. To align with global best practices, Ontario should instead focus on expanding and enhancing cycling infrastructure, ensuring that all residents can safely and conveniently navigate their cities.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed law and believe that bike lanes are essential for making cities safer and more sustainable. Removing vehicle lanes to install bike lanes does not only improve traffic flow, but also reduces pollution, traffic-related accidents, and makes cities more pleasant to live in. Studies consistently show that cities with protected bike lanes have significantly fewer fatalities and serious injuries. For example, a comprehensive study across 12 U.S. cities found that the introduction of protected bike lanes resulted in a 44% reduction in fatalities for all road users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. In cities like Portland, fatality rates dropped by as much as 75% as bike lanes were expanded.\nNot only do bike lanes reduce congestion, but they also help create greener, quieter, and more beautiful urban environments. Research from Carnegie Mellon University further supports that bike lanes reduce congestion by replacing short car trips with more sustainable transportation modes like cycling.\n"

        "comment": "An entire car lane is almost never removed strictly for a bike lane, as a bike lane only takes up about 1/3 of a car lane's width. Usually, it also includes green space, more walking space, and/or street parking. The government should be transparent that this would also prevent the implementation of these other features and not focus so heavily on the car vs. bike debate. Plenty of car commuters would probably be frustrated at the removal of street parking as well. Further, this will not stop cyclists from going on these busy streets. They will just move along with the cars, and there should be markings on the road that indicate the lane is shared between cyclist and car. I find as a cyclist that more people are frustrated with me biking directly center and in front of their car than in a bike lane. Removal of a bike lane WILL make me share the road with drivers, and increase likelihood of accident AND delays.\n"

Municipalities should assess and implement bike lanes without overreach from the provincial government, and the province should absolutely not rip up existing bike infrastructure. We need communities that are less reliant on cars for human and planetary health. Focus more on the provincial responsibilities that are currently failing - like funding healthcare and housing for all, and stop targeting the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "It is somewhat shocking that a government would choose to eliminate a form of transportation that is affordable by all, enhances physical health, reduces the carbon footprint of car travel and statistically, improves congetsion.\nIn addition, it is financially irresponsible to remove already paid for routes. Once again, a  ridiculous decision made by this government with no evidence whatsover to support it and mountains of evidence to support the the positive impact of bike lanes. Major cities around the world have been and are currently redisigning cities by expanding bike access. Montreal, Amsterdam, Paris and more.\nHow is this even a possiblity in 2024. How is this government wasting money and resources to even take these comments. We need properly funded healthcare and education to support society and ensure a vibrant and thriving one in years to come.\n"

        "comment": "I am confused at why this is being looked at from a provincial government level. Roads where bike lanes are installed are managed by municipalities and as such should fall to them to make decisions. Furthermore, the proposal to limit and remove bike lanes goes against the research when we speak about traffic and gridlock. A year after instillation, we have seen that bike lanes increase speed on major arteries (such as the Danforth in Toronto). There are more bikes compared with automobilies per household in Toronto, if all the cyclist that use these bike lanes were to drive, gridlock would be much worse. Cyclists are using these bike lanes to get there faster. And studies from Toronto have shown that people are biking more than they previously were and are more likely to bike on roads with bike infrastructure.\nWhen I drive I am happy to see cyclists biking safely in a bike lane. It helps me know where to expect them. We have had a ridiculous number of cyclist deaths in Ontario this year, hearing that the province wants to re-evaluate municipal e streets use of cycle tracks is appalling. Areas where cycling is more prevalent tend to have lower rates of bicycle-related collisions and fatalities, and further more we know from studies from around the world that bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and increase local businesses. Municipalities should be installing more bike lanes, and the province should not be preventing these benefits.\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no logic to this proposal.\n- This is a total waste of taxpayer dollars. Why is the provincial government overstepping on municipal government decisions? These planning decisions do not need to be duplicated on a municipal and provincial level.\n- Bike lanes REDUCE grid lock - Studies have proven this, (see The Role of Walking and Cycling in Reducing Congestion: A Portfolio of Measures)\n- Building more car focused infrastructure (additional lanes for cars/highways) only promotes car travel, makes us more car-dependent, leading to more gridlock. To get serious about reducing gridlock, the provincial government should be focusing on its investments in public transportation instead of wasting time and money restricting bike lanes.\n"
