This city needs more investment in alternatives to driving, including public transportation and bike lane, and not less. I am furious to know that the Province is considering using my tax dollars to remove public infrastructure. As a parent to young children who lives in the downtown core, this is not the city I want them to grow up in.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident and taxpayer of Ontario and Toronto I strongly oppose this legislation. Bicycle lanes are a crucial piece of our transportation infrastructure and removing them will result in completely avoidable traffic deaths and injuries, not to mention increasing traffic congestion and pollution, hurting local businesses, damaging the reputation of Ontario and Toronto within Canada and the world. Not to mention the complete waste of money and additional traffic congestion resulting from the work to remove them.\nAs a driver in the downtown area I can attest that it is much safer and easier to drive on streets that have bike lanes rather than those that don\u2019t, as then bicycles are separated and protected rather than passing close to and in between car traffic. Additionally, removing bike lanes to restore car lanes will do nothing to reduce traffic congestion as the restored lane will be continually blocked by parked, stopped, and turning cars. This legislation if passed will take Toronto 10 years back and make the roads worse for everyone\n"

        "comment": "I am shocked at the decision to remove bike lanes - bike lanes keep people safer than riding in traffic. Unless, of course, somebody parks in them. There have been 6 deaths this year, that is 6 too many!!\nCycling takes up less room on our streets and is a healthy alternative to driving. We  need to reduce traffic in cities, not increase it. It is total nonsense that adding more lanes of traffic will reduce congestion. It will only increase the number of cars. Why is this government wasting time and a lot of money on \"solutions\" that are in fact false. We still don't have a crosstown! Why?? Major cities around the world, Paris, New York have increased cycling infrastructure to get cars out of the city. Cars cause congestion, not bikes, this is a fact. Montreal has done a great job putting more bike lanes in. They separate bikes from cars and make it very easy to get around the city with their bike sharing program. In Toronto the Premier wants to move backward and won't listen to the experts. Not to mention he refuses to get environmental studies done. It is an absolute disgrace. Talk about a waste of taxpayers money!\n"

        "comment": "The city of Toronto conducted a lot of consultations before installing these bike lanes.  The province should ABSOLUTELY not be involved in this process.  Time and time again research shows that adding more lanes does not reduce gridlock, yet Mr. Ford thinks that this will help. Once bike lanes are created it takes a little time for them to be used to their maximum capacity. We need to continue encouraging people to get out of their vehicles in order to reduce gridlock, this means creating more walkable and rideable neighbourhoods.  Along with world-class public transportation. Toronto needs to look at other major cities in the world like London and New York City that are discouraging vehicular traffic instead of promoting it.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nOur family has lived in Mississauga for 29 years at the same address. We own a home on Bloor Street, (Applewood/Ward 3).  We are 4 working adults with three vehicles in the driveway as most other families in this Mississauga community do too. In June 2023, the Mississauga City Council approved the Bloor Street integrated road project. Much of this public engagement and consultation was done during the Covid times( 2021, 2022) which bypassed normal channels for public consultation. In three of our public meetings did not produce any amicable resolution to moving the project elsewhere.  This project removes a total of 4 lanes of traffic down to effectively 2 lanes for regular vehicle traffic. There are 102 Bloor homeowners and many businesses negatively impacted by this traffic reduction which also leads to additional devaluation of our properties. The cost of this project has been estimated to be $27 million.\nOur community had organized a resident's association to educate and inform all Mississauga residents of this impending change to Bloor traffic. In our physical meetings with the city staff, we were promised a compromise only to find out this meant nothing and the project would continue as is. During our two canvassing and surveys with the Bloor residents, we found that 94 residents did not want this project to be implemented and built. We also had raised a petition list of 3400+ signatures asking the city to reconsider building this project. Unfortunately, dealing with the municipal government that does not listen to the wishes of the people seems very undemocratic and unprincipled. Many municipal governments seem to act with impunity and some hidden agenda.\nAs a homeowner who has lived on Bloor Street, I can tell you the amount of bicycle traffic is negligible. During the warmer months, you would be lucky to see 10-12 riders per week and none after cold weather moves in. With an ever-growing population in Mississauga, the amount of car/truck/public transportation has increased exponentially and Bloor Street has seen a huge increase also in the last decade.  Exiting onto the Bloor from our driveway can take several minutes due to the large amount of current vehicle traffic. Furthermore, additional condo buildings are being built on Bloor Street which will introduce several thousands of additional residents and thousands of additional vehicles. Adding bike lanes to Bloor Street would completely halt any reasonable traffic throughput. This would also negatively impact the response time of all emergency vehicles.\nThis also adds to an argument about the impact on those Bloor businesses that depend on regular traffic and a cut to their revenues due to increased inconvenience in easy access to and from their lots.\nApplewood community also has a high school at the corner of Bloor and Tomken Road (Applewood Collegiate) and during school hours Bloor is overburdened with standing traffic. Removing two lanes of traffic would lead to a nightmare for any homeowner exiting onto Bloor Street.\nBloor Street is a major roadway for many Mississauga residents who traverse to and from work every day and reducing the amount of traffic would undeniably lead to a huge increase in other main road arteries. Our city depends on prompt supply chain deliveries and implementing this severe traffic reduction on Bloor (to appease  0.3% of the population) who do not even live on Bloor is wrong!!\nI applaud Premier Ford and his government for having the courage and strength to reverse a decision (with Bill 212) that a majority of people who live in large urban centres do not support in adding bike lanes from a financial and economic standpoint as it adds more pollution to idling traffic and disturbs the natural traffic flow. I agree there are city streets where adding bike lanes may be the right thing, but adding these lanes on Bloor Street (from Etobicoke Creek to Central Parkway, East) is wrong.\nThank you for giving us this chance to voice our opinion on something that will negatively affect the lives of tens of thousands of Mississauga residents and those in other large urban centres. I also welcome any request for additional information regarding this post.\n"

It's certainly not the result of decreasing public transit reliability, baffling prioritization of on-street parking on major arteries, and shortsighted planning at all levels of government in managing our increasing urban population. This is a Toronto problem and one that we're finally able to address with a sensible municipal government that doesn't sell out to the highest bidder.\nPun intended, stay in your lane, Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "This government should absolutely not move forward with this bill until it has provided thorough evidence that this will, in fact, reduce gridlock, motor vehicle deaths, sustainability etc. Even then, that would be a huge waste of time and resources since a plethora of studies already exists proving that removing bike lanes would do the opposite. More importantly, the government should absolutely not be interfering with municipal decisions on this level. This will create MORE red tape, something this government seems to pride itself on cutting.\nSeeing as how this government likes to operate based on anecdotes, I will also provide anecdotal evidence from my own life. This year alone at least three of my friends have been struck by vehicles while on their bicycles, most of which happened along the corridors the government is suggesting be removed. These are routes that cannot be easily substituted by \"side street\" routes (take pretty much any section of Bloor street for example) and will continue to be used by bicycles after the removal of protected lanes.\nOf course, I do not support any government that introduces legislation that is not rooted in evidence. Something that this government has showcased time and time again.\nLet's save money. Let's protect our vulnerable road users. Let's ensure we are handing down a cleaner environment to the next generation. Let's follow the science and studies that many have already put effort into.\n"

This CBC article from this year goes into all the benefits of bike lanes, including easing, not increasing, congestion plus benefits to do with emissions and climate change.\nBut also, whether they *sometimes* \u201cslightly\u201d (from the city's own research; and this is comparing to traffic data during the pandemic, when people were out less) increase wait times isn't even the right question.\nThe bike lanes are there to make cycling safer, period.\nWe should want fewer people to die, period.\nAnd, the world can't support this many people driving. It's utter madness, to constantly see one single person in a 4000 lb vehicle, taking up that much space. To reduce traffic, for congestion and environmental reasons, you need to give people other options.\nLet's be clear--this will mean more people die. And traffic in Toronto will remain terrible.\nDoug Ford doesn't care about that, though, and he certainly doesn't care about people or the environment--he just hates Toronto and won't support the public transport or any other means that would actually help ease congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is a backwards move. Focusing on car-centric city design by adding more lanes for cars is not a sustainable transit solution.\nFocusing on cars is a backwards step in attempts to address climate change as methods such as public transit and bicycles can get more people around with less emissions.\nIn terms of congestion, persons in cars take up a much larger footprint than an equivalent number of persons in public transit or bicycles. So having more cars results in a greater footprint with worse congestion.\nFocusing on cars also disenfranchises portions of our population who may not be able to use cars. For example, people who may not be able to afford cars of their own may not be able to get around without public transit or bicycles. Or people who have disabilities requiring them to use public transit.\nIn any case, trying to add more car lanes is a backwards step for our society. And removing bike lanes to facilitate the addition of more car lanes is an even larger step backwards. And to waste taxpayer money performing this is even worse.\n"

        "comment": "I completely agree with this. The decision-makers at Toronto City Hall need more oversight. Many people are losing valuable family time due to policies that seem to cater to a specific agenda.\nThe focus on accommodating a small number of bicycle commuters has led to the removal of parking spaces and reduced road access for those living outside the city center. This policy appears to be highly detrimental, offering minimal benefits to the majority of taxpayers.\nIt\u2019s likely that a vast majority of the population, around 98%, only use bicycles occasionally during pleasant weather. Additionally, about 75% of the city\u2019s residents may not be physically fit enough to use bicycles regularly. As a result, these policies have significantly increased commute times for suburban residents.\nThe often crazy limitations placed on arterial roads have had many seriously detrimental effects.\nExtended Delivery Times: The congestion can lead to longer delivery times, requiring more trucks and drivers to maintain the same level of service. This increases operational costs for businesses.\nHigher Costs: The additional expenses from extended delivery times and increased fuel consumption c inflates the cost of goods, impacting both businesses and consumers\nIncreased Pollution: More vehicles on the road for longer periods contribute to higher emissions, worsening air quality and potentially leading to health-related costs1.\nReduced Customer Access: Limited parking and increased traffic can deter customers from visiting certain areas, negatively affecting local businesses\nThese factors highlight the need for a balanced approach to urban planning that considers the diverse needs of all city residents and businesses. None of this has been considered by the current and past councils.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m submitting this comment in strong opposition to this proposal. I\u2019m appalled and shocked that the provincial government would propose legislation that so blatantly contradicts the strong body of urban planning and urban development research, which clearly demonstrates that reducing alternative means of transportation actually worsens road congestion.\nI live in downtown Toronto and cycle almost daily. I cycle for at least ten months of the year, and more if the roads are dry, as was the case during the winter of 2024. Cycling is by far the most efficient way for me to get around my city, saving me countless hours per year that would otherwise be spent in a car or on public transportation. It has the added benefits of being highly cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and healthy. Incorporating cycling into my routine has transformed my financial, physical, and mental health. However, it is also accompanied by significant risks, due to the inconsistent biking infrastructure across the city. I attempt to avoid roads without bike lanes as much as possible because of the clear safety risks this poses, as exemplified by the multiple cyclists that have died in Toronto due to motor vehicle operations this year, as well as by my daily experiences of having near-misses with motor vehicles on roads that lack protected bike lanes. The well-designed bike lanes on major roads in Toronto such as Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street have directly benefitted my commuting experience within my city. They have also directly benefited non-cyclists, as evidenced by a research study which found that businesses along Bloor Street profited from the addition of the Bloor Street bike lanes. As major construction projects continue across the city, cars are being diverted onto side streets, and adding bikes into that traffic will further detract from the safety and quality of life of the residents of these areas.\nIn recent years, as biking infrastructure has improved, more and more Torontonians are choosing to cycle. This has eliminating thousands of car trips that would have otherwise taken place. Removing bike lanes within Toronto, in contrast, will force many Torontonians to abandon cycling, resulting in even worse car traffic within the city, and even more pressure on the TTC, which is already struggling to provide efficient and regular service to the city\u2019s growing population. As the city continues to densify, with new condominium buildings being built on virtually every corner, it is becoming increasingly urgent to provide as many transportation options as possible. Furthermore, new condo buildings often replace surface-level parking lots, meaning that even if bike lanes are replaced with car lanes, there will be less spaces for drivers to park their cars, which will just result in even more traffic.\nIn recent years Ontarians across the province have been struggling to cope with inflation and reduced affordability. Many marginalized individuals cannot afford a car and/or cannot drive, and cannot afford to live in areas connected to public transportation. Cycling is an affordable and accessible way for such people to move around. By reducing safe biking infrastructure, the provincial government will continue to place these people, who are already experiencing threats to their health and safety due to wealth inequity, in even more risk.\nThe government claims that this proposed bill is meant to reduce traffic. However, the obvious negative consequences that this will have for Ontarios, as well as the body of professional research which proves that these measures will actually have the opposite effect, make it clear that this bill is actually a poorly thought out and irresponsible attempt to gain voting popularity, through means that will undoubtedly actually reduce the quality of life, health, and safety of Ontarians. It is shocking that this bill has even been proposed, and has confirmed that this government will never have my support or respect. I urge the provincial government to reject this proposal and to take obvious steps to do their job, that being to act in the good of the province.\n"
