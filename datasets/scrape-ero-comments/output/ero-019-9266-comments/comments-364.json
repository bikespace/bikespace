        "comment": "I do not think it is appropriate for the provincial government to impose its will this much on a municipality. While municipalities are creatures of the province per Ontario's Planning Act, this seems like an overreach and abuse of power. Moreover, there is the question of will this reduce congestion? OPPI begs to differ. I would like to remind everyone about induced demand, adding an extra lane is not going to solve traffic congestion. Additionally this is just further subsidizing cars while they are important and heavily used relied on, I have to wonder how much do we need to prop up this old and unsustainable system (The provincial government already is already cutting around legislature to speed up highway 413). Anyways, I believe this government should not meddle this much into the affairs of Toronto and also reduce its bias towards cars and make infrastructure improvements towards other transit options into the future. Cars will not keep pace with growing a city, this likely will just lead to more congestion and pollution, bike lanes give other options reducing the need for short car trips.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a deplorable use of our taxpayer dollars. The bike lanes have been developed and just barely been put to use and removing them will cost too much extra money and create more construction which is already a major issue hindering the traffic in key streets in Toronto. For new bike lanes, this bill will add to the cost of all future constructions which will make living even more expensive for people.\nFurthermore, there is more evidence backing bike lanes over time will reduce congestion and going through this bill, inadvertently causes more congestion.\nRather than spending our money to rip up or restrict bike lanes, we should instead be helping to fund construction throughout the city to speed up the work being done to our streets. I can think of countless examples that would help such as speeding up the repairs to the Spadina streetcar line and the Gardiner.\nI want to reduce gridlock and save time, but this bill will accomplish neither and will actually increase gridlock, waste time and cost more money.\n"

        "comment": "This is entirely an act of provincial overreach. Municipalities have a better idea of their local transit requirements and needs than a partisan at the behest of a government that prizes car traffic above all else.\nThe overall bill is clearly a thin ruse to spite Toronto residents who live in the central areas of the city for the meagre benefit of suburbanites who complain about the traffic when they drive downtown once a year to see the Jays or the Leafs, i.e., spiting non-Ford voters and pandering to Ford voters.\nBesides which, the bike lanes on Bloor and other streets didn't remove a lane of traffic; they removed a lane that was always filled with parked cars and only left enough space for bikes anyway (except at greater risk of getting doored).\nThis bill will achieve nothing to alleviate gridlock; people need to realise that driving in the city is simply not a good idea regardless of the number of lanes. Take the GO, take the TTC, make your own lives easier.\n"

This is a silly knee jerk decision taken by politicians to garner short term support instead of doing something positive for the city.\n2. Waste of tax dollars. We have the bike lanes built already, find alternatives to reduce traffic now. Will each government keep changing decisions from the older government, add lanes remove lanes, add lanes again, remove them again. Do something productive with your powers.\n3. Provincial overreach. Such decisions should be taken by the city and the city alone. Doug Ford is not the mayor of Toronto and should stay in his lane.\nI hope the province sees sense and does not pass this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Re: Proposed Removal of Bike Lanes on Major Toronto Arterial Roads\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove bike lanes from Yonge Street, Bloor Street, and University Avenue in favor of additional car lanes. As a Toronto resident who regularly uses multiple forms of transportation \u2013 including driving, cycling, and public transit \u2013 I believe this proposal would be a significant step backward for our city's transportation infrastructure and quality of life.\nThe bike lanes on these major arteries have become vital corridors for safe, sustainable urban transportation. Speaking from personal experience, these protected lanes have allowed me to cycle safely with my children, introducing them to an environmentally friendly and healthy mode of transportation that will shape their relationship with our city for years to come. The security provided by dedicated bike lanes has made it possible for families like mine to choose cycling for both recreation and practical transportation.\nWhile I understand the frustration of traffic congestion \u2013 as someone who also commutes by car \u2013 removing bike lanes is a short-sighted solution that fails to address the root causes of our transportation challenges. Studies consistently show that adding car lanes provides only temporary relief from congestion due to induced demand, while removing bike infrastructure discourages sustainable transportation alternatives and increases safety risks for cyclists.\nInstead of dismantling our progress toward a more sustainable city, I urge you to consider:\n1. Expanding and improving our subway system to provide more efficient mass transit options\n2. Optimizing bus routes to better serve our communities, and considering replacement of some streetcar routes with more efficient bus alternatives\n3. Maintaining and enhancing our bike lane network to encourage active transportation\n4. Implementing smart traffic management systems to improve flow on existing car lanes\n5. Using traffic police to guide vehicles at the busiest intersections at the busiest times of day\nThe current bike lanes represent more than just painted lines on pavement \u2013 they represent our city's commitment to sustainable urban development, public health, and environmental responsibility. Their removal would send a troubling message about Toronto's priorities and vision for the future.\nAs our city grows, we need to embrace solutions that move more people more efficiently while reducing our environmental impact. Removing bike lanes to add car capacity is the opposite of what a forward-thinking city should do. We must instead focus on creating a transportation network that serves all citizens, whether they choose to walk, cycle, drive, or use public transit.\nThe success of these bike lanes has been demonstrated by their regular use by cyclists of all ages and abilities. They have become an integral part of many Torontonians' daily routines, providing safe passage for commuters, families, and recreational cyclists alike. Their removal would force many cyclists back into unsafe conditions or onto sidewalks, creating new problems while solving none.\nI strongly urge you to reject this proposal and instead focus on comprehensive solutions that enhance, rather than reduce, transportation choices for all Toronto residents. Let's continue building a city that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and diverse transportation options for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the removal of bike lanes in Toronto main streets namely Bloor, Yonge and Avenue road. One cyclist was killed on Bloor at Avenue Rd this August because the bike lane was blocked by a construction vehicle. And in April  a food delivery man on a bike was killed on Avenue Rd in the Yorkville area by a construction truck. These are preventable tragic deaths. I personally know someone who was hit by a SUV on Bayview Ave Toronto which has no bike lanes. She had serious injuries requiring surgery and was off work for more than a month.\nBike lanes save lives and should be expanded rather than removed. Montreal gets a lot more snow than Toronto and has 600km of bike lanes.  Many cities in Europe have bike lanes and they work very well. (see link)  Premier Ford is misguided and this is not even his jurisdiction. If he wants to reduce gridlock he should change the regulations that allow construction trucks to obstruct roads by requiring construction companies to have an area set back from the street for their vehicles. He can also  help complete the Eglinton metrolinx LRT  and improve public transportation between the suburbs and downtown Toronto so fewer people will need to drive cars downtown.\nFurthermore, there is no need to pave the greenbelt for another highway when the 407 is underutilized due to the exorbitant fees charged by the current owner, a private company. It was  a huge mistake made by a previous Conservative government when they sold it to a private company. Ford should explore other options. Many people have submitted good ideas showing that the new 413 highway is not necessary, but Ford has bulldozed it through without proper environmental assessment.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for letting me comment.\nI would like to raise my concern with this bill. My main issue is this bill impairs municipal governments ability to make good decisions based on the reasonable information they have and properly represent the people who voted for them.\nMy understanding is that we have a municipal government to deal with smaller scale issues (for instance a bike lane) and a provincial government to deal with items such as healthcare, education and transportation between cities. The advantage of this approach is that people can be represented at a local level for local issues.\nThis bill removes this, and attempts to centralize what is otherwise a large number of local issues to a large bureaucracy which is not close to the actual problems being solved. In my experience this generally leads to inefficient decisions made by people who don't understand the problem they are trying to solve. This approach also makes municipal elections purposeless.\nI would ask that you reconsider, having worked at large organizations, this approach to governance is neither efficient nor leads to optimal results. It costs more, and takes away decision making from smart individuals close to the ground who are more directly accountable to the people they represent.\n"

        "comment": "I'm confused as to the reasoning behind this. If people on the bikes that use bike lanes don't have lanes to use, wouldn't that encourage them to drive more which would INCREASE gridlock. Bikes are still smaller than cars, yes?\nAnd for a province to make these decisions for cities which have elected management is absolutely not reasonable. There's a reason cities have people running them. They know the pulse of the city and can track city flow much more effectively than a province which then has to keep track of all the cities in said province. The municipal level of government can receive input and feedback from ALL those who live in said city much more effectively than the province can.\nThis strategy seems rife with ulterior motive. Can we please remove the games - don't use important issues like bike lanes as pawns to achieve unrelated ends.\nPlease respect and act in the needs of everyone - cyclists and pedestrians included, not just us drivers, by ensuring that municipal levels of government can continue to address the needs of city residents in an efficient manner without provincial interference.\nSigned,\nA Toronto driver and pedestrian\n"

Bravo Premier Ford for taking one of the needed steps to reel in contorted city policies which have caused an increase in traffic congestion downtown.\nI frequently witness the ridiculous non-moving lineup of cars up and down Blue Jays Way stretching from Front Street to Queen street during rush hour and event days regularly ever since 2 lanes of traffic were removed.  All across the city, one can count on one hand the number of bikers that use the bike lanes while cars sit stalled in congestion burning valuable energy.\nToronto seems to be missing a department of transportation which helps the city to optimize all modes of transport, but instead installed a department of bike lanes or transit only lanes.\nFor perspective, it is ridiculous to see the city congestion worse today, compared to pre-pandemic shutdown when every working person had to be in the office 5 days a week!  There is no clearer example of failed policies than to have worse congestion when there is comparatively less car traffic downtown today due to work from home policies.\nThe city leadership showed their dishonest hand by reducing lanes during the covid shutdown instead of taking the opportunity of low traffic period to improve road infrastructure!  Was our city leadership expecting business in the city to decrease from their own destructive policies?!\nBicycles are allowed to ride on roads to begin with.  The city only needs to do an education campaign or post road signs telling drivers and bikers to share the road!!\nIf the city admits that traffic congestion costs us $11B in lost productivity, the leadership is incompetent or guilty of maladministration!!\nDecision making at city hall is clearly not data driven, and mostly activist driven.  Please return sanity to city planning!\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "I have mainly two opinions on this proposal. First, I think it is more important to think of bikers safety more than motor vehicle drivers time and economic impact. By removing the existing lanes, bikers may need to take different paths that would have no bicycle lanes or not suitable to drive bikes on. Ontario is looking at building a new bike lane to alternate lanes that would be removed if the proposal were to be approved. I would be concerned that this would make it inconvenient for bikers to commute, and I think it is important to make sure this removal of the existing bicycle lanes would not be disadvantageous on bikers.\nAlso, by building a convenient faster way to transport with cars would encouraging people to drive motor vehicles which transmit a lot of greenhouse gases. This is the opposite of what we want to do, nowadays that people and animals are suffering with climate change. I think building this highway could discourage people to choose public transportation or taking a bicycle. With the money and time spending on building a highway, I think it is more wise to invest in public transportation, such as introducing bullet trains to connect cities. This way, we could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation would be way quicker than driving vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "This attack on bike lanes and particularly the proposal to remove bike lanes from Toronto streets is not supported by evidence (both local and international) of value to the environment, to enhanced mobility goals for all road users, to health and safety benefits for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers and to the economic benefits of enhancing the business environment along streets in the city core.\nThe removal and restriction of bike lanes does not address the two primary causes of congestion for vehicle drivers:\n1.Too many vehicles in the core and too few alternatives to replace private vehicles, (particularly single occupant vehicle) - particularly the lack of adequate and comfortable public transit and transit priority routes to move people through the core,\n2, The congestive effect of allowing developers and infrastructure projects to occupy vehicle, bike and pedestrian lanes.  Cities such as Tokyo, for example, require all construction and staging, including high rise construction on tight lots, to be conducted within the property line of the development - with sidewalk and lanes closures only allowed for short periods (hours) and usually at night. The province should be seriously considering regulating the construction industry to prevent the far more disruptive practice/entitlement that has clogged Toronto streets.\nRemoval and restriction of bike lanes will reverse the kind of successful rebalancing of road space for all users and all taxpayers and have detrimental effects on the safety of both cyclists and pedestrians.\nA serious study of strategies to improve overall mobility along with a commitment to implement strategies that have demonstrated effectiveness should be leading this initiative.\nThe proposed regulation should be shelved until a thorough study, informed by independent transportation expertise and input from municipalities and public stakeholders.\nFinally this is not the kind of planner that should be undertaken by the province. There is a reason why these types of planning decisions are normally left to Municipalities. They are in the best position to understand and balance the needs of their residents. It is wasteful and wrongheaded for the province to think it can effectively step into that role.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. I urge the government to look at data and fact instead of arbitrary opinions when making decisions for our city and province. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\nYour government will lose my vote if this bill goes passes.\nThank you\nMia\n"
