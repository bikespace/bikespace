        "comment": "This is one of the worst decisions made by the Ford government and is a concerning attempt by the province to bully municipalities where they do not have support. This will make cycling more dangerous in Toronto, encouraging people to drive and increasing traffic. Not to mention the public money required to remove already existing infrastructure. Incredibly embarassing.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nAs a Canadian and home owner in Toronto, I have serious concerns about Exempting Building 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act and the removal and strict limiting and regulation of bike lanes. Prioritizing personal cars is not scalable, sustainable, or good for the public health, and is not the right path forward for a city of this size, and\nExempting Building 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act poses significant risks. It can lead to adverse environmental effects, including habitat destruction, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Public health risks may go unchecked, affecting nearby communities. The exemption reduces public participation and transparency in decision-making processes, limiting community input and scrutiny. It can undermine the rights and interests of Indigenous communities, as their concerns and traditional lands may not be adequately considered. Additionally, cumulative environmental impacts may not be accounted for, leading to long-term degradation of the environment. Potential negative impacts on local economies, such as tourism and agriculture, may not be properly evaluated and mitigated. Overall, exemptions compromise environmental protection, public health, and community involvement, leading to potentially irreversible damage.\nRemoving bike lanes is a bad idea for several reasons. Bike lanes provide a safe space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and conflicts with motor vehicles. They encourage cycling as an alternative mode of transportation, helping to reduce traffic congestion. Promoting cycling over driving decreases air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier environment. Cycling promotes physical activity, improving public health and reducing healthcare costs. Bike lanes can boost local economies by increasing foot traffic to businesses and reducing transportation costs for residents. They make cities more accessible to a diverse range of people, including those who cannot afford a car. Integrating bike lanes into urban planning supports sustainable and resilient city development. Overall, bike lanes are essential for creating safer, healthier, and more sustainable urban environments.\nWe should be using data and consideration of future generations to create good policy, not anecdotes. Sustainable, scalable, and safe modes of transportation should be prioritized, like walking, public transit, and biking - not personal vehicles.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "If cyclists lost their lanes and became drivers, would this make traffic better or worse? Even if cyclists do not become drivers, studies have already shown that bike lanes do not add to traffic. The contentions in this bill are unsubstantiated and the whole thing is frankly absurd. On the other hand, bike lanes save lives. As a cyclist who was seriously injured by a motor vehicle, I have first hand experience in how dangerous roads without bike lanes can be. The mark of developed cities is less cars, not more cars. Leave the bike lanes alone. To help the 905, invest in public transit.\n"

Are the 401 or the DVP gridlock free?\nMore bike lanes mean less cars. Less unhealthy, sedentary people adding cost to our healthcare system. Less fatalities. Toronto has studies the impact of bike lanes on travel time. Let's be real about the data.\nRun the province. Fix healthcare. Fix housing. Fix education. Stop trying to be the mayor of Toronto. Hands off bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As Ontario works to effectively increase its density in metropolitan areas, it's necessary that infrastructure is maximized for all road users. Bike lanes not only facilitate road access to more users, minimizing gridlock and travel times for many, but prevent serious accidents caused by motorists. As someone who relies on cycling in the city but also has extensive experience driving a car in the Riverdale area, I have experienced firsthand how the Danforth/Bloor bikelanes have improved my experience both as a cyclist and a motorist. As a cyclist, I have the space I require to safely move through dense areas, and am more confident that I will make it to my destination safely. As a motorist driving through streets with bike lanes, I don't need to worry about sharing confined lanes with cyclists who are required to weave in and out alongside parked cars, ultimately slowing things down further and heightening the stress of everyones journey.\nThe cyclists who rely on this mode of transportation are not going anywhere, so removing bike lanes will only increase rates of accidents and preventable deaths. Making space for more cars will not minimize traffic. However, maintaining and expanding upon bike lane networks will improve the mobility & health for individuals and communities alike.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University is an expensive decision that will make downtown traffic exponentially worse for over a year during construction, and deliver no benefits to drivers in the long term.\nThe city has found it would cost nearly $50 million to remove these bike lanes and the construction to re-align the streets would take nearly a year. During this year there would be reduced lanes, one way travel and entirely closed intersection. This is in addition to the 25 million dollars the city spent installing these lanes in the first place.\nClosing streets and reducing lanes for a year is bad for business. The city has found through careful study before and after bike lake instillation that bike lanes bring customers into businesses. Cars are large and visible and give the illusion of busy-ness, but they are only passing through. There are no impromptu stops. They do not pay for parking to grab a quick thing before continuing.\nToronto is a year round cycling city. The people here regularly observe \"The Coldest Day of the Year Ride\" where they gather simply to cycle in the cold.\nThis plan is chaos for businesses on these streets, emergency vehicles and commuters.\nTo what end? the Bloor lanes alone move 8000 commuters a day. What is the goal? Do you want these cyclists to get into cars and contribute further to gridlock? Or is the plan that these bikes would be mixed dangerously in traffic and hold up cars behind them anyway? Which of these does the Ford regime think is the better situation?\nMoving people downtown is a simple problem of geometry. Private vehicles are large, difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and generally carry a single person. Bikes are small and well adapted for city streets.\nThis bill is driven by ideology instead of facts. It is the prioritisation of feelings over concrete data about how the world actual works. It is designed to make traffic in Toronto slower, dirtier, more expensive, and more dangerous.\n"

The solution to reducing gridlock is less cars on the road, which is solved by both a higher number of people cycling, and primarily, public transit infrastructure. The ELRT, Ontario Line\u2026 transit routes that have their own uninterrupted paths of travel, separate from vehicular lanes. Work on figuring out why the ELRT isn\u2019t open before throwing all of our tax money into this stupid decision that frankly, will not fix a single traffic issue.\n"

Traffic is ridiculous already, and when it takes me an hour to get to the 401 I am so defeated and stressed out it negatively impacts my home life.\nMoving into the city is also not possible. I need a better commute. I have a work vehicle with tools and equipment to help keep the lights on in the city. Reducing driving lanes does not make people ride bikes. It reduces the efficiency of getting anything accomplished.  .\n"

Reducing bike lanes does not help anyone, it is more dangerous to bike rider, and will not make commuting any easier or efficient - that\u2019s just common sense.  The real issue of the bill is about expropriating land, government needs to stop treating the people whom they are supposed to represent as dumb. Reducing environmental studies will not help anyone besides big business.  Simply put damaging fragile environment will damage the ecosystem, damage farm land and effect our food supply which will impact everyone including politicians. That\u2019s common sense.

        "comment": "Re Bill 212:  Given the current Ontario government often references their actions as \"for the people\", surely your goal is to move PEOPLE, not just cars?  No evidence anywhere in the world shows that increasing car lanes in cities moves more PEOPLE.\nAround the world, in dense cities\u00a0like ours (London, New York, Paris, Vancouver, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, and many others), leaders are prioritizing the movement of as many\u00a0PEOPLE as possible by building more bike lanes, safe and\u00a0effective rapid transit, and reducing the number of cars on the road, so that those who want or need to use cars can do so with less congestion.\nThere are reams of data from around the world that support building bike infrastructure, and I have no doubt you have read it.  Bill 212 is politically motivated, not about congestion, and not visionary. If you proceed, we will become the laughingstock of forward-thinking governments and cities worldwide, as they understand that the future of the efficient, safe and pleasurable movement of people in cities depends on various transportation options and that prioritizing cars in large cities does not work.\nLooking back on your careers in years to come, wouldn't you rather be applauded for being a visionary government to make our city truly world-class than bending to voters for a short-term and ill-fated decision to take our city backwards?\nStop your jurisdictional overreach and allow the professionals (City of Toronto planners, Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council) to make decisions on how best to move people through Toronto. Please repeal Bill 212.\nFor what it's worth, as this bill is clearly designed for votes, I am a 60-year-old female professional high-income earner who cycles, walks, takes public transit, and drives in the city. And this bill certainly doesn't buy my vote.\n"

If anything, I would prefer an emphasis on adding turning lanes for cars rather than focusing on whether or not a lane is being removed.\nUnimpressed with the focus on removing infrastructure (bike lanes), especially without proper measurement of impact on traffic or cost.\nEducation and healthcare are my priorities from what the province is supposed to be doing. Please focus on our schools and healthcare, this focus on bike lanes is distracting and does a disservice to the people of Ontario who rely on the provincial government to do their job, especially around education and healthcare.\n"
