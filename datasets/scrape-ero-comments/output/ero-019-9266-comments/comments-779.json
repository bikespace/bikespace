        "comment": "It has been shown time and time again that simply adding lanes does not in any way alleviate traffic in already congested areas. In fact, many cities in the US are undergoing a \"de-highway\" movement, where they are consciously restricting the amount of motor traffic traveling through their city cores. For the Ontario government to propose such a backwards act that hinders the development of safe and environmentally friendly bike infrastructure, and further wastes time *removing* existing bike lanes, is utterly ridiculous.\nIf the government has time, why not consider removing street parking in favour of multi-storey parking garages? Or retrofitting existing parking places with solar panels to make a push for green energy? Or speeding up the construction and expansion of transit networks?\n"

If everyone I saw on a bike was in a car instead, the road would have been full and my hand may not have survived. Bike lanes are a matter or safety and health for EVERYONE, not just cyclists, including those who need to be in a car.\n"

        "comment": "I moved to Canada in 1998 from The Netherlands. As you are aware, it's a strong cycling society there. The cycling infrastructure in the Netherlands started to improve in the 70's as lots of deathly accident occurred. These were caused by an increase of cars, an underdeveloped cycling infrastructure while having a lot of cyclists. They tackled the issue then to improve the safety for cyclists and respect the cycling commuters! We are talking 50 years ago!!! Lots has changed in the cycling infrastructure there since then, in a very positive way.\nIn the last 20 years I have seen a very positive development in the cycling infrastructure in Ottawa. Not perfect, but a lot of hard and dedicated work has been done. Something I am proud of and appreciate the immense efforts.\nEspecially in times where we need to reduce the use of cars to reduce carbon emissions, we should encourage people to cycle in a safe environment. This will also have a long term effect for peoples fitness by improving peoples health and might very well reduce the need for expensive medical care.\nBill 212 comes as a shock. It is taking many steps backward. It's incomprehensible and another step towards creating an unwelcome increasing car using society. It's showing a totally wrong example how we should fully focus on improving our environment and continue to guarantee safety for cyclists. Pushing this bill is a disdain to the cycling community in Ontario. This includes cycling commuters and  recreational cyclists. It's shameful and extremely disappointing and will create more traffic victims.\nI appreciate your time.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not only a disgusting attack on sustainable architecture that is necessary for the city of Toronto, but also an underhanded attempt to sneak legislation past the public while using political distraction tactics.\nSchedule 1 allows for the expropriation of property for the purposes of expanding broadband connections. While on the surface the expansion of broadband is necessary, this will negatively affect Ontarians. The Provincial government should seek respectful alternatives to this, such as mediated compensation for use of or destruction of property.\nSchedule 2 \"3 (1)  Despite subsection 39 (3) of the Expropriations Act, a registered owner may not apply under that provision for an adjustment of the date of possession specified in a notice of possession if the Minister expropriated the land under the Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nIn other words, they can seize your property and you cannot apply for an extension, interesting to note that utility companies are given more rights in this section than citizens.\nSchedule 3, Section 2 exempts not only highway 413 from environmental assessment, but also further developments within the GTA West corridor. This will cause incalculable damage to the environment in this region, destroying the collective property of the peoples of Ontario.\nSchedule 4 involves blatant provincial overreach into municipal affairs in an attack on non car dependent commuters. This will cost the tax-payers massive amounts of money to remove infrastructure that we have already paid for and installed. The Premier should remind himself that he is not the Mayor and, just as he so often as he chastises the federal government, he should remember to \"stay in his lane.\"\nThe Premier and his government should focus on assisting the municipal government in completing existing public infrastructure projects that WILL save Torontonians and Ontarians time and reduce gridlock. These projects are the Ontario line, expansion of the TTC, GO rail service, and the preservation and expansion of bike lanes.\nOne final comment, the Premier and his government should make a concerted effort to understand the concept of induced demand.\n"

It is a grey, drizzly day, but there were cyclists out for a ride, commuters (judging by the clothing), shoppers going to the stores along Bloor Street.   Please do not remove the bike lanes just as they are getting more and more popular, known, trusted and used.  As I walked home from Bloor Street, the only congestion I see and danger I feel is from cars.   Drivers are speeding through the neighbourhood, are careless about coming to a full stop at stop signs and come too close for comfort when passing pedestrians.\nI live in the Sunnylea neighbourhood.   From comments I see on Facebook, some of my neighbours do not want bike lanes wherever they are (\u201cI don\u2019t want a bike lane on my street\u201d).    This is not reasonable in the shared space of our city.\nI am not sure where the money is coming from to pay for the potential removal.  We need to finish the Eglinton crosstown, maintain and improve the TTC and support hospitals and schools.   Cancel the billions budgeted for the 413 and spend the money where there are so many people stuck in traffic crossing the city along the 401.   Lots of congestion and not a bike in sight.\nA minute or two or three in our day is a small price to pay for the the safety and convenience of bike lanes where we need them to get people out of their cars\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is an act that will further increase car usage, which in turn will create more gridlock. This will have a negative effect on the environment, on cyclists, and on transit takers (streetcars are constantly held up by cars). Given the rising cost of living in Ontario and Toronto, removal of bike lanes will also disproportionately affect those who are unable to afford a car and must rely on alternative transit methods to get around town. It is completely absurd that the Provincial government is choosing to ignore the needs of Torontonians and the advice of experts, who are advocating for bike lanes. Doug Ford has a duty to protect and promote the well beings of ALL Ontarians, not his class of elites. Rather than waste time, money, and resources on this regressive and dangerous policy; his party should focus on completing projects like the Eglington LRT and boosting the efficiency of the TTC. Finally, should this bill be successful, it\u2019s negative effects will not simply be contained to Toronto. How can any city or municipality choose to invest in bike lanes when we have a Provincial government that is willing to rip them up at whim? How many cyclists have to risk their lives in Toronto so that a select number of folks save a couple minutes of time on their commute?\n"

        "comment": "We live just south of Bloor off Prince Edward Drive.  Driving to Bloor West Village now takes three times longer since the bike lanes went in and a car lane was removed.\nIts particularly bad at South Kingsway/Jane/Bloor intersection.  That is because there is only one lane on Bloor for cars coming up on South Kingsway to get onto Jane which now cause gridlock while on Bloor blocking eastbound traffic continuing on Bloor. While waiting there (sometimes for ten light changes) the pollution from idling cars is intense and this cannot be good for the very few cyclists.\nTrying to turn onto Bloor from a side street is terrifying as you cannot see the traffic on Bloor without blocking the bike lane (due to the parked cars beyond) and then the cyclists start banging on your car.\nThe poles and other infrastructure is ugly and ruins the look of Bloor West Village and The Kingsway shopping districts.  Not good for tourism in the BIA's.\nWe are not against cycle paths but not on a major arterial road.  Maybe a path can be run near the subway right-of way.  This would require purchasing some land from property owners and new cycling bridges across the two ravines in the west end.  Not cheap, but safer for cyclist and easing the gridlock.\n"

Removing those lanes will put my life and the lives of thousands of Canadian citizens in danger, as simple as it is. Not to speak about the environmental and economic impact of removing those lanes. By removing the bike lanes, the government is encouraging the use of cars, resulting in more congested streets and multiple disadvantages in terms of time and pollution (both environmental and sound). Also, the bill states that \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new and existing cycling lanes.\" I would like to know what that means. To me, there has been no research or idea of the real environmental implications. Again, removing bike lanes from the city will put in danger the lives of hundreds and thousands of Canadians.\n"

It's absurd to make bike lanes harder to build, especially when they replace car lanes that were just being used for parking. At least bikes keep people moving!

        "comment": "Traffic congestion is experienced throughout Toronto due to construction & parked cars, whether there are bike lanes or not.  The City of Toronto spent a great deal of money to make Bloor St. safer for pedestrians & cyclists by widening the sidewalk & putting in separate bike lanes. It also made the area more attractive for business.  Advocates for ripping out the cycle lanes, should take the short walk along Bloor from Palmerston to Spadina.   The cycle lanes are only one metre wide, so removing them would not even add one car lane.  Either the parking lanes have to be removed or the sidewalk has to be narrowed (which is not feasible in some locations) or both. The latter would require relocation of the light poles, traffic light standards & many other amenities & the complete removal of trees & concrete flower beds.  So the $248 million for such reconstruction might even be exceeded.  I recently sat at Walmer & Bloor, waiting for a friend between 5:30 & 6:00 p.m. I noted that there was a flood of bicycles, often passing slower cyclists heading west - far more than the cars!  If the cycle lanes are removed, where will these cyclists go?  Very few of them will go to the side streets for the same reason that they don't go there now.  The side streets are short & usually pour out onto major streets such as Spadina & Avenue Road. Cyclists will be forced to mix with the car & truck traffic. To waste so much money on a project that will cost limbs & lives is a crass & immoral political act.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212's proposal to remove bike lanes along major, well-used corridors in Toronto, as well as to limit or prevent the growth of cycling networks across the province, stands counter to the provincial government's promise to make life more affordable for Ontarians. Cycling is an affordable and quick way to travel, and removing these direct cycling corridors will force travellers to take longer routes or switch to slower and more expensive modes of travel. Furthermore, the costs borne by municipalities or the province to remove existing bike lanes, or adjust plans and designs for roads with bike lanes, will inevitably be passed on to residents of the province in the form of higher taxes. Changes to cycling infrastructure and plans across Ontario will hurt Ontarians' wallets, not to mention present safety risks to any cyclists who continue to ride without adequate, safe infrastructure.\n"

The bike lanes that have been added to the city have allowed for day-to-day and occasional biking to flourish in the city.\nRemoving these lanes will only cost taxpayers more money, for less convenience, and more detriment to the environment. It is absurd the level of government overreach at play here that is even attempting to have a say on how Torontonians prefer to commute. The TTC needs investment, pedestrian infrastructure needs investment \u2014 not cars. We need more bike lanes, not less. Cities that do away with pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure are inefficient cities that are incapable of dealing with massive population growth over the years.\nI urge the province to divest this allotted funding into the TTC so that our public transit returns to being one of the best in the world, rather an an embarrassing system of two underground tunnels. And no, I don\u2019t mean the Ontario Line.\nDoug Ford can take his head out of his rich friends\u2019\u2026 pockets, and focus on smart, innovative, efficient and world-class infrastructure. Keeping a focus on cars is so 2003.\nThank you,\nA very concerned citizen.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill, in particular the projected cost for an undesirable change. Cars are not an accessible or realistic option for many millennial/Gen Z Torontonians who cannot afford the cost of owning a car (ie. Price of the car, insurance, parking etc) along with the high expenses of living in the city. Removing existing bike lanes and creating more bureaucratic hurdles for the city to jump through in order to build new bike lanes will greatly impact my ability to get around the city safely, as well as many others like me. Investing in other means of transportation is so important for reducing gridlock in the city (ie. Consider the impact the go train has had on reducing car traffic). We must also consider the environmental impact of transit and bike lanes vs. the use of cars.  Replacing car use with bike use creates a greener city, and has great impacts on mental and physical health. The key to getting more people experiencing these benefits is to make bike travel safer and more accessible through bike lane infrastructure. We need to focus on the bigger picture of how we can create a more liveable city and province in the long term, and not simply how we can alleviate car traffic in the short term.\n"
