        "comment": "The only method which has been shown to be effective at reducing traffic congestion is by taking cars off the road. The most effective way to do so is by providing viable alternatives to driving cars. When we consider the past, present, and expected future rate of Toronto's population growth, there is no number of additional lanes which can reduce congestion, further emphasizing the need for viable alternatives to driving cars. Toronto has been doing a good job of investing in the TTC, making public transportation an increasingly viable option, especially once the Eglinton crosstown and Ontario line services open. I applaud the current Ontario government on its work in these projects, despite the delays.\nI do agree that the bike lanes are under-utilized, but this is because many of them remain unfinished and leave cyclist unprotected from dangerous car traffic. For bike lanes to be effective congestion-reduction measures, cyclists need to want to use them--that is, people need to feel comfortable and safe riding on them. Right now people do not feel safe on bike lanes and more cyclists are dying on Toronto roads than ever before. The city of Toronto has been making investments towards better and safer bike lanes by installing dutch-style bike lanes where cyclists are protected by parked cars and permanent barriers. The effectiveness of these changes can be seen in increasing use of the Toronto bike share.\nThe removal of the bike lanes that are only starting to show their value is a waste of taxpayer money, and only works to increase car traffic. This increase in traffic will due to the necessary construction for the removal of bike lanes and the demand induced by a lack of viable alternatives to driving. These problems are exacerbated by population growth.\nIf the province is concerned with car traffic in downtown Toronto, they should continue investing in viable alternatives to driving--including bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a municipal issue, not the province's business. People can participate in their local government to change bike lane policies. It is a gross overreach for the province to choose whose transportation abilities are prioritized, uniformly across Ontario. I cannot afford a car and it is ridiculous that those who are rich enough to drive are prioritized simply because they can afford to. I want to get to work without being run over. Please don't waste public money on adding extra red tape OR removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "1. Province should not decide what the municipalities do to handle local traffic. You already get your say on highways, which does NOT have bike lanes and yet still rated the worst congested road in the world.\n2. The province should not do petty politics & ignore actual evidences that bike lanes successfully relieved car lane traffic; while the previous removal attempt (Jarvis St) resulted in worse traffic.\n3. The province should note that bike lanes improved business on either side. Taking away bike lanes mean killing off the street merchants' 50% of their income, and does NOT benefit from side street bike traffic. Multiple BIAs had raised their support for the bike lanes.\n4. Most importantly, the province should let safety & science should be priority on road designs, not political opinions. Time and time again, studies after studies shown that bike lanes improved people's health & reduced traffic accidents, and it allow elderly citizens and children to bike when they cannot drive themselves. Health & wellbeing of it's children, elderly & everyone else should be the province's objective, not petty bike lane removals and hindering. There are multiple hospitals in favor of the bike lanes too.\nIt is hideous enough to hide the agenda behind \"reducing gridlock, saving your time\" when this action will only increase grid lock AND lost all of us more time.\nThis is a bill that directly harm citizens of Ontario, in legal sense & in physical sense. I will do all I can to make sure any MPP in favor of this bill will not be re-elected at the next election.\n"

        "comment": "I am a concerned citizen of the city of Toronto. Bike lane infrastructure is vital to the community and economic activity across the city. Biking provides positive health benefits for all participants, which has both immediate and long term action for population health. Additionally, the costs of implementation and subsequent removal costs of bike lanes should be considered, as this is not effective use of tax payer money. There is not adequate or substantial data showing the removal of these bike lanes will even create traffic relief. As a growing global economy, Ontario and Toronto have the opportunity to step up to the level of our global peers and promote liveable, healthy city centres, with a focus on pedestrian and cyclist access. Our bike lanes are something we should promote and be proud of when attracting human capital, investment etc. I urge the provincial government to reconsider its position on this issue.\n"

        "comment": "I believe that the true problem lies in a lack of reliable and well marketed public transit, people would not be so dependant on cars and streets would not be so full if the TTC ran reliably and quickly. Bike lanes are not the issue, there should be less cars on the road and more alternative forms of transport (and funding for them) around the city.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not the solution to massive congestion. It is a waste of city funds to pull up the existing bike lanes. Additions of more lanes in high traffic areas have been documented to be ineffective in reducing traffic, and actually only result in greater traffic and congestion (see uc davis article attached). Not to mention that the removal of bike lanes only serves to make this city that much more dangerous for cyclists to get around.\nThe only way for this to be a reasonable proposal is if altenative bike lanes are proposed and built before destroying existing lanes.\nOur values need to shift from a car centric way of thinking if we are every going to improve quality of life in Canada. Investing in bikes and alternative methods of transit to cars makes all our neighborhoods safer and reduces carbon emissions.\nI hope our representatives can think about the long term effects of their choices for all citizens. Not just the peers inside their own tax bracket.\n"

        "comment": "As a working parent I commute daily using bike lanes - this will absolutely destroy my ability to get to work in a safe and timely manner. All I want is to be able to get home safely to my family, but removing bike lanes will greatly jeopardize this. This is a city matter and should be decided by residents who use city streets, not mandated by the province. It is costly, studies show it won't reduce congestion, it will destroy infrastructure which citizens actively advocated for and will harm everyday working people like me the most. Please reconsider and let residents decide what works best for their neighborhoods based on data and the needs of residents.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern that the aspects of Bill 212 related to bike lanes go against the parts of Ministry of Transportation's Statement of Environmental Values related to active transportation and climate change.\nSpecifically, I am concerned that requiring municipalities to obtain approval to construct new bike lanes --- or keep recently-added ones --- where doing so would involve sacrificing a lane of vehicle traffic will have a significant chilling effect on climate-friendly active transportation projects. This is for two reasons: First, active transportation, including cycling, is most practical for short trips in highly developed areas where destinations such as shops, restaurants, and homes are closely spaced. Unfortunately, these dense areas are places where bike lanes would be most difficult to install without removing existing lanes of motor vehicle traffic. As a result, this bill could have the unintended consequence of imposing a near moratorium on bike lanes where they are most practical, while allowing construction of new lanes in low-density areas where they are less likely to be used. Second, the provisions in the bill to remove or consider removing existing infrastructure that was installed at a significant cost sends a powerful message that investing municipal property tax dollars into active transportation is a risky proposition. As a result, municipal governments may begin to avoid making infrastructure investments that could increase the modal share of active transportation in the name of fiscal prudence.\nThe direct and indirect negative effects of this bill go against the following environmental values of the Ministry of Transportation:\n- \"Promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation\" (section 2 preamble).\n- \"[Promoting] an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\" (section 2C).\n- \"[Endeavouring] to reduce the impact of Ontario\u2019s transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change by increasing the availability of sustainable modes of travel\" (section 8).\nAlthough not specifically related to the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values, I would also like to take this opportunity to voice my concern that this aspect of the bill will not help reduce gridlock or save people time. Removing bike lanes and preventing the installation of new lanes will make cycling more unpleasant and dangerous. As a result, more people may choose to drive to work or school or to visit shops, quickly filling up the extra lanes claimed for motor traffic.\nTo align with the Ministry of Transportation's Statement of Environmental Values, the provisions of Bill 212 related to bike lanes should be removed.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario is way behind other world class municipalities in adopting bike lanes.  Climate change is real, it is destructive and it is costly to tax payers who are your voters.  Only when we reach a critical mass of bike lanes will drivers become used to bikers and be at ease with them and stop blaming the few for the problems of the many.  Some might even adopt biking as a viable optional form of transportation.\nLooking at the latest City of Toronto bike lane map show even a suburban, Volvo driving, older white lady like me what a disjointed and sparse network of lanes we actually have. Pathetic really.\nYes, I own an expensive folding bike that I asked for after travel abroad. Guess what? I am afraid to use it here in the city of Toronto. I am not safe riding here because the bike lanes stop and start on even my local routes.\nOne new boldly painted BUS Lane and plain asphalt bike lane on Ellesmere, east of warden is wildly successful with multiple long buses whizzing across.  A recent walk over the overpass was comfortable and felt safe - because the busy street traffic was three lanes over from the tight sidewalk. The biggest double buses even feel safer than random traffic as they are driven by trained and accountable drivers and behave predictably. Having the bike lane next to the curb sidewalk was ideal.\nThe city needs more bike lanes NOW!\nMany of your voters are not car owners or more likely use both biking and cars or transit to get around.  Every trip by foot or bike pulls another one driver vehicle off of the congested road way.  Being half committed and wishy washy about alternative transport is narrow minded and reactionary.\nThe key to reducing gridlock involves reinforcing all modes of transportation.\nReal solutions require clear thinking and looking accurately at the real problem.\nA premier who whines about bike lanes is distracting, insulting and unhelpful.\n"

        "comment": "The city\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes is a disgrace. For a city who claims to be progressive, claims to want to work toward a better future and climate resiliency and then actively propose legislation that endangers lives and modes of climate resilient transportation, only proves how feckless your stances and leadership positions are. You make it clear to citizens of Toronto that you are only interested in keeping the status quo under false pretenses instead of listening to the thousands of people who depend on safe bike infrastructure to navigate the city. If this proposal is passed, I can guarantee that lives will be on your hands. Cyclists and pedestrians alike will die or get injuries from drivers of vehicles who are carelessly, passively, mindlessly driving on wide dangerous roads that encourage speeding and eventually cause an accident. Do not remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly unsupportive of removing the bike lanes noted in this absurd Bill. I live and work along these bike corridors. Until the bike lanes were installed, I used transit to commute. However, once the bike lanes were installed, I began using my bike to commute along Bloor and then up Yonge to my office. As a young mother, I used to put my kids in the trailer and bike them to daycare and pre-school. Now, I'm a steadfast biker along the Bloor/Danforth corridor, often racking up the Strava Legend status - meaning I use certain segments of the lanes more than any other person in the city on that app. Commuting using active transportation has led to positive lifestyle changes. Not only to I amass more than 2,000km of commuting distance, the ride gives me a chance to clear my head, get exercise and save money relative to the subway or driving. Moreover, the lanes were instrumental in me taking up a lifelong cycling hobby - I now participate in charity rides for cancer and have found friendships and community through biking. In 2024, I put 3,300+ kms on my bike. That total was 0 before the bike lanes existed.\nThe bike lanes have been integral to my safety and quality of life living in downtown Toronto. Decisions about where to put bike lanes are hyperlocal and this seems like a ridiculous, politicized Bill aimed at antagonizing Torontonians. It's also deeply inconsistent with the densification and housing accessibility priorities of the City.\nI implore you to strike down this Bill and seriously question the motivations of those who proposed it in the first place.\n"

        "comment": "I am both a driver and a cyclist in Toronto\u2019s west end. I use the Bloor bike lanes every single day to commute to work and to places where I shop. It\u2019s how I\u2019m able to both earn and spend money in the city. Without those bike lanes I would have to drive instead, which would cause me to become part of traffic. Removing bike lanes will only serve to worsen the traffic issues we want solved.\nSpending $48+ million to remove bike lanes that are currently serving many citizens of the city will force those cyclists into cars or into driving lanes where they are legally allowed to ride.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider this proposal. This is a major step backwards just when the cycling infrastructure is starting to take shape and finally allow meaningful travel.\nNot only that, but removing bike lanes just encourages more driving and does nothing to remove gridlock. The streets will fill up to capacity soon enough.\nMoving bike lanes to side streets is also not a viable solution for cyclists. Just as drivers look for the fastest route, so will cyclists. After all, practically all cyclists are themselves drivers. A route on a side street with many stop signs and driveways may be fine for a leisure drive/ride, but will not be used for commuting or other purposeful travel.\nThis proposal does not solve the gridlock problem. It just encourages driving and discourages biking.\n"
