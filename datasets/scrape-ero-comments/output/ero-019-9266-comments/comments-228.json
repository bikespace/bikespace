Without bike lanes, where are the adults supposed to ride? On a busy sidewalk? On the street on hope vehicles don't sideswipe them?\nAlso attached to the bill, I support environmental assessments with the new highways. Bypassing environmental assessments is a terrible idea.

        "comment": "This city is already overly car reliant (which is a problem) and the solution is not promoting more car reliance. By prioritizing cars in infrastructure, people who do not wish to or are not able to use a car for any reason are alienated and the city becomes more hostile to them.\nFurthermore, if the objective of this bill is to alleviate traffic, then adding more lanes for cars is proven to not be effective. If infrastructure only supports car use then people may feel required to commute by car instead of alternative modes of transportation which will further increase traffic as there will be more cars on the road. Removing bike lanes to add lanes for cars will also result in a more hostile commute experience for bikers and cause increased road accidents.\nThe best way to alleviate traffic is to have less cars on the road and that will not be possible if the only mode of transportation supported by city infrastructure is commute via a personal vehicle. If there are other option made safe and accessible then many people will migrate to the use of those options, resulting in fewer cars on the road.\nThis bill will make it possible to remove the little infrastructure the city currently has for cyclists which is NOT congruent with the objective of alleviating traffic, and it is not conducive to improving general quality of life in this city.\nI do NOT support this bill.\n"

We should be doing everything in our power to promote sustainable methods of transportation and reduce the use of single occupancy gas-powered vehicles.\n2. Despite what Doug Ford and his people have to say, there is plenty of evidence that promoting safe bike riding (i.e. with infrastructure like bike lanes) *reduces* congestion. https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319 is one example of a relevant article. Our government should quit using cherry-picked, out of date, and misleading statistics.\n3. It will put lives at stake. Cyclists die because of unsafe road design. Not only do we need to be *increasing* the number of bike lanes in the city, we need to introduce other traffic calming measures to protect cyclists, pedestrians, transit users, and the people in other cars from motor vehicle crashes!\n4. It increases red tape and centralises issues that can and should be local.\n5. It will be expensive without doing anything useful. The Ford government has already spent so much of our money in absolutely shameful, destructive, and corrupt ways. Let's not add to the list.\nI am also infuriated to hear that Doug Ford is citing University Ave as a possible site for bike lane removal on the basis of getting staff and EMS to hospitals. I am a nurse who works on \"hospital row.\" On a very personal level, if this province's government rips up the bike lane I ride to work multiple times per week, my commute time will increase, my odds of an accident will increase, and congestion will still not improve. Some more fact checking: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-toronto-bike-lanes-1.7\u2026\nYou know what actually doesn't belong on arterial roads? On-street parking! Bike lanes move people where they need to go. Parked cars don't.\n"

I generally drive to work because lack of provincial support for transit and dedicated bus lanes means transit is slower than it should be and is unreliable. If bike lanes are eliminated, I'll be slowed down even more because cyclists will be sharing the lanes.\nIf you really want to solve congestions problems in Ontario cities make it easier for people to use transit so more of us can leave our cars at home - and save a pile on gas.\n"

This bill is not founded using current best practices and knowledge of urban mobility. The position of the government is that somehow cyclists are causing congestion on our streets and roads, when in reality it is a known fact that the only solution to car traffic are viable alternative to the automobile. This includes, walking, transit, and yes micro-mobility devices (scooters, bikes, e-bikes).\nThis bill should not go forward as it as a blatant overreach of provincial power, and would be extremely harmful to the progress being made by cities across Ontario to improve mobility options, decrease congestion, and increase the safety of our roads and streets.\nThank you.\n"

Not only will it make our roads more unsafe for people who cycle, walk or drive it is also yet another overstep on the authority of municipalities.\nEasing traffic congestion is about giving people more transportation options, not fewer.\nInvesting in public transit, healthier transportation choices such as bike infrastructure, public transit, and fostering 15-minute neighbourhoods will create a healthier future for Ontarians and future generations.  Efforts should be directed to ensure communities are connected so that not every trip to school, to the store, or to work has to be taken by car.\nAs reported in a recent CBC article, the data is clear, building more car lanes and widening roads does not ease gridlock and building more bike lanes does not make it worse but in fact does the opposite.\nThe proposed legislation is ill-informed and should be opposed.\n"

Please encourage biking  which is a much more healthy mode of transportation and not harmful to the environment. Put the money needed to make a tunnel under the 401 to use making user friendly and reliable public transport for people if they feel the need to live 100 or more miles from their work. You have the duty and responsibility to encourage the healthy behavior of biking. Biking is healthy for individuals and nontoxic to the environment.  Please discourage the road rage that automobile drivers feel entitled to. Make the roads safe for both bike riders. Please pass on to all our children an environment they can live in safely not one ravaged by tornados, wildfires, drought and torrential rain.

This is so ridiculous I'm flabbergasted by how ignorant this proposal is. It is tone deaf to so many different issues. I know you like cars and money Doug but when our city is flooded or destroyed by hurricanes or burned to the ground in however long it takes climate change to get us it's gonna be pretty hard to go for a leisurely drive or spend any of that dough you've been raking in at the expense of Ontarians. Truly if you cared at ALL for the people that voted you into the place you are today, whatever their reasons were..., you would work on a carefully crafted solution that will aid users of a multitude of transportation types for the foreseeable future. This plan does not represent that. This decision does not represent a thoughtful analysis of the issue at hand. But it would be uncharacteristic of this government to act otherwise, I suppose. I grow tired of hearing about one moronic proposal after another. I'm not sure if anyone involved in this plan ACTUALLY believes it is going to help traffic congestion or if it's a wrung on the ladder of a longer game this part is playing at, but both are equally frustrating.\n"

This government should be instead getting municipalities to build more protected bike lanes so that more people would feel safe to get out of their cars and use other modes of transportation to get places over short distances. Highway 413 is also completely flawed, as the 407 should be bought back to move trucks off of the 401 when they are moving across the GTA. The 413 will also cause more flooding as we pave, as the water will have no where to go, and we will have more floods that we have seen this past summer, and will also destroy Ontario's prime farmland that we should be improving and protecting so that we are able to grow our own local food. This whole legislation is a failure in our policy makers to look at the future generations and provide a SUSTAINABLE FUTURE, instead of an apocalyptic collapse as we destroy our environment.\n"

A singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too. What is proposed in not equitable transportation planning. It's taking us back 50 years. I'm a transportation engineer with over 20 years of experience in the industry. This legislation is contrary to the fundamental principles of efficient transportation.\nIt won't reduce gridlock or save you time. Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place\nThis move is also out of line with other provincial priorities, such as growth targets, efforts to boost transit, and the current e-scooter micromobility pilot program.\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\nBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles. This is a provincial priority which the proposed bill does not align with. It will have a serious negative effect on the safety of our vulnerable road users. Any impediment to building safer cycling infrastructure puts people at risk of collision, serious injuries, and death.\nReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nCycling is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life, reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health. We have a mental health crisis, and what is proposed will put more strain on our healthcare system by reducing opportunities for commuting by bike.\nStepping into municipal jurisdiction with this legislation will create a significant amount of bureaucratic red tape, resulting in thousands of municipal and ministry staff hours of additional workload at a significant cost to Ontarians. Please consider all 444 municipalities across the province and their residents that would be negatively impacted by this proposed legislation.\n"

Removal of bike lanes will hurt health, not only be discouraging people to get exercise, but also putting them in danger of being hit by a car. Do NOT make this change.\n"
