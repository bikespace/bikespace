        "comment": "When I was a student at University of Toronto, I could get around Toronto so easily with a bike. I have been hit by a car on College St. before (there were no guardrails there) and still continued to bike because it was just so much faster than driving.\nOn Bloor, I can pass most cars easily. On University as well. By doing so, I'm not taking an Uber and keeping the roads less congested. In fact, if I'd drove, it'd be much slower, and would take up even more space on the road. We need the safety of bike lanes, and they help reduce traffic congestion caused by cars.\n"

        "comment": "Concern Regarding the Implementation of Bike Lanes\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the ongoing implementation of bike lanes throughout Ontario. While I understand the intent to promote cycling as an eco-friendly mode of transportation, I believe that the current approach may have unintended consequences that could affect local communities negatively.\nTraffic Congestion: The addition of bike lanes often reduces the number of vehicle lanes available for cars, leading to increased congestion. This can frustrate drivers and impact the overall efficiency of our transportation network.\nSafety Issues: The interaction between cyclists and vehicles can create safety hazards. In some areas, the lack of clear separation between bike lanes and traffic can increase the risk of accidents for both cyclists and drivers.\nImpact on Local Businesses: The redesign of streets to accommodate bike lanes can sometimes limit access to businesses, particularly in urban areas. This may lead to decreased foot traffic and negatively impact local economies.\nMaintenance and Upkeep: Bike lanes require ongoing maintenance to ensure they are safe and usable. There is a concern that prioritizing bike lane maintenance could divert funds from essential road repairs and infrastructure improvements needed for all road users.\nI urge the government to reconsider the current strategy for bike lane implementation. Remove the bike lanes and make way for more cars to reduce traffic.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I have multiple children and riding a bike is not a viable option to get to school, work and the grocery stores.\n"

        "comment": "The GTA doesn't need more highways, it needs better infrastructure to enable people to live in communities that are closer to their jobs. A person who works a minimum wage fast food job in Toronto should be able to live in Toronto. They should be able to take minimal public transit or be able to walk/bike to their job. Increasing road sizes and wasting money on more highways is not a solution to this problem that is only going to get worse.\nAnd as soon as the new roads/highways are built, we'll be needing more roads, and more highways because the real problem has not been fixed.\n1) Housing prices needs to be controlled so people can be more flexible in moving closer to their work. If you are currently renting a place for the past 3 years, you would have to pay several hundred dollars more a month to rent a similar place in a different part of the GTA.\n2) Businesses need to move forward with work from home initiatives. Traffic has only gotten worse since people were forced to return to the office, we should be encouraging businesses to take advantage of the technology we have.\n3) Car dependency has a huge negative impact on the environment, we shouldn't be continuing to encourage long commutes. We should be moving towards the goal of getting the public to use public transportation and bicycles.\n4) Creating more highways and increasing the size of roads is a poor use of land that could instead be used to build more parks, businesses or housing\nDestroying alternative routes of transportation is not a solution to our traffic problem. Building more highways is not a solution to our traffic problem. This Bill is a lazy, ill thought out solution to a huge problem that will only further aggravate it\n"

        "comment": "This Bill represents a major step backwards for Ontario. We need to support active transit wherever possible, and increasing the burden on small municipalities who want to support bike lanes adds unnecessary barriers to supporting environmentally-friendly modes of transit, wastes taxpayer dollars at municipal and provincial levels, and worsens the safety of cyclists. Furthermore expediting highway construction  by removing environmental assessments is ridiculous. Do it right. We know that climate change is going to impact the daily lives of Ontarians, and we need to support better means of transportation. Invest in cycling, invest in high speed rails, invest in sustainable transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove bike Lanes. bike lane removal will also affect a large population that rely on skating or taking a scooter to work or any other type of transportation that relies on using a bike lane, as they are not fast enough to travel with other vehicles on the road. Removal of bike lane will make this much more dangerous for both cyclists and skaters who need to use the road if there is no sidewalk infrastructure in the area. It is also dangerous for drivers as if they do not expect a bike or a skater to be traveling with them they will not expect to look towards where a bike or skateboard may be coming from. As it endangeres both parties I am against the removal of bike Lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I think the province should stay out of municipal bike lane decision making.  Municipalities know their cities way better than the province does.  I've been using my bike to commute for work and to get around the city for the last 20 years.  When I first came to the city there were very few bike lanes and bikers.   Now we have a bunch more infrastructure and I feel safer and I can move around the city more easily and I'm taking a car off the road for commuting.  Taking away bike lanes will not improve traffic.   Can the province focus on more important issues like climate change, health care, long-term care, education, and energy transition planning and stay out of municipal issues.\n"

The province should focus on provinically interconnected roads such as highways and leave municipalities to decide bike lane for themselves. It would be less red tape in the end. The province has health care and education issues that have not been addressed. This is a non-issue and afrivolous bill with no concernable impact to the rest of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this is one of the most backward, short sighted proposals to come out of the ford government. With the democratization of the e-bike and more efficient nature of riding to work more people are taking to riding to work.\nThis has multiple benefits for the people of Ontario. Able folks get out of cars, and travel in a much smaller footprint on the road, they are healthier for riding, better mental state when at work. It also dramatically reduces wear and tear on the roadway, as bikes weigh 25-50 lbs while a car weighs approx 4500lbs. Less traffic with people on bikes. I ride almost year round, taking Dec to Feb off. If I now have to drive, this will increase my cost of living and I will be yet another vehicle taking up space on the road.\nLet cities decide what they do for cycling infrastructure. The province should not be meddling in municipal affairs. This seems like a Doug Ford vs Toronto vendetta. and I believe he will eventually regret this if it passes. Once folks that choose to ride get hit and die because he decided to remove existing cycling infrastructure. Its shortsighted and foolish to remove existing cycling infrastructure and institute measures to control it at a provincial level. Talk about a micromanager!\n"

This is bad for community health, disadvantages marginalized and mobility impaired folks that can\u2019t afford cars, and keeps kids from getting around the city safely.\nIf the goal were really to make roads about moving people, why retain car parking on roads like bloor yonge and university?  Seems rediculous to maintain them if reducing gridlock is really such a huge priority.\nAlso, all those people on the 2 ft of bike lanes now go back to using cars? This doesn\u2019t seem to be routed in data or long term thinking\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government should not be dictating what a city or municipality can do to it's roadways. Just because the premier happens to live in Toronto and doesn't like bike lanes does not mean he gets to dictate how the city uses them. He should contact his city councillor and register his complaint. That's what the rest of us do. Bike lanes REDUCE traffic congestion, not increase it. Traffic congestion is bad in Toronto because there are not enough options for travel.\n"
