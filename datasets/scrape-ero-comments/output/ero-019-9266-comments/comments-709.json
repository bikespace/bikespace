Cars must have compassion for the vulnerability of the later two. The recent death of a young cyclist on Bloor is an example .\nFord is really punching down. Not a word on the Cross Town horror story, no meaningful consultation with users or regards for safety. Is it really only about suburban drivers shaving off 5 minutes from their commute?\nPlease, please, keep Toronto a liveable city for everyone. It's gridlock everywhere, getting people out of cars in the answer. Years of neglected rapid transit infrastructure.has brought us to this point, not bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is insanity. The transport professionals in the ministry know that the evidence shows that bike lanes reduce congestion. Mode shift away from private cars is the only way to reduce congestion. Another lane induces demand and will soon get clogged. It\u2019s crazy the premier is basing policy for our whole province on his own personal route to work. How many cyclists lives is he prepared to sacrifice for this populist pseudoscience? All for his own political gain. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s made headline round the world, it\u2019s embarrassing\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of South Etobicoke, a car owner and a daily driver. I strongly believe we NEED bike lanes to keep cyclists safe. I drive along Bloor West practically every single day - as I driver, I feel so much better knowing there is a bike lane keeping cyclists safe. If anything, the bike lane has reduced congestion because cars no longer have to merge - unsafely - into one lane to avoid cyclists. The proposal to remove established bike lanes is a complete and utter waste of money, and the government should be ashamed of even proposing it. As a city, we should not have to confer with the provincial government to make decisions. The planning and approval of bike lanes should be left up to the municipality and they city's residents, NOT the provincial government and those who live outside of the city WE call home.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned about the public health implications of this proposed plan.  As a family physician practicing in downtown Toronto I counsel Torontonians every day on the need to engage in physical activity to maintain health.  Often time is a barrier and cycling is a way to achieve both efficient transportation and health benefits.  As a palliative care physician I have also taken care of an 18 year old who was struck by a car and died as a result.   We need safe, efficient options for transportation that protect our health.  Transportation by bicycle is significantly more space efficient than cars.  If everyone who is on a bike were driving a car we would have more gridlock and more people biking can help reduce gridlock.  Separated bike lanes have been shown to save lives and this ultimately this should be the priority over a few minutes of extra driving.\n"

        "comment": "It seems extraordinarily tone-deaf of a government to propose removing bike lanes to increase space on the road network for cars in a year when the climate crisis has become more apparent than ever and the Paris Agreement target of pre-industrial + 1.5degC is almost certainly to be breached for the first time. Rather than making it more difficult to build bike lanes, the provincial government could support schemes that encourage active and mass transit transportation, to the wider benefit of society (reduced emissions, improved air quality, improved population health, reduced healthcare costs).\nWhat does the province propose to do once these 'reclaimed' lanes are full in a few years? Start knocking down people's houses to build more roads? It is transparently a politicisation of the issue, and a cheap import of the standard 'drivers vs cyclist' culture war so beloved of the right.\n"

        "comment": "As a long time cyclist (and occasional driver), I can attest that my dangerous interactions with cars has dramatically decreased over the past ten years with the introduction of more bike lanes. There will always be traffic while people continue to drive into the city in large numbers. We need more alternatives. More of my colleagues have started to cycle as the number of bike lanes increased. The province\u2018s rhetoric against bikes is already trickling down; my teenage daughter\u2019s friend was cycling to work last week when she was screamed at by a truck of men to \u2018get off the road\u2019. There are more cars on our roads than ever. No one expects to drive around New York, London or Paris quickly. We need to plan for a world class city that has excellent alternatives to driving.\nWhere in the bill is the consideration of the health benefits of cyclist? Where is the consideration of cyclist safety? The city of Toronto voted in a mayor who is a cycling advocate. This Bill is an undemocratic over reach into municipal politics. It scapegoats cyclists as if we are to blame for bad traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m an engineer and University of Toronto alumnus. In my life, I\u2019ve had to opportunity to live and travel across the globe and have taken an interest in city planning and infrastructure as a result. Back at home, I have lived in both Mississauga and Toronto. Through my experiences, I\u2019ve seen the successes and shortcomings of urban design. As a result, I am writing to express my opposition of Bill 212.\nFirstly, I wanted to discuss the congestion problems we face in the GTA. The design of much of the cities in the GTA is poor. Most people (outside of Toronto) are required to drive a car for basic necessities. A forgotten ingredient for a cookie recipe results in a last minute \u201crun to the store\u201d, ironically requiring a car to drive 10 minutes to the nearest Walmart for a pack of eggs. Congestion in Mississauga is bad and has gotten much worse in the past few years. Major corridors such as Burnhamthorpe, Eglinton, and Dundas are riddled with traffic. Note that none of these streets have bike lanes that take away from normal car lanes (in fact, hardly any of Mississauga does).\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest benefits of living in Toronto is the alternative modes of transport. It\u2019s what makes it an attractive city to live in. It is also clear that Toronto has less emphasis on single occupancy vehicles than its neighbouring cities, with useable public transit and biking infrastructure.\nI don\u2019t believe the solution to congestion is to continue to prioritize single occupancy vehicles in the same way most of the GTA does, as it\u2019s clear in our own province that it does not scale with the inevitable expansion of cities. Away from home, Kuala Lumpur a city that is relatively rich due to oil money. There, it is frequent that a 45 minute drive can take upwards of 2.5 hours. I experienced this first hand on my way to the airport, where I had to get out of the car and run to a nearby train station to catch my flight. Kuala Lumpur has a lacking public transit system because of its historic focus on prioritizing single occupancy vehicles. This is the same issue seen in LA or Manila. These cities have historically put focus on single occupancy vehicles and are now facing even worse congestion issues than we have. All 3 are scrambling to design and install public rail and infrastructure to combat their issues.\nIt\u2019s also clear that advanced global cities (NY, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo) have actively worked to prioritize better ways of moving people, with large infrastructure projects that help combat the use of single occupancy vehicles. In this bill, it is clear that there is an attack on public infrastructure in an effort to prioritize single occupancy vehicles. This is a regressive policy that counters what most of the developed (and developing) world is doing. Removing bike lanes turns what could be a global city back in time, and helps lead us down the path towards the major issues we see in Kuala Lumpur, LA, or Manila.\nIf we want to be a truly global city, we need to continue to enable more efficient forms of transportation. This is even more important with the great expansion of housing we expect over the next few years.  This bill does the opposite and is counter-intuitive towards building better more globalized cities. If traffic is bad now, it will only get way worse without proper alternatives. Removing or red taping bike lanes is not the solution.\nSecondly, I do believe this is an overreach of provincial power. I do not believe that the province has understanding in these municipal issues. If a small town near Sudbury wants to create a park, why would the whole province, including MPPs from Ottawa, Windsor, and Toronto, have authority over the matter? None of those representatives have any knowledge or understanding of the culture and norms of that municipality. I believe the same goes with bike lanes.\nLastly, I want to discuss helpful alternatives and solutions. The province has proven they are willing to accelerate infrastructure planning (with up to $73M in spending to accelerate the Gardiner repairs). I also appreciate the province having contributed additional funding to the Relief Line to enable additional stops to the Science Centre and Exhibition. I don\u2019t think we should stop there.\nI believe GO electrification will be a major driving force in easing congestion, but we\u2019re staring at 5+ years at best. In California, the electrification of their CalTrain has resulted in a major boost of usage, largely because of the increase in speed and the state of their road congestion. Every person on that train is saving tons of space on the roads. If a tiny amount of people, say 1000, decide to take Lakeshore West into Toronto for work because it\u2019s slightly more convenient, that\u2019s 1000 less cars. At 8 metres per car (accounting for spacing), that\u2019s 8km of cars off the road! This logic extends to other transportation projects. The Ontario Line should be completed 2 years before we estimate, and we should be spending money to enable that acceleration.\nI propose that we should be prioritizing spending on these kinds of projects, forcing them through to be completed years before their original estimates, the same way we are doing with the Gardiner.\nI appreciate you taking the time to read all this and am happy to discuss further if you are so inclined.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is an absolute slap in the face of Torontonians. Our subway system is not designed to handle the increase in population over the past few years.\nA good example of this is the Bloor-Danforth line between Woodbine to Broadview. The only switchback there is at Chester Station, meaning that if there is anything like a power cut-off, that means that shuttle buses must be ordered and that will increase gridlock.\nBike lanes are a great way to keep Torontonians on the move, healthy (since we know that you're trying to cut health care, Doug Ford). Another instance is that bike lanes allow our infrastructure to catch up (lane expansion, subway expansion).\nUSING TAXPAYER funds inappropriately to add and then remove bike lanes is another reason why this government is one of the most incompetent governments I've ever seen. Another example is paying the fine USING TAXPAYER funds for beer in convenience stores.\n"

        "comment": "The government's plan to remove bicycle lanes is appallingly stupid.\n1. The City of Toronto's new lanes don't significantly impact traffic according to research to date.\n2. If the government has any actual evidence to the contrary, show us this evidence, rather than just ramming through legislation without debate.\n3.The lanes provide a SAFE means of travel for people who don't have cars. Without lanes, people die.\n4. Toronto already had gridlock before the cycling lanes went in. And even if the cycling lanes are removed, it will still have gridlock.\n5. Even if the government actually believes removing the cycling lanes will help ease our traffic crisis (but see#1 and #4 above), the measure would still be pointless. Short- short-term.  Any gain would be temporary, because the traffic is getting worse and worse every year anyway. Two years, three years, five years, how long until Toronto becomes unlivable, given the way we're going. And what will that do for business and the economy, the only interest group this government seems to care about?\n6. We need real, meaningful, long-term solutions to our traffic gridlock. Measure that will get people OUT OF THEIR CARS as much as possible. THis requires:\n-- MORE public transit, including the light rail transit the Ford dynasty so foolishly killed off\n-- MORE bike and ebike lanes for Toronto residents who don't drive. Creating a large network of cycling lanes is one important long-term strategy in drawing large numbers of Toronto residents away permanently from car use. If Europeans can do it, so can we.\n-- STICKS as well as carrots to get people out of their cars, such as a $$ levy on drivers who drive downtown, as they have in London. It's working there. Follow the experts advice.\n7.This provincial government is dictating to the cities what they should NOT do to solve the traffic crisis. Yet it does not seem to have any proposals or plans about what cities SHOULD do to solve the crisis. Having ignored the crisis so far, is the provincial government now planning to own the problem and provide solutions? We look forward to hearing the Premier's plans.\n8.This government is overreaching its authority on this issue. Certainly, municipalities are creatures of the Provincial government, which is why this government has been able to bully Ontario cities on the cycling as on other issues. But Doug Ford was NOT elected mayor of Toronto or any other Ontario city. Olivia Chow WAS elected as Toronto's mayor, and among other policies she was elected to create new cycling lanes. She is now executing the mandate she received from its residents. Let her do her job.\n7. If the government was concerned about the cycling lanes, it should have acted before they were installed. Instead, now, removing the lanes is going to be very expensive. THis government will be wasting provincial or municipal taxpayers' dollars, once again, on foolish un-thought-out policies.\n8. Following on from #7, the government's actions smack of electioneering: suddenly cycling lanes becomes another issue to play for suburban votes.\nLeave those cycling lanes. Build more.\n"
