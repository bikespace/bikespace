        "comment": "I am against the idea of pushing through building the 413 highway without following the required environmental laws and reviews. There is no valid reason to do this and makes the ontario government look untrustworthy to the public. More effective strategies for overcoming gridlock: invest in more and improved public transit across ontario; buy back the foreign owned portion of the 407 and drastically reduce usage fees; require mixed use zoning so that people can access groceries and direct life needs in their neighbourhood; properly fund provincial healthcare so that people don't have to travel by car for hours to access a doctor or specialist when their city of 100,000 people cannot provide basic family doctor care for its  population.\nFurther, the removal of existing bike lanes is an atrocious waste of money and an egregious overstep on municipal decision making. If cities have already invested the money, time and construction inconvenience to install bike lanes, there is no reason to remove them without the municipality being the one making that decision. Please focus your energies on provincial level issues: health care and education, both of which are in an abysmal state since your government took power.\n"

        "comment": "The legislation does not acknowledge the Province's recognition of the value that bicycle infrastructure can have on improving traffic safety, reducing congestion, reducing pollution, improving public health or stimulating the local economy.  It is important to acknowledge this so that the evaluation criteria for removing existing bike infrastructure or for denying new projects reflects this in the proper context, and is not solely based on automobile traffic flow and travel times.\nIn the case of removals, it is also important to acknowledge the volume of cyclists that are now on the corridor as a result of the bike infrastructure being built, and that if removed, this volume may remain if there isn't an adequate alternative.  This volume of cyclists, now left unprotected, could lead to even greater traffic congestion,  both actual and perceived, as it would increase the conflict points between road users, ultimately leading to more frustration and animosity, with potentially deadly consequences.\nIf, for example, after review of the required information, the province demands removal of existing bike lane, this decision should account for the safety impacts that removing the bike lanes can have on the cyclists that will now be left exposed.\n"

        "comment": "Although traffic is a real problems in our city, this is not the way to solve it. Data, research, and common sense show that bike lanes are not the main reasons for traffic. In fact, the more safe and useful bike lanes are created, the less cars will be on the road.\nThe university and Bloor bike lanes have just been installed. It is a waste of money and effort to remove them so quickly. If the premier wants to study the effect these lanes have had on traffic, now is the time to do it. Ripping them up without a studying their impact is not a logical and thoughtful response.\nSafe and useful Bike lanes are a vital piece of transportation in this city and should not be removed without thorough investigation.\nThis is not ok.\n"

        "comment": "The only, correct way to reduce gridlock is to reduce demand for cars/trucks/etc. This is accomplished by **increasing** public transport and other alternative transport methods like bicycling.\nThis isn't just a random citizen saying this. Induced car demand is a studied and known effect. The government should already know this so either a) they don't know and are incompetent to govern and should resign immediately, or b) they do know this don't care, in which case they do not have the citizen's best interests at heart and should resign immediately.\nAttempting to block the building of bicycling lanes a) goes **directly against** the purported purpose of this bill, and b) is an over-reach of provincial governmental power.\nTrying to ram through 413 approval **against the expert environmental advice** is also incredibly wrong.\nThis bill must die.\nThe Conservative government, and Doug Ford specifically, need to resign immediately.\n"

        "comment": "I've copied with permission the below comment, as it reflects my feelings towards the bill.\nThe stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "Nothing in this bill is in the interests of the people of Ontario. We need municipalities to be allowed to make their own decisions about infrastructure based on their constituents and studies. This is overreach obviously directed at Toronto. Also it seems the main issue of bike lanes (which again it's ridiculous that the premier is making his priority when the state of healthcare and  education in this province is crumbling, and would be a better use of money that would be wasted with the proposed bill) is only a distraction for an attempt to push through highway development with less regulation and give the government power to seize land. This is all being pushed through quickly with little time for public feedback and no time for studies (though bike lanes were installed following studies on traffic and safety at the expense of municipalities).\nIn short this bill is against the interests of public safety and should not be passed.\n"

More room for cars will induce more demand.\nAlternatives like more public transit and more safe and connected bike lanes are the only ways to reduce traffic.\nMunicipalities must be empowered to independently make decisions about how to deal with traffic.\nThis bill also seems like it is trying to address a problem in Toronto while creating more problems in all other cities.

We need to be actively pursuing alternative forms of transport in all areas including Toronto. What we need is better bike lanes and more public transit across the province, and to reduce the number of cars overall. I would welcome not having to use my car, and could only wish to cycle more. The shortsightedness of this bill cannot be overstated. I oppose this bill and the car-centered approach of this government.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on main roads are a critical component in reducing congestion on Ontario\u2019s roads. Cycling infrastructure takes up considerably less space than car infrastructure to move the same number of people.\nCycling infrastructure, like car infrastructure, is only useful and successful when it forms a fast and convenient network. When bike lanes appear to be underutilized, it is usually less a matter of the bike lane itself being unnecessary and more that the rest of the cycling network connecting to the main route is underdeveloped.\nOntario\u2019s municipalities have spent years or decades and millions of taxpayer dollar developing plans for successful and useful cycling networks to alleviate congestion in our largest cities, and hamstringing the implementation of these networks just as they are starting to be built out will destroy any hope of a safe, reliable, sustainable transportation system for our and future generations.\n"
