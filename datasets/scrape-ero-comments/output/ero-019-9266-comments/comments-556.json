If we get people out of cars, there will be less congestion.  I am 60 and I like to ride my bike to work.  I won't do so when I don't feel safe.  There are so many health, environmental and mental well-being benefits that come from people using active travel, don't hinder that.  Cycling cannot be politicized.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with both removing the bike-lanes already installed in Toronto, and with legislating that municipalities must get provincial permission to install bike lanes on major arteries than remove/infringe on car lanes. These are steps backwards. Properly designed bike-lanes help keep cyclists safe and encourage more people to use alternate modes of transit instead of cars. More lanes does not improve grid-lock, it increases the number of cars on the road, which is bad for the environment. Work on encouraging people not to drive instead!\n"

Furthermore, the bill proposes to remove bike lanes in Toronto and Premier Ford has said that the province will pay for this. Again, as a taxpayer, this is an egregious waste of money.\nBeyond my concerns as a taxpayer, the premise that bike lanes increase congestion has been shown over and over not to be true. Cars create congestion. There is simply not enough space in our cities to have everyone drive and still have a city left to drive to. There have been numerous studies on this effect; a synopsis of this research is linked. The only way to decrease congestion is to have fewer people drive. Bike lanes support this. In fact, between 2021 and 2022 the most congested cities in the world increased their level of congestion considerably. The only exception of Paris, which had recently started an ambitious plan to bring in more bike lanes. In contrast, Toronto congestion increased 59% between those 2 years (see link for report).\nIf the Ford government is concerned with congestion, it should also consider other ways to discourage driving. These include building better public transit and putting tolls on roads. Note that the 407 is rarely busy. If Toronto created tolls for the 401 or to come into the center of the city, we could actually reduce congestion. The money from such a charge could help to fund better transit: a win-win.\nTraffic and congestion are solvable and well-studied problems, but more space for cars is not a viable solution.

By choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing us back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth and University Ave have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\nResearch shows that bike lanes *improve* congestion rather than making it worse, and Doug Ford is choosing to ignore that, and to ignore the safety of cyclists, in order to push his own agenda.\nIf you want to improve congestion, you need to focus on improving both cycling and transit infrastructure, not just trying to make it easier for inefficient vehicles.\n"

Cycling deaths are up in Toronto & they occur mostly in places without a separated bike lane. If bike lanes are removed, cyclists will be forced to ride in car lanes which will slow everyone down & make it more dangerous for everyone. Demanding that municipalities get provincial approval to construct new bike lanes that take away a lane of traffic will cause unnecessary red tape & are unlikely to be approved if even existing bike lanes are being removed. We need more bike lanes, not fewer. They will actually reduce gridlock by giving people more options, reducing cars on the road & getting everyone where they\u2019re going more safely.\n"

Bike lanes improve traffic for small businesses and more importantly they provided better safety on the streets. Bike lanes are not the cause for congestion in the city but the absurd amount of construction projects happening at once all over the city is. Even the Gardner expressway is reduced in lanes. How about the numerous ttc projects going on Queen Street and now the Danforth?\n"

Bike lanes should be a municipal decision based on local needs rather than provincial needs.\nThe province should instead being encouraging municipal governments to have more sophisticated, effective, and safe bike lanes to open up more transportation options to Ontario residents. Having better bike lane infrastructure would encourage more residents to bike and reduce the amount of drivers on the road, which will help with traffic. Providing alternative modes of transportation should be the goal, not limiting everyone to one choice only. Making more highways or making highways with more lanes are just a bandaid solution to the traffic problem. Removing bike lanes will make the situation worse.\n"

Also local businesses have an increase in customers when bike lanes are added in the neighbourhood.\nToronto, and other cities in Ontario, have the opportunity to become create the infrastructure to make it easier for residents to get around the city without using a car - whether that be by public transit, walking or cycling. All of these options take cars off the roads, making it easier for those who have to drive to get around the city. Many international cities, and cities in Canada, already have that infrastructure in place and have a significant percentage of the population who is able to leave the car at home for their daily commute. The Ontario government should be encouraging municipalities to install this infrastructure, not preventing them. The best way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nFinally, we have a democratic process in place that includes three levels of government: federal, provincial and municipal. Each level of government has specific areas that are within their area of control, and the Ontario province has been quick to point out when the Federal government has tried to influence topics outside of their area of control. Please let our cities make the decisions that are best for each region, based on the choices of that region, and respect our democratic process.\n"

I also think congestion is bad for people and the environment, but  removing bike lanes that the City has already built will not solve anything.\nI strongly encourage you to look at alternatives like smart  traffic signal timing and sensors at parking spots to reduce the amount of time people spend looking for parking. Public bike sharing programs and improved public transit systems have also been proven to reduce congestion. Toronto and other cities in Ontario will continue to grow, and as we do, traffic will become increasingly bad, no matter how many car lanes we build. This is not a sustainable solution. I urge you to reconsider Bill 212. I am strongly opposed to its passing. I want to live in a city where people feel safe and where our travel options are efficient. Bill 212 will make more people unsafe and it will not combat traffic congestion.\nIn 2017, Premier Ford said \"You're nervous when there's no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders\".\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I find it troubling that the provincial government intends to dismantle infrastructure intended to encourage safe travel for bike users. With recent news of bicyclist deaths, I find the reasoning made by our ministers to be flawed. Encouraging more bike use among our population will not only decrease congestion, but lower relative health service costs for the given population. Indeed, resources should be better utilized in developing more commute lanes, decreasing infrastructure costs and delays, and limiting the amount of Uber drivers. Additionally, creating areas of the city off limits to vehicles will encourage more walking, biking, and lower congestion, raise revenues of street commercial spaces and promote healthy living. I am against the motion to remove bike lanes from our city and for the motion to have direct oversight into the development of future bike lanes in our city.\n"

Bike lanes allow us to more safely navigate a very dangerous landscape and to visit local businesses for shopping etc., medical appts, to attend church and to visit friends as well as for exercise.  Please note we are also car owners.  Cyclists will continue to ride on major routes as when you are self-propelled it isn't reasonable to go out of your way to get to a bike lane, it's too difficult!  Shops and businesses are on the major roads so bikes will be too.  Bikes will continue to be on these roads but without bike lanes, they will be in the traffic lanes.  According to the Ontario website, we need to be at least a metre from the curb and able to ride in a straight line without swerving for obstructions like sewer grates and if the lane is too narrow to share, can occupy the entire lane.\nRoad safety is not solely measured by deaths, many cyclists experience debilitating injuries and my husband was hospitalized with a head injury after being hit by a car while cyclin on a residential street with no bike lanes.  He continues to experience side effects from this years later.\nPlease address issues creating gridlock like construction, ride sharing and other cars stopping in traffic lanes.\nA world class city needs many modes of transportation and cycling is one of them.\n"

        "comment": "BIKE LANES SAVE LIVES.  6 people riding bicycles have been killed by cars & trucks in the GTA this year.  A 13 year old girl riding a bicycle was recently killed in Ajax.  Safety of all road users must be a priority in all transportation decisions.  The problem is not too many bike lanes; congestion is caused by too many cars as there are insufficient public transport and cycling options.  Increased road and highway capacity is quickly filled up by the increased traffic it induces.  All major traffic studies show that bike lanes help decrease automobile use, reduce congestion and improve air quality.  Toronto's  Bloor St. trial pilot of bike lanes showed that merchant sales actually increased once bike lanes were installed. Having the province regulate whether municipalities can install a bike lane or not is a huge & inefficient overreach by the provincial government.  There are over 440 municipalities in Ontario.  This overreach will create more redtape and further bloating of the provincial bureaucracy.\n"

Instead of this, they should levy congestion city tax on the cars entering downtown during peak hours.\nThis bill also has a provision to take over land of people if you live near the highway, which is very shady at the least.\n"

        "comment": "While I agree with the general idea of reducing gridlock, especially as a driver, I do not agree with limiting the authority of local governments. Municipal governments are the closest to citizens with the most impact on everyday citizen life. They spend a lot of time and effort on targeted local consultation to ensure projects represent the unique needs of their communities. This is an important point to consider in this legislation. Ontario is a vast province with communities having very different needs, environments, economies, and capacities. Uploading approvals to the province for extremely locally impactful projects like lane reductions and cycling infrastructure removes grassroots citizen influence on these projects. With respect to the great work of people in the Ministry of Transport, they do not know local needs, history, or unique situations and cannot make as effective decisions as local governments can.\nSo I urge caution in the application of this legislation and suggest limiting its scope and range significantly. It appear to be largely targeted at the City of Toronto, and if so, then perhaps it should be only for projects in the City of Toronto. I do not want Toronto centred solutions to be blanketly applied to my community outside of the GTA. Please respect local decision making!\n"

There is no need for the province to interfere on this level.\nSecond, and most importantly, bike lanes do not increase congestion. They simply don\u2019t. I beg of you to speak to experts who study traffic flow, urban planning, traffic safety.\nThey remove cars from roads. They increase safety for both cyclists and drivers, they make it easier to navigate roads. By removing bike infrastructure you are simply encouraging more cars to use the same roads. It will INCREASE congestion.\nFinally, the bike lanes have already been installed. Using taxpayer funds. And now the plan is to spend MORE taxpayer funds to remove what has been paid for?\nThis bill is beyond ill-advised. It\u2019s dangerous. People will be injured or killed as a result. It\u2019s wasteful. It\u2019s regressive. It should be shelved and efforts should be redirected to finding alternate ways to reduce congestion. Cities are not built for cars. There are other, better ways to move about an urban environment. This government would be well-advised to explore them.\n"
