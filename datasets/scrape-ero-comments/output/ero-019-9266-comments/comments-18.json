There are people dying in waiting rooms, hoping to see a doctor that the province is underpaying and overworking. There has been no progress on housing. There is ample opportunity to build transit if the gov. could actually get its head out of its ass and fund projects. People want to ride bikes! It's cheap, it takes cars off the road, and keeps people healthy. Stop trying to play politics and fix all the stuff you've broken while trying to line your pockets. It's atrocious that this even needs to be said, when you have teams doing research.\n"

I'm all for measures to reduce gridlock, but this CLEARLY won't work and will only contribute to more deaths, more cars, and less money toward badly needed public transit. If anything we need more bike lanes to encourage Ontarians to ditch their gridlock-causing cars and opt for a cleaner and more efficient way to get around. I'm sick and tired of Premier Ford using his populist ideals for the sole benefit of re-election and not for the safety and well-being of the people he represents. Maybe bike lanes aren't for every city and town in Ontario - that's fine, but let THEM decide. How dare Premier Ford continue to make provincial decisions aimed squarely at the Greater Toronto Area, simply because he's sick of driving to work the 5 times a year he actually shows up.\n"

        "comment": "As a recreational cycling and a motorist I feel the initiative to restrict and possibly remove bike lanes is incredibly misguided. Bikes are an efficient and healthy mode of transportation that needs to be encouraged. I also see that most of the gridlock this is purported to reduce is on highways where bikes are already not permitted. If we were to properly address driving standards for cars, motorcycles and trucks I feel that this could be helped. It is also better addressed by other forms of mass transport such as commuter trains that run with regularly and high speed trains between large population centres.\n"

        "comment": "I chose to live in the biggest city in Canada because I get to be car-free and commute by walking, cycling, or transit. I am writing to express my deepest disappointment with this proposal. The proposed removal of existing functional and well-used infrastructure, i.e. bike lanes, is an unconscionable waste of taxpayer dollars. While all other world-class cities are expanding their active transportation networks, this proposal by the Ontario government would make Toronto the only city to contract (in fact, destroy) its own network. Instead of focusing on bike lanes, the government should take accountability for the disastrous delays in the construction of multiple transit projects in Toronto and deliver the projects as promised to Ontarians.\nCommute times have increased all over the province, including roads with absolutely no relationship to bike lanes (such as the 401). To meaningfully improve commute times and improve gridlock, as this bill claims to do, more people should be able and incentivized to use public transit instead of driving. Toronto's road network is not just a funnel for commuters - its primary purpose is to serve the people of Toronto. Forcing people off their bikes by making roads more dangerous is going to make gridlock worse, not better.\n"

It was a mess during construction but is now actually a nice street to walk. I see no backlog of cars and the bike lanes are used by many people. Unfortunately too many food couriers, with their bikes are using them.\nEmergency vehicles have reported better response times with bike lanes.\nThere's no need for the province to be involved in municipal affairs governed by locally elected leaders.

We also need to think about vulnerable populations such as children, individuals using motorized wheelchairs, or people with limited incomes that can only afford bikes. Decreasing bike lanes will result in increased deaths of road users. If we want to decrease commute times we need to take public transit seriously and increase bike lanes to reduce congestion. We need to increase bike lanes to prevent deaths. It\u2019s about public safety and making our cities resilient, improve economic growth, and overall quality of life. Roads in Toronto cannot handle everyone driving. We need more people to choose alternative modes of transportation or we will never get out of this mess.\n"

        "comment": "I don\u2019t even need to hark the usual talking points which point out the benefits of cycling infrastructure because the ministry has probably heard them more than enough.\nInstead I\u2019ll provide my personal experience. Cycling infrastructure has allowed me to take so many trips without needing to use my car. Need to go to T&T? The Clark bike lanes are there for me. Need to pick up my car from the dealer? The Willowdale lanes help me get there. Unfortunately, visiting any business along the Yonge stretch between Sheppard and finch is hard for me without either paying astronomically for parking while getting stuck in traffic, or walking for an eternity. This legislation further delays the construction of this project, to the point where I might not even be able to provide support to the businesses in my lifetime until they shutter up.\nThis legislation adds unnecessary red tape to getting these road diet projects approved and built (in a party that platforms off reducing red tape!!), and because of its blanketed nature, it impacts ALL projects regardless of whatever the traffic study tells you. I work on them myself. 90% of the time, the results tell me that traffic will be fine after a lane reduction for bike lanes.\nPlease reconsider this and put my taxpayer dollars into something that actually matters. How about your ongoing transit projects? A traffic squadron for OPP to enforce traffic on the 401 which is often jammed because of crashes? How about reconfiguring the interchanges between Weston and Black Creek? Healthcare? Education? Anything is smarter than this\n"

        "comment": "As a tax payer and property owner in the City of Toronto who drives a car, uses transit to get to work, and cycles to/from my home and parks for recreation, this legislation will make it far more difficult to get active and move safely in the city.\nAs a Registered Professional Planner and a transportation planning expert, I reiterate the words of my colleagues in saying that banning bike lanes on busy corridors will worsen congestion, worsen transportation affordability, and worsen emissions in our communities. With the majority of trips under a few km long, bike lanes provide a safe and separate space for kids and adults to move through their community without the need to drive and find parking in the city. But they only work when homes and destinations are connected, and safe, and not when infrastructure is downgraded to appease non-residents who refuse to accommodate others. We are not talking about banning cars, simply balancing space so that everyone can move safely, but it seems this nuance is lost in the discussion.\nFinally, if the province is serious about solving congestion, then an order of magnitude increase in transit funding is required to increase operating capacity, complete existing rapid transit projects, accelerate the building of new lines, and activate additional regional rail corridors (such as the midtown and uptown rail corridors) to provide cross-regional transit access parallel to Highway 401 and 407, connecting jobs and homes without the need for a car. In a growing region, the only solution to congestion is reducing the number of cars on the road, and in a sprawling region, this solution is only possible through rapid regional rail, with corridors that move through the city and not just converge at Union Station (while important) as data shows a significant percentage of trips start and end across the suburbs.\n"
