        "comment": "This bill is blatent overreach by the province into municipal affairs. We elected our officials based on their platforms with the expectation thay they will deliver on them. Removing infrastructure that has been thoroughly studied, consulted on, and most importantly built is a slap in the face to the entire city. The decision to remove and restrict bike lanes will lead to more deaths on our roads. I find it troubling how easily MPPs are prioritizing (perceived) convenience over safety.\nAdditionally, the excemption of highway 413 from environmental safeguards is despicable. Running this highway through the greenbelt is no different than the previous scandal. Stoking the flames of a culture war to slip this through is abhorrent.\nThis government's use of bad-faith arguments (ex: the claim that < 2% of Torontonians commute by bike) will lead to distrust of our institutions. It is unbelievable to me that this government can claim to make data driven decisions while peddling utter falsehoods and turning a blind eye when presented with the facts (i.e. the city's recent report).\n"

I ask that the committee push back against Bill 212 and reshape it to prioritize local design decisions.\nAs a teenager, I experienced Bloor Street on a daily basis. I would walk by it on the way to school, go to lunch there, socialize with friends, and enjoy all it had to offer. As an adult, I was able to enjoy the amazing bike lanes which were installed. The bike lanes encouraged me to ride, improving my health and to explore the local neighbourhood. My partner has also become a regular cyclist because of the bike lanes installed in our area. Without them we will be forced to drive or spend more money on personal transportation, adding to congestion and slowing traffic.\nOutside of this personal impact, the bike lanes were implemented after a strong engagement campaign led by local leaders and community members. To remove these bike lanes, or even approve a framework that allows them to be removed, invalidates our local democracy and subverts the proper order of governance in the province. With over 400 municipalities coming under review, this just gives too much power to Queen's Park and the Minister of Transportation.\nI ask that you do your best to rectify the serious errors this bill could enshrine in law. Restore local autonomy and remove any requirement to remove specific bike lanes!\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "There is little evidence to support that this change is making our city better. You point to the need to improve infrastructure with our growing population by taking out the bike lanes, but that is a separate challenge in itself the province and Canada must deal with and that bikers shouldn't be punished for. There are SO many commuters that use the bike lanes - it's significantly faster than the TTC or driving - THAT should tell you something. Plus it's a greener initiative, it's good for our city, it's healthy for the citizens of Toronto - and if citizens are able to make healthier choices, they'd be happier overall.\nAdditionally, before tearing out bike lanes that cost tax payers likely MILLIONS of dollars and so much time to build, were any experts in green urban planning consulted to see how we could make this infrastructure better for drivers and public transportation commuters alike? How is it that cities in Europe with hundreds-of-year-old architecture (like Copenhagen) can be biking capitals of the world, and we cannot make this system work here? Surely more research and calling in more experts should be evaluated so we can help make this WORK rather than wasting already-spent money by trashing an idea that many feel is essential to their lifestyle and vision for the city.\n"

My father commutes to work on his bike and is currently able to do so mostly on bike lanes. By removing them, I worry that my dad is at a much higher risk of getting hit by a car. Additionally, bike lanes have been hugely successful at encouraging more people to bike.

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident, been living here almost 15 years, and I am writing in opposition to this proposal.\nIf the Province wants to reduce gridlock - encourage more people to choose biking or public transit, especially for short inner-city trips.\nRemoving bike lanes will negatively impact health, quality of life, and, notably, the economy.\nTop concerns with removing bike lanes and stalling new bike lanes:\n1. Gridlock - Encouraging more cars will increase traffic and lead to worse gridlock. On the contrary, diversifying model of travel by having bike lanes actually balances traffic, thus reducing gridlock. Like good monetary strategies, good traffic management also requires diversifying.\n2. Safety - Cars switching lanes on narrow or local roads (like Bloor St. and Yonge St.) can lead to collisions, fatalities, and gridlock. On the contrary, dedicated properly installed bike lanes reduce chances of car collisions, thus reducing gridlock for those travelling by car.\n3. Housing Affordability - More housing options and taming the housing affordability crisis will require building homes that have safe access to bike lanes - to move people to stores, schools, and work without adding cars and thus adding congestion.\n4. Air Quality and Public Health - More cars means more congestion, more idling engines, and poorer air quality for Ontarians, leading to negative health impacts.\n5. Economic Consequences for Businesses - Bike trips increase customers to businesses - especially along Bloor St. and Yonge St. Having bike lanes on prominent inner-city streets supports retail, restaurants, and services, providing frequent, repeat customers. Cars cannot as quickly support businesses, or, in doing so, would block traffic lanes, causing gridlock and congestion.\n6. Loss of Competitiveness as a Global City (for Toronto, therefore impacting Ontario too) - Successful safe bike lanes gain attention on the world stage, and bring in tourism and money. Making it harder for residents and visitors to use active transportation to travel within the city will make Toronto less desirable to visit, spend money, and live. This will negatively impact Toronto's and Ontario's economy.\nRegarding Bloor St., Yonge St. and University Ave. - these are near high frequency major transit (TTC subway lines). Cars should not use these local roads. Cars should use roads that go around cities, not through them.\nIn summary, the legislation as proposed legislation will do the oppositite of what it claims to promote. Less diversion of car traffic [to bike lanes] will actually create more gridlock. Moreover, the analysis of where to install bike lanes, to support safe, healthy, and mobile cities, is most appropriately dealt with at the local level.\nPlease roll back this proposed change and leave bike lane decision-making to municipalities.\n"

I depend on bike lanes to protect me from the dangers that motor traffic pose, so by ripping out existing lanes and making new lanes nearly impossible to build, this proposed legislation is a direct threat to my personal safety and livelihood. If the provincial government was truly serious about reducing gridlock, it should be helping Ontarian cities build more bike lanes to promote the use of bicycles (and other forms of micro-mobility such as e-bikes and scooters) as an alternative to motor vehicles. Extensive bike lane networks are the solution to gridlock, not the cause of it.\n"

As workers in the core downtown of Ottawa, bike paths are an essential part of our daily commute to and from work and school. We educate and are the next generation of nurses, doctors, engineers, artists, lawyers, and psychologists, and we need the freedom to choose our method of safe transportation. Our bikes are our cars, they are what we use to get to work, do groceries, go to events, and socialize year round, even during the winter months.\nAccording to Ratehub, the average cost of car ownership in Canada is $16,644 annually. According to Statistics Canada, the average APR on new car loans is 8.19%. For young people such as our members, buying and owning a car is not affordable.\nThis bill is another gross overreach of the provincial government\u2019s powers, motivated by the Premier\u2019s personal agenda against the City of Toronto and its municipal government. It will only encourage more cars downtown, increasing traffic congestion and making biking downtown less accessible and more hostile. In addition to pushing Ontarians into Car Poverty, Bill 212 will cost taxpayers millions by forcing cities to destroy good roads bringing more construction downtown, making roads inaccessible for everyone. That\u2019s money that could be used to improve public transit infrastructure, fix our schools, fund our healthcare, build more affordable housing, or save the Ontario Science Centre. This is a short sighted attempt by the Premier to control a municipal policy so he can reduce his own commute. If he truly wishes to reduce his commute, we recommend that he make the healthy choice by biking and using public transportation rather than removing the freedoms of Ontarians.\nSincerely,\nCUPE Local 2626 and the student workers of uOttawa.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this new bike lane framework. This is a band-aid approach to resolving gridlock and does not get to the root cause of the issue which is too many cars. This will encourage more driving on the roads where bike lanes are removed and make traffic worse. More lanes does not solve the problem, especially with the anticipated population growth Ontario will have over the next few decades. In a lot of areas in Toronto, there is one lane for traffic and the other lane that\u2019s technically for traffic, is used for parking. Chances are, people will just park on these opened lanes and it will NOT improve traffic at all. With the density that Toronto has, the province should be encouraging alternative forms of transportation to help reduce gridlock.\nThe fact is, separated bike lanes like the ones on Bloor save lives. Preventing collisions between vehicles and cyclists, vehicles and pedestrians, and between vehicles themselves, should be the province\u2019s #1 priority. They should be collaborating with municipalities to improve transportation infrastructure. They should NOT be making it more difficult for municipalities to achieve Vision Zero. As a Toronto resident and driver, I am appalled that this government believes saving people a few seconds is worth a cyclist\u2019s life. Because that IS what will happen if this Act passes.\nAs someone who commutes by car, I would gladly commute by bike if it were safe and there was the infrastructure for it. I appreciate the City of Toronto\u2019s initiative to improve cycling infrastructure. From the perspective of a driver, I prefer cyclists to have their own protected lanes so all commuters can be safe. It does not bother me if the City has to remove a traffic lane to prioritize safety for all road users.\nThis framework is a huge overreach of the provincial government. The City of Toronto, with its democratically elected council, should be the lead authority in its own planning matters.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes policy proposal would cause more harm than good. I am a cyclist and I can say that I feel a lot more safer with the bike lanes in place when I am riding my bike in the downtown core and in other parts of Toronto, such as going west into Etobicoke along the Bloor street bike lane or using the bike lanes in Scarborough. I grew up in the suburbs where I understand the need for a car for tasks as simple as running errands such as grocery shopping or visiting the postal office. But I also really appreciated the stretch of bike lanes that were installed along Sheppard right where I grew up and spent most of my life, in the Rouge River area. The bike lanes allowed me to remain separated and safe from drivers and unknowingly motivated me to bike more. I would love to be a life long biker and avoid using a car for as long as I possibly can and by being able to access and ride on bike lanes I will be able to do so. I understand that we need to make our neighbourhoods more accessible to meet basic and recreational needs but I also know that for those who are able to get around via biking, the bike lanes encourage bike use. This has tremendous benefits: it limits the emissions of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases that would otherwise be emitted from the use of a car (or even taking transit); it reduces the number of cars on the road, and therefore decreases the level of motor traffic; it boosts my physical and mental health, and therefore reduces potential burden on the healthcare system and it provides me and others with an affordable transportation option during tough economic times, which means less stress on my wallet and mind on where my money is going. I know I am not alone when I say that bike lanes do more good than harm FOR EVERYBODY. Even is someone drives and does not bike at all, the bike lanes (especially the ones with protected barriers) help improve visibility of the bikers for the drivers, which reduces the risk of incidents between the two. I don't think that removing the three identified bike lanes downtown will reduce the number of bikers downtown drastically. I believe it will simply divert those bikers onto the road who will then bike either ahead of or behind the drivers, which I think will contribute to congestion even more, as bikers on the main road may slow down traffic even more. As a biker, I don't intend to bike less on the three targeted streets for bike lane removal, and that will increase my risk of getting into a car accident. People could really lose their lives as a result of this policy and that isn't something anyone/any governing body/any politician/ any human would want for anyone. I kindly implore you the government to re-consider it's stance on this proposal. I am disheartened by this proposal and hope and pray that the government will reconsider its stance on this (which I think may help the politicians secure more votes from their voter base during the next election cycle). Thank you very much for providing a forum to share this comment.\n- A fellow Torontonian, biker and optimist for the future for all beings\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the newly installed bike lines on Bloor in the west end. We should give it more time for people to adjust before removing. It has only been a year since they were installed. I do think that certain areas need to be reworked, including the area between Old Mill and Jane. The new traffic lights and condos, along with the decrease in lanes is causing grid lock during rush hours. This is what I have heard most people in my area complain about.\nI now feel safe enough to start biking parts of Bloor, I previously avoided due to safety concerns. I am not an avid biker, but I did start to bike to local shops instead of driving.\nI think the Ontario government should play a more consultation role, and leave the decision making to the municipality.  This is a community issue. Let's use this money for other issues effecting the ontario cities.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n"

        "comment": "Please stop this proposal to remove bike lanes for six reasons:\n1) I'm against provincial interference into municipal traffic management. If the residents in a city have given a mandate to their municipal government to control traffic on city roads, I don't want an un-knowing, distant politician (in either provincial or federal government) to tell us what we want. The Federal conservatives have demonstrated the impact of this kind of interference when John Baird stopped the Siemens contact from being implemented, so Ottawa had had a lousy tunnel to nowhere, and we had to resort to a third rate train supplier, many years later than we wanted.\n2) Ontario's Provincial government is not even doing it's own job well. I don't want it to waste resources doing our municipal government's job poorly.\nStop this nonsense and do YOUR job! Get back to focusing on policies that are Ontario's responsibilities: provide us with doctors, hospitals and medical care; educate our kids from daycare through college and universities; support construction of mass transportation and inter-city rail; support green/nuclear electricity and build infrastructure for electric vehicles; attract manufacturing, and more.\n3). Biking and walking (and reduced driving) should be promoted. It makes Ontario residents healthier, and reduces their need for health care, ultimately benefiting Ontario's by reducing reliance on health care and ultimately improves our fiscal situation.\n4). Bikes (and reduced vehicle usage) improves air quality and breathability in the downtown core.\n5) Bikes reduce pollution, ultimately contribute to our carbon reduction goal to reduce the impact of climate change.\n6.) This proposal appears to have been pulled from thin air, without much thought. Were other alternatives to improve downtown traffic considered by a panel of experts? A really good alternative could be for Municipal government's to charge a premium for car use in the downtown core, to reduce congestion, improve safety of pedestrians and to improve air quality. This extra revenue could be used to provide FREE use of bus/train throughout the downtown core. Tourists and commercial vehicles could be given exceptions. Politicians (like you guys) don't need to drive downtown, should take transit! (If you don't like transit, see item 2 above, and help to improve it!!)\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for bringing the impacts of bike lanes along congested major urban roadways into public discussion.\nThe current Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process at present allows a segment-by-segment rather than a full network approach to transportation planning. The process classifies transportation projects based on their (natural) environmental impact, so projects that involve not adding any additional road width, e.g. repurposing existing vehicular road lanes for cycling lanes, are classified as EA-Exempt projects. This EA exemption allows conversions from vehicular lanes to bike lanes to take place quite easily. For a consistent transportation and policy planning framework in the province, the MCEA process should be revisited to ensure that the broader transportation impacts on all modes of transportation are also considered.\nI can appreciate the benefits of having cycling lanes to facilitate cycling and make cycling safer. I can also appreciate that not all types of trips can be made by bicycle, so the movement of motorized traffic also needs to be considered - and this includes transit, trucks, emergency vehicles, services like waste collection, and yes, personal automobiles too. Toronto is one of the most congested cities in North America, and that hardly makes it \"open for business\".\nMost efficiently, motorized traffic would move on major roadways, with secondary roadways being used for local access and local traffic. Having cycling lanes reduce the capacity of major roadways means that through traffic ends up using secondary roadways. For example, with the bike lanes installed on Bloor Street east of downtown, Google Maps often now directs drivers to avoid Bloor Street for through traffic and use secondary or local roads instead.  While the most appropriate place for bike lanes may sometimes be on major roads, more consideration needs to be first seeing whether bike lanes could go along parallel secondary roads instead.\nA network of truck routes also needs to be to be protected to ensure freight can be delivered, etc. Some vehicle types like larger trucks, construction vehicles, fire trucks, etc. need the larger, wider roads with enough turning space, and it is more feasible to move the smaller bicycles than to move bus or truck routes. MTO has identified a Strategic Goods Movement network in its GGH plan, but I understand that even these roads are being considered to be switched in part to bike lanes, e.g. Kingston Road.\nHaving bike lanes on major roads makes the roads more confusing, with so many more things to watch out for, so much guided by painted lines that are hard to see in the rain at night. And the many bike lanes separated by bollards! Perhaps the bollards are a temporary step to provide bike lane separation until curbs or other treatments can be installed, but the bollards make so many of Toronto's streetscapes look so unattractive, especially the rows of damaged ones. I hope that other solutions can be developed to provide some separation for bike lanes when needed.\nCycling affects not only vehicular traffic but also transit riders, as often transit riders have to cross cycling lanes when getting on or off the vehicles. Cyclists often don't stop at lights and both cars and pedestrians as well as cars have to be extra careful to see whether what cyclists are doing at intersections.\nCycling lanes in Toronto are often used by e-bikes and e-scooters, e.g. by Uber Eats or other cycling couriers making deliveries. This doesn't seem appropriate to me. Guidance by the Province on what types of vehicles should use bike lanes would be helpful in the Highway Traffic  Act, so that it doesn't fall on municipalities to each define this for themselves.\nOther means to reduce gridlock include coordinating construction, i.e. making sure that all major parallel routes are not impacted by construction or other activities, and Toronto often has major parallel routes affected at the same time.\n"

        "comment": "In total agreement on removing bike lanes on Bloor W Street and other main streets in Toronto. It is unfortunate that our municipal government does not hear and act based on majority's opinion and majority's needs. Bike lanes need to be placed so that they do not create more obstacles in traffic.\nI live on Bloor Str W and I spend almost every day, at least 2 hours, walking on Bloor West Village. I see very few bikes, sometimes none. I always see cars idling  Polution? I see problems for disabled people, people with children in strollers etc. trying to get in and out of cars, trying to manage over concrete blocks. I see wasted infrastructure. The roads were designed for car traffic, we now have hatched areas used by no one. I drive a few ties a week from my home to my daughter's home on Royal York It takes me 30min minimum for 6km distance with few or no bikes. The only reason we don't have accidents is because there are very few bike lanes users. The car lane on Bloor Str W going east over the Humber River to the Jane street is a disaster. Whoever designed it should come back to look at the congestion there at any time during the day. I wrote to our Councillor last year asking many specific questions, one being: has anyone completed the study after the bike lanes have been installed to check and prove their goal. Do we know actually what was the goal? I don't. If the goal was more bikes, less cars (which would only be logical to assume as a valid goal)-it has not been achieved. Another very important issue-can emergency vehicles get through? Or do they now take side streets to avoid these main, which used to be 2 car lanes. I didn't get any meaningful response from the Councillor to these 2 questions.\nI think that a full transparency and post bike lanes traffic study should have already been completed by the Municipal Government, since it created so much opposing, strong views. It should not have created a political situation in which we are now.  I personally don't know anyone who is pro bike lanes on main Toronto streets.\nMy position on bike lanes is completely apolitical. I feel that, unfortunately, the Provincial Government had to step in.\n"
