I'm someone who has lived in Toronto for 10 years and who both bikes and drives a car very regularly in the city.\nI really don't believe that getting rid of bike lanes will reduce gridlock. I can tell you that the number of times a parked car or delivery driver has blocked a lane of traffic during rush hour would shock you. So no, getting rid of the bike lane to create two lanes of traffic instead of one won't actually fix the gridlock issue.\nThe problem isn't the bike lanes. It's cars parked where they aren't supposed to that ACTUALLY cause traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to affirm my strong opposition to this proposal. If passed, this will make building proper cycling infrastructure significantly more difficult and even forcibly rip out existing bike lanes which tens of thousands of people actively depend on. Despite this government claiming to be \u201cfor the taxpayers\u201d, they are going spend millions on destroying infrastructure which was approved in an extensive consultation process. It is extremely wasteful and insulting to see the tax money of Ontarians be used to forcibly destroy public infrastructure for no good reason.\nPreviously, this government said that it would respect the decisions made by local councils in regards to urban planning, particularly by not legalizing fourplexes province-wide. However, it seems that this government has forgotten that and they will instead be making decisions for local councils.\nFurthermore, commuting by bike has proven to be beneficial for one\u2019s fitness, sustainable for the environment and financially responsible. Cycling can also reduce gridlock for others as every person who chooses to bike is one less car on the road, and you don\u2019t need to spend billions on a tunnel underneath the 401 to do that. There are tens of thousands of people who want to cycle and will get out of their car to do it as their regular commute, but only if safe infrastructure is built to allow it. I\u2019m not saying that people should be forced out of their car and onto a bike, but rather that safe infrastructure should be available to those who would like to cycle, and that this government not impede the construction of such.\nAs for the government\u2019s claims of increased travel times and damage to small businesses, studies have shown that bike lane infrastructure does not significantly worsen car gridlock, and the Chief of Toronto Fire Services has confirmed that bike lanes do not negatively impact the response time of emergency services. Further, the Bloor Annex BIA has released a statement opposed to the removal of the bike lanes in their area, stating that they have been beneficial their businesses. Surely a government which constantly claims to support local small businesses would not put said businesses\u2019 bottom lines at risk by destroying infrastructure which helps drive customers.\nAgain, I would like to reiterate that I have appreciated this government\u2019s improvements to public transit infrastructure, but this type of bone-headed policy making is extremely concerning and makes me doubt my confidence in this government. Therefore, I strongly urge that ERO 019-9266 and Section 4 of Schedule 4 of Bill 212 be dropped immediately.\n"

The lower City already has enough gridlock which will only get worse with planned changes to Main and King streets. Further bike lanes will benefit few people and inconvenience many. I am a experienced cyclist and have ridden thousands of km's in the last ten years on roads and trails. I rarely feel threatened by cars but can't say the same about other cyclists. Many do not communicate their intentions to cars or other cyclists, they run stop signs, or are just too aggressive. Where possible, I avoid bike lanes.\n"

If I had to bike on the road, it would make the experience worse for drivers, and if I had to take a car, it'll be more traffic.\nIt does not make sense to me to tear down bike lanes that already exist. They're already there. We paid to build them, then we're paying to tear them down again? Even if the lanes were rebuild on side streets, why are we paying to rebuild something that already exists?\nThis just seems like a waste of tax payer dollars, and doesn't even solve the problem of traffic congestion. Removing the bike lanes would just mean more people would have to drive, and increase traffic congestion. Traffic is a big issue across the city and province, but I this is not the solution.\n"

This is by far the biggest contributor to traffic and accidents, putting pedestrians, drivers and cyclists at risk.  Removing on-street parking will add a whole lane to major city streets (I.e. bloor street) while maintaining safety infrastructure for cyclists.\nTry removing on-street parking first before removing existing cycle lane infrastructure.  You will see car traffic improve and much less congestion.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Bloor West Village in Toronto, I oppose this proposal for the following personal reasons:\n1) Safety. In particular on Bloor St. W., the changes to the road to accommodate bike lanes has improved safety for all road users - including pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. Before bike lanes drivers had too much road space and were using Bloor as a highway, travelling at high rates of speed through my residential neighbourhood of Bloor West Village. I was nervous crossing Bloor St. as a pedestrian with my children. The bike lanes have had the effect of calming traffic and reducing their speed. I feel safer now on Bloor St. as a pedestrian.\n2) Car travel times haven't changed that much. I regularly travel by car along Bloor westward through Etobicoke and, although traffic does get backed up at lights, it moves. My commuting times westward are not much different than they were pre-bike lanes. Note that when I need to travel downtown and I'm not biking, I usually take the Bloor subway line. I know that (car) traffic in the central part of Toronto is horrible due to volume and the many infrastructure projects underway - so I avoid it by taking the TTC. If drivers on Bloor aren't happy with their commuting times, and they are able to, they should consider doing the same - it would be a benefit to everyone!\n3) It's not going to change anything. My daughter plays competitive soccer so I'm constantly driving her and her teammates around the GTA to practices and games. And we are CONSTANTLY in traffic - on the 401, on Jane Street, on Lawrence, on Eglinton, on South Kingsway, on Kipling, on the 404, on the 400, on Lakeshore, on the Gardner, on the DVP, in Brampton, Milton, Mississauga, Etobicoke, Scarborough, Aurora, Markham, yes, and on Bloor too. It. Is. Infuriating. But bike lanes have very little to do with this, and while removing the Bloor bike lanes may reduce our driving time by a few minutes when we are travelling west on Bloor, I suspect the reduction will be short-lived, and it's not going to do anything to help our drive time on the other, longer segments of our commute. There are just too many drivers on our roads - we need to give people more options for getting where they need to go - i.e. better infrastructure, including transit - not take options away.\n4) Cyclists Get in the Way of Drivers - as a driver, I prefer to have cyclists out of my way. When cyclists are commingled with traffic, they cause unexpected traffic slowdowns because cars all need to pass the cyclists. This is dangerous for both cyclists and drivers.\n5) Removing a Transportation Option for me - the extension of the Bloor bike lanes westward into my neighbourhood has meant that I now bike places that I used to drive to. I feel safe enough to bike towards downtown for an appointment, I feel safe enough to bike to High Park with my kids. Previously, without the separated bike lanes, I would have driven my family where we needed to go rather than bike there. The bike lanes have done their job of turning a driver into a cyclist when possible - and it will do the same for others. Over time, this will get some drivers onto bikes, leaving more space on the road for people who have to drive. If the Bloor bike lanes go, I will be forced back into my car for some of the trips that I need to take eastward along Bloor.\n6) Red Tape - the Premier has stated many times that he opposes red tape. This bill introduces red tape to all future road infrastructure projects. Why does the province need to get involved in municipal infrastructure decisions? It's adding layers of paper pushing, review, discussion and signoffs at 2 levels of government. Why?? The province should be focused on provincial initiatives like health care and education and highways (lots of traffic there that needs to be dealt with!). A good premier should delegate, not ADD red tape to the already inefficient tendencies of government.\n7) Lack of Data Analysis in Decision - I am an actuary by profession and regularly do statistical analysis as part of my job. I see statistics being floated around that only 1.2% of people bike to work vs. 70% of cars. Where is this statistic from? I've looked but haven't been able to find the source. What year of study? Toronto statistics from 2022 suggest 2% commute by bike and 60% by car. But taking a Toronto-wide statistic is flawed in itself when the majority of commuters in this statistic are coming from outside of central Toronto, where there is very little to no bike infrastructure - how could people outside of central Toronto commute to work if there aren't bike lanes for them to commute on? Further, why are only commuters being taken into consideration - what about people, including children, who bike to school? What about people who bike to activities or social events or for errands? I don't respect a decision that isn't based on proper, data-driven, and forward-looking analysis.\n8) Waste of Taxpayer Dollars - this is a rash response to infrastructure that is barely a year old. The roll-out of the western section of the Bloor bike lanes was completed very recently. It is such a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars to rip this out without giving residents, commuters, and the city a chance to adapt and make it work. Let the city try to implement changes that will get traffic on Bloor West moving a bit faster - they have ideas, they are willing to work with the province, what is the harm in letting them try?! Let's move forward, not backward! Let's not waste the taxpayers' money!!\n"

        "comment": "Hi all, I can't believe we're having this conversation again. I've included a link to \"induced demand,\" a phenomenon that applies to transportation planning which quotes one city planner: \"the great intellectual black hole in city planning, the one professional certainty that every thoughtful person seems to acknowledge, yet almost no one is willing to act upon.\"\nAdding bicycle lanes results in more cyclists on the road, as a City News article found in 2024. Cyclists do not appear out of nowhere however; a person on a bicycle is one less person driving a car, which has the net impact of reducing the amount of traffic for commuters who have no choice but to use a car. For some commuters, a car will always be necessary, and so the best proven way to reduce traffic for these drivers is to give everyone else alternative means. Public transit and cycling are two such alternatives. If there were no such alternatives, there would be more drivers on the road, increasing congestion. Removing bicycle lanes to make room for more cars on the other hand increases traffic for car drivers for two reasons:\n* It induces demand for cars\n* It reduces demand for bicycles\nEqually importantly, I do not understand why the province is adding more red tape to city planning. How is the province of Ontario expected to efficiently review and approve all such bicycle lane installations without holding up municipal public works projects? The most optimistic answer I can think of is that it will drastically slow things down. A more cynical take, however, is that the intent of this bill is to make cities think twice about installing bicycle lanes in order to avoid this red tape. Whether or not that is the intent of the bill, that is how it will work, something the province must surely know.\nIn the neighbourhoods I grew up in, I rode my bike as often as possible. The cycling infrastructure gradually improved and each year I noticed more bicycles on the road. I never thought much of it until I moved to another neighbourhood with poor cycling infrastructure. Here, it's very difficult to get around without a car, and so we were forced to buy one. I do not enjoy owning a car. It is expensive to own, expensive to maintain, expensive to insure, and takes up a lot of space. What's more, it doesn't even get me anywhere quickly, because the roads are full of cars and parking is difficult to find. Occasionally I'm still able to use my bicycle to go somewhere and it's actually faster. When I ride my bicycle, I am also reducing traffic for people who must drive their car. I can't repeat this often enough: better bicycle infrastructure makes car infrastructure better too.\nIn summary:\n* Please do not remove the bike lanes proposed by this bill. You will make traffic worse for car drivers, as well as making it worse and more dangerous for cyclists.\n* Please do not involve yourselves unasked in municipal transportation planning. That is not the province's role. At best you are adding red tape and more gravy to the process; at worst, you are disincentivizing better city planning.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto's current bikelane infrastructure is essential to providing a safe, convenient method of travel for city residents. My rent is so astronomically high that I cannot afford to own a car, nor do I have a parking spot for a car. My electric bike gets me to my office in twenty minutes when the bus/subway takes 40 minutes. If none of us could bike anymore driving a car to work would take even longer in increased traffic. Research clearly shows that adding car lanes does NOT reduce traffic... case in point the 401. It barely snows anymore in Toronto so cycling has become an affordable all-season transit method for me. It is BONKERS in 2024 to take away bike lanes in a major city instead of adding more. Doug Ford and company, stop trying to force everyone to drive just because you do. This is unfathomable and outrageous. I've always been conservative but you're working real hard to get me to vote liberal here.\n"

While removing them may help reduce gridlock for vehicles, it will ultimately hinder the progress towards zero-emissions. If we remove the bike lanes, the public no longer have a safe way to choose cycling as their preferred transportation.\nCities should be incorporating more cycling friendly infrastructure regardless of gridlock, and focus on safety of all travellers. They should also take into account the future throughput that might be required and plan accordingly for this, rather than try to correct it afterwards.\n"
