        "comment": "Could you please provide some evidence on how this would actually reduce congestion?\nI am also confused about the name of this act. I live in Barrhaven (Ottawa suburb) and I bike commute year round. I do not have the option to drive to work. I have a 20 minute bike commute, 65 minute walk, or 60+ minute bus/walk. Forcing me to use a different option would triple my commute time. I am very nervous about what would happen if the bike lanes in my community were removed. I would still be biking, but I would have to take up a whole lane, and I am not fast. With the bike lanes, I don\u2019t have to impede traffic.\nIt\u2019s weird to me that you would prioritize a very exclusive mode of transportation. Not everyone can afford a vehicle, and not everyone is legally able to drive (eg youth).\n"

        "comment": "Other than everybody knows how bike lanes makes for safer biking, and that many cannot afford car or TTC anyways- removing them will not change this fact, I have to understand why in 2024 we still allow non residential car to enter the downtown core.\nIn Italy this is forbidden for as long as I can remember. Shuttle buses for small cities or Bus collect drivers from parking lots outside the city center and brings them conveniently downtown. This helps with pollution and general livability of city center for residents, tourists and workers.\nCars that enter downtown for non resident and non permit holders get highly fined.\nIn norther Europe they have a cold climate as well but they figured well biking into the cities. See Amsterdam above all.\nPeople will be better able to reach shops by biking than having to find a parking spot.\nBus commutes get 2-3 times longer with more cars into the city.\nPeople have to spend long time in commuting in and out the city. Way more people would fit into a single bus, leaving the road free.\nEvery km biked add to one's own health, and every Km driving removes to one's own health, which helps with our declining health system quality.\nWho is really gaining from this move in the end?\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen, I use multiple modes of tranportation: walking, biking, bus/streetcar/subway, and driving. Keeping the bike lanes is of the utmost importance to me regardless of the method I am using at a given time, because (1) they are space-efficient and reduce congestion in other modalities, (2) they increase the safety of streets by reducing traffic speeds, and (3) they are better for the environment (fewer fuel emissions, less wear and tear and maintenance required). I imagine you know all of this, though, because the transportation experts working in government would have told you these and other findings. Yet this government still want to mandate that municipally installed and paid for bike lanes be removed, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a waste of public funds and oversteps the bounds of the provincial government. The suggestion that bike lanes be built on nearby streets is ridiculous, as (1) believe it or not, people want to bike to places that are on main streets, and need infrastructure to make that safe, (2) nearby streets, particularly in a city like Toronto, are winding and add extensive distances to trips. Both of these factors disincentivize people to actually use the infrastructure. As someone who cycles in Toronto to places on main streets, removing the bike lanes will not remove me from the main street. And of course I will not sacrifice myself to riding in the door gutter as vehicles try to squeeze around me at illegally-close distances. Instead, I will ride as a \"vehicular cyclist,\" taking up an entire lane as is my legal right. Enjoy the resulting congestion!\n"

        "comment": "I am OPPOSED to Bill 212 for the following reasons.  Please DO NOT pass this bill.\nWhat's wrong with the bill\nIt won't reduce gridlock or save you time. Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place.\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nThis move is out of line with other provincial priorities, such as growth targets, efforts to boost transit, and the current e-scooter micromobility pilot program.\nWhy we need more (not fewer) bike lanes\nA few key reasons why municipalities across Ontario have committed to building bike lanes:\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\nBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\nReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nCycling is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life, reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nThere is a wealth of evidence in support of building bike lanes, some of which has been summarized in Stuckless Consulting \u201cActive Transportation Benefits Research Tracker\u201d.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is called Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act -- an ironic name to an Act which seems the be based on ill-informed and bias opinion, rather than based in facts or on any traffic studies. It completely negates road safety and the fact that streets with bike lanes are safer for everyone; drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The Ford government has not put forth any logical argument that can be substantiated, but is interfering unjustifiably in municipal democracy and governance. Leave the traffic management in the hands of municipal traffic specialists, and if the Ford Government wants to help Ontario cities alleviate the road congestion, then it should fund public transit, support efficient commuting alternatives and incentivize reducing the number of vehicles on the road! The average vehicle takes up the space of a small living room on city streets AND again when parked - multiply that by half a million and there's your traffic congestion.\nGive people safe travel options, not box us in cars.\n"

If this government has respect for taxpayers as they often claim, they will cancel this proposal.\nI want to note that I am not even a cyclist, but as a commuter in this city (by TTC, walking, and driving) I appreciate infrastructure that safely seperates these forms of transport and works to offer alternatives that get as many cars off the road as possible. Bike lanes are a method of getting cars off the road, NOT simply adding new lanes and inducing further demand.\nIf the provincial government insists on adding more lanes, it should be at the expense of inefficient on street parking, not bike lanes that keep this city moving. I urge you in the strongest terms to reconsider this policy.\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting on this proposed legislation in my capacity as a private individual and resident of Ottawa.\nI strongly disagree with the proposed changes to the Highway Traffic Act.\nThe last thing that we need is one more layer of bureaucracy in making changes to our local infrastructure. In our city, many protected bike lanes are installed in direct response to tragic, unnecessary deaths when a cyclist is run over by a car or truck. Rather than simply lamenting the tragedy, we respond by changing the built environment, thus preventing future tragedies. Taking away our ability to decide immediately on the right, local solution in specific circumstances is a waste of both our and the provincial bureaucracy\u2019s time. The insanity of actually removing protected bike lanes that have already been built would be both a waste of money and would re-introduce fatal risk into our city.\nIn our family, we use all modes of transportation that we can. We walk to school and work, I get groceries using a cargo bike, my teenaged children bike or use public transportation to get to their extracurricular activities where it is feasible to do so, and we drive to visit friends in the suburbs or to get our children to activities that they can\u2019t get themselves to. I would love for us to be able to bike more and to drive my children less; every single place that I or my children can get ourselves to by bike or public transport is one less car on the road. I want to do my part to reduce traffic congestion and also build more regular exercise into my day, but this is only possible by having protected bike lanes. Reducing a road by one lane to allow safe cycling in both directions (bike lanes are much narrower than car lanes) will reduce traffic congestion on every single road we use (just my children and their friends cycling together would probably take four cars off the road on a regular basis).\nAs a driver, I also would much rather have bikes in their own, protected lanes. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about hitting a cyclist while I drive, just as I do not want to worry about getting hit when I bike.\nIn short, every city needs to be able to figure out for itself how to allow its residents to get safely everywhere they need to go. When it comes to the local balance between walking, cycling, public transportation and driving on a road-by-road basis, the province can and should leave it to each city to decide.\nThank you for your time and attention.\n"

I can confidently say that the only efficient way I ever found to move across the city is on a bicycle. I'm also someone who has been doored by a car (driver was found at fault). Please do not remove bike lanes if there had been one for me to use I wouldn't have been hit.\nI strongly believe that removing bike lanes will not solve congestion since you won't be removing bikes from roads. The cost of living, speed, efficiency, environmental stewardship and recreation is going to keep people using their bikes. Nothing will become faster for drivers if they are forced to wait behind a bike going 20km/hr. Leave bikes their own lane, keep people safe and allow cars to move freely beside the bikes.\nIf we want to make Toronto roads SAFER and FASTER please expedite ongoing construction projects that clog up lanes of traffic. Buy back the 407 and alleviate traffic into the city! There are no bikelanes slowing down 400 series highways!\n"
