        "comment": "I am in support of the bill. The data that the City of Toronto uses is biased to biking. In a recent public meeting about Bloor bike lanes the City stated delays as being 4 minutes on average. This does not include delays getting onto Bloor or people like myself that now use residential streets to avoid Bloor. This includes not going to restaurants on Bloor as my wife has severe knee problems and cannot walk long distances, with parking reduced.\nThe real benefits and costs of bike lanes needs to be measured not biased.\nWe need traffic moving in the GTHA to encourage and support business in particular with more business wanting their workforce back in the office.\nThank you Doug Ford for bringing back sanity to this unfortunately divisive debate.\n"

        "comment": "This is dumb.   Seriously.  As a driver you know what slows me down? When I have to give space to a cyclist in front of me to maintain their safety and my own.  If you make it difficult to add bike lanes cyclists are still going to be there except they will be in traffic instead of in their own space.\nOr they will be up on sidewalks then risking hitting pedestrians.  Also why waste municipality time by forcing them to collect data and provide it to the province?  Municipalities are far more aware of their community than the province.\nThis is just creating unnecessary oversight by the province.\n"

        "comment": "I do not like this proposal.\nIn general, a strong bike network will reduce motor vehicle traffic as more cars are off the road and the remaining vehicles can achieve better efficiency even with fewer lanes. This can be seen in many studies across the globe.\nIf the province throws a wrench in the plans and stops existing bicycle lanes to become more connected with new lanes (thus leaving the smaller separated networks that are useful to exponentially less people), the province will create a \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d situation.\nMore bike lanes is part of the solution to traffic, not the enemy. Speed up the bike lane and separated public transit lane process, do not slow it down.\nTrust the cities to handle their traffic.\nUse evidence based studies to make informed decisions, not voter base opinions.\n"

All the evidence says bike lanes DO NOT cause congestion, they actually reduce the number of cars on the road because people can bike instead of drive. Even if they did, the massive improvement in safety would be worth it. Far too many people are killed by driver when biking. Doug Ford should be ashamed, there will be blood (and longer commute times - since that seems to be all he cares about) on his hands.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill embodies many things that the Ford office has stood for throughout its tenure. It represents a horrible regression in policy and legislation, as well as a grossly irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars and public servant resources. Not to mention the downstream labour overhead requirements for municipalities within the province if passed. This bill expresses Fords disregard for Ontarian's who are unable to drive due to financial, or accessible reasons. It also will not solve the congestion problem and there is no meed to elaborate on this. The notion that car is king is something that needs to be phased out for a plethora of reasons not limited to our emissions commitments as a country tied to our ability to address the climate crisis, solving the traffic problem in our cities, addressing the chronic illness crisis western nations are experiencing, and restoring vibrant communities. This bill is a step back in the wrong direction. While so many cities around the world are moving towards developing active and alternative transportation, Doug Ford is single handedly pushing Ontario backwards.\nTo summarize, this bill will not address the problem its attempting to solve, it excludes a significant part of the population of Ontario, will put burden on the already tight budgets of municipalities, is an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars and public servant labour, is moving on the wrong side of progress, will hinder our ability to address the climate crisis, and just downright doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nI urge this party to not consider this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this Act.\nThis Act is irresponsible, imprudent, counter to the data, and bordering on micromanagement of municipal governance. Moreover, it is dangerous and myopic. The focus is on improving vehicular traffic congestion but does not acknowledge the large and significant number of citizens who are cyclists and/or use scooters to get to and from work in a much more efficient and faster manner. Also, the bike lanes were recently installed on university Avenue which took years of construction and millions of tax payer dollars. This Act will reverse that decision and easte even more money. Similar pattern with this government's unnecessary need to change the license plates in a hurry only to reverse it because they did not do the due diligence to understand the clear ramifications. Similar to the way this government paid millions for highest 413 signs prematurely only change them at the tax payers expense.\nIrresponsible and irrational spending needs to be held accountable.\n"

I fully support the provincial government stepping in when municipalities are not using taxpayer funds prudently.\nI am a Toronto (and Ontario and Canadian) taxpayer.  I fully support the provincial government stepping in when municipalities are not using taxpayer funds prudently.\nThe expansion of bike lanes throughout Toronto is a massive waste of limited taxpayer funds which could have been put to better use such as looking after homeless people, dealing with mental health issues including rampant drug addictions and dealing with rising crime. These are the priorities.\nBike lanes in Toronto are rarely used, notwithstanding any fabricated data and certainly not enough to justify the costs to the majority of Toronto citizens. One has only to look at bike lanes on main roads like Bloor St. Very few people use bike lanes and even fewer use them when it\u2019s hot, cold or raining.  The reduction of driving lanes has caused significant congestion. The traffic congestion has become a danger to those who need emergency services where emergency vehicles cannot get through in a timely manner.  Added to this, buses cannot run on efficient schedules.\nFinally, car drivers are spending so much added time in traffic making the frustration levels increase.  Car horns are common place. Motorcycles frequently lane split and put lives and property at risk. The city is trying to implement a war on cars - added to bike lanes, speed limits throughout Toronto have been reduced. For example, The Queensway, two lanes going east and two lanes going west is 40kmh maximum. I cannot understand how this is justifiable! Please expand your purview into speed limits as well.\nPlease, help!\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely terrible policy that should not be considered. As someone who is unable to drive, due to a disability, I rely on biking to get to work and move around Toronto. The separated bike lanes such as those on College, University, and Bloor are some of the best infrastructure that exists in this city and should be the standard used to rapidly expand the biking network. Having more commuters bike results in fewer drivers, this means not only helping meet Ontario's carbon emission goals but also fewer cards congesting roads. If a bike lane does not exist on a road, then when I cycle I am forced to bike in the same lanes as cars. This forces cars to drive slowly behind me and increases tension, frustration, and opportunities for injuries. Separating bikes from cars is better for everyone! We have seen more cyclists killed due to being hit by cars. Bike lanes, reduce pollution, help mitigate climate change, provide freedom of movement for everyone, and stop cyclists from being killed.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to Bill 212, which seeks to prevent the construction of new bike lanes in Toronto and potentially dismantle existing ones. As a resident of Parkdale and a daily bike commuter, this issue affects me personally, particularly the proposed removal of the bike lane on Bloor West. This route is vital not only for my daily commute but also for countless others who rely on it as one of the few usable east-west cycling corridors in the city.\nThe Bloor bike lane has been successful in promoting safe cycling and has become increasingly popular among users. Removing it will not only worsen traffic congestion\u2014already a critical issue in Toronto\u2014but will also compromise safety for cyclists, potentially leading to more accidents.\nFord's arguments against bike lanes are frankly ridiculous, and have no basis in reality. Dedicated bike lanes can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, which is essential for managing congestion. To argue that it's bike lanes and not CARS that cause congestion is absurd, totally absurd. He is using this as a wedge issue, and turning something that should be strictly about policy into a \"left-right\" ideological issue.  There is nothing left or right wing about alternative options to get to work.\nAlso, ripping out these bike lanes represents a massive waste of taxpayer dollars and effort, especially considering the city has already invested significant resources in designing and building them. It is baffling that the provincial government is opting to divert funding away from meaningful solutions for transportation, healthcare, and housing while targeting bike lanes as a scapegoat for the city\u2019s congestion woes.\nThe arguments against bike lanes frequently overlook their benefits. Dedicated bike lanes can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, which is essential for managing congestion. It\u2019s important to recognize that cyclists will continue to ride, regardless of whether bike lanes are present. In fact, many drivers will likely prefer having designated lanes for bikes, as it allows for safer and more predictable travel.\nDrivers who oppose bike lanes aren't understanding that we will still be here, bike lanes or not. This policy will make their commutes more frustrating, not less. Cyclists who return to their cars because they now feel unsafe will contribute to further congestion, while those who continue to ride will be in the way, forcing drivers to be hyper-vigilant of our presence instead of having us safely \"tucked\" away in dedicated lanes.\nThis situation also exemplifies a significant overreach by the provincial government. While technically allowed to override the city, it makes little sense for the province to micromanage municipal road infrastructure. The city has already developed a comprehensive plan\u2014the Cycling Network 2025-2027 Implementation Program\u2014into which time, expertise, and funding have been invested. It raises the question: why would someone in Kingston even care about bike lanes in Toronto? Bike lanes should be managed by the city, where local needs and conditions can be best understood and addressed.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not lost on anyone that two of the bike lanes Doug Ford wants to eliminate\u2014Bloor and University\u2014are routes he himself uses to commute to work.  This is an autocratic and plainly corrupt use of his position.\n"

Any person with a modicum of intelligence knows that bike lanes have higher throughput than car lanes - I advise the government to watch YouTube channels like \"Not Just Bikes\" or \"Strong Towns\" to educate themselves.
