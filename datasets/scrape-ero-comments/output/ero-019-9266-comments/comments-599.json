        "comment": "I am vehemently opposed Bill 212 or any other measure that would reduce or restrict the number of dedicated bike lanes in Ontario.  If the government wants to tackle the issue of traffic gridlock or congestion, start with the facts.  Look at any congested street in the province and you\u2019ll see a full 67% of vehicles have a single occupant.  THIS IS WHERE CONGESTION COMES FROM.  Want to end congestion?  Encourage motorists to take one other passenger.\nEncouraging cycling is part of the solution for ending traffic congestion.  However to encourage cyclists you have to make is safe for them.  Here in Ottawa we have worked for decades to encourage cyclists and it\u2019s paid off.  We have doubled the number of people who commute by bicycle in the past decade.  We have worked too hard to see this progress reversed - NO TO Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Great cities around the world are removing CAR lanes, not bike lanes, because areas with fewer cars have improved quality of life- better quality of air, more greenspace, and improved access to shopping and other services. A parked car takes up the space which would hold 15-20 bikes.\nAs temperatures rise in Canada, cycling is increasingly a perfectly viable commuting solution for millions across the country.  Many cyclists ride all year round.\nIt has been proven across the world that adding lanes for cars does not ease congestion.\nThose who ride bicycles are healthier human beings, placing less of a burden on the health care system.\nThe city of Copenhagen, Denmark provides perfect examples.  There are more bicycles than people in Copenhagen, and the city's sustainable urban development relies on bike infrastructure.  Cycling is fast, convenient, healthful, inexpensive  and climate friendly. Cycle super highways are already a reality, leading cyclists in and out of the city from as far as 15 kilometres away. Cycling accounts for 49% of all commuting trips. 25% of all school children cycle to school. 9/10 Danes own a bicycle (so the culture is not only in Copenhagen).  By the way, it snows in Copenhagen in December, January and February, and in March.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely disgraceful piece of policy. All scientific evidence clearly shows that bike lanes help to mitigate congestion. Rather than wasting our hard earned tax payers money on removing bike lanes that are part of the solution, why not use that money to actually solve the root problem - public transit. Disgusting divisive politics by Doug Ford who I used to support. This will come back to bite his re-election efforts, as will the $2B being paid back in $200 cheques. It is remarkably sad that these are the politicians representing the people. What a fall from grace.\n"

I do not understand how the safety and well being of cyclists like me does not matter to the Provincial government.  Removing these bike lanes will jeopardize the safety of all cyclists who use these corridors and will do little to alleviate automobile congestion.   In my opinion, removing these lanes will jeopardize the safety and well being of urban cyclists, waste an enormous amount of public funds and do little-if anything- to address the frustrations of motorists.\n"

        "comment": "I am an 81-year-old woman who has a medical condition that makes me housebound and for which I have been awaiting treatment for over a year with no end in sight. In order to live somewhat independently, I use my car, going out only when I have not eaten for many hours, in order to pick up what I need or go to doctors' and dentists' appointments. I do not use a bicycle, nor have I for many long years!\nI travel on University often as I have four doctors at Mt. Sinai. I also use Bloor and Yonge a lot to get to many destinations I have to reach. I live on Bathurst north of St. Clair, where there are no bicycle lanes and where it is very treacherous for both drivers and cyclists as the four lanes of traffic are dense almost 24/7. There I have to slow down often in order not to hit a cyclist in my lane, including the many who are doing deliveries on bikes.\nI was recently driving west along Bloor and this is what I thought. I was so relieved that the cyclists were in their own lane, and not weaving in and out as they often do, so that drivers have no idea where they are, or sharing one lane, so that drivers must slow to cyclists' speed in order to avoid hitting them. I could see them coming up behind me easily from my right mirror, so could be careful when we all got to a light at one time. I noticed that there were way more cyclists than drivers that day. They took up by far much less space on the road than the cars. (And 90% of the cars were carrying one person, just as the bicycles were.) I thought, if cyclists are stopping to shop on Bloor, their vehicles are easy to park compared to cars and again take up much less space.  I also felt that all of us should have the right to shop on Bloor, and the businesses there should have the right to serve all of us, whether we are on foot, on a bicycle, or arriving by car.\nWhen I got to Bathurst, where I and many others were turning right to go north, there was a clearly marked lane swap. I could make sure not to get into that right lane near the intersection, just as a cyclist was moving left to get into the lane to cross the intersection. I just had to look at my mirror and look over my shoulder and then make my move when it was safe. Simple.\nApart from the fallacies promoted by drivers who want to essentially 'hog' the road for themselves only, including the highly questionable figures on ratio of drivers to cyclists, I resent the Province interfering in a decision so clearly not in their bailiwick or level of concern, in my opinion. This is a City decision. The Province has 'bigger fish to fry' as we used to say when I was a child.\nSome of the things the Province might consider addressing, instead of bike lanes put in for the safety of all, are the wait times for health care; the quality of the Toronto waterfront, where they have also interfered, for those who cannot afford summer cottages; the cost and supply of rental housing; the fact that double the number of people have to get their food from food banks than a year ago; the parks full of homeless with nowhere else to go, etc. Why are they horning in on bike lane decisions in order to create a huge safety hazard and cost, as they are removed, and an ongoing hazard afterwards, instead of attending to what should be their responsibilities? It reminds me of cancelling half the ridings in the city during an election, thereby increasing the costs of the ones left to double what they had been and creating more backlogs in service for city responses.\nSo I have said more than enough. Back off on the bike lane legislation and get back to the 'business' of our safety by ensuring a decent healthcare system, which is the business of the Province for sure!\n"

        "comment": "In my opinion the removal of bike lanes is a step backward with respect to encouraging the use of alternative transportation strategies and forgoing the use of personal motor vehicles within the confines of urban areas. Time spent in Amsterdam, Netherlands has proven bicycles alone with foot and public transportation is a solution to gridlock in densely populated urban areas. I\u2019ve seen the same apply in Dubrovnik, Croatia and Edinburgh, Scotland. In essence we do not have space to store all these vehicles in densely populated areas. I personally have a room, the size of a one car garage. I can effectively store/park over 20 bicycles in that space. Money should be spent on expanding public transportation networks and not making any further accommodations for private motor vehicles.\n"

This proposed bill flies in the face of what could only be described as sane governance. Cyclists and people who use bike lanes are a boon to us all,  not a negative. I have seen people hit by cars because they do not have the infrastructure to bike safely. When the provincial government states that there isn't enough people currently cycling to warrant the use of bike lanes, I say that is because they are too scared to be there on the road with trucks the size of tanks and half the visibility. No one wants to take away your right to drive, and driving in then city is going to suck regardless of their being bike lanes or not. Please actually listen to anyone with an education for once in your tenure as those in charge of governing Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, Framework for Bike Lands is government overreach and an assault on local democracy with no evidence that it will alleviate congestion.\nTruly world class cities and regions are embracing active transportation and public transportation, recognizing the primacy of the personal automobile has no place in a modern mega-region. Car dependency is economically inefficient, environmentally destructive and socially isolating. In a city like Toronto, bike lanes save lives, improve business on main streets and provide a safe means to get from point a to b that is cheaper, greener and healthier.\nThe residents of Toronto voted for a municipal Council that has voted for its cycling network plan, so the idea that the province will overrule local democracy is reprehensible.\nThis is cynical wedge politics with no basis in evidence.\nThis proposal will risk lives, cost money and not improve congestion. If bike lanes were truly the cause of congestion than why does every street and highway without a single bike lane also have congestion. This isn't common sense, it is the opposite. The problem is cars.\nI urge the government to listen to the experts on real solutions to congestion, like congestion pricing, more frequent and reliable public transportation, less low density sprawl development and more active transportation. Do not take Ontario backwards, while risking lives. This is not good governance or smart decision-making.\nReferences: https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-250545\u2026\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bike-share-toronto-ridership-rec\u2026.\n"

The data shows that bike lanes are not responsible for the traffic issues and year over year more people are choosing to ride now that the safer bike lanes are an option. I mean Doug Ford himself back in 2017.\nPlease don't make our city go backwards. Biking is affordable, better for the environment and a great way to get around the city. This move won't 'reduce gridlock' it definitely won't save bikers time and I doubt it will have much effect on drivers either.\nPlease use our tax dollars to help our Ontario progress and not waste our money on this pandering move.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI cycle to work every day, and do our household shopping by bicycle as well. All of these trips are relatively short distance, under 5 km, one-way.\nUntil bike lanes were installed, these travel routines were much riskier and more distressing. There was confusion between cyclists and drivers sharing lanes. After installation, all that confusion went away, resulting in less anxiety for me, and I assume for other cyclists as well as vehicle drivers.\nIf there is a collision between a vehicle and a bicycle, the cyclist will suffer one hundred percent of the impact. The City of Toronto notes that over the last ten years, \"28 people have been killed and 380 people have been seriously injured while cycling in the City of Toronto. 68% of these collisions took place on streets without safe cycling accommodations.\"\nAs a result of the installation of bike lanes, my wife has felt it safe enough in the city to resume cycling again after many years avoiding it due to fear of injury. She purchased a bike and we now enjoy pedalling around town together -- shopping, visiting cafes, and so on. We are both in our 60s, and cycling gives us a real benefit in physical fitness, while combined with practicality.\nRipping out the bike lanes will be very expensive, and it will also waste the City's previous investment, including extensive and thorough research. The effect will not be to relieve congestion, as the Province assumes. The City's research does not support that assumption, which is evidence-free. As the City notes, removing the bike lanes will generate \"likely minimal improvements in travel time.\" Further, \"The experience in Toronto has been that while travel times for people driving are sometimes found to increase immediately following the installation of bike lanes that impact motor vehicle lanes, once further adjustments are made to optimize operations, the long-term impacts to travel time for\ndrivers are generally minor.\"\nIn other words, removing the bike lanes would waste millions of taxpayer dollars to achieve, at best, minor improvements in congestion at the same time significantly increasing the risk of serious injuries and death for cyclists. These are the economic and safety arguments for bike lanes; I haven't included the environmental benefits of bike lanes, and their effect of encouraging more people to take up bicycling instead of driving, for example.\nI would add that even if one is not in favour of bike lanes, Bill 212 does damage to local democracy. Toronto citizens voted for certain Counsellors, and those Counsellors overwhelmingly support bike lanes, for a multitude of reasons. Bill 212 is reckless: with public money; with safety; with environmental conditions our children will inherit without getting a say; with the democratic process.\nPlease reconsider and withdraw this irresponsible, evidence-free Bill.\nThank you.\n"
