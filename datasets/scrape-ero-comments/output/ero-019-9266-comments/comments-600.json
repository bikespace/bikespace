        "comment": "if bike lanes are removed, then I assume there\u2019ll be a lot more cars on the road. Will one extra lane be enough to accommodate that? I believe cyclists are actually already mitigating the gridlock problem because they can use bike lanes/infrastructure.\nAdditionally, the bike lanes on University Ave. are large enough for emergency vehicles. Consider that there are four major hospitals on University and how traffic will affect emergency vehicle drive times and health outcomes of citizens.\nLastly, there\u2019s confusion over why the provincial government is concerned with municipal matters. Justification would be appreciated.\n"

        "comment": "Bloor St is better with bike lanes. This bill unfairly prioritizes the needs of people living outside of Toronto over those who live and work here. The provincial government should not interfere with municipal decisions, especially when they are failing to provide the basic services the provincial government is actually mandated to provide (education, healthcare, regional transit). Moreover, the entire province pays the price when the provincial government wastes 48 million dollars of our tax dollars to pay for these unnecessary changes, when the money would be better spend on improving regional transit, education, or healthcare.\nI live on Bloor St, it is my home address. I watched the current bike lanes being installed and I see them in use every day. Even if I'm not riding a bike myself, I see the benefits every day. They provide additional space and protection between pedestrians and moving vehicles, they improve the flow of local goods and services being delivered, and they offer a healthy option for people to commute to and from downtown.\nBloor St. is not a highway, it's my neighbourhood. When I go out on my balcony or open my windows, it's just a little quieter and more pleasant with 2 lanes of traffic vs. 4. With current zoning and development plans slated to have so much growth on Bloor in the coming decades, it will be the neighbourhood for a lot more people. Removing bike lanes now would be extremely shortsighted as this corridor becomes more and more dense with residents.\nThis bill is yet another disappointing example of the current provincial government seeking to interfere in municipal policy, where they are simply not equipped or qualified or mandated to understand the needs of the people. Everyone in business understands you want issues to be solved by the people closest to the problem, not by the people who happen to have the most power.\nIt's also another disappointing example of pandering to the Conservative party base who live in the suburbs surrounding Toronto and vote to keep this government in power. Removal of bike lanes on University, Yonge, and Bloor would not only put people's lives directly in danger, it will also FAIL solve the problem of gridlock, as the streets will simply fill with more cars.\nIf the province was actually interested in serving the needs of the people, they would take the 48 million dollars it would take to completely disrupt traffic to remove the bike lanes and instead invest it making the EXISTING transit actually reliable, usable, and desirable. You're proposing to add more cars to the exact same roads we should already see reduced volume on if we had properly funded public transit on the existing subway lines.\nWe would also be much better off if you had delivered on promises to improve and increase GO transit (just a reminder that GO stands for Government of Ontario) -- a service you already have complete control over improving, making desirable, which would ACTUALLY have an impact on gridlock.\nPlease ask the government to spend a little less time thinking of ways to pander to the Conservative base and spend a little more time on actually improving the lives of all Ontarians. Get more people out of their cars, and provide better public transit.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is deeply upsetting to me and I feel I must speak up as it affects me personally because I am a cyclist. I've only been cycling since the start of the COVID pandemic and have fallen in love with this method of transportation since I have found it to be liberating and empowering. As a woman, I plan my trips around accessibility to bike lanes because it's the only way I feel safe getting around on my own power.  When I bike from point A to point B, I inevitably make stops along the way at businesses that are on my route and I find this easy and convenient and it's not something I would do if I were taking transit. I have never been a driver and so for me this is also an issue of accessibility and affordability. Having a vehicle is a privilege many of us don't have and we cannot be passed over in favor of those who drive. It is infuriating that bike lanes are being blamed for problems that are actually complex and mostly caused by car density. The benefits of cycling are not only personal (including time efficiency, financial savings, and physical exercise for better health), but also social and environmental. We need our elected leaders to inspire us all to do better and be better for the good of our communities, our cities and the world, one person at a time. Cycling should be encouraged and given the credit it deserves in helping fight some of the issues our cities face such as traffic gridlock and pollution. Separate bike lanes actually help traffic flow since drivers are not forced to slow down behind a cyclist. Bike lanes also prevent accidents and save lives. Bike lanes are not part of the problem, they are part of the solution. It does take time to see change, but if you build it they will come. The more visibility we have around bike lanes, the more people will be encouraged to bike. Moving bike lanes to secondary roads sends the message that cyclists are second class citizens that don't deserve the convenience of main thoroughfares or direct routes. It is also ridiculous that after the inconvenience of detours and gridlock due to construction of the newest bike lanes on Bloor, the premier is suggesting we should endure this all over again just so that the street would go back to how it was. Doing this would be an enormous waste of money and not how I want my tax dollars to be spent. Societies are meant to move forwards not backwards. This bill 212 does not take us forward and it cannot pass.\n"

        "comment": "This policy endangers me and my friends and family who use these lanes. It endangers the independence of local government. It endangers all citizens, as emergency services have confirmed their response times as well as accidents on these routes have reduced since the lanes' introduction. It endangers anyone who makes it to the hospitals in Toronto, as they requested these lanes for the 2/3 of their staff who commute by bike and would be at risk of being on the opposite end of a hospital bed thanks to feelings-don't-care-about-facts decision-based-evidence-faking. As Ontario's own recent data shows that for trips starting or ending in downtown Toronto, 26% are drivers and 9% are personal mobility users like bikes and scooters, that means over 26% of those we need to focus on are users of these lanes, while they have nowhere near that share of road space, and if anything we should increase it due to both mode share and actual greater capacity shown in every study of roadways. Play politics with your own lives, not mine. We do not need to waste money and sacrifice lives to pretend like your choice to drive is the only or the universally best choice: it is not. Respect my freedom to not live in a Conservative communist society where I am only supported if I drive, but instead let me live in a freedom loving society where I have the choice, not a government making it for me, to give up space in a wide car lane for you, by going into a more efficient and narrower bike, transit, or pedestrian lane.\n"

        "comment": "Induced demand means the more traffic ways you build of a particular medium, the more of that kind of traffic you will encourage. This means the more car lanes we build, the more car traffic there will be. This also means the more bike lanes we build, the more bike traffic we will see.\nThe impact of bikes vs. cars on a city's health, sustainability and quality of life is self-evident. As a society we should strive to build more livable cities. That means prioritizing bike lanes over car lanes - and likely means less commuting options for cars. Car owners might see this as a step backwards, but as a car owner myself I see it as a necessary tradeoff for the greater good.\nPlease keep the bike lanes and build more of them, even if it comes at the cost of car lanes. Car traffic and its negative impact on noise, safety and pollution in comparison to bike traffic should make this decision an easy one.\n"

        "comment": "I am very saddened by the provincial government's proposal to remove Toronto's bike lanes with Bill 212. I am a 5', 66 year old woman who travels by bike daily in the city. I am constantly in danger, it feels, and have been hit by cars twice this year. One incident I reported as a hit and run to police. I go out of my way to find bike lanes so I can commute to work and shop. The hit and run gave me a concussion but could have been much worse, I know people who have been seriously injured. I am only now, many months after that incident, able to cycle without extreme anxiety and fear of being hit from behind. I changed my route to travel side streets to work rather than the direct, shorter road with no bike lanes where that happened. Removing the lanes, in the downtown especially, is completely against the Vision Zero plan, it is without merit, and based on skewed figures that do not represent the actuality of bike travel on our city roads. I hope the Minister of Transportation will redo the Math because his numbers are not accurate.\nIt is disheartening to see that the provincial government has so little concern for the constant casualties on our roads. Increasing car traffic does not, and will not, help people feel safe whether cyclist or pedestrian. The daily collisions, bad driver behaviours, and lack of enforcement should be tackled before taking away safety from the most vulnerable.\nInstead of overstepping into municipal affairs, please take that impulse and use it to encourage efficient, environmentally sound, and healthy ways of commuting and traveling throughout our city. Look to the increasing Bike Share numbers where residents and visitors find their way to all the interesting places there are to see. Downtown Toronto is not a highway and should never be given up just for the car.\nAs a year-round cyclist I am in close proximity to drivers and see that the vast majority of cars are transporting one person, how is that efficient and sound economics or environmentally sound? You are taking a hugely backward step and I hope that your government will not use my tax dollars to remove these lanes. For a government supposedly obsessed with the bottom line, how does this make financial sense? Please rethink this terrible idea.\n"

        "comment": "As a car driver and business owner on Bloor Street, I strongly oppose Bill 212 and the removal of bike lanes in Toronto. In my experience, bike lanes have been a positive change, not just for cyclists but for everyone in the city.\nSince the installation of bike lanes, I\u2019ve noticed a significant improvement in traffic flow on main arteries. The predictable and orderly movement of bikes and cars makes driving more efficient. Contrary to concerns, bike lanes have not worsened car traffic\u2014they\u2019ve helped balance road use.\nAs a business owner, the impact has been even more tangible. Foot traffic near my business has increased substantially since the bike lanes were added. Cyclists frequently stop in, and I see more people walking around because of the safer and more pleasant environment. Removing these bike lanes would be devastating. Many of my customers have told me they wouldn\u2019t visit if bike lanes were removed, as they rely on cycling for their daily commutes and shopping trips.\nThis isn\u2019t just about traffic\u2014it\u2019s about the economic and social health of our city. The bike lanes on Bloor have fostered a thriving, connected, and vibrant community that benefits everyone. Removing them would be a step backward. I urge the government to reconsider Bill 212 and work collaboratively with cities to improve road safety and congestion without dismantling essential infrastructure.\nLet\u2019s focus on solutions that bring us together, not tear apart what\u2019s working.\n"

At a time when we're facing increased congestion, global warming from carbon emissions, and a need for affordable transportation (i.e. biking) -- this seems like a backwards step. There are plenty of studies that show that increasing lanes of car traffic will *not* decrease congestion. It will only encourage more folks that use bikes to change to cars because it decreases the safety of other modes. As an Ontario resident in Toronto, I urge you to not pass this bill.\n"

I also use a bicycle to carry out multiple errands since it is far quicker and easier to link multiple trips together by bicycle or by transit than by car.\nThe current proposal makes it appear that cyclists are responsible for the congestion in Toronto which is demonstrably false. This narrative causes polarization and encourages drivers to act aggressively towards cyclists making me feel even less safe.\nRegarding the suggestion that side streets be used - this is already done wherever practical but the need to cross over ravines and railway tracks makes that impossible in all cases. Also a 10-15 minute detour on a bicycle can make the difference between a practical bike ride and an impossible one!\n"
