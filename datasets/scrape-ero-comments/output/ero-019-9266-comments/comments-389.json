        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposal to remove bike lanes especially on arterial roads and especially new bike lanes.   As bike lanes are slowly being implemented and connected for greater distances, newer cyclists of all ages are gaining confidence to cycle.  As the cycling culture gains traction, it has a positive impact to both society (i.e climate change) and one's own personal being (ie. physical health and finances).  I personally bike (manual pedal) everywhere to work, shopping, events, etc and bike about 90% time on arterial roads because (guess what,) I live, work and shop where majority of these buildings are on arterial roads.  For 90% of my trips, there is no parallel side road to cycle without increasing the cycling time by 3 or 4 times greater than the direct route of using the arterial road.  And as I live in postal code M5R, the main arterial roads I use are Avenue Road, Queen's Park, University Avenue, Yonge St., and Bloor St West/East.  Because of higher expenses in housing, food and communications (i.e. cell & internet), like many other residents in the city, one cannot afford public transit let alone taxis, Uber or owing a private car especially with gas and car insurance so high.  Thus, cycling is the main mode of transportation for many residents; myself included.\nBike lanes also are being used by people in wheelchairs especially where sidewalks are too narrow, blocked and inaccessible (ie. lack of ramps).  Even as pedestrian, sometimes I am forced to step out on the bike line for a couple of steps due to blocked sidewalk; but that's better than stepping out on busy road.\nThis type of removal equates to removal of sidewalks for pedestrians and saying to pedestrians walk the roads and hope for the best navigating the fast moving vehicular traffic on the roads.  Many drivers are not respecting pedestrians or cyclists when driving.  It's why the city has planned and is deploying Vision Zero to make residents feel safer moving about in the city.  Please respect the elected city officials' decision to make decisions to facilitate a safer city life for all people whether it's the local residents or guests from out of town.\nRemoving bike lanes will increase the number of cyclists getting hit and injured or worse death.  There are already six dead this year; mourned and missed by their families and friends.  This does not include hundreds of injured requiring medical assistance that could also lead to time off from work, school, etc making Ontario less productive.\nArterial roads within city limits are used by everyone: pedestrians, cyclists and drivers; it should NOT used exclusively by drivers who treat them as if its their own personal highway.\nSpending money to rip out bike lanes that were recently added is burning money up in smoke, when those funds could be used more wisely towards issues of greater need such as public transit, healthcare, housing, climate change, etc\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. Congestion is a symptom of poor public transit and too many cars. The province should invest in creating better transit infrastructure such as light rail and improved bus services and subway systems, promoting alternative transportation methods such as bicycling, and creating disincentives for vehicles.\nRemoving bike lanes will also increase health risks and congestion for both drivers and cyclists. Without dedicated lanes, cyclists will need to share the roads with cars. This increases the risk of accidents on the road, as well as congestion.\nEven if sooner of the current bike lanes are not ideally located, municipal bike lanes should not be part of the province's jurisdiction.

        "comment": "Ever since getting an e-bike, I now spend 90% of my time traveling in the city by bike. The other 10% is on TTC when it's poor conditions to ride. I may take a car once or twice a year if I take an Uber.\nThis act makes me think that I HAVE to buy a car to solve congestion issues. Think about that for a second, because it makes absolutely no sense.\nWhen I hear that the city wants to remove bike Lanes, I'm literally getting the impression that Doug Ford wants me to buy a car and stop biking because it will be safer and faster.\nHow will buying a car and using that as my main form of transportation solve congestion? If I'm already commuting and getting around the city by bike, convincing more people to do what I'm doing will get less cars off the road and improve the flow of traffic in the city.\nI'm also not taking TTC, which eases pressure on that system as well.\nDrivers in Toronto absolutely terrify me, because nobody looks when they're turning corners, they don't give me space, and I am constantly at threat about getting run over and killed. The reason this happens? It's because of poor bike infrastructure.\nI implore anyone thinking of this act as a good idea to look into actual research about long-term benefits for bike infrastructure and making a city accessible by many different transportation means. All the evidence points to more accessibility creating safer and better flowing cities. And there's also research to backup the fact that if you add another lne of traffic, more people will travel that route and make it just as backed up if not worse than before.\nTo recap, traffic is bad in the city is because too many people drive. TTC is too overburden and unreliable to be a good form of transportation for a lot of people, and bike infrastructure isn't good enough to have people willing to bike around. Instead everybody takes a car. If you want to ease congestion, you need to make it easier for people to get around by more efficient means.\nIf traveling by car is the most efficient way of getting around, that's what people are going to use, and the city can't sustain that.\nI've cited a few sources, but I implore you to do your own research. Cycling around the city is healthy, efficient, doesn't take up space, puts less burden on public transit, and has many benefits over driving. Bikes can easily get out of the way of emergency vehicles. I want to keep riding and enjoying riding, And I want to see the city get safer and more accessible. Adding biking infrastructure will do that, taking it away won't.\n"

        "comment": "I write to express opposition to Bill 212 in the strongest possible terms. I live in Toronto and rely on both cycling and public transportation infrastructure daily for all commuting needs. The installation of the bike lanes, particularly those along the Danforth-Bloor corridor, has been integral in my ability to safely commute. Bike lanes provide Ontario residents additional transit options, safer means to arrive at their destination, reduce congestion for everyone, and maximize transit infrastructure. In a 2019 survey published by the City of Toronto, the top cited concern that all individuals, that is, non-cyclists and utilitarian cyclists alike, had with respect to cycling was safety. Dedicated bike lanes provide safe options for vulnerable road users, and represent essential transportation infrastructure, like sidewalks and public transportation. That same survey indicated substantial increases in cycling (44% identified as being utilitarian cyclists and 70% as recreational cyclists), far more than the often cited 2011 statistic that only 1.2% of city residents are cyclists\u2014a statistic that included the entirety of the amalgamated city of Toronto, including vast regions of the city where there is no cycling infrastructure. Moreover, 67% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \u201cI would like to travel by bike more than I do now\u201d. Increased bike infrastructure is in line with resident wants. Furthermore, while the perception is that bike lanes substantially increase congestion and travel times for drivers, the data does not back this up. A 2022 Pilot Project report by the City of Toronto found that the installation of bike lanes along Yonge St (Bloor St to Davisville Ave) had minimal impact on car travel, only increasing car travel times by a minute at rush hour. That same report identified an increase of between 57% and 180% of daily cycling volumes within the pilot area, a clear indication that when provided with quality biking infrastructure, residents embrace it. Finally, Bill 212 serves to increase red tape and inhibits Ontario cities\u2019 ability to self-govern on matters specific to the city with little to no provincial implication. For these reasons, among others, I am strongly opposed to the passage of Bill 212.\n"

When I'm forced to go on an unprotected road there is nothing protecting me from drivers not paying attention, driving too fast and close to me or intentionally trying to force me off the road.\nBike lanes don't cause traffic congestion, there are no bike lanes on the 401 and the premier has the idea of building a multi billion dollar tunnel under that highway. No bike lanes on the DVP and many city streets where congestion is caused by many factors including CARS!!!!!, construction, parked cars, traffic lights and pedestrians crossing when their light is a flashing red hand.\nEven when bike lanes do cause slight driver inconvenience, is that more important than another persons safety?\nOf course none of this matters and you are wasting your and our time as this is nothing but political theatre and this won't change anything.\nBye.\n"

        "comment": "Commuting by bike is very important to my physical and mental well being.\nA few things keep me from biking more.\nFirst is the lack of safe bike infrastructure in Ottawa. Biking in many parts of the city is extremely dangerous due to the lack of safe and separated bike lanes. Thankfully there are adequate bike lanes that I can use to get to the O-LRT.\n2nd During the winter these adequate bike lanes are not cleared of snow, forcing me to take poorly funded public transportation or drive to get around the city.\nPeople within the government point out that not many bike to commute or to go to their destinations. They ignore the barriers that stop people from biking despite wanting to. Most people would like to bike more, many studies on the subject have been conducted. However, they feel unsafe due to the lack of infrastructure and maintenance.\nThe routes we do have are inefficient and often full of pedestrians preventing bikers from going quickly.\nBy removing bike lanes the Ontario government will be forcing me to take more dangerous routes to my destination putting my safety at risk.\nBike infrastructure is significantly cheaper to build and maintain that care infrastructure. Instead of attacking the few bikers there are now the government should be building more infrastructure to encourage biking.\n"

Talk about overriding local democracy and governance by a paternalistic, micromanaging Premier - all the while ignoring evidence, expertise and good design. I've commuted by car for years - soul crushing being stuck in a tin can. But I moved close enough to my job to commute by bicycle year round in southern Ontario - before bike lanes, when \"bike lanes\" were pained gutters and now improvements with separation and safety for the non-motorist in mind. As safety improved, as the bike lanes became extensive enough, I've seen an explosion of not just die hard cyclists like myself - but people on all sorts of mobility devices make use of these pathways - getting cars off of the road.  It's better for their health, it saves them a lot of money and it's better for the environment all while meeting neighbours and other travelers on the bike lanes and paths. The employer doesn't have to waste large amounts of [valuable] space to provide [expensive] parking and we can all do with less pavement in the world. As family members have aged and been unable to drive - being forced onto unsafe sidewalks (narrow, bumpy) for their mobility devices and then have them resort to using the road - when a bike lane would be exactly what they need to get their groceries and other chores done.\nIt's high time that we stopped worshiping at the alter of the automobile - and made a society where ALL people can get around without being forced into expensive, polluting and dangerous cars.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support these bike lanes. I often have to take the bus and mount my bicycle because it is not safe to bike, and this puts strain on myself and needlessly slows my journey down. Cycling in my suburban neighbourhood is often dangerous especially at intersections, and putting this legislation in place limits the city from making changes that would make it safe. If Torontonians don\u2019t want bike lanes, we will vote for an anti-bike lane mayor, not premier.\nMoreover, I feel most suburban roads in Toronto are way too congested on my commute to work. These roads have zero bike lanes, meaning that there is something integrally wrong with roads that is clearly not to do with bike lanes. Projects that will make commutes easier, like crosstown and the Ontario line, are set to open way too late and/or are very delayed, which DOES make a difference for commute times.  Make it viable for citizens in this city and across the province to take whatever means of transport they want, not just drive. Don\u2019t limit a city government from making bold decisions that could make lives better for everyone - if the program didn\u2019t work, Torontonians would be the first to protest the decision, not the province. And finally, expediting construction on rapid transit projects and highway/roadway rehabilitation would significantly make our lives better as drivers, as opening up these bike lanes tomorrow will result in the same bumper-to-bumper traffic we had before they were installed. Setting this precedence enables is not the right move.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is fundamentally flawed and will increase traffic throughout the city and reduce road safety on our major roads. By removing bike lanes on bloor, Yonge and university, it will force cyclists and motorist to share the road rather than having dedicated lanes for both groups of riders. There are business and homes on these major streets that cyclists need to get too so you won\u2019t be able to force most of them onto side streets. I believe our government should prioritize the safety of all road users rather than the speed at which motorists travel, it was a motorists choice that they chose to drive in traffic so why should the cyclist have to give up their safety and security to save a couple seconds on a motorists commute. It is my opinions that pedestrian and cyclist injuries and fatalities will increase dramatically on these roads once our dedicated bike infrastructure are removed because the increase conflicts between motorists and cyclists. We are at risk of losing decades of progress in improving road safety for zero improvements in traffic. The number of motorists will continue to increase but the size of our road network is at the limit with no room for future expansion. We need to change how we move around in the city because our car infrastructure is at capacity and we are at deadlock in peak rush hour traffic.\nOur dense urban downtown has gone through major growth and revitalization in the past 20 years and now is the time more than ever to make sure we have options to move around the city rather then be stuck in traffic. Our roads will never be large enough to support 70% of our population to drive cars so giving people the option to use other modes of transportation is fundamental in our hope to turn Toronto into a world class city. We need to give people the choice whether or not to drive rather than forcing people to own a car. People should have the right to choose whether or not they want to own a car but we live in a city where you will not be able to get to your place of work without it.\nIncreasing the bureaucracy and red tape for building new road infrastructure will slow down the growth of our cities by forcing cities to require provincial approval to build any and all bike lanes. We should be limiting the control our government has on our daily lives. It should be the cities authority because these roads are for more than just for driving and the citizens of the city should determine how they are used, not the province.\n"

        "comment": "This reckless initiative shows a complete misunderstanding of why Toronto struggles with congestion. Proper biking infrastructure alleviates congestion on major roads as more individuals opt to bike instead of sitting in traffic, caused not by the bike lanes but the ever-increasing influx of cars from the suburbs. Torontonians walk and cycle\u2014the downtown congestion is a result of commuters. Banning street parking on Toronto's major arteries would be more effective than cutting out an important network for green commuters.\nCongestion could be improved with more investment in car-alternatives: public transit and bike lanes. To allow for further growth amid a developing climate crisis, investing in more infrastructure for cars is exactly the opposite of what Ontario should be doing.\nWhy begin a new project when others are still incomplete? How can there money for tearing up bike lanes but not for fixing the Eglinton Crosstown or Ontario line\u2014two solutions actual Torontonians have asked for that would actually help to solve congestion in the city. Is there no accountability? How can the Premier move forwards in such a thoughtless manner?\nFurther, why is the Premier of Ontario dictating how congestion on Toronto streets should be managed? What makes him qualified or entitled to? Does he live in Toronto, making him intimately acquainted with its specific problems? Has he studied Toronto in detail and have the facts to substantiate his decision to tear up perfectly good infrastructure at a high price to taxpayers?\nBlaming bike lanes for congestion satisfies the Premier's conservative backing and not much else\u2014it does not reflect facts and it's a move away from solving the problem.\n"

One of these cities implemented far going cycling and walking infrastructure while the other went the north American way and made more lanes for cars. Since we have known about induced demand for decades it comes as no surprise that the city without good cycling networks has more traffic congestion than the one with. Don't take the Rotterdam route, it is proven not to work.\nThis is only from a drivers perspective BTW. If you need to drive to get to where you are going you should be in favour of bike-lanes. Not surprisingly having less people in cars will shorten your commute. There are millions of reasons that are not about driving and an interesting Danish study found that for every unit they invested in cycling infrastructure they saved 8 in other fields, mostly from improved health in the general population.\nAgain, this has been proven over and over again in city after city of all sorts of climates from southern France to northern Finland. Please think before you do this. It will backfire, it always does.\n"

Removing bike lanes is an insult to those who have been killed or seriously injured while riding a bike. The province should not be dictating what municipalities want to do to serve their people.
