Thousands of people rely on these bike lanes to get where they need to go and removing them or preventing the construction of new lanes will cost lives and will not improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I feel that this proposal is a provincial overstep into city decisions.\nThe city of Toronto has recently just paved brand new, safer, and just more bike lanes on University Ave and to remove them is a waste of public money.\nThere is no need to conduct a study on each individual bike lanes as later urban studies on the benefits of bike lanes have been done with positive points for bike lanes. There are also many European and Asian countries with great bins infrastructure that are excellent examples of the benefits of bike lanes in helping traffic congestion. If all cyclists choose to stop biking for safety the amount of car traffic will increase.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I both drive and bike but given the option of safe bike lanes I will always choose to bike for ease of parking my bike. If the bike infrastructure is removed or reduced, I will once again have to drive for short distance trips contributing to more gridlock.\nEncouraging for Ontarians to bike rather than drive will also reduce carbon emissions and increase physical activity for Ontarians.\nOverall, I find this proposal very disappointing and hope it can be reconsidered.\n"

        "comment": "This plan is very misguided. Research has shown over and over again that adding more car lanes will just induce more traffic within 1-2 years, making the problem worse.\nBike lanes are not the issue, in fact they ease congestion by taking people out of their cars. Investments in public transport and active transportation are needed, not getting more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "The goal of reducing gridlock in Toronto is one we all share. However, international data shows addressing traffic requires solutions that go beyond car-based transportation. Expanding and improving alternatives, such as finishing the Crosstown transit line or enhancing cycling infrastructure, could make a significant difference. Spending money to tear our evidence backed solutions to traffic is extremely counter productive, not to mention dangerous for the cyclists.\nOn a broader level, it's important to respect the role of municipalities. Local governments are best positioned to make decisions that reflect the unique needs of their communities. Is it necessary for the Provincial Government to impose these changes from the top down? Is this a good precedent?\nAs you consider this bill, please ask yourself: How effectively will these measures really reduce gridlock? Is it appropriate to make such sweeping changes without clear evidence, especially when municipal governments are already equipped to address these challenges? What governing responsibilities do you hold to represent the 82% of Ontarians who did not vote for this majority government?\n"

Beyond that this government was elected to govern Ontario and not meddle in local politics. Maybe thunderbay doesn\u2019t need more bike lanes but Toronto does. Stay in your lane.\n"

        "comment": "As somebody who does not own a car, why is my access to safe and efficient transport routes prioritised less than those who own vehicles - some of which a wholly unreasonable for commuting down town Toronto. Spend a day counting the number of SUVs with more than one person in that aren't taxi's and you'll realise how much space they consume just to get from A to B, not to mention how dangerous and polluting they are.\nThe cycle lanes of Toronto set the city apart from the most of North America in that they're actually half decent. Removing lanes will only cause more traffic and danger due to roadworks and further congestion. More lanes do not reduce traffic and this has been proven time and time again.\nIf you want to reduce traffic, provide better alternatives to driving in the city and introduce a congestion charge like in other cities such as London, UK. This raises significant taxes for improving infrastructure and helps improve things such as air quality, something which is woeful in Toronto.\nInstead of listening to anti bike ideology and culture wars, please actually listen to the science on the matter. Alternative travel infrastructure fights congestion, not removing bike lanes.\n"

The reason we have gridlock is because the government can\u2019t get the Gardiner fixed!!\nTaking out bike lanes is just reversing construction already done, will put more cars on the road, and is just distracting from the real problem here - the Gardiner. If Ford does this - there is NO WAY I will vote conservative in the next election.\n"

        "comment": "This is a horrendous piece of proposed legislation. It is governmental overreach with the province becoming involved in matters not relevant to their  governance level. It has been demonstrated the world over that it will increase gridlock and not improve it, let alone being bad for businesses where more car lanes are maintained. It is a terrible decision for the environment as single occupancy cars cause gridlock increasing emissions and are a significant source of emissions themselves. Not only will this proposal not solve the issue it is trying to, it will fail to meet its goals while making the roads much more dangerous, resulting in more lives lost on Ontario roads.\n"

Bike lanes are a critical investment in our community\u2019s safety, sustainability, and overall quality of life. By providing dedicated space for cyclists, bike lanes reduce the risk of accidents, create a safer environment for all road users, and encourage more people to use bikes for daily transportation.\nThis shift toward cycling can alleviate traffic congestion, reduce pollution, and promote healthier lifestyles. Cities with robust cycling infrastructure often see a boost in local business and livability, making our community more attractive for families and professionals alike.\nI believe that prioritizing bike lanes is a forward-thinking approach that will benefit everyone\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians\u2014and I hope you will continue to support and expand these efforts.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"

Instead of fixing these issues this government plans to spend hundreds of millions ripping up existing bike lanes with no evidence as to whether or not this will actually reduce traffic (and plenty of evidence to the contrary).\nThis is the same red tape the NIMBY lobby always proposes, objecting to anything that makes Ontario a more affordable and enjoyable place to live.\n"

Biking in Toronto poses many hazards, between the many reckless drivers who hold no regard for cyclists lives, and the poor road quality with literal holes that can knock a cyclist flying off their bike. Bike lanes make it possible to bike safely around the city. They give people an affordable, active and environmentally friendly way to get around.\nI would recommend you try biking around on a busy street without a bike lane and see how you feel. You might reconsider removal of bike lanes.\n"
