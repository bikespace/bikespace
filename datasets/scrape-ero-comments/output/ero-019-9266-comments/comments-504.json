        "comment": "This proposal is absurd and should NOT be approved.\nFord is obsessed with rhetoric from the 1950\u2019s that centres all urban planning around the car. For over 30 years, urban planners have been trying to undo the damage car-centric planning has done to communities, people\u2019s stress levels, and the environment.\nCities need more pedestrian areas, more bike lanes, and more transit.\nThis government needs to listen to a broad range of research conducted by experts, not base legislation on one cherry-picked study.\nAlso, the province has no business in city affairs.\nBike lanes reduce fatalities, increase individual fitness levels which improve physical and mental health and decrease the province\u2019s medical costs, increase local business profits, and decrease pollution.\nADD MORE BIKE LANES! DO NOT REMOVE BIKE LANES!!\n"

        "comment": "This legislation has multiple problems:\n1) Bike lanes are municipal jurisdiction. They impact people locally, not on a provincial level, and there placement and implementation should be kept at the local level.\n2) Why are cars even being prioritized on Bloor St. W, University Ave, and Young St.? All three of these roads have subways which would facilitate easy commuting from further afield (ie. Etobicoke, North York).\n3) Bikes alleviate congestion. They occupy 1/10th the space of a car and are environmentally friendly.\n4) If the Provincial Government was serious about congestion, they would focus on completing their projects in a timely manner. For example the Ontario Line has pinched traffic on Danforth and Papa, and completely snarled the downtown with the blockage of Queen St. at Yonge St. Furthermore, Metrolinx is years behind on completion of the Eglinton Crosstown light rail.\n5) The Provincial government could allow the City of Toronto to implement solutions to gridlock, like allowing \"cameras\" to ticket drivers who \"block the box\" during red lights, freeing up police officers and penalizing drivers who create additional congestion.\n6) Penalties for developers who require lane reductions to build condos and other buildings. Yes, lane reductions are necessary, but if the daily cost were to increase, as well as penalties for delays, developers would plan to complete projects on time and with minimal or reduced lane reductions.\n7) Increase fines for drivers who park or stop in no stopping zones. Blocking a lane, even for a few minutes, essentially constricts a multilane roadway that could accommodate more flow and causes gridlock.\n8) Had the Progressive Conservatives NOT sold Highway 407 in 1999, a good portion of today's congestion would have already been alleviated. Just think how many drivers currently use Highway 401 to avoid paying exorbitant tolls? If even 30% of that traffic \u2013 including trucks \u2013 were instead using Highway 407, much of the congestion on Highway 401 would be alleviated. Highway 407 was conceived as a freeway to alleviate congestion.\nBy selling it, the PC government has in fact inflicted decades of congestion on GTA motorists. It is disingenuous to claim that today's congestion is the fault of bike lanes and that the solution is to remove bike lanes on Bloor St., University Ave., and Yonge St.\nBill 212 is poorly thought out and is nothing more than a political wedge issue. It should be rejected.\n"

My husband bikes to work to cut down on our cost of fueling our car and he doesn't feel safe using public transport since COVID.\nThe removal of bike lanes will directly impact his ability, and that of countless others in our city, to get to work safely.\nIf you want to \"save time\", expand the bike lanes so more people feel safe using them, and they get out of their cars and bike around! Less cars on the road and more bikes means less congestion, less emissions, more exercise - bike lanes = safety, cleaner air, healthier population!\n"

        "comment": "I currently live on Ottawa, Ontario and cycle to work almost daily. Cycling allows me to get some exercise and get to work much more quickly. It also helps me reduce expenses I would pay such as parking and gas. For the community, it reduces congestion on the roads. It also reduces carbon emissions, something the Ford government has failed miserably on.\nCycling lanes are vital for the safety of commuters. Removing bike lanes will endanger my life and those of my loved ones. I have had several near incidences with cars when not cycling in a cycling lane. I fear if more cycling lanes are taken away, there will be more car-bike accidents. Will the Ford government be able to afford the lawsuits that will be launched against the government for removing safe cycling infrastructure?\nThe Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I think that taking out bike lanes that are used by many cyclists will have detrimental effects on traffic, business, and road safety. I do not think that removing bike lanes or returning them to traffic or parking will have as big an effect on gridlock as you hope.\nI would ask that you look at how many cyclists use a bike lane, and model what would happen if all those cyclists were driving single occupancy cars on the same stretch of road. If a bike lane appears to be underused then consider investigating why.\nConsider that if there is sufficient bike infrastructure and public transit then road users making local trips  would be able to use transit or bikes for many trips, and this would leave more space on the existing car lanes for people who need to use cars and trucks. I live downtown, and most of my travel is by foot, bike, or public transit. This means I'm not taking up road capacity for people who do need to use cars or trucks. By making cycling and public transit a reliable and easy option you are freeing up existing capacity. With the new electrically assisted bikes I feel that I could cycle longer distances and do even more of my trips by bike.\nBikes take up less parking space than a car, how much road space would be freed if there were half as many cars using on-street parking in the city?\nI have attached links showing that bike lanes are seen to have a positive effect on businesses.\nCycling is a healthy activity. Drivers hitting cyclists with their cars not so much. Having protected bike lanes improves safety for cyclists, and has incidental safety benefits for pedestrians and drivers. See attached link.\nI think having safe, affordable, and reliable options for all types of road users encourages people who don't need to use cars to use an alternative, and that frees up road capacity for those who need or want to use a car for a trip.\nBike lanes help both cyclists and drivers, and removing well used bike lanes will not improve congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal doesn't make any sense at all. Ripping out bike lanes that were just built doesn't make financial sense and it won't help reduce traffic congestion. Toronto needs to have safe bike lanes - for the safety of everyone. Please don't do this, let's not go backwards. I've seen food delivery cyclists use sidewalks where there aren't any bike lanes or have to ride in the middle of the road. This is dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers.\nI used to cycle a lot, but stopped because the route I had to take didn't have a designated bike lane. On more than one occasions I've had car doors opened on my, truck driver didn't see me and turned right in front of me, cars pushed into me. Very unsafe, I haven't experienced that in other cities I cycled in.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not only a gross overreach of the Province's power and an entirely regressive bill, given the need to reduce emissions but also serves to accomplish little. Gridlock is predominantly created by lack of appropriate means of transport in higher density areas, such as cycling or public transportation.\nThe province would be better served to cancel this bill and demand accountability from our local transit provider Metrolinx, for it's inability to electrify GO lines, build reliable LRT or expand subway services in a prompt fashion.\n"

        "comment": "I am very much against this proposed legislation regarding provincial approval for bike lanes. Bike lanes and municipal roads are clearly responsibilities of local municipalities, who are best placed to respond to needs of residents in the area. This is a gross violation of local control for the province to retroactively review and remove bike lanes, specifically in the city of Toronto.\nThe city of Toronto\u2019s bike lanes make me as a pedestrian and transit rider safer and make road traffic more controlled and safer in the dense neighbourhood  of Toronto. Bike lanes allow cyclists to get around safely and keep them out of the way of motor vehicle traffic, which moves faster than cyclists do. Bike lanes allow people to visit local businesses, attend events, and go to work.\nThe rollout of bike lanes and road changes has not been perfect, and improvements could be made to lane configurations on specific locations, signal timing, and construction management. But the province\u2019s overreach with this proposed law will not do that. Instead the province should work with municipalities to support better traffic management and mobility solutions. The province has plenty of transportation responsibilities in their jurisdiction such as the swift delivery of public transport projects like GO Expansion and Ontario Line and Eglinton Crosstown that will reduce traffic and the delivery of new roads.\nI will not feel safe in my neighbourhood if bike lanes are removed. The removal of bike lanes should be a municipal choice in consultation with all local residents.\n"

        "comment": "Addressing Ontario\u2019s government on Bill 212, which proposes the removal of bike lanes to prioritize car traffic, several key arguments demonstrate why this move is counterproductive for mobility and regional development:\n1.\tNegative Impact on Sustainable Mobility: Removing bike lanes discourages active transportation, which includes cycling and walking. Cities worldwide are moving toward sustainable and active transportation modes, reducing car dependency, lowering emissions, and improving air quality. Bike lanes play a crucial role in providing safe, accessible infrastructure that encourages cycling as an alternative to cars, thus aligning with sustainability goals.\n2.\tIncreased Traffic and Congestion: Prioritizing cars by removing bike lanes doesn\u2019t necessarily reduce gridlock. In fact, studies show that inducing demand for cars worsens congestion. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have demonstrated that increasing bike infrastructure leads to lower car traffic by giving people attractive alternatives. By removing bike lanes, Ontario could inadvertently increase car congestion and decrease overall road efficiency.\n3.\tEconomic and Community Benefits: Bike lanes positively impact local economies. Cyclists are more likely to stop at local businesses, as they can park easily and don\u2019t face the limitations of car parking. Streets designed for multi-modal use, including biking, are also known to attract people to neighborhoods, promoting vibrant, economically resilient communities.\n4.\tPublic Health and Safety: Encouraging cycling and walking through dedicated bike lanes promotes physical activity, with long-term health benefits like reduced rates of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Bike lanes also provide a safety buffer for cyclists, making cycling a feasible option for a broader demographic, including families and less-experienced cyclists. Removing these lanes compromises safety, discouraging people from choosing this healthy mode of transportation.\n5.\tCity Appeal and Quality of Life: Modern urban development increasingly prioritizes human-centered design, including extensive bike and pedestrian networks, as they are key indicators of a livable city. By opting for car-centric policies, Ontario risks diminishing its appeal as a progressive, forward-thinking region, potentially deterring young professionals and families seeking a sustainable lifestyle.\nBy reconsidering this aspect of Bill 212, Ontario can align with global urban development best practices, create more efficient transportation networks, and invest in a healthier, more vibrant future.\n"

        "comment": "Removing alternatives to driving does not reduce gridlock. As a tradesperson who travels in a truck full of equipment, I would much prefer commuters do not take up parking space or drive themselves around. Bike lanes among other travel options for those just looking to transport themselves is very beneficial to me.\nI would prefer that Right Turns on Red Lights be removed at busy intersections because people who make rights on red often cut off drivers trying to get through the intersection box. They also create conflict with straight moving pedestrian or bike traffic.\nI find it to be a waste of money to force municipalities to remove bike infrastructure which will just result in more people driving and negatively impact my job which requires a lot of driving around. I want less people in cars so they don't contribute to the traffic.\n"

The government should be prioritizing public transit to solve the traffic issue not spending money on cars. That is the only way you solve congestion.
