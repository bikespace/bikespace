        "comment": "This entire bill is such a farce. Why is the province meddling with the city's bike lanes? Let the municipalities deal with the municipal issues. The whole thing just seems like a distraction to try and sneak the highway 413 environmental protection exceptions in without people noticing, which is dishonest. The idea of ripping out existing bike lanes is incomprehensibly misguided. We need to be encouraging people out of their cars in the city. Hey, if you actually want more space for cars lanes to make traffic flow better, why not get rid of on-street parking? A single car parked on the road takes away an entire lane of traffic. Why isn't the provincial gov't concerned about that? Is it because this bill is actually about sneaking in the highway 413 stuff?\n"

        "comment": "1. This proposal represents wasteful duplication of government and unnecessary incursion into municipal jurisdiction. The City of Toronto has a duly elected government that is perfectly capable of making decisions about its own roads. Its decisions are taken carefully and only after extensive consultation with residents, and with full democratic accountability afterwards. Time spent by Government of Ontario employees second guessing those decisions is the worst kind of waste. Respect the taxpayer!\n2. Toronto's population is growing quickly. If we keep adding cars, we are guaranteed to clog the available road space. This is simple geometry. The only solution is more efficient alternatives. The province should build and fund public transit and support cycling infrastructure.\n3. Cycling rates are increasing every year. We need more cycling infrastructure, not less, to keep up.\n4. For the bike lanes that are proposed to be removed, there are no nearby alternate routes on side streets without interruption and/or major diversions. The proposal ignores the physical realities of the road network in the city.\n5. Six cyclists have already been killed on Toronto's streets this year. The proposed changes will end more lives and destroy more families. That is unconscionable. There will be blood on the hands of the Premier, the Minister, and every employee of the Government of Ontario who helps execute these shameful plans.\n"

        "comment": "The move to eliminate some bike infrastructure by Premier Ford is absolutely insane on so many levels and using misleading figures to support that dangerous position is unethical at best, and worse will undoubtedly lead to preventable deaths on Toronto streets. Premier Ford and his yes men at Queen's Park will have those victim's blood on their hands.\nPremier Ford has a history of meddling in municipal issues when they personally affect him, his family or friends.\nOverriding the duly elected Toronto city council because of personal preferences represents gross overreach on Premier Ford's part and comes across as anti-democratic.\nRoads are not meant to be exclusive to one form of transportation. Road use has evolved to include walking, horse riding, horse drawn carriages, bicycles, cars, buses and large transport trucks. Many people who cycle in Toronto are also drivers, pedestrians, transit users and we all expect a thoughtful infrastructure that address the ability of people to move about the city in an efficient and a safe manner. What's worse than bike lanes for traffic congestion? Drivers that park in no-stopping zones, make illegal turns and drive with their eyes glued to the phones.\nThe province has a responsibility to provide safe infrastructure for all residents (notice I don't use taxpayer) regardless of their activity or abilities. That includes a requirement for railings on bridges and elevated walkways, sidewalk curb cuts for people with disabilities, etc. Bike lanes are not an attack on cars, rather they help protect bicycle road users from interactions with vehicles that are exponentially increasing in size (like the Premier's previous Lincoln Navigator).\nThe city of Toronto conducted numerous studies and consulted with experts before implementing safe cycling infrastructure. Premier Ford being upset he can't zoom down Bloor Street West does not qualify as an expert opinion. Clearly Premier Ford wishes he had access to a tunnel that runs under the 401 and along his route to Queen's Park. I wish I had a pony, however we have to be realistic.\nSimple fact - improved cycling infrastructure helps to saves lives, cuts down on congestion, promotes a healthy lifestyle and should be considered a basic human right in Ontario.\nPremier Ford - drive in your provincial lane and stop encroaching on Toronto city council's jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "This is simply a waste of taxpayer money. The city of Toronto is already unsafe for cyclists, and prioritizing more lanes for the already too many vehicles is a waste. This city does not need more cars!!!!! What it needs is safer conditions for cyclists, pedestrians and citizens who use transit. Put this money where it really counts instead of wasting the infrastructure that has already cost this city so much to install bike lanes. Stop lining your pockets Dougy\n"

        "comment": "Traffic congestion in motor vehicles isn't caused by bicycles, it's caused by too many people choosing cars.\nPlease DO NOT remove bike lanes that give me the choice to use a bicycle in Toronto. Taking out Bloor, University, and Young bike lanes directly removes my choice to avoid taking my car to travel around Toronto.\nI recently started leaving my car at home and taking the GO train into Toronto to visit friends since the bike lanes have finally reached sufficient level of usefulness. It was way better than I thought. With the construction on the QEW, it was actually faster than driving. Cycling also helps achieve some physical therapy that my doctor recommended after a knee injury last year.\nPlease don't remove bike lanes, remove car lanes instead. Make cycling more convenient than driving and more people will bicycle.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a mistake. Rather, we should solve gridlock by encouraging safe cycling, and making it more attractive to use public transit by making that more efficient and well-funded. We need more incentives to avoid driving and use more eco-friendly options. Plus, I believe it should be up to each municipality to decide these things without provincial interference based on the needs, infrastructure and demographics of their community.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a Toronto resident my whole life. I have lived from east to west. I love this city and I love how these bike lanes are connecting others and myself with the people I know and places I go. They make things more convenient and faster for me in countless situations, and critically they make getting around safer for everyone. I have felt empowered to explore the city so much more because of the freedom the bike lanes have given me, and I say that as a person who can drive and has a car. Those who are unable to afford a car, who have immigrated from other places and don't yet have a license, or who are not yet old enough to drive are in an even worse position than I if this bill is passed and followed through on.\nI don't believe, based on innumerable observations and using the streets in Toronto as every manner of transit-goer, that removing the bike lanes will make anything better for anyone. Quite the opposite, they will put more cars on the roads and slow the flow of traffic by removing places to stop and load, and mix in bicycle traffic with cars making everything more dangerous and much less efficient. There is no way to \"reduce gridlock\" in this city without making alternative forms of transit more convenient for people of all ages and demographics to use, and one of those incredibly important ways is bicycle infrastructure. This bill would regress us in an enormous way after years and years of building us up to be a more livable and sustainable city. I am saddened that the provincial government sees fit to override a city with their own elected leadership and their own vision, one created by the people that use the streets every single day. Please reconsider this bill as the effects for me and countless others will be dire, while benefiting essentially no one.\n"

Cars still try to side swipe bikers in the in-between sections of elevated and protected bike lanes.\nGetting rid of bike lanes would put bikers at increased risk of injury and death as seen by how cars interact with bikers in these in-between sections of our current protected bike lanes.\nBike lanes are the *bare minimum* safety (other than helmets and personal safety gear) for bikers.\nIt is also classist to get rid of bike lanes as biking is one of the only completely free forms of transportation.\n"

In regards to the Yonge-Bloor lanes, it will remove bike lanes that provide easy transit for many and further encourage eco-friendly travel both of which are essential for our society to develop in a better direction for all. In regards to the requirement for provincial approval for bike lanes that would take up a car lane, the province should not impede on the decisions of a city to be more eco-friendly and encourage alternative means of transportation. The decisions to make bike lanes within a municipality ought to be the decision of the municipality itself, not with provincial interference.\n"
