        "comment": "The reason traffic is so bad is because the government has not invested enough in improving infrastructure. To reduce congestion we should instead invest more in public transit and bike lanes so that both options are more favourable and we have less unnecessary cars on the road. If public transportation is the most efficient form of transit then the traffic congestion will decrease. We should instead implement public transit ONLY lanes so that we decrease congestion. Removing or making the implementation of bike lanes more difficult to obtain will only exacerbate this problem.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes on existing infrastructure is short sighted and counter productive. With the amount of commutes, casual cyclists and food delivery couriers like uber eats, a rip up off all that infastructer would cause a massive disruption of people's lives and in some cases jobs. This will only result in cyclists having to now share the same lane with cars, causing more traffic and endangering lives. This will also force more people to drive, adding more cars onto roads that are impossible to keep up with the demand. Promoting cycling has been proven to lessen congestion and has the added benefit of being a healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Common sense should mean thinking about a problem for more then 5 seconds, and going off of emotional responses\n"

        "comment": "I am writing regarding the proposed framework requiring provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment The EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\nUrban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\nAir quality at street level where people walk and bike\nNoise levels that affect mental and physical health\nSafe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\nAccess to sustainable transportation options\nStreet-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\nOverall quality of life in our communities\nBike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\nCreating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\nReducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\nDecreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\nEnabling active transportation that improves public health\nBuilding more livable, human-scaled urban environments\nSupporting sustainable urban development patterns\nProviding equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\nContradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals Your SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\nContradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\nCreates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\nPrioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\nUndermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\nContradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\nPlaces an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\nEnvironmental Assessment Concerns While the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n\"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n\"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\nAir quality impacts\nStormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\nOil and gasoline leaks\nTire particles and microplastics\nBrake dust and heavy metals\nRoad salt and de-icing chemicals\nSediment and debris\nThe cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\nThe relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\nClimate Change Obligations Your SEV specifically commits to:\n\"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n\"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n\"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\" The proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nEvidence-Based Decision Making The proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\nIgnores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\nCreates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\nOnly bike lanes must be justified with data\nNo similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\nMunicipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\nThe default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\nOverlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\nReduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\nSignificantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\nCardiovascular disease\nSleep disturbance\nCognitive impairment in children\nMental health impacts\nReduced property values\nImproved public health outcomes through active transportation\nEnhanced road safety for all users\nEconomic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\nIncreased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\nHigher property values on calmer, more livable streets\nReduced road maintenance costs\nGreater neighborhood desirability\nMore equitable transportation access\nMunicipal Planning Integration Your SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\nUndermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\nCreates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\nMay discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\nCould delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\nRevise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\nEnvironmental benefits (both natural and urban)\nPublic health impacts\nSafety improvements\nEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\nAccessibility enhancements\nClimate change mitigation potential\nIntegration with existing transportation networks\nEnsure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\nReflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\nConsider both immediate and long-term impacts\nAccount for municipal transportation master plans\nInclude environmental and health metrics\nSupport the achievement of provincial climate targets\nRecognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\nModify the data collection requirements to:\nInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\nConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\nAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\nMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\nEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation represents a significant overreach. Municipal leaders are already accountable to their voters, so if bad policy regarding bike lanes is put in place, Ontarians already have a way to rectify it. It will also do nothing to improve congestion, and will likely make it worse. Cyclists will simply take the full lane where bike lanes are removed, and traffic will slow to a crawl. Finally, removing bike lanes is an enormous waste of money and an insult to taxpayers.\nI find it hard to fathom how such bad policy can be proposed.\n"

        "comment": "This act should not pass.\nBike lanes take up 1/5 of a lane on each side of road and do not contribute the more traffic jam. Bike lanes help to reduce more traffic off the road by replacing cars that would be normally on the road with bikes on the bike lane that take up less space and do not contribute to automotive congestion.\nRemoving a bike lane or two on a road would not add an additional lane to a road nor even if it did add a lane, studies have found that more lanes do not equate to better traffic flow.\nBike lanes also prevent unnecessary deaths of people who travel on bike. Bikes are means of transportation for all Ontarians regardless of income level and physical ableness. Taking away bike lane is to take away individual freedom and safety of universal right to mobility.\n"
