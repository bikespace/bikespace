        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212\u2019s restrictions on bike lanes. Research shows that bike lanes improve safety, promote healthier lifestyles, and reduce traffic congestion. Encouraging cycling not only alleviates gridlock but also helps reduce healthcare costs by lowering the strain on our system through healthier living. Active transportation reduces the risk of chronic diseases, saving taxpayers money in the long run. Ontario should prioritize sustainable transportation options, not limit them.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident, I am strongly against this proposal to reduce bike lanes from our city streets. The city is already woefully inadequate in its bike transportation infrastructure relative to cities such as Montreal. Moving backward on this issue goes against the progress seen in other cities and unfortunately works counter to protecting the city\u2019s ridership, which are already vulnerable on the roads.\nAbsolutely small minded and circular progress to now destroy the University Ave infrastructure that was just recently completed.\nThis bill should be thrown out otherwise we will enjoy throwing this government out next election.\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely backwards bill that will literally not move Ontario forward. As a transportation professional, I cannot believe the lack of data and studies to back this detrimental change to our roadway networks. Not only does this put strain for municipalities to advocate for active transportation, but literally undos all the bike advocacy that has been growing over the last few decades.\nThe solution to gridlock isn't expanding the road and adding more lanes. We all can see what happened there - in NYC, LA, Dallas, Houston, and yes - in Toronto! Instead, we should put more investment in transit, bikes, and modes that are much more efficient than cars.\n"

I am a Bloor-Kingsway cyclist who uses the bike lanes on Bloor, and believe that it has been a positive development for the neighbourhood and the city. I am flummoxed that Premier Ford would weigh in on what is definitely a municipal and not a provincial issue.\n"

        "comment": "Please don't spend anymore taxpayer money removing something we just spent money on building? How is traffic congestion the most pressing issue? Removing alternative forms of transportation will only bring more cars to roads, it doesn't matter how many lanes there are for cars. What's next, narrowing sidewalks? Removing them? Why are cars such a priority instead of forms of transportation that people that actually live in these neighborhoods use? Do we not deserve a safe place to walk and bike in our own neighborhoods??? No? You would rather I get in a car instead and add more traffic? I've lived in this city for 14 years without a car, but I'm considering getting one just because I no longer feel safe getting around without one. If I get a car, I'll get less exercise which could lead to health issues that will strain the province further (because NOTHING is being invested in healthcare). I'm genuinely so upset at how we are moving backwards when it comes to accessible modes of transportation for everybody.\n"

        "comment": "This is among the most narrow-minded, data-blind, and draconian proposals I've seen from the Ford government.\nBike lanes do not increase traffic. They displace drivers from cars to more road occupancy efficient bikes. They increase road utilization efficiency, reduce car ownership and use, increase (NOT decrease traffic flow), bring health and environmental benefits to reduce strain on infrastructure, reduce parking and increase loading efficiency, boost local economies, and improve energy efficiency / reduce carbon footprints.\nToronto has one of the most limited public transportation systems for a city its size in the world due to '98 PC government cuts of the Eglinton subway line and a repeated war on public transit by both the previous Ford municipal government and the present Ford provincial government.\nAnyone that supported this bill should be deeply ashamed for the long-lasting, anti-intellectual harm they are doing to the city of Toronto.\nReferences\n-Pucher, J., & Buehler, R.

Congestion and traffic is a problem in big cities because there are no better options for people to get where they need to go! We need MORE bike lanes not less, to encourage people to choose the more environmentally friendly option there has to be some kind of incentive!! We need better and cheaper public transportation, not more lanes of traffic! No where in the world has adding more lanes of traffic done anything other than encourage more cars on the road.

We have a crumbling healthcare system that could use some funds right now\n2. Pandering to cars does not improve traffic. They take up too much space so you will never move as much people in equivalent space for bikes\n3. Let the elected officials in the municipalities decide what streets should have bike lanes. People in Peterborough should not have influence on what Torontonians should build on their streets\n4. Bikes are way better for the environment than cars, we are at the beginning of a climate crisis so the bare minimum of supporting non polluting travel would be nice\n5. Multiple studies on Bloor have shown that pedestrians and cyclists are more likely to purchase goods from local stores. Bike lanes are literally better for business too\nIt is a shame our provincial government is wasting time and money to make the province a worse place. We should not go forward with this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who predominantly uses a bicycle and public transportation, I support this bill, as it means instead of using a cramped bicycle lane, I will be forced to cycle in the vehicle lane, giving me much more room to manoeuvre in the wider lane.\nAlthough this means that the vehicles behind me will be limited by my top speed of around 25km/h, and though cyclists like me - who are already vulnerable due to woefully inadequate urban design and driver consequences - will be at much greater risk of harm due to unsafe and impatient drivers, I believe this is a small price to pay to reduce gridlock and save time.\n"
