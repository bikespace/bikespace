        "comment": "The three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto sees thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and its proposed framework for bike lanes. This legislation represents a significant step backward in our efforts to create safe, sustainable, and livable cities. Here's why:\nPrioritizes Cars Over People: Bill 212 prioritizes the convenience of drivers over the safety and well-being of cyclists and pedestrians. Removing traffic lanes to make way for bike lanes is a proven strategy to encourage cycling, reduce congestion, and improve road safety for everyone.\nUndermines Municipal Autonomy: This bill strips municipalities of their ability to make decisions about their own transportation infrastructure. Local governments are best positioned to understand the specific needs of their communities and should have the authority to implement solutions that work for them.\nContradicts Climate Goals: At a time when we should be doing everything we can to reduce our reliance on cars and promote sustainable transportation, Bill 212 sends the wrong message. Investing in cycling infrastructure is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating healthier communities.\nIgnores Public Health Benefits: Cycling has numerous benefits for physical and mental health. By making it more difficult to build bike lanes, Bill 212 discourages active transportation and contributes to a less healthy population.\nLacks Evidence-Based Decision-Making: There is overwhelming evidence that bike lanes improve road safety for all users, reduce congestion, and boost local economies. Bill 212 ignores this evidence and puts the interests of drivers ahead of the needs of the broader community.\nI urge the government to reconsider this misguided legislation and instead work with municipalities to create transportation systems that prioritize the safety and well-being of all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation will result in the deaths of more cyclists. The legislation disregards everything that experts say about reducing gridlock. If you want to reduce gridlock - improve TTC service, prioritize TTC vehicles with dedicated bus lanes, improve cycling infrastructure with protected bike lanes, remove street parking on thoroughfares and transit corridors, and stop letting developers take up lanes of traffic to build their for-profit buildings.\nIT\u2019S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE! LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS!!!!!! THE FACTS AND FIGURES ARE CLEAR AS DAY!!\nYou\u2019re doing the exact opposite of what will fix the problem of gridlock!!\n"

The bike lanes part is against evidence and seems like Ford just has a personal problem with bike lanes and cyclists. The bike lanes I've seen don't remove a lane of traffic, it is street parking that is removing a lane of traffic, why not ban street parking on busy roads?\nThe plan to remove existing bike lanes in Toronto is an absurd waste of money and will not improve traffic, bikes will just be in the same lanes as cars and cause more grid lock, making it more dangerous for both cyclists and drivers. This is ridiculous, if you want less traffic, build better public transportation.\n"

Cyclists tend to stop more frequently and browse local shops compared to people stuck in traffic. Plus, with more people on bikes, there's less congestion overall, which makes the area more pleasant for everyone. In the long run, I think investing in bike lanes is an investment in the future of our community and good for business too.\n"

        "comment": "As a road user that primarily use a car, I am deeply concerned about the Government's intention to remove bike lanes or put barriers to their development. The removal of bike lanes will not prevent bike users to use the road. This will not help address traffic concerns, and will make sharing between cars and bikes more dangerous, increasing the risk of deadly accidents. Bike lanes are beneficial to all road users including automobile users. I hope that the Government will reassess this proposal.\nThe following sources highlight the benefits of bike lanes:\n- \"Cyclist-motor vehicle collisions before and after implementation of cycle tracks in Toronto, Canada\" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000145751930658X\n- \"Debunking three big myths about bike lanes\" https://www.tvo.org/article/debunking-three-big-myths-about-bike-lanes\n- \"Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion?

From first hand experience the lanes make things so much smoother for both drivers and cyclists. And the lanes in Toronto have been packed with cyclists. Want to reduce gridlock? We need alternatives to driving, like more transit, and safe biking. That doesn\u2019t mean a war on cars. Just give people options.\nEnd this terrible policy immediately. More people will get stuck in traffic, and more importantly, people will get HURT and will DIE.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, I've actually preferred driving since the city added bike lanes. It used to be so stressful trying to navigate around cyclists who were constantly darting in and out of traffic. Now, with the dedicated bike lanes, everyone knows where they belong. It's like a breath of fresh air. The roads feel less chaotic, and I find myself driving more calmly and enjoying the ride. Plus, it's great to see more people embracing a healthier and more sustainable way of getting around. Bike lanes are a win-win for everyone. I think if you really want to improve congestion you need to make better public transit.\n"

As a cyclist, I exclusively use routes with thoughtfully designed bike lanes to get to and from my destinations safely. Jeopardizing the safety of cyclists by removing bike lanes will have a profound effect on all motorists including drivers.  Please consider the impact this legislation will have on thousands of residents who are reliant upon this critical safety measure.

        "comment": "This is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirst, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be going THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\nUsing bike lanes to sneak through removing environmental assessments to expedite construction of the unnecessary 413 and Bradford Bypass is classless and underhanded. Do better.\n"

They provide character and cohesiveness. Why can't we strive to be like that? This proposed bill is an old school way of thinking and we should be forward thinking.\nWhen I drive my car, I expect delays because it is an inefficient mode of transportation and I am fully aware of that. I think all drivers should be aware of this, you have the privilege of being in a covered environment away from the elements. There is a tradeoff. Suck it up and be patient in traffic, you will eventually arrive to your destination.\n"

These bike lanes serve very few people and that vast majority of cyclists do not use these lanes year round. It would serve the greater part of the population to have more lanes for vehicles. Less grid lock for vehicles also means that there is less pollution from vehicles idling in traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just shortsighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nEvidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those who rely on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without access to vehicles. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment.\n"

While drivers might possibly experience slightly longer commute times (even that is questionable), cyclists face the very real threat of serious injury or even death when sharing the road with cars. Biking accidents are a tragic reality in the city, and eliminating bike lanes would only exacerbate this problem. We need to prioritize the safety of all road users, especially those who are most vulnerable. Let\u2019s create a transportation system that values human life over minor inconveniences.\n"
