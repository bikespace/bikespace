I have to allow 40 minutes for what used to be a 10 minute trip. Frustrated drivers are switching to Dundas St., which is getting just as bad. I don't need statistics from the City justifying bike lanes - I can see the gridlock myself, and how few bicyclists are using these bike lanes. Give me back my city!\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto.\nThe removal of bike lanes is completely backwards. More traffic lanes in the city increase traffic as more people are forced to use cars, they make the city less safe for pedestrians and bikers and are terrible for not only the natural environment but for the cities cultural environment as well making Toronto look ugly and unwelcoming.\nWe need to add more bike lanes as this creates induced demand for more people to bike places making the city healthier in the process. Also it is such a waste of taxpayer money, of MY money to remove bike lanes?? it makes no sense to spend money on removing something that has been a net benefit to the city by every metric.\nIf people are having difficulty commuting from outside of Toronto there should be space for more buses, subways, and trains to allow for a more efficient commute, not increasing traffic by requiring more people to drive.\nIf any bike lanes start being removed protests will be organized and there will be much push back please don't ruin our beautiful city and province with more roads.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my disappointment of Bill 212 which is not founded on any factual based evidence that removing bike lanes will help \"reduce traffic\". In fact, the opposite will happen as adding more vehicular lanes to streets will induce a greater number of people (who now have LESS choice to travel) to actually drive instead. I am a cyclist who commutes to work and I use the Bloor Bike lanes nearly every single day, as well as the University bike lanes which provide an essential north south connection to the core - where many people work. Having the province decide to remove bike lanes and make decisions on behalf of the municipality is an abuse of power and it really should not be up to the province to determine how the city functions. They have spent years on building this infrastructure which has been proven to boost businesses and increase cycling ridership in the City (see how many bike share memberships have exploded in the last few years). Why are we regressing by removing this much needed infrastructure which continues to help give alternatives to people who DON'T want to be stuck in this so called \"traffic\"? It's quite incomprehensible what the Province is trying to do. We live in an URBAN city, not the suburbs. It's expected that you don't drive your car downtown if you don't want to be stuck in congestion. Please open up the Crosstown, Ontario Line, and give people better options for moving. Don't take these options away.\n"

It is a sad day when our taxes once again are misused by this myopic climate denying government.  I come into the city from the gta regularly and choose  not to drive a car.   Perhaps the minister of transportation should be required to take public transit as a role model.  A person choosing to ride a bike can do so if there is a bike lane or not.  having bike lanes makes it safer for all.  Stop trying to buy our votes by wasting our hard earned dollars on none sense ideas\n"

This is a terrible idea and goes against hours of public consultation that people have provided on how they want to see their city changed for the better.\nThis government is a disgrace for putting such a bill forward and lumping in local city based policy with a plan for a 400 series highway - two vastly different pieces of infrastructure that have zero relation to one another.\nWe don't need more drivers getting places faster - we need all Ontarian's to get everywhere faster which includes cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and those using other mobility devices.\nFor shame.\n"

        "comment": "I support this motion. University avenue is a major street where ambulances need to get to hospitals and sometimes it is reduced to 1 lane.  It\u2019s has been a traffic nightmare to get emergency and acutely ill patients to the hospitals in the downtown core (Toronto General, Princess Margaret, Sinai, Toronto Rehab, Sick Kids). Some of these hospitals are quaternary facilities (ie transplant). The effects of delayed care are an issue that hasn\u2019t been measured since the construction of these bike lanes. However, as a clinician, precious minutes could mean the difference between a worse of life threatening outcome.\nI agree with bike lanes being removed from the major arteries of the streets as cars have had a hard time accessing the downtown core and is essentially gridlocked.\n"

It occupies provincial government time and energy that should be spent on provincial infrastructure.  Removing existing bike lanes and the cost associated with it also doesn't make sense. This proposal is just for political  favour and does not improve congestion or aid in environmental issues for the future. As even the premier knows and has said on record, cycling without cycle lanes is dangerous and this year already has already recorded a high number of cycling deaths on Toronto streets. Removing lanes will only add to deaths and serious injury to cyclists who are also tax paying citizens. With actions like these I will be looking for and promoting a change to a new government when given the chance.\n"

I\u2019m speaking with regular bikers and as a car driver, I can say these bike lanes add no value:\n1 - traffic has been impeeded on major routes, negatively impacting local business, the backbone of our community\n2 - the lanes are unsafe to bikers in the way they were built.  The lanes hide bikers behind parked cars, making it very hard for drivers to see them, creating significant hazzards for all on the road\n3 - as a city that experiences real winter, and inclement shoulder seasons, bikers admit to not wanting to use the lanes for at least half of the year, meaning traffic is disrupted for no reason\n4 - the significant traffic impact has meant that cars are re-routing to residential streets, causing safety concerns for children walking to and from school and playing with friends\nThe lanes need to be removed.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a threat to road safety, local businesses and climate change. While the bill proposes a framework to tackle gridlock, its approach is not based in evidence and data.\nThere is so much research that shows that bike lanes are not the cause of traffic congestion. For example:\n1. Adding vehicle lanes to roadways actually increases congestion and carbon emissions because it's creating induced demand by encouraging more cars on the road in the long-run. Source: http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124/\u2026\n2. Bike lanes encourage more people to leave their cars at home and gives them a more reliable way to get from point A to B. Between 2015-2023, Bike Share Toronto ridership has increased from 665,000 bike trips to 5.7 million trips annually. Source: https://schoolofcities.github.io/bike-share-toronto/growth Every one of those trips is taking a vehicle off the road to reduce congestion. This shows that if you invest in bike infrastructure, people will use it.\n3. Bike lanes bring in more customers to local businesses. A 2019 study found that the number of customers frequenting local businesses increased after the installation of the Bloor bike lane. Businesses also reported more consumer spending post-bike lane installation. Customers who arrived by bike or foot also reported higher spending in the area than folks who arrived by car or transit. Source: https://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bloor-Economic-Impact-St\u2026 During a time when many local businesses are struggling to bounce back from COVID due to rising rent and inflation, this Bill will further hurt storefronts along Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave.\n4. Bike lanes keep people safe. 6 cyclists have died in 2024, which is the highest number of cyclist fatalities in the city in the last five years. Personally, I was in a bike accident on Adelaide a few years ago before they put in separated bike lanes. Sadly, my story is not unique as the majority of cyclists in this city have also been in at least one accident. It's terrifying to bike on roads without proper bike infrastructure and I now limit my routes to ones that have bike lanes. Removing bike lanes and impeding the development of bike infrastructure in this city is completely negligent, irresponsible and dangerous to the safety of Torontonians. Removing bike lanes will without a doubt cause more cyclist accidents and deaths.\nThe root cause of gridlock in the city is an underfunded and crumbling transit system and limited bike infrastructure giving people alternative ways to get around the city. The reality is that COVID has also increased the number of vehicles on the road as many Torontonians have been priced out of the city due to rising housing costs but still need to commute into the city. Rather than propose a Bill that's based on false claims about bike lanes adding to congestion, the Province needs to be spending taxpayer dollars on holistic and evidence-based solutions that will support transit and transformation infrastructure development that benefits EVERYBODY. This Bill is irresponsible and short-sighted to say the least.\n"

        "comment": "People who cycle are not secondary to car drivers. Cyclists commute times, safety, and access are not addressed here. How are cyclists supposed to travel to their destinations without bike lanes on main roads to get them there safely?\nHow does a cyclist use side streets to get to work/store/school if main streets are the only route to these in places? Toronto wasn't built the way you are describing. If its not practical or feasible your plan doesn't work. If a cyclist uses a neighborhood side street, sure that sounds nice to maybe have a short leisurely ride for fun, but if it doesn't connect anywhere non-residential how can one travel anywhere useful on their bike?\nThis legislation makes no sense. Please throw it in the recycling. Maybe next time consult with experts and actual travellers who cycle in cities to make informed future legislation that makes sense.\nMPPs vote NO!\n"
