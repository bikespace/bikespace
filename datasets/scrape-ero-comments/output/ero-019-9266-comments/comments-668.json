        "comment": "How come people who do not even live in the city (let's include Etobicoke) in there are try to push forward something that affects the livelihood of people who live in the city when they infrequently visit the city and refuse to take public transportation? How can removing a bike lane on Yonge (which cost a lot of taxpayer dollars) affect traffic at the 401/ 427 highways?\nWhat does removing a bike lane accomplish? If somehow, a car lane is fit in, all that will happen is that cars will use that for parking and then cyclists will use the road and slow down traffic even more?\nCan the City of Toronto step up and prevent outsiders (who are the minority in the GTA) from disrupting our way of life? I bike to work 3 times/ week. I don't ask Mississauga to change for me, so it does not make sense vice versa.\nAlso, why is Toronto different than other major cities? If you visit cities all over the world, there is a trend towards building better bike infrastructure (because it literally takes cars off the road). I don't want Toronto to go backwards, and we keep using tax dollars to build and remove bike lanes.\nLeave us alone in the city, and just take your car and drive around on your highways.\n"

Removal of bike lanes will result in unsafe situations for cyclist, who may have to 'take the lane' to ensure their safety, which will likely have unintended impact on other road users.\n"

I spend much less time in my car. I also feel much safer on bike lanes. I have kids who are starting to bike around the city and bike lanes improves our safety. There will still be bikes on bloor, bike lanes or not. This is silly and huge waste of money.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my profound dismay at the Progressive Conservatives' recent efforts to not only limit the development of new bike lanes, but even to rip up existing bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge and Avenue. Misleadingly Bill 212 is called 'Reducing Gridlock, Saving you Time.' But, in fact, evidence has shown again and again that bike lanes are not the cause of traffic congestion.\nThis is truly a colossal waste of money--the money that has already been invested in building the bike lanes and the money that will be used to take them out.\nPlease, I beg you to retract this bill that will only diminish the health of the city. Both myself and my husband routinely use these bike routes to get to work. Even a quick look on Google maps reveals that there are no feasible alternate bike routes. So we will continue to use Yonge and Bloor out of necessity even if the lanes are gone, only we will be so much less safe. And for what end? Cyclists will lose, businesses will lose, drivers will lose (as gridlock will not improve and now they will need to navigate around bikes), and the taxpayer will lose. It saddens me that the government would consider such a pointless and destructive act.\n"

Toronto has spent years and tens of millions of dollars to implement a city wide cycling infrastructure that moves people safely and efficiently. It\u2019s a success and I\u2019m appalled that the Ontario government would act to remove these routes. The province has many serious issues; eliminating Toronto bike lanes is not one of them. Show some of your self proclaimed \u201ccommon sense\u201d and leave these lanes alone.\n"

Study after study has shown not only the POSITIVE economic effects of bike lanes on local neighborhoods but that it REDUCES overall traffic congestion, and improves emergency response times.\nBill 212 ignores all this evidence supporting bike lanes while touting it's goal of reducing traffic congestion. This is absurd.\nFurther, this is a vast over reach of municipal jurisdiction to govern their own affairs. Local planning decisions must be left to their elected officials at the municipality level, and not at the provincial level. I demand the withdrawal of this Bill. We will remember your actions and that of others come next provincial election.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to the proposal to remove bike lanes in Toronto, and to need the approval of the province to put in new bike lanes in the future. Canada has signed the Paris Accord, which requires a steep reduction in our carbon emissions. We are not going to get there as long as the province encourages people to keep driving when there are other less polluting forms of transit possible. We need people to find other ways to get around the city: public transit, walking, cycling. The Province's proposal will discourage people from cycling. The complaints over bike lanes are coming from people who do not recognize our collective responsibility to change our ways. No one will be thanking us when climate change causes impossibly hot summers, and our alibi is that people like their cars. We must live up to our international agreements.\nI am a cyclist who uses the Bloor and Yonge bike lanes. Should they be torn out, you will make my life less secure. You will also be endangering the lives of the food delivery riders who are the majority of users of the Bloor bike lanes in afternoon rush hour. They will not go through the maze of residential streets parallel to Bloor. They will stay on Bloor and the other east-west corridors, being endangered by cars.\nThis is bad policy, and it should be stopped before it is law.\n"

I tend to only go to built up areas that have safe bike infrastructure. If the safe passage is removed I believe it is a huge step backwards, bad for the environment, and will only succeed in providing a few more parking spaces for a few cars. Waste. Gridlock will happen. Or drivers will drive faster around cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists and public transit riders are doing their part to reduce traffic both congestion and harmful greenhouse emissions. Their efforts should be supported by increasing cycling and public transit infrastructure, not punished by removing bike lanes, reducing bus services, and raising public transit fees.\nWhen I travel (by GO bus) on Ontario\u2019s highways during rush hour, it\u2019s apparent that the vast majority (probably over 90%) of cars caught up in the congested highways have only one person in them. Instead of punishing cyclists, the government should consider offering incentives to commuters to car pool or take public transportation.\nRipping out Toronto bike lanes creates a disincentive for cyclists and an incentive for drivers. In the long run will increase, not decrease, congestion and greenhouse gasses and have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of all Toronto residents. Ford\u2019s proposed anti-congestion law is nothing more than a cheap grab for the votes of frustrated car drivers at the expense of cyclists and city residents. If Ford is truly interested in a plan to reduce traffic congestion, I suggest he look to the highly successful strategies of cities like London and Paris.\n"

        "comment": "I don't believe Provincial overreach is the answer to a city's issues. This feels like a slippery slope. What happens if the province decides bus lanes need to be removed or sidewalks shrunk to make more parking? This isn't how a 3 tiered government should work. Cities should determine what's best for its residences. Most decisions about bike lanes, parking, complete streets etc. are made after significant studies not knee-jerk reactions. I drive, I bike and I walk throughout the city. Some areas work better than others, but this bill will do nothing to help traffic and again is a massive overreach. Removing bike lanes will reduce cyclists, add cars and force bikes into car lanes. Bikes will slow down car lanes if they re too take up a complete lane of traffic as the law indicates they are allowed to. That is a lose lose situation for everybody. We should find a common sense solution, not this ridiculous bill.\n"

Having connected sections of bicycle lanes is important to allow cyclists to commute.\nI am waiting for a section of Yonge Street to have a bicycle lane so I can commute safely. I believe it is too dangerous to bicycle in a car lane, where cars often speed and do not give adequate room when passing bicycles.\nIt has been many years of small incremental additions to bicycle lanes but soon there will be enough connectivity to allow commuting by bicycle. This legislation destroys this connectivity.\nThis legislation is a great overreach by the Provincial government into Municipal affairs. Local matters should be decided by local government.\nFinally, with global warming a looming issue, moving commuters to bicycles will reduce carbon footprint. This should be encouraged not discouraging as this legislation will do.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the provincial conservatives position that they should have the ability to disapprove of municipal plans related to bike lanes. I STRONGLY disagree with their proposal to remove existing bike lanes that have been instituted in municipalities, often after rigorous study, consultation, and expense to construct.\nIf you create fewer safe options for commuters (cyclists, pedestrians, transit riders) then you are only going to increase the number of people who feel pressured/induced to drive their cars. We should be taking measures to reduce the number of cars within urban centres.\nWe should have an entry fee for cars coming into densely populated and trafficked parts of Toronto for example. We should direct revenues from these types of tolls towards transit, maintenance and expansion of bike lanes, improved pedestrian infrastructure, and more.\nMore cars will increase noise pollution, air pollution, create more deadly/dangerous road conditions, and reduce the health of residents who will be less inclined to walk, bike, or otherwise engage in physical activities that promote an active and fit population.\nIf the density of Toronto increases (as it has, as it will) given the types of housing developments in the present and on the horizon, another lane isn't going to solve ANYTHING. A single line of TTC subway can move as many people in a day as the entire Toronto stretch of the 401, why would we give up space and safety to the least efficient and most dangerous mode of transportation? There is no good answer to that question.\nIt is also worth noting the dramatic income opportunities available to independent and local businesses when areas are walkable and bikable. Car drivers are not able to frequent as many businesses, and their cars take up space that could be used by businesses (street-side patios, and other festivals/activations).\nInducing demand for cars, and forcing people to drive cars as single occupants is the among the most regressive tactics. We are not in the 1950s.\nPlease think about future generations that will inhabit this city. Please think about the current community members whose safety and well being is risked by your proposal. Please think about the economic vibrancy of our communities that will never be served by more room for cars.\n"

No matter how many passengers were in that vehicle, that one vehicle remains to completely block that lane. Compare that to bicycles. When a bicycle rider gets to it's destination, the bicycle is completely removed from the bicycle transit lane.\nMaybe it would be much more noticeable when all the bicycles that arrived at their destination were left roadside. We always see vehicles parked but bicycles are often whisked away to be parked in often unseen locations.\n"
