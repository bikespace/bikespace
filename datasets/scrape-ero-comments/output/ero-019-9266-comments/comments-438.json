        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill. Urban Toronto should be for everyone, not only motorists. Those 3 specific bike lanes are some of Canada\u2019s most used and successful. From an economic perspective, pedestrians and cyclists are much more likely to stop, shop and eat at the many shops they pass, bringing economic vitality to these routes (as opposed to cars which require parking in order to stop and explore an area). Cycling is also a healthier and more environmentally positive mode of transportation than increased car reliance.\nSimilar to Toronto\u2019s King St streetcar corridor, these bike lanes make the roads quieter and safer for everyone, and bring higher density of cycling and foot traffic which fuels the street side businesses.\nOntario cannot go backwards; car prioritization is not sustainable and we need to encourage cycling, walking and transit as the optimal routes within our urban hubs.\nI supported Mr. Ford in the prior election - I will 100% vote against Mr. Ford if this bill is passed.\nThank you for reviewing my feedback. Cheers.\n"

        "comment": "If we want to reduce gridlock, we need to focus on a long-term solution! Cities that are accessible without requiring the need to drive. I understand the current infrastructure promotes the convenience of driving. However, as the population grows and if we are concerned about the environment and building healthy communities, then it is not sustainable to rely solely on driving. We can take a page from Europe and Asia where walkability, public transit and other means of transportation is prioritized over owning and driving a vehicle. Although the bike lanes may have negatively affected drivers, there have also been positives out of it.\nAnecdotally, I can say that these bike lanes have changed my life for the better (and many others I have spoken to). Prior to the installation of the bike lanes, I did not even own a bicycle let alone call myself a cyclist. I was too scared to bike anywhere \"public\" and it always felt like anywhere in Toronto was far to get to. It is thanks to these bicycle lanes that the City installed, I have learned to cycle safely and confidentally in the city. I am now excited about the idea of going out because it is so easy to bike from one place to another. I have also been an avid supporter of people cycling for physical and mental wellbeing, saving money, saving time and saving the environment from all the consumption a car requires. It has even allowed me to support local businesses I wouldn't have noticed if I were driving!\nDriving is expensive for both the city and for the individual users. The need to maintain roads, for individuals to own and maintain their own car. We're worried about housing space? Well if people need to own cars, we have to think about that too!\nThe City needs to take a leap of faith and trust that these bicycle lanes will result in more permanent and significant changes in the mindset of citizens. Just like how the Bixi bikes took time to rise in popularity, so will the adoption of cycling and a more car-free city. You can't build a great building on a weak foundation - and that weak foundation would be removal of the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am hugely in support of removing the bike lanes on all major roadways. I hope it includes not just the downtown area but the GTA as a whole.\nI currently live in the Bloor West Village area and the traffic is horrific since the bike lanes were put in. The bike lanes don\u2019t have much volume and it has made a total mess to drive around here as the traffic is now backed up bumper to bumper through multiple intersections along Bloor St which then leads to backed up traffic along the a-joining roads  leading to Bloor St. The congestion then backs up on side streets and putting lots of cars in areas were little kids are walking and playing therefore making it unsafe for them to play in front of their home.\nA perfect example is the intersections of where Bloor meets Jane St and where Bloor meets the South Kingsway and where Bloor meets Armadale. These three intersections are one block from each other. The traffic lights change and no one is able to move. The bike lanes took away the second lane, everyone is pushing their way into one lane and it just doesn\u2019t work. When both lanes were open for cars it was busy but if the left turn lane was backed up the ones going straight could do so in the second lane. Not now, everyone sits and waits and honks and get aggressive.\nAlso Because of the bike lanes on Bloor west of the South Kingsway (which by the way make no sense as they are very rarely anyone using them) the traffic moving East to turn on the South Kingsway heading down to the Gardiner is now backed up over the Humber bridge and many times as far as into the Kingsway area,  every week day and sometimes on the weekends also. Terrible and totally not needed.\nAs a person who has mobility issues it made it next to impossible to get to my physio and doctor appointments. Sometimes all the parking was turned into bike lanes and there was no parking for a car until the next block or two. I could barely walk at that time. And if I had someone drive me the car or taxi would have to stop in the only lane which was the live lane of traffic which was the only lane for traffic and everyone would have to wait for me to get out, then get my walker out and then wait and watch me try to find a place where I could go through with my walker because with those cement barriers and reflective sticks where too close together and I could not step and or lift my walker over them. Then I was stressed and upset as I was holding up all the traffic as everyone watched and waited for me.\nI have seen at least 4 times where on Bloor near High Park Firetrucks unable to get through traffic because there was not enough room to drive down the middle of the road even though everyone was pulled off to the right to let them through. The city has made the lanes so narrow they were not able to give the firetruck enough room.\nThese bike lanes are more of a blind spot when making right turns as they have you swinging out so far you can\u2019t get an unobstructed view as to see if any bikes are coming. Also low bikes or mopeds \u201chide\u201d along side  of the parked cars they are not seen until you have actually started turning. I found it safer when you could look into your side mirror, check if a bike was   coming or not and make your turn. They have gone crazy overboard with lines all over the place, reflective sticks, different colours painted and the constant curving of lines for you to follow rather then majority being straight with slight bends in them. Also you will be driving in a lane of traffic that without notice suddenly becomes a left or right turn lane only.  I have noticed more and more bike signals at intersections these days\u2026..but those who are using the lanes are ignoring them!!\nAlso, don\u2019t think bike lanes should be used for motorized vehicles like electric bikes, electric scooters, mopeds, etc. Many times I have been driving along the road at the correct speed limits and these electric bikes fly right past me. They too need to be held to the laws of the road especially the speed limits!!  I know its hard to police them but drivers are not the only reason accidents happen. Cyclists don\u2019t obey the laws, go through red lights, wave themselves into multiple lanes of traffic trying to take a short cut to get across the street.\nIn the end, bike lanes, as they have been built are not good for Toronto. It is one of the main reasons the gridlock is out of control for our amazing city.\nLastly, if the city is so short of money, why have they taken away a huge source of revenue they were getting from all the Green P street parking fees???  And why, if they are so short of money have they spent a fortune on bike lanes and have delayed other projects that should have taken priority??\nI really hope Doug Ford steps up and fixes the bike lane mess the city has made. Most people I speak to are not happy with them and that jas included some cyclists.\nGood luck, I\u2019m counting on you Doug. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\n"

        "comment": "Having reviewed the bill and read up on coverage of it in the media, I have two main comments to make. They depend on the government's motives. Please don't take the second point to be an attack. I simply do not know from my perspective what motivation the government has.\n1) If the government is motivated to improve traffic congestion, I don't think this bill is a good way to do it. Municipalities know their roads and road users best. If a city like Toronto decides that a lane is better utilized as a bike lane, it's because they know after performing careful study that it will move more people. Bikes are smaller than cars, buses and streetcars hold more people than cars, etc. Sometimes the math just works out that way. Let cities do their job to move the most people.\n2) If the government is politically motivated, hoping to be more popular during the next election by doing this, then this bill represents a dangerous road to go down. Things like cycling should not become political. It shouldn't be a \"PC thing\" or an \"NDP thing\" to want to use a lane for one purpose or another. It's just about moving people best. That's it. If we go down this path, we're going to see other things that are best decided by experts start to be thought of as political, and progress on them is going to slow.\nThanks for reading,\nMatt\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto citizen, bike owner, and Ontario taxpayer, I adamantly oppose Bill 212 because of the proposed removal of bike lanes in my city. Bike lanes represent the type of critical infrastructure needed to actually manage traffic congestion. More lanes is not the answer to traffic congestion; it is a debunked myth that never yields the desired result. For every bike that replaces a car on the road, we improve traffic flow, reduce emissions, and improve safety. More cyclists and fewer motorists benefit literally all parties \u2014 other motorists, the environment, and businesses along cycle paths which see increased foot traffic and consumer spending. Further than the proposal itself is the Province clearly overstepping and inserting itself into municipal matters. The City has a government to serve the city \u2014 let it do exactly that. To think of the money that will be wasted removing bike lanes that have just been constructed is sickening. Rest assured, I will absolutely not vote for the Provincial Conservatives in the next election if they pass Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes or any related cycling infrastructure should be the exclusive domain of municipalities in Ontario. These bike lanes were only made permanent after pilot programs have demonstrated that there were no or negligible impacts on motor vehicle travel times while boosting the revenues of local businesses. I am not aware of this being required for any new or expanded roadways for cars. Data and evidence-based policy decisions need to take precedence over ideological approaches that are couched in terms of \"common sense\".\nThe numerous factors and stakeholder involved do not make the solutions obvious ones and available research and expert analysis needs to be used to assist development and implementation of public policy.\nIf the province really wants to do something about traffic congestion it should allow the City of Toronto to impose a toll on vehicles entering the central portion of the city similar to what other large cities in other jurisdictions have successfully done to address traffic congestion. It seems to be \"common sense\" that it is necessary to make alternatives to individual car ownership and operation available and viable. Currently vehicle use on public roads is indirectly and heavily subsidized by all levels of government by not applying user fees as is the case with public transit.  There are many examples of cities around the world where this has been successfully done and Toronto and Ontario would be well served to take advantage of what has been learned elsewhere.\n"

I would bike to commute to the subway to get to work, do chores or go to social events if there was a safe option in my neighborhood. It's a waste of money to pull bike lanes out, couldn't that money be better spent on filling pot holes? The roads are congested because the population of Toronto is increasing and addressing congestion isn't going to be solved by putting everyone into a car. It can only be addressed by giving people options, and that includes cycling, transit, walking and cars. I hope there's no bill to take away side walks to give more space to cars! There's lots of evidence from Canadian cities that if you build bike lanes that are safe, businesses will do better, residents feel safer and the bike lanes get used. And there's even examples in Canada where traffic improved by getting some people out of cars and on bikes (see Vancouver).\n"

We know this doesn't work. It has never worked. More cars will just fill the space and you will have removed a safe, reliable, and affordable alternative to driving.\nDuring a housing and cost of living crisis, the very last thing the province should be doing is removing affordable and safe ways for people to get to work, school and home again.\nI beg you to reconsider this bill.

        "comment": "Creating new laws that add more red tape and shift the approvals process from the municipalities is not efficient or cost effective. It's like an adult needing to go to mummy or daddy to get the okay for everything. The municipalities are the best stewards of our roads and infrastructure as they have the best understanding of the daily transportation requirements of their residents. All levels of government should be works together as a team. This bill is a heavy handed approach to governing that is inappropriate and disrespectful of role municipalities play in governing.\nFrom a health perspective, we should be encouraging people to make use of cycle paths for their own personal health and the health of their communities by lowering the emissions created by cars.\nFrom a safety perspective, having separate lanes for bicycles help drivers by creating less distractions on the road as cyclists can often be difficult to see. Adding in permanent cycling infrastructure often comes with improvements to intersections making them safer for all users not just drivers or cyclists.\nIf this government wanted to help with congestion they would work toward creating more options for getting around rather than removing options. Removal of newly installed safer infrastructure is fiscally irresponsible and when Ontario has one of the largest deficits I don't think it's smart or prudent to just demolish it.\n"

        "comment": "I travel by bike, by car, by transit and by foot - so I experience all aspects of this issue.\nThis proposal is ridiculous, ill-planned, and vindictive.\nCongestion is a problem - and the way to improve it is to reduce car traffic by promoting better transit and bike lanes, not the reverse.\nThis proposal is not backed up by evidence. The most recent studies done show minimal impact on car travel by bike lanes.  Some of them even show bikes lanes improved car travel times.   Construction, on the other hand, quite clearly slows car (and bike) travel.\nThe idea of bike lanes on side streets instead of major streets is silly.  Quiet side streets are just where bike lanes are not needed - such streets are already safe and pleasant for bike travel. If such routes exist that get me where I need to go, I will bike on them, with no need for a bike lane.  But the road grid is such that there is no reasonable way to get by bike from where I live (north of Danforth) to where I regularly commute (Queen & University or Bloor & Spadina) without going on major roads.\nThis proposal will make my life less safe and less pleasant - and encourage me to take my car instead of my bike - thus increasing congestion.\n"

Look across the pond in Europe and learn. At the moment 70% commute by car and that\u2019s not sustainable at all. I get that bike lanes alone won\u2019t solve the problem but it can certainly help especially in the warmer months\u2026 look at all the tourists using bikes! Plus city bike ridership is up by hundreds of % in the last few years.\nThe real answer is of course more accessible public transit!

This legislation is clearly targeting the City of Toronto (as explicitly stated in the requirements to remove existing bikelanes within the municipality) when the Ontario government should be focused on the good of the entire province (rather than restricting development that might hurt the commute of MPPs to Queen's Park). Additionally, this forced removal of existing bikelanes within the City of Toronto is ridiculous considering they were implemented using municipal taxpayer dollars rather than being funded by the provincial government. If this legislation is passed, the provincial government should be required to pay for both the removal and the original costs of installation rather than leaving the burden on the citizens of Toronto for an unnecessary action as the existing bikelanes save cyclist lives and produce alternatives to driving (that reduces gridlock) or the underfunded TTC.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to Ontario Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, for several important reasons. Removing bike lanes as a strategy to ease traffic congestion is misguided and lacks evidence. In reality, eliminating bike lanes will likely increase traffic issues rather than alleviate them, as research consistently shows that reducing cycling infrastructure leads to more congestion, not less. This action would also put lives at risk, ultimately leading to higher costs for the city in terms of healthcare, emergency services, and legal fees.\nToronto's history provides a clear example of this issue. After bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, city data revealed that travel times actually increased, slowing traffic instead of reducing it. Removing bike lanes not only endangers cyclists but discourages sustainable transportation options, increasing reliance on cars and worsening gridlock.\nInstead of adopting policies that compromise safety and weaken urban infrastructure, the province should prioritize investments that genuinely benefit residents, such as improved healthcare and education. These efforts would serve Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to appease drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 is a step backward for both Toronto and Ontario. Sustainable urban planning should promote multimodal transportation solutions that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government's priority should be creating a livable, accessible city for all, not just those who drive to work in the city.\n"

Spend my tax on improving scalable infrastructure. Build more rail, build denser housing.\nProvide tax incentives for businesses who have people working from home. That will reduce gridlock much faster and extensively than building any infrastructure. My commute went to 0 after I got a remote job, that should be the goal.\n"
