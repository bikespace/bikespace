        "comment": "I am a taxpaying resident in Toronto, having lived in Etobicoke and elsewhere in Toronto for most of my life. I am appalled that the provincial government is overreaching into an area of municipal responsibility by including the removal of bike lanes along some major Toronto streets as part of Bill 212. By removing bike lanes along these major streets, it seems that the Ford government is more concerned about potentially (although this is debatable) saving automobile drivers a few minutes of their time than they are about the lives of Toronto residents who choose to ride a bicycle downtown. In addition to putting the lives of cyclists at more risk with the possible removal of bike lanes, this would be a HUGE waste of taxpayer funds ($48 million, based on a City of Toronto report). Those funds can be put to much better use for residents of Toronto.\nI use various modes of transportation in Toronto, including the TTC, GO Transit, as well as walking, cycling and occasionally driving into and out of downtown Toronto. Like many other people who choose to drive downtown on occasion, I simply find other routes to take if I would prefer not to drive on the roads which include bike lanes. Or, I drive less often. People adapt.\nMany residents are not just cyclists or just drivers, but rather we use different modes for different purposes. Bike lanes benefit everyone over time, including drivers, by reducing the number of cars on the road. And to reiterate, BIKE LANES SAVE LIVES by making it safer to get around the city by bike.\nIn anticipation of a rebuttal from the Ford government that these bike lanes could have been installed along other streets, I would like to point out that installing bike lanes along major streets such as these makes it much easier and more direct for cyclists to get around downtown. If we want people to seriously consider shifting some of their trips to cycling trips, and thus reducing traffic (over time) by taking more cars off the road, we need to make it safer and more convenient for cyclists by installing protected bike lanes in convenient locations.\nPLEASE reverse the ill-conceived decision to include bike lane removal as part of Bill 212. The amount of money that would need to be spent goes against the Conservative party\u2019s position to be \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am a married 60-year-old mother of three adult children who lives and works in Midtown Toronto. Our family owns two cars and many bicycles. We often ride our bicycles in the protected bike lanes and other bike lanes to do local errands and commute to school and work downtown. In our case, this helps to ease congestion as we typically only take our cars if we need to transport things like groceries or hockey bags or if we need to travel further afar. I believe  that the bike lanes along Bloor, University and Young Street save lives. Several years ago my middle child was hit by a car that swerved into a non-protected bike lane.  thankfully he was not seriously injured only bruised, although his bike was destroyed. I have another son who commutes downtown using the bloor street and university bike lanes as he works in the financial district. These bike lanes are essential to his safe commute. It is not possible to get where we need to go only using side streets. Without protected by lanes, I personally would not feel safe and would end up driving my car thus contributing to the traffic congestion. Thank you for your consideration\n"

        "comment": "My primary concerns are:\n1- Inaccurate Data from Bike Counter:\nWe have reservations about the accuracy of the bike counter located in High Park. Reliable data is paramount when making infrastructural decisions, and we believe that this counter may not be providing an accurate reflection of bike usage.\n2-Scarce Cyclist Usage:\nMany residents and businesses along Bloor St. have observed a limited number of cyclists using the designated lanes. When designing infrastructure, it's essential that it reflects the needs and usage patterns of the community.\n3-Two Lanes Each Way on Bloor St.:\nIt's crucial for Bloor Street to maintain two lanes of traffic in each direction to accommodate the heavy vehicular flow. The reduction to a single lane has caused significant congestion and has been a source of constant frustration for motorists.\n4-Reduction in Traffic Flow:\nThe transition from two-lane roads to single lanes to accommodate bike lanes has significantly reduced the efficiency of vehicle flow. This change has caused increased congestion, prolonged travel times, and a heightened risk of accidents.\n5-Impact on Community Traffic Flow:\nWhile we recognize the importance of providing right of way for bikes, this should not come at the cost of significantly impeding the flow of vehicular traffic or causing confusion that may lead to accidents.\n6-Loss of Business Revenue:\nWith the added congestion and limited cyclist patronage, businesses along Bloor St. are reporting reduced footfall, which threatens their livelihoods and impacts the vitality of our local economy.\nDelayed Emergency Response: A reduced number of lanes can significantly hinder the rapid movement of emergency vehicles, leading to potential delays in critical responses.\n7-Lack of Comprehensive Infrastructure:\nBike lanes must be a part of a broader, well-thought-out system that ensures safety and harmony between all road users.\nNeed for Proper Intersection Management: Efficient movement at intersections is vital. The inclusion of right and left turn lanes with bike signals will help in achieving this.\n8-Inadequate Utilization of Roadbed Capacity:\nEfficient utilization of our existing roadbed is necessary to ensure smooth traffic flow and safety for all users.\nAs such I would like to propose removal of the bike lanes on Bloor Street from Islington to High Park.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is undemocratic, wasteful of taxpayer dollars, wasteful of road-space and hobbles local government in areas traditionally governed at the local level.  It reduces the flexibility of our transportation systems and in most cases will have precisely the opposite of it's intended effect; creating more gridlock as more people drive and cycling becomes less viable.  It is especially egregious to waste millions of taxpayer dollars removing services that we have spent millions to install.  Where are the provisions to adequately study each case and act in accordance with best practices?   Simplistic logic applied to transportation design is of no help and leads to congestion and deaths.\n"

We should be making driving harder in the city, not easier.\nThe short term frustrations don\u2019t out-weigh the long term environmental benefits of making people think twice about jumping in the car vs taking transit or biking.\nRemoving bike lines would also discourage people from biking, as dedicated bike lanes are what makes biking in this city safe.\nMoving forward with this decision seems lose lose.

        "comment": "Kudos to the province for finally recognizing the massive traffic congestion on Toronto's main arterial roadways. It is clearly evident to see how the bike lanes continue to motorist frustration with the reduced lane travel. What once were normal straight roads, are now a pathetic mix of confusing bike lanes, concrete barriers, while others have plastic posts, and even Cafe's, with little to no patrons!\nWe have excessive signage, no right turns on red lights, despite the fact motorists have been doing just that for decades. We have bike lanes with extremely low bike travel. Yet hundreds thousands of vehicles continue to be restricted in their travel because of these lanes. It's not rocket science to see exactly what is happening on Toronto's main roads. Due to a very vocal Bicycle Lobby, Toronto City Council has been conned into initiating the Vision Zero program which to date exceeds $300M of taxpayers' money. 21 Councillors should not be allowed to make such decisions that create such controversy. A public Referendum should have been called. The fact remains, there are a lot more vehicles using our roads vs bicycles, that represent an extremely low percentage of the travelling public. The City should also ban main street parking during the morning and evening rush hours to increase traffic flow.\nIt's time to eliminate the frustration, increased travel times for vehicles, and loss of productivity, because of the bike lanes.\n"

They were not well planned or thought out, and their usage does not justify their existence. There are many other alternatives to have them on less travelled  routes and allow less congestion on the main thoroughfares. I have seen many times that emergency services cannot get to their destinations as a result of the traffic and congestion caused by the restrictions of traffic caused by the insertion of the bicycle lanes. Well intentioned as they may be - they are going to result in someone death.\n"

        "comment": "I know many others have written in explaining all the research and large scale reasons that make bike lanes an important part of our cities, so I just want to briefly offer my own personal perspective on why this bill would be so damaging and a step back for Ontario.\nFor several years now I have biked from my home in the west end of Toronto to my workplace at the University of Toronto by going along college street. When I first moved to Toronto and began biking this route, the only bike lane was a simple paved line. And every single day I biked the route I would nearly get run over, or encounter a car parked in the bike lane, or have someone make a sudden turn in front of me cutting me off. It felt dangerous, day after day. But after the city installed the new grade-separated lanes these incidents have almost entirely disappeared. Not once has a car been parked in the lane, and it's far more rare that drivers make dangerous turns in front of me. Bike lanes protect people, they save lives.\nWhy should the safety and security of my commute be worth less than that of a driver? Why is the government of Ontario not encouraging and helping people take healthier and more environmentally friendly forms of transportation? Why is it instead punishing people who cycle?\nThere is no good reason this bill should be passed. It will cause harm with no benefit.\n"

When the political process is being fundamentally undermined in this kind of coordinated way, it does require efforts like Bill 212 to bring back transparency and accountability to a fair, reasonable, and representative democratic process!\n"

As both a cyclist and a car owner, I value both, but especially I value the establishment of a safe and respected bike lane network throughout the city. Respect for cyclists needs to be fostered, not resentment, and this kind of bill alienates an enormous segment of the population and makes cycling more dangerous than it already is. Cycling n Ed\u2019s to be viewed as an important and advantageous way to navigate and move around the city: it is non polluting, promotes active lifestyles, promotes community, among other benefits.\nThere is no data or study that has shown Hwy 413 will benefit the province; in fact, it is the contrary.\nThe Ford government is lacking a forward thinking, good of the people, community centred approach.\nStay in your own lane and let cities makes these decisions for themselves.\nLook at other cities here in Canada (Montreal!!!) and around the world for examples of how this should be done.\nThe Ford govt needs a new blueprint for how they see the path forward.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed law would be an incredible waste of everyone's time and money and reeks of nonsensical personal vendetta. Bike lanes make roads safer and do not increase congestion - this has been proven over and over anytime someone goes to study these issues. Removing bike lanes will likely lead to increased traffic as fewer people will be biking which will mean more cars on the road. It also makes no sense for taxpayers to have to pay to make our infrastructure objectively worse, as well as for all the oversight costs that will inevitably result from whatever approval process needs to be put in place for building future bike lanes.\nBike lanes are popular. They reduce car traffic on roads. They make our streets safer. They are the way of the future whether the current administration likes it or not.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for all your efforts in making Ontario a better place to live. I recognize that everyday you come to work, striving to make this province a better place to live and work.\nMy political views are not partisan. I voted Conservative, but I am more loyal to competence and efficiency than I am to any political party.\nI do not consider myself \"a cyclist\". I don't really consider myself a driver either, although I both drive and cycle to get around. Like my politics, I've never found myself loyal to a particular transportation mode of getting around, and just use whatever is most efficient. I am also a business owner, which is perhaps why I'm someone who is more concerned about efficiency than I am about party politics.\nI use the bike lanes to get to/from work and often times to get to other places downtown. Why? Simply because it's more convenient and efficient. I can grab a Bikeshare bike almost anywhere downtown, and ride safely to wherever I'm going, usually faster than any other mode of transportation. I also get some exercise while I'm doing it, and I'm also one less driver on the road when I choose to bike.\nThe idea that one more lane of traffic on Bloor, University, or Richmond is going solve traffic issues in Toronto is ludicrous. Traffic in the GTA has been chaotic and gridlocked for 50 years, despite the construction of numerous bike lanes in that time. One more lane dedicated to cars (or even worse, parked cars that are just stationary and wasting space and causing last minute merges) is not going to solve Toronto's traffic problems.\nUndoubtedly, there are people who will send you comments that explain the merits of bike lanes much better than I will. But I'm guessing it doesn't really matter, because this issue is more about values than it is about facts (which is fine I suppose, that's almost always how it is). Arguments related to overreach into municipal politics probably doesn't matter either (even though small government and local government are supposed to be tenets of the Conservative Party platform, and tenets I believe in). And neither does the fact that removing bike lanes that are already built will make short-term traffic even worse and cost taxpayer money.\nGiven that I believe this debate is more value-based than it is fact-based, I'm not going to try and make the case that bike lanes should remain because they're more efficient. Instead, I would like to ask you to consider the following questions, if for no other reason than to help you strategically consider the outcomes of your decision:\n- What happens when the cost of removing bike lanes (and building alternative new ones) balloons more than you expect? Other infrastructure projects around the province already suggest that cost and time overruns are guaranteed in almost all projects that the province engages in. (This is not a criticism; it simply is inevitable that these projects are very complex and have many considerations that are unforeseeable until after the project has begun)\n- What happens when the next cyclist dies? I'm not trying to guilt you. It is simply a statistic reality that another cyclist will die on Toronto roads. 6 have already been killed this year in Toronto alone. It will likely be someone like me, someone who is just trying to get from point A to point B as efficiently as possible, and was clipped by a driver who was trying to beat traffic. If these deaths happen on one of the existing arterial bike lanes that you plan on removing, it will be all the more tragic. Are you prepared to handle this both personally and professionally?\n- What happens when traffic patterns don't meaningfully change, and when more groups (whom you currently use as examples of those disenfranchised by current bike lanes) such as BIAs actually come out against your decision? It's not a good look when you say businesses are being negatively impacted by bike lanes, and then the Bloor Street BIA comes out and says business has been better with bike lanes (see supporting link).\n- Do you think that by removing bike lanes, people on a bike will stop biking on those roads? Some will, but many won't, because it's simply too inefficient and inconvenient to divert to some side road that doesn't exist. What will happen instead is these cyclists are more likely to take the entire lane (for safety reasons, as biking close to the curb makes cyclists vulnerable to passing cars), making it even more of a traffic issue than it is currently.\nI am not speaking as someone who is loyal to your political opponents. You have probably seen that there have been a number of cyclist protests in recent weeks. You may write them off because they are a small number of people in the grand scheme of things. But please remember - I am not one of those demonstrators. I assure you there are many like me, who silently just use bikes to get from point A to B as efficiently as possible, and who otherwise may have voted for the Conservative Party in an upcoming election, but will no longer do so if this bill moves forward.\nI appreciate your consideration. Thank you again for all your hard work.\nRespectfully yours,\nA concerned Torontonian\n"

That's the thing, removing these bike lanes costs the lives of people and the future of Toronto and Canada. It is a hate crime against the poor and young. People who use these streets, especially students and young workers who are unable to afford cars are going to suffer. People will still have to take these streets to get to school and work. Without bike lanes they will just be placed in more danger.\nIt's also been established that widening highways and building more roads does not reduce congestion. People are going to die, and congestion isn't even going to improve. Please take this proposal back to the drawing table and use some more updated information and proper research.

Knowing he\u2019s in a bike lane that keeps him safe, allows me to give him the independence he deserves.\nI cycle to work. I could drive. But cycling is better for my physical fitness, my mental health. It\u2019s better for the environment. Less pollution. Less parking space. Less congestion on the roads. My cycling is better for me and better for everyone. My life should not be at risk for making positive choices.\nBike lanes don\u2019t slow traffic so significantly to merit tearing them up. The construction will definitely slow traffic though. Parking on main streets slows traffic. Why don\u2019t you ticket and tow people who are illegally parked. Start on Bathurst for example. One person parked to selfishly pick up food at Dupont or St Clair can result in me sitting in my car and watching the traffic lights change up to five times without making it through the intersection.

The City of Ottawa is closing traffic lanes on central arteries connecting the West End to downtown,even when bike lanes can be safely installed without lane closures. My understanding is that city Councilors are not so much pro-bike, as they are anti-car, and the bike lanes are a convenient excuse to increase gridlock and force people onto public transit, which is losing money currently. Existing bike lanes in Ottawa are practically empty, and are unusable for the majority of the year due to Ottawa's climate. We did not vote for this, and are respectfully asking the Province to intervene in preserving our cities livable without gridlock. I am convenient that bike lanes can be implemented without traffic lane closures. Thank you for your consideration.\n"
