        "comment": "As a citizen of downtown Toronto with both a car and a bike, I\u2019m concerned this bill will do the opposite of what it\u2019s titled. When only travelling downtown, I usually bike because it saves time and prevents me from putting another car on the road contributing to gridlock. We know that cycling is a more efficient way to transport a greater number of people vs cars. The bike lanes on main streets like University, Bloor, and many side streets are critical for our safety. Please don\u2019t remove them and add more red tape to getting new ones put in. I\u2019d rather not have to bring my car onto the road to contribute to more traffic, not to mention fearing hitting a cyclist because we don\u2019t have the proper infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This is atrocious policymaking. At MINIMUM, leave the lanes that have been built, and even that would be a regressive policy. For goodness' sake, look at what pretty much *every* city government around the world is doing.\nWhat an absolutely horrible decision your government is making. Firstly, Ontario municipalities should be able to make decisions about their own cities without the ham-handed provincial government butting in, but I guess it's too much for a premier who still sulks that the city wouldn't elect him mayor.\nSecondly, *EVERY SINGLE STUDY* that has been done around bike lines show that they make the urban landscape better and safer, and improve custom at businesses. People who no longer feel safe bicycling will have to start driving, which will just end up clogging the roads further and reducing the air quality of people who actually live in the city. These side-roads that you imagine cyclists could take across the city don't exist, and would materially impact their commutes in a far greater way than that of (usually the single occupant) in the comfort an enclosed SUV.\nCatering to suburbanites whose tax dollars do not support the municipality is a craven attempt at vote buying, much like the $200 cash payments your government is making in lieu of properly funding hospitals or developing a rational housing policy (which the amount of money you're distributing like candy would be *more* than enough to do).\nPlease focus on the issues under your purview, and quit relying on anecdotal evidence or the fact that you personally don't like to be \"inconvenienced\" to drive policy for the city that refused to elect the premier mayor. You folks are pathetic. I honestly don't know how you sleep at night knowing that you're making craven decisions solely based on holding on to power instead of what is best long-term for the city and its residents. I've never been so angry at a government in Canada in my 57 year old life. And for the record, I'm a business owner, highest marginal rate taxpayer who lives downtown, uses BikeTO and transit, and wants our city to start planning for a future with *less* cars, not uproot the minor but significant strides that have been made in the last two decades I've been living here. Stay in your lane, and out of our bike ones.\n"

        "comment": "Comments on Bill 212\nIt is a well-documented phenomenon that adding lanes to roadways often leads to increased traffic congestion rather than alleviating it. Effective measures to reduce gridlock typically involve strategies that encourage alternatives to car usage. Has the Province conducted comprehensive research on this matter? The absence of such research raises significant concerns.\nThe implementation of bike lanes serves as a catalyst for reducing reliance on automobiles, simultaneously slowing traffic to enhance pedestrian safety. Data from Toronto EMS demonstrates that response times on Yonge, Bloor, and University streets have remained consistent following the installation of bike lanes.\nResearch indicates that bike lanes can decrease accident rates, stimulate economic activity for adjacent businesses, mitigate congestion, and contribute to the overall health and well-being of residents.\nThe notion that the primary objective should be to facilitate faster travel for drivers is a relic of mid-20th century thinking, a perspective that many progressive jurisdictions worldwide have moved beyond. Notably, leading global cities do not prioritize the concept of enabling cars to travel faster in urban settings. It is imperative for Ontario to recognize that the future of transportation does not revolve around an increasing number of vehicles traversing urban areas at higher speeds across more lanes. Rather, the focus should be on integrating diverse modes of transportation, including walking, cycling, and public transit, as demonstrated by cities such as London, Paris, and Copenhagen.\nThe removal of bike lanes on University, Bloor, and Yonge streets is likely to exacerbate risks for pedestrians and cyclists, as it would encourage faster vehicular traffic on these urban thoroughfares, effectively transforming them into multi-lane highways. This shift would create an environment where pedestrians feel increasingly unsafe.\nI urge decision-makers to thoroughly investigate the potential implications of the proposed legislation by reviewing existing literature and engaging with elected officials from other jurisdictions. It is crucial to envision an Ontario that prioritizes the well-being of its residents, rather than adhering to outdated ideologies that have been widely discredited. The focus should be on fostering a transportation framework that accommodates all Ontarians, rather than catering to a narrow viewpoint rooted in a bygone era.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of the City of Toronto, I am opposed to this proposed legislation. Specifically, I oppose:\n- The proposal to remove the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue\n- The proposal to only allow bike lanes if traffic lanes are not removed\nFor one, the University Avenue bike lane, which is already seeing heavier use, was just installed at some expense. It would be a waste of tax dollars to immediately rip it out.\nAs someone who lives along the stretch of Yonge Street which has bikes lanes that would be ripped out under this proposal, I do not want a return to the previous road conditions. And I am someone who is a pedestrian, a driver, a cyclist, and a transit user. There was already a cyclist death last year at Yonge and St Clair. We don't need more deaths on our hands. As a pedestrian, I enjoy walking along this stretch of Yonge now that there aren't four lanes of traffic making it a speedway. I live on Avenue Road and I actively avoid walking along there because of the many lanes of traffic and the lack of cyclist buffer between me and the cars.\nThis is an incredibly shortsighted proposal aimed to buy suburban votes for the early spring election we all know the government plans to call. You can be assured, you have lost any of chance of getting my vote.\n"

Wasting my provincial income tax to rip up what my municipal property taxes paid for. This bill is nothing more than vendetta punishment for people who don't agree with this premier's \" Beers, Betting, Speeding\" agenda. All this legislation will do is force cyclists into traffic unprotected. It will result in injury, and death. It will not alleviate congestion in the slightest. This bill cites zero sources, zero statistics to even back this ludicrous claim. How then can this government plow ahead anyway? Unlike this bill, bike lanes in Toronto, and the rest of the province actually go through years of consultation and trial processes. Can the government say the same for any of its disaster bills that it continues to roll out? I ask the ministers and premier authoring this bill, if THEY would feel safe sending their children to ride down Bloor and University without lane protection. If they would answer no, then they have no right to remove this critical infrastructure, as a means of petty spite and manufactured outrage.\n"

Overruling Torontonians and their representatives on city council in order to remove bike lanes that are keeping cyclists safe shows arrogance and contempt for residents of Toronto. The fact that this legislation was introduced under the guise of being relevant to all of Ontario, but the lanes slated for removal are solely in Toronto, additionally shows how little Doug Ford and his government care about the majority of Ontarians, for which this will have zero impact.\nStay in your lane, Doug Ford. And quit abusing the constitution to make up for losing the Toronto mayoral race a decade ago.\n"

This proposal is shear stupidity for a number of reasons, the least of which is that it is completely devoid of any facts, logic, common sense, or engineering principles. Bike lanes are not the cause of traffic, cars are the cause of traffic. A densifying city like Toronto is learning that the car can no longer be the dominant mode of transportation - this is basic engineering principles. The fact that we do not have enough subways, that our streetcars and buses are left to duke it out with said car traffic rather than be given priority in both right of ways and traffic signals, and that there are not more bike lanes are the cause of traffic. These are facts. I grew up in Etobicoke where our Premier is from and know that a lot of folks consider cars to be the only viable means of transportation. It is this dangerous thinking that is keeping Toronto from emerging into the world class city it could be. Put aside how utterly idiotic this man's idea is, this also highlights as to how a man with no working knowledge of transportation principles has the authority to overrule engineers and planners whose job it is to keep the city moving. Between the Bradford Bypass, the 413, the tunnel below the 401, this Premier has reached a new low in figuring out ways to set Toronto back decades in progressive planning while simultaneously pissing away billions of dollars.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible bill that will slow down traffic due to forcing cyclists into the street.\nAs a Toronto driver I appreciate the bike lane as a place for the cyclists to go in order to keep traffic moving. Without it traffic will only move slower. On street parking and pulled over vehicles already reduce four lane roads into effective one lane roads so addi g extra lanes is marginal at best. Add to that having cyclists on the road and things will be worse.\nPlease evaluate the cycle lanes carefully as the ones Ford has proposed to remove would be the worst ones to remove.\n"

        "comment": "For several reasons, I am absolutely NOT in favour of your plan to restrict bike lanes. I will voice some of the concerns that the other commenters probably don't mention as much.\nABOUT SIDE STREETS: your government keeps talking about putting bike lanes on side streets. However, your proposed additions to the HTA mention nothing about giving any exception for streets with low traffic volume or streets that are designated as local or minor. This act, contrary to what Premier Ford has stated, would still prohibit bike lanes on side streets, and that's a problem because those streets only get congested because of unnecessary traffic signals and stop signs causing backups and limiting flow.\nEven of more bike lanes are constructed on side streets, it would make the route highly circuitous, discontinuous and difficult to follow because there just aren't many side streets that don't curve and end abruptly. This would become a fatal flaw of the bike network.\nYour claim that only a few cyclists use the bike lanes is frankly ludicrous. As a university student who resides in the City of Ottawa, I have observed that a bike network that are separated and well-connected will attract many, many cyclists. The bike lanes along Mackenzie Ave and the surrounding area are a great example of this. Of course, you won't notice most them when you're in car, but you will when you just go outside and take a look at what's really out there. Montreal, which has a much more extensive bike network, is an even better example, look at this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F_B0HtewDU).\nYou can't judge the need to build a bridge by counting the number of people who try to swim across a river. People will claim that only five or so people cycle on a given road per year (which is already a false and infantile claim to make), but surveys taken by cities show that the major reason for that is NOT LACK OF INTEREST, NOT WINTER, but instead PERSONAL SAFETY. In addition, cycling routes are only as good as their weakest point, which is why we need CONNECTED bike infrastructure. Effective bicycle routes should have less breaks and interruptions and should definitely not be difficult to get to in the first place. Your legislation will make that approach very difficult, sometimes impossible. As a university student, I found that the network was quite disconnected and hard to navigate because of the all the gaps in between, and I am concerned that your legislation will prevent the city from being able to fix those.\nCongestion you say? That's not because there are two vehicle lanes instead of three. If you add another lane to a road that currently has two lanes of stopped traffic, you get three lanes of stopped traffic. The problem is that you are unwilling to look outside the box and find alternatives to placing excessive amounts of traffic signals and stop signs on arterials and collector roads, which have been considered the traditional approach to fixing traffic. It is not because of the bike lanes.\n"

Getting around and being able to get our kids to their activities has been severely compromised by the bike lanes on Bloor.  This is the view of a vast majority of residents in this area that I speak to, and getting rid of these bike lanes will improve the quality of life.

Doug Ford and the provincial government should be far more concerned about building housing (don\u2019t think that we didn\u2019t see that the provincial government missed its target of 1.5M homes built), fixing the healthcare system instead of crippling it, and on actually improving infrastructure for rural and northern communities. Instead of antagonizing a city that desperately needs actual evidence based ways to improve congestion \u2014 which time and time again research has shown is improving bicycle infrastructure and more robust public transit options.\nBike lanes are not only better for traffic by providing people with alternate modes of transportation, they also take cyclists out of dangerous situations. This will just put more people in harms way. We cannot have a thriving, vibrant city if we do not move away from being so car centric.\nFinally, the most confounding part of this legislation is that the conservative government is proposing using additional taxpayer dollars to remove infrastructure that we have already paid for to put in. University Ave\u2019s bike lanes were literally just completed and now we are talking about taking them out? That is such a massive waste of taxpayer money and it is setting us back as a city. As a taxpayer living in Toronto, I am incredibly upset by this. We cannot have local infrastructure and city planning policies interfered by MPs who don\u2019t even live within the city.\n"
