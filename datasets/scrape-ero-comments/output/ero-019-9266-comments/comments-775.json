Drivers in Toronto don\u2019t respect cyclists and this will result in more accidents and deaths.\nSaving lives should be the goal not getting somewhere 5 minutes faster.\nIt took a long time to develop bike routes that I have seen in many cities around the world. If Toronto and Ontario truly want to be world class this is definitely a step in the wrong direction.\nThank you for your consideration in keeping what we have built and using the funds to revive the bike lanes on priorities like the homeless and health care.\n"

        "comment": "I support bike lanes in the city of Toronto and believe they are critical to the infrastructure and safety of the city's citizens. Me and my family bike throughout the city and although the bike lanes are not perfect, they are much safer than riding without them, especially when they are protected bike lanes. Bike lanes do not contribute to the congestion throughout the city - that is an issue of public transit and longstanding delays and lack of improvements. Cities around the world have implemented bike lanes for the safety and health of its citizens and the environment. Sustainability and long-term use should be major considerations. Reducing carbon emissions and providing a sustainable future for Toronto is extremely important and bike lanes are a huge factor in that. Please reconsider Bill 212 and its impacts. There MUST be safe and climate-friendly ways to get around Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bikes lane will not stop traffic buildup. I encourage the city to look to other means of road decongestion. Bikes lanes provide a safe means of transit for cyclists, and the removal of them will only discourage people from wanting to cycle and therefore cause more people to use vehicles, causing an increase in traffic. It will also increase cyclist death rates and accidents and just general safety concerns. This is not a viable solution!\n"

        "comment": "We will not solve the congestion problem by building another highway. The strategy that \" Just one more lane\", or \"one more highway\" will resolve the problem has never worked.  Fast-tracking it by bypassing environmental studies is an additional offence.  Already more than a quarter of our GHG emissions come from road traffic, and this is increasing. We need to reverse this to meet Canada's climate change commitments.\nIn  Toronto where I live, encouraging greater use of cars directly contradicts the city's Net Zero strategy, as well as its Vision Zero strategy for road safety.As a long time cyclist, and now  a senior with asthma (due to pollution) and arthritis, I have invested in a pedal assist e-bike so I can easily continue to ride.  The  Danforth-Bloor cycle lanes are my highway through the city  and I wholeheartedly welcome the city's plan to increase them. If you remove them, I will not be able to ride because the encounters I had with cars, doors and streetcar tracks which left me bruised when I was young and stronger might have much more serious consequences now. The separate bike lanes also make it safer for my young nephew, and other parents accompanying their children riding to school, daycare and other activities. Taking away these safe lanes will just force me and many others back into our cars, thus adding to congestion.\nIf you want to reduce congestion, here are some solutions:  Expand bike lane network; eliminate parking on arterial roads, speed up building the Eglinton cross town and other city and commuter networks; make public transit more efficient, convenient and affordable to encourage people not to drive in the city.  At the very least, leave the cities planners alone to do their job - stay in your lane.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Strath Ave. While I enjoy cycling, the bike lane infrastructure recently imposed across Bloor St and other major  roads is unacceptable to me as a taxpayer.\n1) There was no community consultation and no/improper analysis. The city council catered to specific interest groups and wittingly kept potential opposition in the dark. Meetings that were set up a year ago were set at rush hour in the far reaches of our area in a blatant effort to exclude opposing voices. Bike lobby groups were kept well informed.\n2) The presentation by city staff at Etobicoke Collegiate in the spring was laughable. It was apparent that the traffic \u201cstudies\u201d were insufficient and meaningless, yet were interpreted in a way to support the foregone conclusions. Staff was unprepared to answer intelligent questions.\n3) The bike lanes (at least west of High Park), are rarely used. There is little/no need for them.\n4) The environmental impact of the traffic stopping & starting, and idling more than offsets any gains.\n5) It is dangerous to be a pedestrian, driver, or cyclist. With all the congestion it\u2019s impossible to see properly around all the traffic and obstacles that have been installed.\n6) There is no consistency throughout the city (and therefore it\u2019s evident there is no real plan), in how these have been installed. All the white plastic markers and boulards are unsightly and as a visiting friend said have \u201cruined the charm of the neighborhood\u201d.\n7) I don\u2019t care who city council gets to say that emergency vehicle response is unaffected, it is blatantly not true. I have been trapped in front of a fire truck on Bloor for several minutes with nowhere to go. The statement made at the last \u201ccommunity\u201d meeting called by Amber Morley that response times have improved is misleading. In what specific area? Have more trucks or staff been added? Etc, etc\u2026.questions that couldn\u2019t be answered.\n8) Why host a community meeting, invite cycling lobby groups from outside the area, seat them up front and only answer their questions? No obligation to make sure you\u2019re hearing from people actually living in the community?\n9) Contractors and homeowners are having difficulty finding trades to come to the area due to traffic congestion. If they do find them, they are charging a premium!\n10) It is almost impossible for a person who parks on Bloor St to safely exit their vehicle and cross the obstacles and bike lane to get to the sidewalk. What about someone with limited mobility? What about if we have snow this winter?\n11) Goodbye Cafe Toronto. Something that was a big step forward and good for neighbourhood businesses and community spirit, gets reduced by about 75% or more so 5 cyclists/day can ride by?\n12) It\u2019s time to have a real transportation plan, using real experts and with community consultation before wasting more of our taxpayer money. How about a real subway system like other world class cities? Stop Toronto City Council\u2019s war on cars when they haven\u2019t done their due diligence or come up with an informed infrastructure plan.\n*PS I would have set up an account but it wasn\u2019t clear to me whether or not my name/email address would be seen by just the department reviewing this matter, or the general public.\n"

        "comment": "I am very concerned that Bill 212 goes against the dozen year's progress since the 2012 Coroner's Report that recommended bike lanes and safe infrastructure to prevent cyclist deaths and serious injury. Vision Zero is realistic and achievable. While our population continues to grow across the province, we must shift transportation to active sustainable modes to prevent congestion, reduce pollution and improve health (our diabetes epidemic). Bike lanes for cycling and other forms of micromobility are the only safe method for doing this. When physicians (120 from U of T) who signed a letter, are against the removal of bike lanes, we need to listen to the evidence. When the Association of Municipalities of Ontario call this policy \"significant overreach\", we should listen. When the Ontario Professional Planners Institute are against this policy, they know how to design cities and towns and we should listen. They know how adding lanes for cars just creates more demand. (Look at 410 that is jam-packed with cars day and night.) When we have people struggling to budget their expenses and choose active transportation, we have a duty to think about equity and listen to them. Savvy entrepreneurs know cyclists and pedestrians stop and shop, not the car drivers who are passing through. BIAs have the statistics to prove this. This is a waste of taxpayers' money to rip up what has already been studied and built, and to micromanage the good work of the municipalities. Put money into transit and health instead!\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing as a deeply concerned citizen to oppose Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. This bill threatens the heart of our communities, the environment, and the safety of Ontarians. By exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, this legislation allows irreversible harm to sensitive Greenbelt lands, which are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. Environmental Defence has shown that this highway will destroy over 400 acres of critical natural habitat.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion\u2014it will make it worse. Experts around the world have proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need smart, forward-thinking solutions like better public transit and bike lanes. Every bike on the road is one less car, which means less pollution, less noise, and safer streets for everyone.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a huge step backward. These lanes don\u2019t just help cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Plus, local businesses benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Why would we take away something that helps people get around safely and supports our economy?\nPlease reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that brings people together, not policies that divide us and harm our future. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-centered transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned the outcome of the proposed legislation will result in a reduction of safety and urban access for cyclists.  Further, provincial intervention into the sphere of delegated municipal powers and decisions should require a high bar of necessity which has not established in this environment by data or authoritative study.\nI am a car driver, pedestrian, and a cyclist.  A city functions well when citizens can move safely and efficiently using the mode of movement of their choosing.  The experience of other major urban centres, such as New York, is that in establishing secure venues of travel for pedestrians and cyclist not only reduces injuries and fatalities but reduced vehicular travel times.  However, the premise of this legislation is that the removal of specific dedicated cycling lanes will improve vehicular speed within urban areas.  The benefit - if established - is negligible; the increased risk to non-vehicular users of dedicated cycling lanes is concerning.   Dedicated cycling lanes are established to enhance the safety of growing proportion of a city's residents.  Canadians using bicycles for daily commuting nearly doubled between 1996 and 2016.  However, cycling commuting is not without risk: between 2016 and 2021 researchers found that 30,101 emergency care visits were initiated by cyclists whilst Toronto Police documented 2,362 injuries to cyclists during that period.\nOntario residents participate in municipal elections and select municipal councils.  Councils consider municipal issues and needs as directed by the electorate.  Provisioning of urban infrastructure is the responsibility of municipal and regional councils.  Provincial intervention must meet a high threshold of necessity; an error in law / regulation, an egregious action affecting a wider sphere of citizens, or fiscal irregularities. None of these factors hold in the case of the proposed legislation.\nBill 212 proposes and unnecessary and unwarranted solution to perceived problem.  The bill should be withdrawn.\n"

The congestion has made commuting time much longer. One cannot open the door on the car without being in the driving lane.\n3. The parking is very restrictive and having a handicapped husband it makes it nearly impossible to take him to stores/restaurants.This causes loss of business for the small stores sestroys the neighbourhoods we so enjoy.\n4. There is little use of the bikelanes and the bikers often break the rules of the road.\n5. The consultation was done without enough input of the neighbourhood.\n6. I strongly believe the city counil is not representing myself as a taxpayer.\n7. Toronto has a lot of snow in the winter and the bikelanes is an epediment for safe driving.\n8. Furthermore City council has spent millions of dollars bike lanes which are not suitable for the distances in Toronto. As a senior I cannot bike to downtown.( I grew up in Copenhangen where bikes are a mode of transportation).\n9. Further High Park is now off limits for us on the week-ends. This is discrimination.

        "comment": "Compelling Arguments Against Bike Lanes on Bloor Street Between Kipling and Jane\n1. Dramatic Increase in Commute Times\n\u2022\tSince the installation of bike lanes, commute times for drivers have doubled. This significant increase negatively affects daily productivity, family time, and overall quality of life for residents and commuters.\n\u2022\tThe reduced number of lanes for vehicular traffic has created severe bottlenecks, especially during peak hours, when thousands rely on Bloor Street for efficient travel.\n2. Underutilization of Bike Lanes\n\u2022\tObservational data shows that the bike lanes on Bloor Street are often empty or underutilized. It is common to see zero cyclists using these lanes on most days, suggesting that the infrastructure does not serve the majority of road users effectively.\n\u2022\tCyclists often prefer alternate routes, such as the Lakeshore bike trail, which offers safer conditions and scenic benefits, making the Bloor lanes redundant.\n3. Increased Pollution and Environmental Harm\n\u2022\tTraffic congestion caused by reduced road capacity has led to idling vehicles, which significantly increases air pollution in the area. This contradicts the environmental goals that bike lanes are meant to support.\n\u2022\tSide streets, now serving as detours for impatient drivers, have also seen increased traffic and emissions, spreading pollution into residential neighborhoods.\n4. Safety Hazards in Neighborhood Streets\n\u2022\tThe diversion of traffic to smaller side streets has made these areas more dangerous for children and pedestrians. Drivers navigating these routes to avoid gridlock on Bloor often speed or drive recklessly, posing risks to the community.\n5. Inefficiency During Public Transit Disruptions\n\u2022\tWhen the subway is down, Bloor Street becomes a critical alternative for shuttle buses. The reduction to a single lane has proven insufficient to manage both public and private transportation needs, leading to gridlock and forcing many commuters to walk long distances.\n\u2022\tDuring such disruptions, the inability to clear traffic efficiently undermines the city's capacity to provide reliable transit alternatives.\n6. Toronto's Weather Reality\n\u2022\tToronto experiences snow, rain, and cold weather for nearly half the year, making cycling an impractical mode of transportation during these months. The bike lanes remain largely unused, while drivers and public transit users continue to suffer from reduced road capacity.\n7. Lack of Justification for Dedicated Bike Lanes\n\u2022\tFor the sake of a few cyclists using the bike lanes sporadically, the city has compromised the efficiency of a vital transportation artery. This is not a balanced or equitable use of public resources.\n\u2022\tAlternate bike-friendly routes, like the Lakeshore trail, provide a safer and more scenic option for cyclists, reducing the need for bike lanes on Bloor Street.\n8. Traffic Blockages from Turning Vehicles\n\u2022\tWith only one lane in each direction, vehicles turning left create significant backups, bringing all traffic to a halt. This ripple effect compounds congestion and adds to commuter frustration.\n________________________________________\nConclusion and Proposed Alternatives\nWhile the intent of bike lanes is to promote sustainable transportation, their placement on Bloor Street between Kipling and Jane has had the opposite effect\u2014creating gridlock, increasing pollution, and reducing road safety in surrounding neighborhoods.\nA more effective solution would involve:\n1.\tRedirecting bike lanes to alternate routes, such as quieter streets or scenic trails like those along the Lakeshore, which are safer and more appealing to cyclists.\n2.\tEnhancing public transit options to reduce reliance on cars and avoid overburdening major streets during disruptions.\n3.\tUsing dynamic infrastructure planning to ensure that major arteries like Bloor Street remain accessible and efficient for the majority of users.\nRemoving the bike lanes from Bloor Street would restore balance, reduce gridlock, and improve the overall flow of traffic in the area. This approach respects the needs of all road users while encouraging more practical and impactful sustainability measures.\n"

        "comment": "this is what i wrote, feel free to copy and modify:\nTraffic in Toronto is an urban planning issue that has nothing to do with the bike lanes. Removing bike lanes does not remove the cyclists. Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the bill to reduce the number of bike lanes on major city streets. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that removing bike lanes will have a significant impact on traffic congestion or improve the flow of traffic. In fact, many studies show that well-designed bike lanes actually reduce congestion by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transportation, which decreases the number of cars on the road.\nReducing bike lanes undermines efforts to make our cities more sustainable, safer for cyclists, and more pedestrian-friendly. It also sends the wrong message about prioritizing car-centric solutions over more balanced transportation options that benefit the entire community. Instead of eliminating bike lanes, we should be expanding them to support a healthier, less congested, and more livable urban environment.\nI strongly recommend the Province explore alternate methods of reducing congestion in highly populated urban centers. Some alternatives to this bill that have proven successful in reducing congestion include expanding/improving public transportation, promoting/expanding cycling infrastructure, improved traffic management technology, better parking management, and pedestrianizing areas. These initiatives are mainly managed at the municipal level, however, the Province should consider supporting municipalities in pursuing these efforts if meaningful change is to be accomplished.\n"
