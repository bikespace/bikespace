        "comment": "Keep the bike lanes!\nUniversity, Bloor and Yonge St are busy streets with many pedestrians and shops, not really used as a main through way to get around the city. Visiting by bike or TTC is the best option to spend time in the city centre. If you can do something more impactful, get a handle on the construction projects that demand lane closures for an extensively long time, many months even years in some cases, disrupting traffic on main streets.\nFor cars, they have Davenport and Dupont, which moves better than Bloor, University isn't that congested, and still has 2+ lanes even with the bike lanes, Yonge has never been a driving street, you can't make turns anywhere off of it downtown. It's way better suited for walking and biking.\nFor those living down town, they don't need a car to get around - because of the bike lanes and transit systems, which still need improvement.\nRemoving the bike lanes is not a path forward to getting the city moving better. Its way better to have more options, that result in less cars on the road.\n"

The statistics have been compiled, the scientists are in consensus. Why is this anti-science policy being delivered to a city that has made clear it doesn't want the bike lanes removed?\nPlease leave our bike lanes alone.\nThere have been six bicycle deaths in the city this year. All of them have been the result of not enough bike lanes. Removing bike lanes threatens the safety of all cyclists, at a moment when it is more important than ever, to create real neighbourhoods, to protect the environment, to make our cities livable, to promote cycling.\n"

It is a Bill that is inequitable to the people of Ontario. If passed, it will only make the harm the people and put cyclists and nature in unsafe environments.\n"

        "comment": "The Bloor Street bike lane is an extremely important East-West travel corridor for cyclists. This corridor is used by hundreds if not thousands of cyclists every day regardless of the time of year. It speeds up our commutes and reduces burden on other systems such as public transit (therefore increasing city accessibility, even for people who can't drive). Removing it will increase congestion and directly cause cyclist deaths. Scientific research on the effect of bike lanes on gridlock and city livability are clear: bike lanes save everyone time and improve the city's livability. The fact that Doug wants to turn Toronto into yet another freeway is however beside the point.\nMore importantly, this act is a disgraceful piece of shameless populist legislation that prioritizes quick \"wins\" over actual policy or accomplishments. Doug Ford has shown a consistent lack of forward vision in his policies, and this legislation only demonstrates that. Doug saw an opportunity to pander to his base while trampling on the public interest. This is a cynical authoritarian move and Doug should be ashamed.\nThe bill should be called Reducing Accessibility, Saving Dougie's Polls.\n"

        "comment": "I want to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 and to urge the Ontario government to reconsider and withdraw this proposal. Decisions impacting our communities must be guided by science, evidence, and logic\u2014not by ideology or divisive rhetoric. Bill 212 exemplifies an unwise use of resources and misplaced priorities.\nOur province faces far more pressing issues that demand immediate attention. Healthcare systems are strained to the breaking point, infrastructure remains underfunded and outdated, and timelines for critical projects consistently fall behind. Yet, instead of addressing these urgent challenges, this proposal focuses on dismantling bike lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor Streets\u2014a decision that lacks both rationale and supporting evidence.\nThe premise of Bill 212\u2014that eliminating bike lanes will alleviate traffic congestion\u2014is flawed and shortsighted. Converting bike lanes back into car lanes will not result in smoother traffic flow. Current data shows that these bike lanes are heavily used, with up to 30% of commuters in these areas relying on bicycles for transportation. These individuals will not disappear or abandon their daily commutes.\nWithout bike lanes, cyclists will be forced to share car lanes, inevitably slowing traffic even further. This not only undermines the argument for removing bike lanes but also compromises safety for all road users. The claim that these bike lanes are underutilized is based on outdated and irrelevant studies, including data from 2011 that does not pertain to these specific areas. Relying on such flawed research erodes public trust and raises concerns about the rigor behind government decision-making.\nThe streets targeted by Bill 212\u2014Yonge, University, and Bloor\u2014do not suffer from the gridlock issues the government purports to address. Instead of dismantling infrastructure that serves a vital function, the government should focus on areas that genuinely need intervention. For example, roads like Queen Street, which are plagued by narrow lanes, street parking congestion, and poor planning, should be prioritized.\nSimilarly, our highways, where gridlock regularly disrupts productivity and quality of life, demand urgent investment and modernization. Addressing these real challenges would provide tangible benefits to Ontario residents. Instead, this bill seeks to \"solve\" a problem that does not exist, creating unnecessary disruptions and wasting public funds.\nThis proposal also raises troubling questions about the government\u2019s commitment to public safety and equality. By removing bike lanes, the government is effectively prioritizing the convenience of drivers over the safety of cyclists. This sends a disturbing message: that the lives of cyclists are less valuable than the minor inconvenience of traffic delays for drivers.\nCyclists are legitimate road users who contribute to our communities and our economy, and their safety must not be compromised. The implicit class system that this bill suggests\u2014where drivers are afforded greater rights and protections than cyclists\u2014is unacceptable. All citizens, regardless of their mode of transportation, deserve equal respect and consideration.\nBill 212 represents a misguided approach to urban planning and transportation policy. It does nothing to address real issues and instead creates new ones, all while diverting attention and resources from the critical challenges facing our province. I urge the government to withdraw this proposal and to focus instead on evidence-based solutions that prioritize safety, equity, and the long-term well-being of our communities.\n"

        "comment": "It is unconscionable to remove bike lanes that already exist and to prevent the construction of planned bike lanes. These provide safe ways for people to commute and travel around the city, and have proven benefits to the economy, the environment, and the physical well-being of Ontarians.\nIf this bill goes forward, it will mean putting cyclists of all ages at an increased risk for life-altering injuries and death. 6 cyclists have already died this year on the road, up from 1 in 2023. How many will die as a result of Bill 212? What's more, a portion of cyclists who are deterred from using their previously safe routes will turn to traveling by vehicles, further increasing the amount of vehicles on the roads, the city's congestion, and carbon emissions.\nInvest in better transit systems for a reduced number of cars on the road, rather than jeopardizing the lives of citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I used to use Toronto's bike lanes extensively as a cyclist, until knee problems curtailed my cycling.  Even though I now get around by public transit, I strongly support our existing bike lanes, and the expansion of bike lanes.  Cycling is good for the environment, good for people's health, and good for a vibrant street life.\nJust as new roads for cars or new transit lines can need tweaks once they're put into service and problems are seen, so too bike lanes can need tweaks.  I've heard there are real traffic problems at the new western end of the Bloor cycling lane.  The solution is to redesign the roadway and lane to address the problems, not to rip out cycling lanes across the city.  Other new cycling lanes, such as those on University, are working wonderfully well.\nToronto elected officials and Toronto planners are the people who know best what Toronto needs.  Please let them do what they do best, and design traffic solutions which address local needs, including new bike lanes.\n"

And with a rising cost of living making personal vehicles prohibitively expensive, cycling is becoming an increasingly inviting and affordable option.\nMaking bike lanes easier to install will get personal vehicles off the road reducing congestion, will minimize life threatening accidents, and will allow people with less disposable income to save money, or invest it into potentially the local economy.\nCycling promotes active lifestyles and the associated benefits can mean a reduced burden on an already taxed medical systems.\nAnd a safe and robust cycling infrastructure can be a draw for tourists.\n"

Harbord street to get to work and other bike lanes for shopping and leisure.\n As a middle aged woman I feel comfortable biking on a regular basis in the downtown area. My husband and teenage son also bike to work and to get around locally.\nIt is much safer and faster for everyone to have bike lanes. As a driver you don\u2019t need to worry about cyclists being too close to your vehicle. And as a cyclist you are less likely to get injured.\nI know that vehicle driving times are not significantly increased. And I would hate to waste money on taking out the amazing and long awaited bike lanes. (If you want to take out the ones in Etobicoke, go ahead)\nBike lanes keep cyclists off the main road lane and give vehicles their space to drive.\nOne more bike equals one less car on the road!\nThanks\nChristine\n"

It is also a regressive step in terms of enabling local communities safe and active travel.  Kids getting to school,  adults traveling to work via bike lanes are at risk with this proposal.\nI get that the Ford Government cares little for the environment or for the city of Toronto communities but imagine the precedent this sets for every town and city in Ontario. Let local business be determined by municipal level of government, not by the Premier of Ontario. The fact that Toronto's traffic is such a problem is because of poor & slow investment in public transport - the TTC  Ontario Line / LRT Eglington; the Gardiner East bound . All of these could be improved and sped up. Instead the Premier wants to create a bike v car driver antagonism, making it an unsafe environment for everyone.  Not every Toronto street should  be a highway!\nThat is poor leadership and a big mistake.\n"

        "comment": "I object to the Ontario government proposal to be the ones to make decisions about bike lanes instead of municipalities who make decisions based on local research, consultations with their citizens and urban planners.  As a dedicated cyclist, both for commuting and road riding for exercise and pleasure,  I use bike lanes at least 5 days a week.  They give me a great sense of safety and make me more visible to traffic. Having a full network of lanes both down main road arteries and across the city make using a bike for safe transportation possible.  I am disturbed by the tenor of recent comments from the Premier saying bicyclists should be delegated to \u201csecondary roads\u201d and are the cause of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is the result of urban planning practices that force communities to rely exclusively on private automobiles for transportation. Past experience all over the world shows that making more space for cars only attracts additional traffic (a phenomenon known as induced demand). Blaming bicyclists for congestion will not solve anything.\n"
