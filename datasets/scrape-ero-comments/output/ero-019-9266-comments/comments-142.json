Where's the science?  Where are the studies that say this is even effective?\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely disappointed with this proposed legislation. This government is backward thinking and is preparing Ontario for the problems of the 1990s instead of the 2030s. Greater investment in public transportation and less reliance on cars should be a priority in a city that is already plagued by gridlock. The meaningless removal of bike lanes is petty and lacks evidence to solve any of the problems it aims to fix.\nSecondly I am vehemently opposed to the reduction of laws and regulations concerning environmental protections. This government is hell-bent on paving over what farmland we have left and creating urban sprawl on par with Mexico City. The proposed highway will not improve commuting and the residents of the GTA would be better served by improved rail service and access.\nFinally, I am saddened that this comment will be ignored as it lacks the customary manilla envelope of cash that usually accompanies the policy advice this government receives.\n"

I am an Ontario resident residing in Kingston.\nI wish to comment on the proposed Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\u201d\nGiven the nature of rapid climate change and its effect on the food chain, extreme weather events, forest fires and population migration, I feel it is unwise to oppose any effort to increase the number of Canadians using non-vehicular forms of transportation.  Bike lanes keep cyclists, and increasingly users of electric scooters safe from vehicle traffic, reducing the number of cars on the road and the amount of CO2 gas emitted into our atmosphere.\nFuthermore, I believe traffic management and road planning is best handled by the municipality where much more scrutiny can be applied.  Cities and towns have a flow to them that isn't always apparent to outsiders, and their traffic planners are in the best place to decide when and where to install bike lanes.\nFor these reasons, I oppose Bill 212.\nSincerely,\nA Kingston, Ontario resident.\n"

        "comment": "Maintaining safe practices within the city while promoting safer means of travel, both biking and public transportation, are incredibly important to the well-being of Ontarians.\nToronto alone has a new LRT line waiting to come online to help reduce gridlock across the entire city, and with updates happening across the entirety of the city via construction, there's real potential to see significant ease for many drivers on the road. Shrinking the amount of drivers with capable access to both Bike Lanes and Public transport will also reduce gridlock and the problems that come with multiple car lanes.\nLastly, but most importantly, cars should not have better access and capacity over people. It's important for keeping families, children, commuters, and students safe in our cities. Any argument that fights against the increased presence of bike lanes is Anti-Ontario and Anti-safety.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is infuriating.  My city (Brampton) already has been slow to adopt new bicycle lanes, which are absolutely required when drivers aren't paying any attention to the cyclists.  On several occasions I've had cars and trucks pass far too close to me; since we started getting bicycle lanes, it's been much less of a concern.\nThat the province believes it \"knows better\" when it comes to *local* traffic flows is patronizing and insulting.  I don't believe the Ford government rhetoric and, as such, I have provided two links that counter said rhetoric, about how bicycle lanes \"cause traffic jams\" and \"impact local businesses negatively\".\nPlease, do NOT force cities to remove bicycle lanes.  My children have started using them; I don't want to go back to telling them I shall have to drive them because our government decided they should not have the freedom to travel when and where they *should* be able to, without requiring an automobile.\n"

Always going through stop signs and traffic lights. Yonge Street is a nightmare ! Our main artery through the city centre down to one lane !!!! I used to ride up until about a year and a half ago, people opened car doors on me and I got hassled by the people behind me trying to pass me. Realistically we can only use them from April to the 1st November ? They should be taken away in high traffic areas. Dangerous for the rides and cars. TAKE THEM DOWN ASAP\n"

        "comment": "Adding my voice in support of removing the Yonge Street bike lanes. For the main reasons already noted, namely increased traffic congestion most of the day, and underuse of the lanes by cyclists. Plus....winter. This has been the case since they were installed. There is simply not much demand for these lanes, as evidenced by REAL data that's not cherry-picked to suit a viewpoint.\nI'm a resident in the area most acutely affected (Summerhill/Rosedale) and while I support bike lanes in concept, where they make sense, this particular lane was a disaster from the outset, pushed through arrogantly by council favouring ideology over common sense. These lanes should never have been installed on this street, area residents have always been strongly opposed, and we were not listened to.\nI'm referring to the Yonge lanes only. Bloor and University lanes are a separate discussion and I can see merits of keeping them intact. But the Yonge lanes NEED TO GO.\n"

        "comment": "It is difficult to form a specific complaint about bill 212 because every aspect of it is a negative change for the province.\nHighway 413 should not be exempted from any environmental assessments or requirements.  No highway should be.  The Environmental Assessment Act exists for a reason; if it doesn't work, repeal it.  If it works, follow it.\nFurther, requiring more red tape and more levels of approval for new bike lanes is a regressive change.  Bike lanes have only ever made my commutes and travel easier, whether I'm driving or biking myself.  Keeping bikes out of car lanes, which makes traffic smoother and cyclists safer, means building more bike lanes.\n"

Ultimately if citizens are upset at a bike lane that council approved then they have the civic right to not vote for those individuals in upcoming elections.\nI see this legislation as anti-environmental (discouraging cities from planning bike lanes) as well as needless red tape that will cost taxpayers. How much will these reviews cost the government over time? Why couldn't that money be spent elsewhere instead of forcing cities to jump through newly created hoops.\n"

It makes no sense at all.\nIt is nonsensical to remove bike lanes in any city. The overreach proposed by this government is the opposite of what they claim to want from the government.\nIs the government so flush with money (withholding federal health care money during a pandemic provably helped) that they want to spend money for resurfacing?\nIt's such bad policy.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an attempt to mislead the public about the efficacy of bike lanes and to sneak in exceptions for environmental assessment for Highway 413.\nThe government's laws and policies should be evidence based. The evidence on bike lanes has shown that they are effective at reducing congestion and pollution. This bill threatens the existence of bike lanes that are widely successful in many municipalities. The only reason the government is pushing this through is so they can assign even more construction projects for the removal of these lanes to those connected to the ontario PC party.\nThe province needs to focus on promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation (transit, rail, bikes) to reduce congestion and work with (not against) municipalities to resolve the insane congestion and transport problems we have in Ontario. Bike lanes have a positive effect on congestion, but failure to properly fund or supervise projects like the eglinton LRT have led to delays and ultimately increased issues for commuters.\nThe conduct of the majority government has been shameful.\n"

        "comment": "People should be incentivized to utilize things other than Cars, and bicycles are one of the best alternatives outside of public transportation. They are better for the Environment, our physical health, as well as our wallets. But as long as there is no infrastructure to support them, there isnt any reason to changeover from vehicles because you can't safely use them as a replacement for a vehicle.\nAllowing cities to change a lane into a dedicated lane for bicycles will make cities safer for pedestrians, safer for cyclists and and a better place to live in as both of these improvements will make it easier to live a lifestyle where you dont need to drive everywhere.\nCities should be made for people. Not cars.\n"

You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nb) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nRefer to these articles that show that bike lanes do not cause gridlock:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000145751930658X\nhttps://www.tvo.org/article/debunking-three-big-myths-about-bike-lanes\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n"
