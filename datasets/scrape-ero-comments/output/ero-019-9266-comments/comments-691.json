        "comment": "As a landscape architect, urban designer, urban transit employee, driver and cyclist, I'm disturbed by the proposals within this bill.\nRemoving bike lanes in favour of lanes for vehicles is moving backwards. Anyone who understands what major cities like Toronto need to operate safely, efficiently, and in a way that boosts economic development should be opposed to this bill.\nPlease listen to the professionals - the experts on these matters - and plan and execute Toronto's infrastructure and transportation plans accordingly. It is an embarrassment to see the Ford government proposing this totally backwards bill that wastes time and money and undoes what little progress we have made.\nMore protected bike lanes means healthier citizens, fewer collisions, lower healthcare burdens, lower carbon emissions, and more thriving people-friendly neighbourhoods, to name a few benefits.\nI urge you to take the wise course of action and put the future of local residents and the environment over the whims of privileged lobbyists, contractors, and short-sighted drivers.\n"

        "comment": "a) Bike lanes provide cyclists with safety; in 2023 there were 5 cyclist deaths in Toronto; so far in 2024, there have been 6 cyclist deaths in Toronto; removing bike lanes will reduce safety and increase the risk of cyclist deaths.\nb) Bike lanes take people out of their cars and onto bicycles.  This means fewer cars which means less congestion, not more congestion.\nc) Studies show bike lanes reduce congestion, not incrase it.  I Googled for a study that says bike lanes make congestion worse, and I couldn't find one!  If the Ontario Government is aware of a well-done Study that concludes bike lanes make congestion worse, then please share!\nd) On November 1, Ontario's Transport minister stated that only 1.2 per cent of people use bike lanes to commute to work.  But this statistic is misleading because it is not local.  The statistic comes from a survey of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) which stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe.  The Minister should be looking at local stats which show that 44 per cent of Torontonians bike in good weather to get to school, work, shop or visit friends.  It also found 26 per cent of people bike for fun or fitness only, making up to 70 per cent of Torontonians cyclists in some capacity.\ne) There are many health benefits when people cycle to get around instead of driving to get around.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes aren\u2019t causing gridlock\u2014 it\u2019s the lack of funding for public transit, especially for the TTC and GO busses/trains, causing more vehicles to be on the road. Bike lanes ensure the safety of commuters and cyclists that rely on them. In 2024, six cyclists have died on Toronto\u2019s roads due to motorists (not including the number of non-fatal accidents), and will only increase if we keep defunding public transit and remove the one thing that keeps cyclists safe. We should be encouraging the public to take greener forms of commuting, and promote exercise.  Doug Ford has also failed to provide any evidence that this will even ease traffic congestion, and instead will waste tax dollars by ignoring the needs of the people who actually live in the city and overreaching into municipal jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing bike lanes will make the people of Toronto less safe, and do little to speed up motor vehicle traffic times. It is a massive waste of taxpayer money to rip them out, and much of the infrastructure is more complicated than when the Ford brothers took out the painted lanes on Jarvis.\nPremier Ford needs to stop re-litigating his past fights with Toronto, and begin focusing on our public healthcare, crumbling schools, and the province as a whole.\nMy family lives just west of downtown, and we have benefitted greatly because of the bike lanes in all seasons (we only get a handful of snowy days). My son rides his bike to high school safe on lanes on Harbord and Shaw. I use bike lanes on Harbord, Bloor, and College regularly for work, groceries, and enjoyment. I ride down University to visit my specialist doctor for a chronic health issue. I cycle the Danforth to visit my elderly mom in the east end.\nI frequently do long distance cycling trips to view our beautiful city and explore new neighbourhoods and shops with friends. Bloor-Danforth, Yonge, University, College, Richmond, Adelaide, King, Shaw, Palmerston...Toronto needs more cycling routes, not less.\nPlease stop this. Backtrack and concede the people of Toronto voted for pro-bike lane councillors. Direct your attention and focus back to where we need you, in education and healthcare.\nI am not just expressing concern. I am being polite in expressing outrage and despair.\nIf you rip them out, my son may not bike to school anymore, but I will be defiantly cycle commuting in all weather, taking a full lane as is my right under the HTA.\n"

        "comment": "I think that it is ridiculous what the province is doing. Bike lanes save lives. Bike lanes help to ease congestion. Bike lanes move more people per hour then car lanes. Bike lanes have in no way increased traffic times. This is ridiculous. The province has no business removing bike lanes. Bicycling is a great source of exercise, It is democratic. It allows for people of all incomes to access their community  and be part of it, not just people in cars. The province does not step in and take away on street parking under the guise of congestion. The move to remove bike lanes is solely ideological and in no way based in any rational underpinnings. The argument that bike lanes are bad for businesses is ridiculous and is in no way true. Bike travel is very localized  extremely beneficial to small business as street facing small business benefit from cyclist moving at a slower pace allowing them to take in their business frontage. Compared to when you are driving a car and it does not allow you to sight see as you are having to maintain greater attention to your surroundings and it does not allow you to window shop as you operate the vehicle. Bike lanes are important in giving young agency in their community. It allows them to explore and perhaps get a part time job or meet up with friends, giving them the opportunity to feel as though they are citizens and not just chattel of their parents.  Baring the building of bike lanes on streets in the future is very short sited and non flexible to changing lifestyles and work habits. Bike lanes do no cause traffic. I drive to work in Vaughan everyday. There is a death trap of a bike lane along highway 7 running unprotected and running along the street. There is 3 lanes of traffic in each direction the bike lane is tucked onto the side. It is an extremely dangerous bike lane that I seldom see anyone using as there are tractor trailers and suv's doing 70-80kmh. The traffic is terrible on highway 7 I can assure you that it is not the bike lane that is causing it.\n"

It would be ridiculous for him to drive there, it\u2019s so close. It also allows him to get exercise daily without having to \u201cschedule it in\u201d.\nWe have a very busy family life with 2 boys in sports and clubs, so we don\u2019t have time to go to the gym.\nMy husband is the main breadwinner for our family, I can\u2019t work because of a chronic illness. Not only would it be devastating to us emotionally if we lost him to being hit by a car because dedicated bike lanes have been removed, our family would also be financially destitute.\nI am entirely positive that we are among many thousands of people who rely on dedicated bike lanes in Toronto for our family\u2019s well-being, and transportation to the jobs that support us.\nWe only need to look at the many countries in Europe who have successfully implemented dedicated bike lanes to see how they significantly increased the use of bicycles taking thousands of cars off the road. Less cars equals less traffic. Whenever you are in a car caught in traffic, you are not special, you are part of the traffic problem. We all have somewhere to be.\n"

        "comment": "Plenty of Ontario residents and organizations have already made the case for why Bill 212 does not represent good governance. It would not reduce congestion, but it would reduce road safety. Lessons from around the world teach that to reduce gridlock, a government should invest in better public transportation and build more active transportation infrastructure. Ontario is no different.\nI'm writing to you because the decision to remove bike lanes makes me worry for my mother's safety. She is 73 and is trying to improve her health by riding her bike more. The cycling infrastructure in Toronto does not yet support her in this effort, but it is getting better.\nMore safe cycling infrastructure would make me feel better about my mom using her bike to get active. Removing some of the best cycling infrastructure -- that are also major connections in the cycling network -- and making it harder to build more safe routes, would put us back years as a city.\nThe Transportation Minister's disbelief at the City's stated cost to remove the lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, perhaps suggest that he has not taken a good look at them lately. They are not merely painted lines or cheap concrete slabs with flexi-posts. They are part of entirely redesigned streets and sidewalks.\nI have a nagging suspicion that this Bill is not about reducing gridlock at all. Trust in government is low these days, because of bad decisions like this. The Ontario government should not play politics with road safety or local democracy. Respect that.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on roads do not cause traffic congestion.\nIntersections cause traffic congestion.\nSimple example. Imagine a single lane road, going east to west, with everybody driving following the MTO's \"2 second rule\". About 1500 cars, maybe 1600 bikes can be travelling along per hour.\nNow imagine another single lane road, same as the example above but going south to north.\nWhere they meet (called an intersection) neither road will be able to keep up with the flow. Flow will be halved (assuming 50/50 split) bringing the throughput to 750 cars per hour.\nRemoving bike lanes will not help congestion. Moving people to denser transport vehicles will.\nIf I (not a transport engineer in any way) can figure this out, then anyone can. The MTO engineers know this. Their documents that have been released show that this is the case.\nI have no idea why our Ontario Government can't figure this out.\nI have no idea why our Ontario Government can't listen to those they employ to figure this stuff out.\nCan you please tell me what I'm missing?\n"

        "comment": "I believe that this proposal is harmful and will not accomplish what it intends to do - which is to reduce traffic by removing heavily used bike lanes and returning them to motor vehicle use. If they are removed, people will still continue to bike on these streets, they will just share the lanes with cars and motor vehicles. This will inevitably slow down cars and motor vehicles from reaching their destinations. Commuters who ride bikes will not suddenly stop biking because bike lanes are removed. This could also result in more accidents because this proposal forced cyclists and motor vehicles to start sharing lanes. The proposal to remove the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University, to reduce traffic and \u201cget drivers where they need to be\u201d does not sound like it will achieve its objective. These streets all run on subway lines, thus drivers do have the option to ride the TTC directly below these 3 streets if they wish to increase their speed when commuting. This proposal goes against Canada\u2019s Climate Plan. It encourages people to use individual motor vehicles rather than commuting by bike or by public transit. As a Torontonian who has used the bike lanes throughout the city, and has loved the experience of biking from Bloor west to the Danforth along the Bloor bike lane, I personally feel like my human rights are being taken away. I feel as though this proposal is attacking my (and many others\u2019) way of life. It is not inclusive, it is disruptive and it is incredibly costly.\n"

Recently, with the extension of bike lanes in the city I have been able to resume biking again and almost never drive anywhere except to get groceries once a week.  My husband and I are able to function with only once car. Biking is the fastest, least expensive and cleanest way to get around the city.  I know if the city continues to expand, rather than destroy the biking infrastructure in the city, more people would feel safe  to bike into the downtown core to work, and congestion would ease.  Many of the great cities in the world - Paris, New York - are doing this and it's working.\nI do agree that some of the bike lanes that were put in during Covid, need to be examined.  There are some areas that with proper bike and traffic lights that bikes and cars could co-exist more efficiently, but ripping out expensive bike lanes is not the way to do this.\nI beg you to make the city safer, and cleaner, by reducing congestion and finding ways to reduce it rather than increase it, as Bill 212 is proposing.  Floods, heat waves, forest fires, all caused by climate change are the legacy we want to leave our children and their children in this city.\n"

Here are my top reasons\n1 - I turly feel safe. Lets be honest there is a pecking order on Toronto streets and vehicles  trump bikes and when i'm on a non bike lane street i'm always on my guard and have had many missess (famously cars will quickly see if htey can pass a street car and fail to see me next to it )\n2 - its faster than taking a car or public transit. Yes i get to work   approx 5-10m sooner on my bike\n3 - I do most of my daily shopping needs (groceries, butcher, pharmacy liquor store etc) along my bike route as i go home. Bloor street offers all of these and i am alswasy stopping off at a store. Never did i do this with a car.\n4 - i leave zero ipact on the enviroment and get some exercise to boot. The later is important as i have a desk job and though i love the idea of coming home and going to the gym ...its hard. But getting on my bike for 60m a day (30m each way) improves my health\n5 - I feel invirorated when i get to work. There is nothing better than on a sunny day  coming in after a 30m ride. It has become a highlight of my day\nplease keep the bike lanes.....please\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto Ward 15 and bike 12km to and 12km from work everyday, for about ten months out of the year. A large portion of my route is on Bloor, from Sherbourne to Ossington. Being able to bike to work allows me to be on time, easily run errands and do business if I need to, and enables me to maintain a healthy level of physical exercise in this busy city. Removal of any bike lane along Bloor would be disastrously hazardous to cyclists like myself, and will indubitably increase the number of cyclist injuries and deaths in the city.\nNoticeably the sections of road on my bike route without bike lanes are far more dangerous (and usually in poor condition). Because of this, I'll bike defensively in the centre of the road or lane so as to avoid dips, potholes, and debris on the right of the road, and to avoid being hit or run off the road by drivers on the left. If bike lanes are removed from Bloor, I would be frequently forced to bike this defensive way as it will be the safest way to do so; in the centre of the road so that no one may pass. I am certain I will not be the only cyclist who will choose this method of safety in the absence of bike lanes.\nDue to the nature of working in the film industry\u2013 I have travelled by bike at all hours; and at every hour no matter how early or late, I will always encounter at minimum five other cyclists on each trip. At peak hours, I'll see more than I can count and keep track of. In my decade of living in Toronto, I've noticed a dramatic increase in usage of the bike share bikes after 2020, and it appears the data correlates with my observations; I attached an article that covers those statistics. Additionally, not once have I ever seen an emergency vehicle get stalled because of bike lanes.\nI can tell you what was the cause of so much congestion along Bloor this year, biking consistently along there from January of this year until present, with a break in March and part of April. From my observations it was the construction at the Bloor/Yonge intersection that is in part to blame for the abnormal congestion.\nInstead of wasting taxpayer dollars to undo work that has undoubtedly saved lives and protected from harm, it seems reasonable and logical to me to redirect those funds into researching and implementing solutions to road rage, improving public transit, and/or towards other factually-proven measures to reduce traffic congestion in the city. Furthermore, it is plain to me that the provincial government is overreaching into municipal affairs without cause, and dare I add\u2013 in bad faith. I am disappointed by the blatantly false claims on the impact of bike lanes on traffic and how frequently they are used that have been made by Premier Ford and his party members.\nI am vehemently opposed to Bill 212. I\u2019ve attached articles that further support my comment on Bill 212. I urge you to put an end to this bill.\nSincerely signed,\nM. H.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against the proposed legislation for the following reasons:\n\u2022\tThe overreach of overriding municipal decision making and jurisdiction. There has been no attempt to work with Toronto to address any perceived bicycle lane issues. Instead, an entire new, unaccountable layer of bureaucracy is being created. In many cases, such as with complete Streets Eglinton, this is undoing years of collaboration, community consultation and street design, and is a slap in the face to all community members and groups in the riding, whose work is being cast aside. The government wasn\u2019t elected on a platform or mandate to take over this area of municipal jurisdiction. It is not equipped to do so, and a partial meddling in the work of municipalities is bound to be inefficient, ineffective, and expensive.\n*    The removal of the bicycle lanes will waste money -- destroying millions of dollars of work, costing millions of dollars to execute, and creating a massive amount of work and expense to re-engineer and replace/create alternate cycling lanes (which the province is not offering to pay for, and which will come out of Toronto and/or Ontario taxpayer dollars). It will create traffic problems and diversions for many months and possibly years as the lanes are removed, and there is no evidence that it will have a measurable positive impact on traffic in the longer term.\n\u2022\tBicycle lanes are being scapegoated for the major failures in transportation planning --such as the Crosstown, now entering its fourteenth year of construction, and the poor coordination of major construction downtown (e.g. Ontario line) \u2013 which transportation engineers have identified as the actual cause of traffic congestion in Toronto. Separated cycle lanes on main roads are a key feature of most cities that have successfully reduced congestion, as cyclists take up far less road space than cars. 83 major cities in Europe average 15% daily cycle commuting among residents, with the leaders being northern cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam (35% of daily commuters use bicycles), and cities in Sweden and Norway. In the case of the city of Toronto, present and future housing developments require that fewer new residents use cars: in 2021, city council removed minimum requirements for parking spaces in new developments. Only 22% of residents of future developments within the city will have access to parking spots. For many of these people, cycling will be the safest, fastest, and most consistent commuting option.\n\u2022\tThis legislation will result in more cyclist injuries and deaths, which are already shockingly and unacceptably high. Cyclists deserve safe, efficient routes \u2013 yet the plan is apparently to remove such routes with no alternatives in place.\n\u2022\tThe legislation is sexist. Women, whom research shows are for more likely to \u2018trip chain,\u2019 making multiple stops (at a school, a dry cleaner, a grocery store, etc.), are often best served by cycling. Women are less likely to have access to a car (if there is one car in a household, a man is far more likely to drive it). Women, young people, and racialized groups drive less; the government has an equal obligation to meet these groups transportation needs. More than 50% of road users are going 5 km or less, for which a car is usually inefficient. These folks are also \u2018traffic.\u2019\nI sincerely hope the minister will reconsider this ill-thought out legislation. And also the ill-conceived political strategy behind it. Ontarians care about the bread and butter issues \u2013inflation, lack of affordable housing, lack of job opportunities for youth. Diverting attention to bicycle lanes as a culture war \u2018woke\u2019 issue is a strategy most voters see through. This will be heightened if/when bicycle lanes are ripped out and gridlock continues; rather than providing a distraction, it will become an example of government failure to effectively address pressing problems.\n"
