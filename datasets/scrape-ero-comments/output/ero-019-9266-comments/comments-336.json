        "comment": "Hi, as both a biker and driver in Toronto, I\u2019m writing to express my concern about the removal of bike lanes. Without the bike lanes, bikers will have to bike on roads, which also in some ways slow down the traffic. Moreover, drivers will have to be even more cautious of not hitting bikers who have nowhere to bike except sharing the road with cars. I would much rather drive on a road next to a bike lane, than sharing a road with bikers because of safety reasons. Whenever I bike on roads which require bikers to share lanes with cars (e.g. Bloor Street east of Sherbourne Street), drivers would try to pass us and act as if bikers are biking on the wrong lane. Expanding the area of this kind of roads would only increase the friction between bikers and drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, please do not remove the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic. My family lives by Harbour Street and on most days are unable to commute without a two hours commute due to traffic built up on Lakeshore and the surrounding regions. We should not be encouraging single occupant vehicles, my partner just reported her co-worker got her foot ran over today. Two night ago I experienced two people simply parked right at the intersection in the lane making a two lane into a single lane with many blind spots. There are often food delivery drivers who simply park in the bike lane and how would cyclists and pedestrians share a sidewalk. It is not safe for cyclists who must be driving an arms length away from a vehicle 25 times their weight. We must encourage emission free transportation. Earlier this year I travelled to London where there have been Ultra Low Emission Zones in effect for the past five years. As Toronto continues to become a world class city we must not retract services which our locals rely on for people to sit in traffic. Limit the amount of automobiles by not allowing single occupant drivers people should carpool or seek alternative transportation means. Our city has become stagnant and must not take the single activity which allows people to lower the cost of living and cost to the environment. Thank you and please make the right decision. When walking down bloor st I noticed the car parked on street parking was about to open their door into someone on the bike lane how could they possibly have a safe mean of transportation without a lane.\n"

        "comment": "When the act is called \"Saving You Time\", whose time is it really saving?  Is it the people living downtown who would benefit from an affordable and relatively quick mode of transport if the TTC is out of service, or if they are going to or come from an area that is not well serviced by buses or the subway?\nRemoving the bike lanes will endanger cyclists that currently ride on these streets, and negatively impact local businesses due to loss of foot traffic. As Toronto's density increases, we need prioritize the safety and use of the road for all commuters, regardless of transportation method.\nI do not support this Bill and it will negatively impact the neighborhoods where the bike lane are removed from a safety and economic standpoint.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will do nothing to alleviate traffic in Toronto. As a resident of the Annex for the past 10 years and someone who has living in Toronto since birth, I absolutely want the bike lanes to stay. Toronto needs these bike lanes. And ripping them up is a complete waste of money that will only cause further congestion.\nIf this government actually wants to do something about congestion and traffic they would invest in high speed trains. We need to move away from car transportation. Listen to the experts, not developers and construction companies.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose any provincial legislation that will restrict or remove any municipal bicycling infrastructure.  My concern arises from my belief that such actions will reduce cycling safety, and reduce progress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\nUp to a few years ago, bicycling was my main means of transportation around Mississauga and Etobicoke.(My car stayed at home.)  Mississauga was easy.  Over the years it has developed a network of bicycle routes along the major arterial roads, creeks, power line rights of way, etc. This appears to have evolved from a municipal consultation process that worked.\nEtobicoke was a cycling disaster area.  I wanted to cycle along Bloor Street (and perhaps shop or eat), but couldn't due to the lack of bike lanes on the street, narrow bridges over creeks and Highway 427 and the narrow underpasses for rail lines, and the complicated street pattern at six points (recently fixed).  As a result, I avoided Etobicoke.\nToronto also appears to have a working municipal consultation process and it should be allowed to work on the matter of bicycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "When I learned about Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, I realized it could impact my commute to school and work. I understand the challenges of rush-hour congestion, but it\u2019s important to recognize that many cyclists also rely on this specific bike lane. The city should prioritize support for those commuting by bike, as cycling reduces air pollution and alleviates traffic. Expanding resources and dedicated bike lanes for cyclists would be a positive step forward for Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "The specific targeting of 3 different Toronto bike lanes that have all been constructed is awful. Wasting more resources by reversing decisions the City of Toronto has made is wasteful and ignorant to the needs of the local residents that use the roads everyday.

        "comment": "This proposal, especially as amended, is quite frankly insane.\nAs a regular biker and resident of Toronto, the bike lanes on University, Bloor, and Yonge are phenomenal. They are used all the time; every time I use them, there are lots of other bikers there as well. Since I live near all of these streets, many of my routes through the city involve using one of these lanes, and it's always convenient to be able to navigate using a main street and know that it's a safe place to bike. I don't need to worry about having to share space with cars, which is more stressful and more dangerous for both drivers and bikers. It's especially good because the network of bike lanes in Toronto is frequently disconnected; even for relatively short trips, I often need to bike on roads without bike lanes simply because no bike lane exists to get me where I need to go. Having main roads available as bike routes makes planning and navigation simpler and easier.\nRemoving these lanes would make life more difficult for the countless people who actually live, work, and travel downtown. That's not even mentioning the effect more prolonged road construction would have on the businesses along these streets, who already had to deal with business disruptions as recently as this year during the lanes' construction. All of this would be, at best, to benefit mostly people who don't even live in the areas affected, a benefit which is not even particularly likely.\nIt has been shown time and time again that widening roads tends to *increase* traffic, not decrease it. Insisting that further widening multi-lane streets will somehow \"solve gridlock\" therefore seems, to me, patently false. The big city can be a frightening place for a person on a bike, but the increase in bike infrastructure makes it better and safer for everybody. The only real way to permanently reduce traffic is to get more people out of their cars by making walking, public transit, and biking (including ebikes & scooters) more attractive options. Above all, it seems clear to me that these decisions should be made by the residents and politicians of the city, the people who actually live and work here, not by voters in Barrie or Sarnia, and not by the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I am 100% opposed to this bill. Removing bike lanes and restricting the construction of new ones will not have a significant beneficial effect on motor vehicle traffic. In fact, having fewer bike lanes will likely have a significant negative effect on traffic as many trips that are could be taken by bike will now instead be taken by car, causing traffic to increase. With another lane of car traffic on a street like Bloor, cars will not move faster, there will just be more of them stuck in traffic crawling along at slow speeds. The only way to actually reduce car traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving. If the province is concerned about improving mobility around our cities, it should be prioritizing investment in transit, cycling, and pedestrian infrastructure.\nFurthermore, this bill is a gross overreach of provincial power. Decisions regarding the design of local streets should be left up to municipalities. The provincial government should not be seeking to insert itself into that decision-making process, slowing down much needed improvements with extra bureaucratic red tape.\n"

Counter intuitive, but a fact.\n3 Downtown Toronto should be a destination where walking, cycling and public transit are prioritized. Downtown Toronto should not be considered a thoroughfare for motor vehicles.\n4 Removing bike lanes will lead to an increase in CYCLIST AND PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES.\n5 Increasing motor vehicle density in the city and province will lead to increased emissions. This is not only bad for the health of the citizens of this province and city it also contributes to global warming which is an existential crisis.\n6 We, the residents of downtown Toronto are not represented. The present PC / Ford government does not have any seats from the core of the city.\n7 This Bill 212 is an affront to the authority of the City of Toronto.\n8 This Bill seems designed to create divisions between cyclists and drivers. I don't see how this culture war incitement is good for anybody.\n8 The premier's SCAPEGOATING OF CYCLISTS and cycle infrastructure is galling.\n8 As a passionate cyclist who lives in downtown Toronto I feel like I have just been hit by a truck full of BS driving by the premier.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist and driver in the City of Toronto, and a property owner in the City, I am DEEPLY OPPOSED to Bill 212.\nI support the continued installation of bike lanes and infrastructure across our city and in other municipalities across Ontario. This infrastructure helps protect the safety of all road users and minimize conflicts between different modes of transportation. It also offers transit options other than the car, which ultimately reduces the number of vehicles on the road. That is a good thing for people who still choose or need to drive\nI am deeply troubled by the province's efforts to intervene in municipal decision-making on this matter. It is the city planners most closely connected with our local built environment that should be making decisions on local infrastructure developments such as bike lanes, with the approval of elected city officials. The province has no role in such decisions and needs to back off.\nI strongly support the continued existence and development of bike lanes in the City of Toronto, which I regularly use. We need MORE, not less, bike lanes. I am deeply opposed to the Province's efforts to intervene in municipal planning and attempt to remove bike lanes that my taxes have paid for and my municipal elected officials have approved. Not only is removing existing bike lanes a huge waste of taxpayer funds - it will endanger vulnerable road users across the city.\nTo be clear: I SUPPORT BIKE LANES IN THE CITY OF TORONTO AND THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO.\nI DO NOT SUPPORT BILL 212.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not based on any evidence, proper metrics, or recorded statistics of any kind.\nAs a lifelong Ontarian, I expect a few things from the Progressive Conservative party, that I believe the Premier and Transportation Minister would agree with:\n- A careful eye on government budget.\n- A lack of red-tape overreach.\n- Respecting the jurisdiction of municipalities and municipal infrastructure planning.\n- Bills and actions based on facts, not anecdotes.\nBill 212 flies in the face of all four of those tenets. I would beseech the Ford government to reconsider this wasteful, overreaching, ineffective bill.\nAnd to address what I assume will be the rebuttal to my points (\"Congestion in Toronto needs to be addressed\"), I agree. Congestion on the streets of Toronto and the province as a whole needs to be addressed.\nThis bill WILL NOT REDUCE CONGESTION. PERIOD.\nI understand that a significant number of Ontarians and PC party supporters live in areas in which drivers need ample road space as that is the major method of transportation. In suburban towns and cities, bike lanes on major streets may not be the right solution.\nIn Toronto, more than 50% of commuters DO NOT DRIVE to work and back home. They walk, they cycle, they use transit.\nIf the Ford government is keen to reduce congestion in Toronto, ripping out bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge (all three on top of subway lines) is foolhardy and misguided. Instead, efforts to support transit with funding (including working with Metrolinx to get the much-delayed Eglinton LRT line opened) and cutting down on construction congestion (something this bill will make worse) would actually make a difference.\nBike lanes on Toronto REDUCE congestion when used properly. Please refer to the many exhaustive studies to show how the three lanes mentioned make the areas safer for cyclists and do not increase overall congestion. I should also note that the insistence that the University bike lanes are causing issues for first responders is entirely false and not backed up by any hospital or emergency service provider.\nPlease do not tie up Toronto with more red tape, more construction, and more provincial overreach. Please let us keep the bike lanes that make the streets safer and allow for more people to move through the city more safely.\nI am a driver.\nI am a cyclist.\nI am a voting, tax-paying Ontarian and passionate resident of Toronto.\nI do not want to die on my bike one day because this bill forced a foolish decision on my city.\nAnd make no mistake. Removing bike lanes will get more cyclists injured and killed. It will turn some drivers into murderers, who would otherwise be safely separated from bike traffic. That is a fact.\nI would invite Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria to join me on their own bicycles to experience, first-hand, the realities of a cycling commute in this city. I know the Premier is passionate about connecting with citizens directly and I think this would be a fantastic opportunity for him to show how commited he is to the bike lane debate. I am happy to be contacted at any time if the Premier and/or Minister are interested in learning about the realities of what their bill will affect.\nThank you for your time.\n"
