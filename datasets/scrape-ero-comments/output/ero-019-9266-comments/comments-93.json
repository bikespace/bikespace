BIAs also have shown that bike lanes help local businesses make money and keep Ontario moving. This is a shortsighted, nonsensical plan that will only endanger lives and make our roads worse. Please reallocate the funds to more important issues like our healthcare system, overcrowded schools and helping our most vulnerable to create safer communities. I do not support this proposal.\n"

Bikes are also a great way of promoting a more active lifestyle and a healthy population. The provincial government should be paying for MORE bike lanes.

If you want traffic to move faster, support more bike lanes and start planning the next subway line which get cars off the roads.

I feel that this interference is being done for blatantly political reasons and not with the aim of \"reducing gridlock.\" There are already too many cars in my city. Why are there too many cars and why is there so much gridlock? It is because the public transportation system here is unreliable and has been underfunded by the Provincial government for years now. Removing and restricting bike lanes is not the solution to the problem of gridlock. Keep and expand the bike lanes and vastly improve our public transportation system. That is the solution to gridlock. It is not in the building of more roads and the encouragement of more driving that will get us out of this mess.\n"

        "comment": "Another grasping at straws idea from a conservative government that is more interested in looking like they are doing something than actually doing something to solve a problem. It is a fact that bike lanes 1: reduce traffic because bikes will no longer be in regular lanes causing slow downs and 2: provide a safe place for cyclists to commute without the threat of being harmed or killed by a careless driver.\nThere are many more reasons why this bill is idiotic, but I will only point out the absolute inanity of a conservative government, which should represent a small government mindset, forcing municipalities to ask for permission from the provincial government to do something in their own town! Government oversight and government overreach is antithetical to the very concept of \"conservativism\" and laissez-faire.  But I guess Doug Ford never took political science or speak French, so I don't think he knows what laissez-faire even means.\n"

        "comment": "If we care about climate and safety, we should be pushing towards better public transit and cycling infrastructure, not more cars on the road.\nRather than spend millions ripping out the newly installed bike lane on university, that money should be spent improving the TTC, encouraging more people within the city to stop driving as much, and making it easier and more reliable for out of towners to get to work from union station.\nWhen cycling (or taking transit) becomes a viable option for more people, the number of cars on the road will decrease. Let's look at real solutions to make Toronto a better city long into the future, not knee-jerk bandaid solutions that won't be effective in the long term. Let's not fall behind as a city.\nFurthermore, this shouldn't be a political issue. Bike lane additions/removals should be based on data, and this data should be open to the public to avoid the politicization of the issue. It's not black and white, some bike lanes are probably underused and not well placed, but others (like the one on university) are in constant use and anecdotally don't seem to cause more congestion (again, let's study the effects before throwing away money to rip them up).\n"

        "comment": "Mr Premier, I'm very disappointed in the proposal of Bill 212 that will serve to add red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy to the approval of bike lanes in Ontario. This bill will do nothing to 'reduce congestion'. There is no real data to support the idea that bike lanes add to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the less that people feel obligated to drive, and therefore the number of cars on the road is reduced. The citizens Ontario do not want their tax dollars spent in such an inefficient and harmful way. It is money that could be used to improve healthcare, public schooling, and, most relevantly, public transport.\n"

I have been a conservative voter all my life but I have had about enough of these absurd decisions that are made solely to win over suburban Toronto voters. The provincial government should leave municipal affairs to local government that are elected by the people they serve to deal with municipal issues. There is no reason a Toronto MPP or provincial bureaucrat living in Toronto needs to intervene in municipal projects in Kingston, Ottawa, or Sudbury. Think there is plenty of work to do on truly Provincial responsibilities like health care and education.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is an overreach by the provincial government in an area usually delegated to municipalities. It will also have negative environmental and other impacts.\nEnvironmentally, bike lanes reduce reliance on cars, leading to fewer emissions and improved air quality. Without them, cities remain car-centric, contributing to pollution and urban congestion.\nFrom a transportation perspective, bike lanes promote safer, more efficient mobility by encouraging cycling as an alternative to driving, which alleviates traffic and improves overall access in dense urban areas. Limiting bike lanes restricts this mobility, making cities less accessible for non-car users.\nFor local businesses, bike lanes can increase foot and bike traffic, bringing in more customers who might otherwise avoid congested areas. Reducing bike lane infrastructure could hurt local economies by limiting access for these patrons.\nWith respect to the Bloor bike lanes in particular, which Premier Ford has discussed removing, the head of the local Bloor Annex BIA has come out and said that the removing these bike lanes, which have now been in place for many for many years, will have a negative economic impact on local small businesses on Bloor.\nOverall, removing bike lanes hinders sustainable urban development. The provincial government\u2019s policy proposal is completely misguided and will harm the communities, both residents and small businesses, that are impacted.\n"

Cyclists REDUCE gridlock and should be encouraged. Bike lanes prevent traffic by moving people out of their cars and onto bikes. They also create safe conditions for cyclists, which encourages cycling, and also saves lives. This is anti-evidence and small-minded.\n"

I take all of the safety precautions that I can take as a casual cyclist- I wear high-vis clothing, use bike lights, signal turnings- and still- I have been in dangerous situations caused by irresponsible and downright aggressive drivers. Bike lanes protect me from these drivers and help me get from A to B in a safe, quick, and zero-emmision fashion. Also, by providing safe, dedicated spaces for cyclists, we can encourage more residents to choose biking as a viable mode of transport, leading to fewer cars on the road and decreased traffic in general. Less bike lanes = more drivers. It won't help with traffic times.\n"

This is limited thinking that discounts the role of alternate modes of transport, including transit, bikes and other micromobility vehicles. Not everyone in Ontario can afford a car, why should those who cannot afford one be penalized by the \"for the people\" government. We cannot afford to move backwards. We need to build alternate modes of transport, including transit. I implore you to do away with this mindless Bill and focus on what Ontario needs to move ahead with our transportation network. Instead of building new highways and tunnels, reclaim Hwy. 407. Instead of ripping out bike lanes, invest in Toronto's subway system. Instead of blaming grid lock on bike lanes, look at driver behaviour and upgrade the traffic signal systems. Please do not pass this senseless Bill. It will move Ontario back years and traffic will be just as bad as it is now, due to the concept of induced demand. Please consider people's lives and place some importance on vulnerable road users. Premier Ford is a premier of all Ontarians, not just the ones that drive a car. Consider the impact of your actions and this Bill. If this comment lacks clarity - let me reiterate - I do not support Bill 212. It is misplaced and lacks vision.\n"
