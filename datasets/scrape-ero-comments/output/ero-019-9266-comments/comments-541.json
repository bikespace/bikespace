        "comment": "The number of people driving bikes in Toronto has been growing for the last few years. Even though currently the number of bikers is roughly 2% of all Toronto citizens this number will increase. Removing bike lanes puts cyclists in a huge danger on the road and it promotes people to buy cars, which will increase the traffic load even more, or to use already overcrowded public transport. Removing bike lanes is definitely a step back for the city.\n"

One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\"\nDoug Ford TVO, 2017\nIt\u2019s time to think outside the car\nI am a 66 year old cyclist who rides my bike for commuting, utilitarian and recreational purposes.  I own several bicycles and also own a car and use the appropriate vehicle for transportation considering conditions and distance. I also use public transit especially to get into and out of the city. I defer to these modes of transportation rather than my car than my car. I have lived in the GTA for over 60 years and witnessed substantial growth in the city over those years.  A result of that growth is significant increase in car use, traffic flow and congestion.\nI am active in promoting the many benefits of cycling and am a passionate advocate for the bicycle as practical active transportation. While I occasionally use the bike trails I generally ride on the roads when commuting or riding for utilitarian purpose, i.e. shopping.  I am happy to see that The City of Toronto is establishing a network of interconnecting bicycle lanes and other infrastructure that make travel by bike within the city practical and safer.\nThe data is clear on personal car use in cities, it is unsustainable.  Building more highways encourages more cars; \"induced demand\" - new roads attract more drivers.  Vehicles are getting larger and more deadly, especially to vulnerable road users. One person using an oversize SUV to go 5km, or less, is causing congestion, not bicycle lanes.  Public transit, walking and active/micro modes of transport are part of the solution to the bottlenecks on our roads.\nMajor cities of the world have begun to promote active transportation and restrict car use.  The trend is towards progressive polices aimed at reducing air pollution, improve public health and relieve traffic congestion and gridlock.  The proposed Bill 212 is regressive when what we need is bold, progressive \u201coutside the car\u201d thinking and action from our elected politicians, not legislation designed to serve personal car drivers.\nPlease review the data regarding bike lanes and traffic congestion and reconsider, or amend, Bill 212 and make evidenced based decisions.\nThank you for reading and considering my comments.\nConcerned voting citizen\nPSB\n"

        "comment": "Cities need to be free to designate the space they have appropriately to meet their needs.\nAdding bike lanes can reduce gridlock, when implemented such that cyclists have a safe path to go completely from A to B through the city. There also needs to be a safe storage options at both ends of the commute. Once the infrastructure is in place, people will use it more and more.\nAs a chain is only as strong as the weakest link, so is this infrastructure. If a cyclist has bike lanes for 90% of the way to work, but they still feel like they're risking their lives for the other 10%, the gridlock reduction goal will not be realized.\nWith that in mind, there will be some places where they make sense, and others where they don't.\nWhether it makes sense to add or remove them should be completely a local decision. The province could provide models, statistics, data and guidance to aid in such decisions, but anything beyond that is just provincial overreach and unnecessary red tape, causing delays and added administration costs for every improvement a jurisdiction tries to make.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will not reduce gridlock or save commuters time, it will do the opposite. Research shows that bike lanes actually improves traffic, because more people will bike, leading to fewer people in cars. Bike lanes enables a larger number of people to move through a much smaller amount of space than cars require. Removing bike lanes off of major streets like Bloor & Yonge will make biking down those streets much more dangerous and lead to injury and death for bike riders. I, along with many, many other Torontonians, use the bike lane on Bloor all the time, and I feel much safer because of the separated bike lane. This bill is a huge step backwards for transit, quality of life, and sustainability in Toronto. Research also shows that bike lanes help businesses - it is much easier to stop and pop into a store along Bloor or Yonge St if you're on a bike than in a car. Please do not pass this bill. We need legislation that increases alternative forms of transportation - bikes, subways, streetcars, etc. if you truly care about reducing gridlock and saving time. It is already faster to subway or bike most places in the city than it is to drive, especially during peak hours. It could be even better if you invested in safe bike lanes and public transportation, instead of this misinformed and unpopular bill that will put more cars on the road and endanger the lives of bikers.\n"

The other 10% is done with public transport, car share, and Uber.  It is important to us that we, especially our children, have safe routes to get to and from our destinations for sporting events, groceries, community events, and including going to the park or the library, etc. on a daily basis.  Already our routes remain broken up and many times we feel unsafe.  For a long time we've been fighting for the very few, disconnected bike lanes we now have, only to hear that they could be under threat of being removed.  Our cities should be safe for all: young and old, rich and poor, able bodied and persons with disabilities (including my husband's brother who has down syndrome and only feels safe in bike lanes).  We already know that the more bicycles and buses we have on the road, means less traffic congestion, so why are we forcing more vehicles on the road by removing or not allocating bike lanes.  My family and I oppose this decision which makes absolutely no sense for cities or traffic congestion and makes Canada quite frankly a undesirable place for a lot of people to live in or want to visit.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal seems to miss the point that bike lanes encourage cycling that, in turn, removes cars from the road and, so, reduced congestion.  I personally drive, cycle, walk, and take transit; it all depends on what makes sense for the specific trip and conditions.  Bike lanes are a major consideration since they can make a bike trip faster and safer where they exist.\nInstead, this proposal appears to start from the premise that bike lanes cause congestion.  This is counter-factual.  Studies have shown that for both bike and car lanes when you increase the number of lanes you increase usage, but that it takes time for that impact to emerge.  So, if you increase bike lanes, you need to have patience to reap the longer term benefits of less congestion.  And if you increase car lanes, you eventually get increased congestion.  There is also evidence to suggest that bike lanes are good for business; after all, when you are not simply driving past a store at 30 or more km/h and do not need to find parking, you are more likely to drop into the store and buy something (please see the first link).\nI object to the section on environmental implications.  I agree that it is not possible to state in specific terms what the implications will be since there are so many variables.  However, as a public servant who at times is called upon to address the environmental impacts of proposed policies (though I do not work in the environmental sector), I know that it is possible to consult with colleagues and make projections about broad implications.\nBy limiting the number of bike lanes - and potentially taking away bike lanes and \"restoring\" car lanes - it is reasonable to assume that a result will be to limit the number of cyclists, many of whom will then drive.  This is bound to have a negative environmental impact, regardless of the fuel used to power the cars.  By writing \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new cycling lanes\" you are simply evading the question.\nI also object to the imposition of provincial authority in these matters.  We have municipal staff and politicians who are perfectly capable of dealing with the issue.  They may or may not make good decisions on an individual level but to add an extra layer of bureaucracy - particularly from a higher level of government - makes no sense.\nCities need multiple ways for people to make their daily trips.  The basic infrastructure is heavily weighted toward private cars but people's habits have been changing.  Cars are expensive to purchase and to run and maintain, take a heavy toll on the environment, and cause a great deal of property damage, pain, and death in accidents.  Balanced against this, they are (usually) convenient ways of getting around and we greatly rely upon them.  But because of the negatives, people are mixing things up, using bikes, transit, and walking, so we need to diversify our transportation systems.\nCompared to the real estate taken up by car lanes, bike lanes are a minuscule presence in our cities.  Focusing on limiting them - and possibly getting rid of them - is a misguided approach.  Please reconsider this proposal.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto for over a decade (in South Etobicoke for 5 years), and am a driver, pedestrian, transit user and cyclist. I am extremely concerned about your government's position on bike lanes and proposed Bill 212, which would remove existing major bike lanes in Toronto and add a cumbersome layer of bureaucracy to the installation of new cycling infrastructure. I am unequivocally against it. Bill 212 is dangerous, irresponsible, and not at all evidence-based. It is also a total overreach of provincial power.\nPeople living in Toronto (and in Ontario, but let's be real - this reads as a personal vendetta against Toronto, again) need efficient, safe, environmentally responsible and economical ways of getting to work, school, childcare, play and beyond.  To use a favourite term of Conservative governments: cycling is \"common sense\". There are so many benefits to cycling: it is more environmentally friendly than driving (critical in an era of climate change), is fast and efficient, promotes exercise (which in turn, reduces healthcare costs), and is accessible to more people (not everyone can afford cars!). A critical mass of people on bikes will reduce strain on transit and car lanes. However, that critical mass will not be achieved if bike infrastructure is not safe, and especially not if it does not exist. Moreover, more cyclists will die if your government removes our bike lanes.\nThere is plenty of evidence, both formally researched and anecdotal, that bike lanes DO NOT, on their own, negatively impact business. This has been disproven in Toronto and beyond. Do not use this as a reason to remove bike lanes on major streets. I include links to various resources at the bottom of this comment. It is shameful that I have to do so.\nIn terms of increases in vehicle travel times, if traffic needs to move more slowly to accommodate safe cycling infrastructure, so be it. At this point, it becomes a question of values. I value the benefits of cycling and Vision Zero far over the inconvenience of a few extra minutes of drive time. So do 120 physicians in a petition that I linked through this commenting portal. That said, of course all potential adjustments should be made to improve travel times, such as signal timing or road design. Moreover, if adjustments need to be made to allow for emergency vehicles, we should defer to Emergency Services departments, who are the experts on that matter.\nTo repeat, I do not support Bill 212. Our population is going to continue to grow, and I think we agree that our roads can\u2019t accommodate many more cars.  (So does the Ontario Professional Planners' Institute; I have included a link to their formal statement through this portal, as well). Without drastic action, climate change will continue to affect Toronto. For all the jargon around \u201ccommon sense\u201d, there\u2019s truly no logic in what you\u2019re doing. Cycling as a mode of transportation is a GOOD thing that your government should be encouraging and partnering to improve with all levels of government, not actively obstructing.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes the removal of existing bike lanes and increased roadway capacity for cars. This bill\u2019s approach lacks supporting data to justify its premise that removing bike lanes and increasing car lanes will reduce traffic congestion. Studies consistently show that adding road capacity does not alleviate congestion but rather increases it, an effect known as \u201cinduced demand.\u201d When more lanes are built, it encourages more drivers to use them, leading to the same level\u2014or worse\u2014of congestion within a few years. For example, research from multiple sources, including the Rocky Mountain Institute (https://rmi.org/more-lanes-do-not-mean-less-traffic/), highlights how expanding highways in urban areas fails to provide long-term congestion relief, instead promoting more car use, pollution, and often further disconnecting communities\u200b\nAdditionally, Ontario\u2019s transportation strategies should prioritize climate-smart solutions, which means increasing\u2014not dismantling\u2014protected bike lanes. Cities worldwide are investing in protected bike lanes as a crucial part of reducing dependency on personal cars and lowering carbon emissions. Studies from urban planning initiatives in Europe and North America show that bike infrastructure is essential for creating accessible, low-emission transit options. Adding bike lanes not only supports environmental goals but also aligns with international standards for safe, sustainable urban transit. Ontario\u2019s goal should be to provide robust, safe alternatives to personal vehicle use that help reduce emissions and combat climate change.\nFurthermore, the choice to prioritize car infrastructure over sustainable alternatives is at odds with what many residents seek: safer, more inclusive transit options that reduce dependency on single-occupancy vehicles. Bill 212\u2019s amendment to remove existing bike lanes is particularly concerning. These bike lanes were funded by tax dollars to improve safety and accessibility for cyclists, making urban spaces more navigable and reducing road conflicts between cars and bicycles. Removing these established bike lanes wastes public funds and disregards the safety benefits these lanes provide. Data from cities like New York and Copenhagen shows that dedicated bike infrastructure not only decreases cyclist injuries but can also lead to more efficient vehicle travel times, as dedicated lanes manage traffic flow better\u200b. (Please see https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319)\nIf an extra lane for driving cars is truly necessary, then why not remove parking on these streets? It seems inconsistent to prioritize idle, parked cars over actual living space that could be used for transit or pedestrian paths. How is it that idle cars get to enjoy this precious public space, while residents seeking safer, active transit options are neglected?\nThe proposed reallocation of public funds to dismantle bike infrastructure contradicts the province's stated goals of enhancing overall transportation efficiency. If the goal truly is to enable all residents\u2014not just drivers\u2014to move efficiently, these resources should be directed toward improving public transit and protected bike infrastructure. Our communities deserve safe, sustainable, and economically responsible transit solutions, and prioritizing car use does not align with this vision.\nIn summary, Bill 212\u2019s approach is costly, unsustainable, and overlooks the demand for safer, more equitable transit options. I urge a reconsideration of this bill and instead recommend investing in solutions that reflect a modern, sustainable vision for Ontario\u2019s transportation needs.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident that regularly uses many modes of transportation, including automobiles, subways, and bicycles, I am conflicted by this attempt to remove bike infrastructure from busy streets in Toronto. So many cyclists have been killed in this city due to poorly-designed and implemented transit infrastructure; leaving me feeling that the addition of bike lanes on Bloor St. was a boon to cyclists not wanting to be permanently injured or killed during their morning commute. As a resident of the city, I'm able to report that business along cycling routes has not dwindled after infrastructure had been implemented; an observation that is supported by statistical information relating to business transactions before and after such infrastructure was implemented. Making movement through the city easier for those who wish to spend their money, be active and fit (reducing hospital wait times - barring the likelihood of severe injury or death after an altercation with a vehicle), and thereby removing additional vehicles from the road (by not having to use a car), is a win-win for the city, region, and province. As a father of two, I hope to be able to continue to live and commute, without fear of being maimed or killed during my daily commute, and wish the same for my children. I believe that the cycling infrastructure being put in place will help serve this purpose of not dying while cycling, while still supporting local business.\n"

        "comment": "The suggestions that Bill 212 proposes are completely in opposition to its stated aims. Bike lanes, when they provide a comprehensive network for commuters to use, are far more effective at getting people where they need to be. I am someone who has used bike lanes when I've lived in downtown Toronto on Yonge, Bloor, and University, and would love the addition of more bike lanes. The following specifically concerns me about Bill 212:\n- The bill neglects the fact that bike lanes are able to more efficiently move large numbers of people. Bikes take up physically less space than cars, and most commuter cars only have one person in them. Thus, if the goal is moving large numbers of people at once, a bike lane is more effective than a car lane.\n- The bill is a gross overreach of provincial power. By requiring approval for past and future bike lanes, the bill introduces extreme levels of bureaucracy and unjustified overreach into decisions that ought to be left up to municipalities. Let the people who actually live there make the decisions about what's best for the community.\n- The bill holds an incomplete network of bike lanes to the same standard as a complete road network. If  roads weren't connected to one another, no one would use them. Since currently the bike lanes in downtown Toronto aren't connected to one another, cyclists are taking a risk every time they bike. The real solution is to create a more extensive network of bike lanes across Toronto such that cyclists can safely reach their destination.\n- Removing the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University won't stop people from biking, it will just make it more dangerous for those who do cycle. We will always have food delivery cyclists and other commuters, and more of those people will get injured or even killed from vehicle collisions if the bike lanes are removed. Bill 212 actively disregards the safety of Ontarians.\n"
