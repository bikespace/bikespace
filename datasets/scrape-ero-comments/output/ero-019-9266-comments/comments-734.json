        "comment": "The bill as framed is harmful to transportation efficiency, safety, and fiscal responsibility. These harmful elements include:\nIncreased Traffic Congestion: By discouraging cycling as an alternative mode of transport, the bill could lead to more cars on the road and greater congestion.\nSafety Concerns: Removing protected bike lanes could result in more fatal accidents by making cycling less safe and less accessible.\nLocal Autonomy: The bill undermines municipalities' ability to implement tailored solutions for mobility, reflecting politically motivated opposition to cyclists rather than practical policy.\nEconomic Waste: Removing well-used bike lanes, such as those in Toronto, would squander taxpayers' money\u2014costing $48 million to remove, in addition to $27 million already spent building them and further expenses for alternatives.\nOpposition by Municipal Leaders: The Association of Municipalities of Ontario opposes the bill, emphasizing its misalignment with local needs and broader mobility goals.\nFor these reasons, I as a taxpayer strongly oppose the passage of Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I agree with removing bike lanes on major thoroughfares. In particular the Yonge St ones. How are emergency vehicles to get by when there is only one lane of traffic each way. Don\u2019t whatever you do have an emergency during rush hour!! Between development and the removal of traffic lanes it is very difficult to get around the city if you are a senior citizen. What percentage of the population is over 60?\nAs an aside I think closing the Bayview extension to north bound traffic south of River St was a big mistake. That street is the perfect north south thoroughfare for people to get from uptown to downtown without impeding anything as there is no retail and really no pedestrians. Really you should be able to etch out a bit more space to have bike lanes without having to remove a lane of traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Dear ministers,\nThis is one of the most horrific prices of legislation I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The removal of bike lanes is an insult to your constituency that would degrade peoples quality of life significantly for absolutely zero reason. Study after study shows that bike lanes benifits the environment, reduce traffic, improve the economy for local businesses, increase children\u2019s mobility, improve health, and so so much more.\nHowever that\u2019s not the worse thing this bill does, in fact this bill is simply a Trojan horse to create an Ontario that is permenanty addicted to cars and urban sprawl. Sprawl that in an era of fiscal insecurity Municipalities cannot afford. Sprawl which will increase traffic even more because how many times does any with a single once of common sense have to inform this government that the definition of insanity is doing that same thing over and over again and expecting different results. If there are already 28 lanes on the 401 and it has the worst traffic in North America maybe it\u2019s time for a different approach rather than a ridiculous tunnel that will bankrupt us and accomplish nothing. Not to mention all the negative environmental and climate impacts of this bill.\nIn conclusion ,please kill the bill or this will be part of what ends this government come next election.\n"

        "comment": "I see grid-locked traffic on all the streets regardless of whether there is a bike lane. So clearly it is NOT the bike lanes that are the cause of increased congestion. The source is that there are too many cars and the majority of the cars have only 1 occupant. The bike lanes are a viable part of the solution. Imagine if all those cyclists took up driving, how much more of an issue of car traffic congestion there would be not to mention that when they get to their destination they will be all fighting for limited parking spaces. Cyclists have voluntarily opted out of the option to drive. What part have the drivers done to become part of the solution to traffic?\n"

        "comment": "My daughter is a professional cyclist who has represented Canada on the national team for years. She just quit at only 22 years of age and despite being Canada's top ranked domestic pro racer and I couldn't be more relieved. The greatest catalyst was the impossibility of training in Ontario. She has multiple incidents a day that make her fear for her safety and make us believe that purely on the numbers a serious road incident caused by inattention, road rage, malicious drivers, or just poor infrastructure was inevitable. In addition, one of her best friends and training partners (a tenured pro and one of Canada's brightest stars in the sport) was recently hit by a car, nearly died, spent almost a week in a coma and is now coping with permanent, non-recoverable, debilitating results. She's just 22 and the number of people she knows who have been killed or injured in this way is shocking.\nThis law is nuts. Any urban planner or expert in transportation infrastructure will tell you it just won't help. And many more will die because of it. And for what? to score cheap political points? To drive us into american-style polarization?\nMy family is Dutch and here is something that will never happen: a Northern European coming to Ontario and saying 'wow your highways and travel infrastructure is amazing!'. They look at our car centric approach and think we are simply crazy.\nThe research is pretty clear her to my knowledge:\n- active transportation is good for communities - in the near term and the long term\n- injuries and deaths in Ontario are common and severe\n- cycling infrastructure can promote healthy, active transportation that is safe and well-used\n- removing cycling infrastructure and adding lanes to existing transportation systems (over transit or active transpo) will clearly not help to ease congestion in the long-run and may very likely come with serious health risks\nI've voted conservative most of my life but this bill sickens me.\n"

        "comment": "- In dense urban areas, cars are limited by space they take up - a 3.5m wide lane can only carry 1500-2000 people per hour.  To reduce grid lock, we have to shift the amount of space allocated to cars to other modes of transport. (see TUMI link).  A similar amount of space allocated to bicycles could carry 12000 people per hour.\n- Bike lanes in dense areas encourage bike use, and relieves traffic congestion (see THE ROLE OF WALKING AND CYCLING IN REDUCING CONGESTION)\nFrom personal experience:\n- I have commuted from Yonge/Sheppard to King/Bay by bike.  It's a fast way to get around that avoids traffic\n- In speaking with peers, the safety aspect deters them from cycling in urban areas.  Bicycle lanes would allow more of them to use bikes rather than their cars\n- In speaking with family in Montreal, bike lanes introduced there have enabled them to safely commute by bike, which they would not have done previously\n- From observations travelling, large cities that successfully move people around have never achieved this by allocating more space to cars\n"

Cycling infrastructure is developed following rigorous evaluation processes that consider location, design, construction, and funding within the unique context of each project. These routes are proposed by professional planners, engineers, and related experts, guided by municipally adopted plans and strategies that align with Official Plans and Transportation Master Plans. They help keep people--whether they are cyclists, pedestrians, or drivers--safe.\nPlease directed your government's time and money into fixing the health care, housing, or climate crises.

At least bikes still get people moving through those streets, which is the main objective of a street anyways (to get someone from point A to point B). If main-road parking is removed, you\u2019ll get back your lane at a much cheaper cost than tearing up the road yet again.\nKeep the bike lanes as is and focus on better planning in the future.\nThank you\n"

You could be cleaning the air in our schools and keeping our children  healthier and safer.

        "comment": "Bill 212's provision requiring provincial approval of municipal bike lane installation and permitting the province to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue in Toronto is wrong for many reasons:\n1.\tMore cyclists will die because they will be forced to ride in traffic with cars.\n2.\tTo battle climate change \u2013 and particularly in the old City of Toronto \u2013 we need to get more people out of cars and onto bikes or sidewalks. It does not make sense for the provincial government to enact policies that make it easier for automobiles to access the core of the city. Streets that are friendlier for pedestrians, for active transport and for the air that we breathe are the way to go.\n3.\tBike lanes improve commute times for car drivers. It gets bicycles out of car lanes and takes some cars off the road as people take up cycling who were previously deterred because of the dangers of cycling in car lanes. Premier Ford and his Transport Minister have claimed bike lanes slow automobile commute times without providing evidence. In fact, the explosion of bicycle and e-bike based delivery services in the city means one of two things: 1.) hundreds of people will lose their jobs, and hundreds of thousands of consumers and businesses will be inconvenienced as bike-based delivery becomes unviable, or 2.) there will be more accidents and automobile travel will be slowed further, and hundreds of thousands of consumers and businesses will be inconvenienced as bike-based delivery services are forced back into car lanes.\n4.\tTearing up existing lanes is a waste of taxpayer money. At least leave existing lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue in place.\n5.\tIt is yet another encroachment by the Ford government on municipal jurisdiction.\nGovernment politicians frequently cite a statistic that only about 1% in Toronto ride bikes to work, but there are other measures. Taking just the City of Toronto (rather than the \u201ccensus metropolitan area\u201d that the 1% statistic is based on, about 2% use a bike as their main mode of commuting and 3.8% commute to work by bike sometimes. But not all cyclists are commuters. The latest (2016) Transportation Tomorrow Survey that the Ministry of Transport helps conduct shows that 26% of households in the old City of Toronto either bike or walk regularly (the two were grouped as one category).\nThe data show, as with so many things, that behaviours (and the appropriate policy responses) are not the same in the City of Toronto as elsewhere.\nI just spent some time visiting major cities in Europe. Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels \u2013 everywhere, I saw well built out cycling infrastructure and high use rates. Against the argument that those cities don\u2019t face our harsh winters, Scandinavian cities like Oslo and Stockholm also rank highly for cycling friendliness.\nSurely, Ontario does not want to go backwards on cycling infrastructure. Surely, we want to look to a future where there are fewer cars on the roads causing gridlock and pollution and more people safely riding clean, community-building bicycles.\nLeave decisions about cycling infrastructure in the hands of municipalities that know local needs best. And hands off the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University!\n"
