This bill, which will get rid of bike lanes and make them harder to implement, is an extremely temporary and shortsighted solution to our congestion and environmental issues. Please look at how other global cities have addressed these issues with a long-term plan to reduce car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make the city more accessible and safe, especially for people with low income that cannot afford cars or to use transit daily. I also feel, as a driver, that it is far more dangerous to drive on a road without bike lanes - people will be cycling regardless, and the risk of hitting a cyclist on a busy street is way amplified without proper lanes. We need to focus on making the streets of Toronto MORE accessible, not less.\n"

It is incredibly frustrating that at times there is actually no good route. Having fewer cars on the road makes biking the solution not the problem. Removing bike lanes will put blood on the hands of city counselors and is an incredible idiotic waste or the tax payers' money.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI have a number of reasons why I oppose this bill.\nThe first and foremost one, though, is related to democracy. This bill makes me feel like as a citizen I have had fundamental rights taken away. If I go to the effort to vote for a particular mayoral candidate because I support their policies but a higher level of government can just completely nullify my vote by doing whatever they want in a municipally why would I ever bother to vote? I feel like my voice has been completely silenced. This feels like an authoritarian move especially given that there is no actual data proof that this would solve the stated problem.\nThe second one is that, as a person who has to get around by car for health reasons, I really want cyclists NOT riding in traffic with cars. It is so much safer and comfortable for everyone to have cyclists separated.\nThird, as cities grow it is not possible for everyone to get around by cars. There must be alternative ways to travel and cities around the world show that adding cycling into the mix works out for moving people, for environmental issues, promotes  healthy exercise, etc.\nFourth, data shows that bike lanes are not the greatest negative impact on car traffic. There are clearly other things that can be done.\nFifth, to take out lanes that have already been installed is a huge waste of taxpayer\u2019s money in a time when there are competing needs for those dollars.\nAnd lastly, to get back to my first point, this is a municipal issue and should be decided by the voters in the municipalities in which they live.\n"

Bike lanes should not be your priority!\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr. Premier,\nBill 212.  It\u2019s not much of a vision you\u2019re offering the citizens of Ontario, of which I\u2019m one. Your recent TV add promoting Ontario shows us life in an ever expanding low density single family suburb somewhere at the end of a mind numbing car drive to somewhere else, no one can bear or afford.  In this dream we get to use the fabulous convenience of our many cars for all our trips. This vignette skips past the fact that parents are terrified to let their children out to play.  Witness the latest killing last week of a 13 year old girl as she took her bike across  a cross walk in Ajax, run over by an in attentive driver of an over scaled SUV.  Current studies indicate that two thirds of Canadians including children are over weight or obese.   There are lots of reasons.  One is urban design.  In the car-centric settlements you are so committed to, parents are certain their children will be killed by their neighbours.  And of course they are not wrong.  So no more road hockey, no more exploring where you live.  Just putting in time until you\u2019re 16.\nMr. Premier, leave the City alone.  If you have no province wide leadership ideas to offer then at least limit your concerns to your own suburban constituents.  Raise the speed limits, make alternate means of transportation illegal.  Have at it.  But leave the City of Toronto alone!!\nAnd begin by rescinding Bill 212!!!!!!!\n"

        "comment": "**Opposition to Bill 212 and Highway 413 Act, 2024**\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. After careful consideration, it is clear that this legislation fails to address its stated goal of reducing gridlock while introducing significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and public health.\nHighway 413, which is exempt from environmental assessments under this bill, will destroy crucial Greenbelt lands, including wetlands and farmland. These areas are vital for flood prevention, carbon storage, and biodiversity. Environmental Defence has reported that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of this protected land, irreparably harming our ecosystem. Exempting a project of this scale from proper oversight undermines the integrity of Ontario\u2019s environmental protections.\nFurthermore, the removal of bike lanes contradicts well-established principles of sustainable urban planning. Bike lanes improve traffic flow, promote safer streets, and reduce emissions by encouraging active transportation. They also provide economic benefits, as demonstrated by increased retail sales along bike-friendly corridors in Toronto. Removing this infrastructure will lead to more congestion and undermine local economies.\nThe financial cost of Highway 413, projected at over $8 billion, is another cause for concern. This money could be better spent on public transit, healthcare, and affordable housing\u2014areas that provide far greater economic and social returns. In short, Bill 212 prioritises costly, outdated solutions over modern, sustainable alternatives.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation. Ontario\u2019s future depends on bold, forward-thinking investments that prioritise environmental stewardship, public health, and fiscal responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "I don't think the removal of bike lanes will help with congestion. Bike lanes should remain a municipal decision making item and municipalities should not need to consult with the province. It seems to be a waste of time and money to unnecessarily add the province into the decision making. Municipalities are responsible levels of government and are equipped to make these types of local decisions. Further, cyclists and their lives should be protected. We should not be prioritizing use of vehicles in the citys core.\n"
