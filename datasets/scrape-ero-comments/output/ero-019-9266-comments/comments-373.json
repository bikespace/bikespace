There is a website cycleto that has already gathered 16 thousand signatures with people who support bike lanes. Take your hands off from what cities are supposed to do. If you want to make our life better then invest in health care, roads, public transit. Take a look at the map of Toronto subway, no wonder why traffic is so bad.\n"

You all that vote for this legislation rake money in and simply cannot fathom that bike lanes reduce traffic, make streets safer. This is a step backward. If you pass this, I am done with this province, I will move to Quebec instead and will push all my close friends to move with me.\n"

It is nice to bike to the library or grocery store without risking my life in traffic.\nTaking out bike lanes will have the opposite effect on grid lock.  Even if half of bikers switch back to cars, traffic will surely be worse than today.\nIt is inconceivable that Toronto is trying to bring back the bygone Era where car was king. The rest of the world had moved on and is building pedestrian and bike friendly infrastructure to create a healthier and more livable city.\n"

        "comment": "I am in very strong support of this proposal.\nI encourage the government to order the removal of the bidirectional bike lanes on O'Connor street in Ottawa.  When turning left, to head south, it is unbelievably dangerous for both bikes and cars- bikes coming from either direction but cars only from one, plus pedestrians.\nBikes should not be forced on the population as a primary mode of transportation in a northern climate.  Furthermore, a bike is not a reasonable option for us, as parents, who need to stop their children at daycare 5km in the opposite direction of work in the morning.  Bike lanes are for wealthy, able bodied, white people who don't have young children.  They do not serve the average family.\nThank you.\n"

I know personally I cycle for most errands and commuting but did not when there were not separated bike lanes to make it safe. Business groups have said they are good for business. If you want to reduce congestion buy back the 407, get the Eglinton crosstown open, remove street parking from busy roads and aggressively ticket those who block the box or pullover where they shouldnt\n"

The grid lock along Bloor West in Etobicoke is ridiculous and we hardly see a bike on the road during the summer months let alone the winter months .  Comprehensive, thorough and thoughtful research with common sense needs to be employed when implementing bike lanes.  We are not a small European city with mild European weather.  Thank you for taking action   It is an embarrassment that Toronto is now The Worst City in the World for grid lock. This is not what we want to be known for\n"

        "comment": "\u201cIn Canada during 2022, 294 pedestrians, 46 cyclists, 258 motorcyclists, 316 passengers, and 952 drivers died in collisions. There were 8,851 serious injuries from collisions, including pedestrians (15 per cent), cyclists (5 per cent), motorcyclists (13 per cent), passengers (17 per cent) and drivers (47 per cent). As of Oct. 9 this year in Toronto, 16 pedestrians, six cyclists, three motorcyclists and 10 motorists have been killed by traffic-related trauma. Every fatality is the loss of a person, someone who loved and was loved.\nAmong survivors, the horrific consequences of motor vehicles hitting pedestrians, cyclists and people in other vehicles are difficult to imagine. Brain injuries that fundamentally change personalities, memories and cognition; torn spinal cords that commit people to lifelong ventilatory support; scars from surgeries; post-traumatic stress disorder from both the trauma and the care required to help people survive. These patients spend weeks and months in hospital, and often never return to work or school.\u201d\n"

Furthermore it should be up to each individual city to decide where bike lanes make sense rather than the province. Centralizing this responsibility will only create bottlenecks in the review process. Thus Ford is hampering the process of reducing gridlock rather than facilitating it.\nLastly shouldn't the decision be made based on a politically independent study rather than on the whim of a politician ?\n"

        "comment": "Bike Lanes Hold the Future for Toronto\nPlease don't remove the Toronto bike lanes! I have lived in Toronto my entire life. My husband and I have six children who all attended UofT. Several of them biked to the university daily from our home near at Mt. Pleasant and Eglinton. It was great exercise and very fast. The problem they faced was drivers not wanting to share the road.\nMy son bikes from his home  near Bayview and Eglinton every day to go to work at King and Bay. With the bike lanes in place, he can do this safely. I love my son as does his wife and two small children. As a mother, I worry that if you remove the bike lanes, his commute to downtown Toronto will not be as safe as it is now.\nToronto is an amazing city that is for everyone, not just cars!  Removing the bike lanes is a step backwards and makes the city favour cars over people. Bike lanes are the future of every large city in the world. They encourage exercise and are a great way for people to get around.\nPlease don't take our bike lanes away. I couldn't bear it if I lost my son; he will continue to bike to work with or without the bike lanes. This city is a better place to live with roads being shared by cars and bicycles!\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI would like to highlight the bike lanes on Dundas St East in Regent Park, in Toronto, specifically between Parliament and Broadview. This stretch of road was once a two lane road in either direction. It is also a streetcar route.\nThis stretch of road is periodically thick with gridlock. I have witnessed many situations where emergency vehicles have to navigate with some difficulty through the traffic, and evidently take longer time to respond to their call. The road also has an entrance to the Don Valley Parkway, and it's a major throughway to many of the city's downtown hospitals.\nHaving bike lanes along both Dundas St East and Shuter St one block south seems like an inefficient use of our roads.\n"

Cyclists will still be present on roads and actually cause more congestion because they will not have a dedicated space.  It will make roads more chaotic and dangerous.\nCongestion is an issue in Toronto.  The government is obviously avoiding the clear issue, which is allowing developers to clog up roads endlessly while doing their work, a lack of reliable public transport to encourage people to leave their cars at home as is done in all major cities around the world.  Those cities, incidentally, are all expanding their cycling networks, not dismantling them.\n"

Adding more cars, or more bikes in mixed traffic flow, will only make things worse.\nWorld class cities are diversifying transportation options and IMPROVING biking infrastructure.\nStay in your lane and these decisions to the City, which undertook careful planning prior to implemention.\nFurther the idea of wasting so much city to make the City districting worse is appalling.\n"

In the cities transportation master plan there are plans to remove traffic lanes on several major commuter roads that are already overflowing with traffic (St. Joseph Blvd in orleans is one) and these projects need to be stopped asap.\nIt\u2019s a relief to finally see some common sense from government regarding road development.  I\u2019d also like to see some legislation that forces municipalities to prove that each speed camera they install lowers accident rates (like in Alberta) because right now it certainly seems like all they do is generate revenue.\n"
