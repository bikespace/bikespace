        "comment": "This bill will be a detriment to my life and those of so many I know. Protected, uninterrupted bike lines like the one on Bloor Street are the only places I feel comfortable biking in the city, where congestion and reckless driving pose a real risk to cyclists. Every time I bike on a downtown street without one I brush up against cars and fear for my safety. Allowing for safe bike commuting promotes healthy lifestyles and helps to fight climate change - something very important to me as a young Ontarian who's terrified that I will never get to have children, or that my children will inherit a dying world. To that end, paving over areas of the protected Greenbelt with Highway 413 will pose a risk to our drinking water, to endangered species, and to flood mitigation in the GTA. It is uneccessary and costly.\nIt is irresponsible and callous of the Ontario government to interfere in the jurisdiction of municipalities. Torontonians and our representatives vehemently oppose eliminating bike lanes, and our choices should remain ours.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed framework requiring the removal of sections of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto, as well as the broader authority to review and remove existing bike lanes and to regulate future bike lane installations. This proposal undermines evidence-based urban planning, local decision-making, and sustainable transportation goals.\n1. Governance and Local Decision-Making\nThe proposal represents a concerning overreach into municipal governance. Decisions regarding local infrastructure, including bike lanes, should remain with municipalities, which are better positioned to assess and address the transportation needs of their communities.\nGranting the province the authority to override local bike lane decisions sets a dangerous precedent. It risks politicizing infrastructure development and undermines the principle of subsidiarity, whereby decisions are made at the level closest to the affected community. Toronto has conducted thorough consultations and implemented bike lanes as part of an evidence-based approach to reduce congestion and improve mobility. This provincial overreach disregards that effort and undermines the autonomy of local governments.\n2. Evidence-Based Decision-Making and Long-Term Impacts on Congestion\nThe argument that removing bike lanes will alleviate congestion lacks supporting evidence. Numerous studies have shown that bike lanes:\n- Reduce traffic congestion: By encouraging cycling, bike lanes decrease the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes will likely result in more vehicles, exacerbating congestion.\n- Improve efficiency of road use: Bikes take up far less space than cars, allowing more people to move efficiently through urban areas.\nThere is no substantial data demonstrating that returning bike lanes to motor vehicle traffic will lead to long-term congestion relief. In contrast, evidence consistently shows that infrastructure encouraging alternative modes of transport reduces overall traffic volumes.\n3. Cycling as a Key Component of Transportation Systems\nCycling infrastructure is a cost-effective and sustainable way to meet growing transportation demands:\n- Cheaper and healthier transportation: Cycling is not only an affordable mode of travel but also contributes to healthier populations, reducing healthcare costs in the long term.\n- Economic benefits: Cyclists are active contributors to local economies. Studies have shown that cyclists tend to spend more per trip at local businesses compared to drivers.\n- Environmental benefits: Cycling infrastructure aligns with the province\u2019s commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.\nRemoving bike lanes contradicts these objectives, increasing reliance on cars and worsening air quality and emissions.\n4. The Costs of Removing Bike Lanes\nThe removal of bike lanes would be a costly and counterproductive exercise:\n- Financial costs: Removing existing bike lanes and restoring the road for vehicle traffic will require significant taxpayer funding, which could be better invested in improving infrastructure.\n- Public health costs: Eliminating bike lanes discourages active transportation, increasing public health burdens associated with inactivity, such as obesity and heart disease.\n5. Cyclists are Taxpayers and Residents\nCyclists are not a niche interest group; they are taxpayers and residents who rely on safe infrastructure to commute, shop, and contribute to their communities. Decisions about infrastructure should reflect the needs of all road users, not prioritize one mode of transport to the detriment of others.\n---\nRecommendations\nI urge the Ontario government to:\n1. Respect municipal autonomy: Leave decisions about bike lanes to local governments, which have the expertise and stakeholder input necessary to make informed decisions.\n2. Use evidence-based criteria: Ensure that all transportation decisions, including those about bike lanes, are based on comprehensive studies and data demonstrating their long-term impacts on congestion, the environment, and public health.\n3. Invest in sustainable transportation: Focus on enhancing cycling and public transit infrastructure, which provide scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solutions to urban mobility challenges.\n4. Avoid expensive removal projects: Prioritize spending on projects that deliver measurable benefits to Ontarians, rather than costly and counterproductive bike lane removals.\nThe proposed framework fails to account for the demonstrated benefits of cycling infrastructure and risks setting Ontario back in achieving sustainable and equitable urban transportation. I urge the government to reconsider this proposal in favor of policies that promote local decision-making, evidence-based planning, and the long-term well-being of all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I have concerns that there has been no technical feasibility assesment conducted to determine the traffic flows after the removal of bike lanes. Can this information be published for the public to understand the current traffic flow and potential removal of bike lanes?\nFrom an economic perspective, can we have statistics provided to demonstrate the economic impacts resulting from cyclist activity? Other media outlets have inquired about these statistics through the City of Toronto.\nHas public consultation been conducted to understand a vsriety of public's opinions? How can the overall transportation network improve to encourage less transit usage? How does the removal of bike lanes feed into province's expansion of transit facilities?\nHow does the removal of bicycle lanes respond to the new Provincial Planning Statement which supports the use of multimodal transportation within MTSAs? These bike lanes are each within an MTSA which benefits from a variety of transportation options, rather than solely focusing on one form of mobility.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential part of city infrastructure; removing them would be a grievous mistake.\nFirst and foremost, bike lanes save lives by reducing opportunities for drivers to strike and injure or kill cyclists. This should be reason enough to leave them be.\nSecond, removing these bike lanes will not improve gridlock. There are countless studies showing that bike lanes ease congestion, as well as that adding additional car lanes makes congestion worse (there is so, so much data on this latter point, from cities all over the world - widening roads and highways makes traffic worse, full stop). To suggest that removing these bike lanes will improve gridlock is to ignore the facts and misdirect the blame. Cyclists don't cause traffic - motorists do. Cyclists also don't exist in a vacuum: removing our safe access to the roads will force many of us into other means of transport. In many cases, this will mean getting back into cars, which will create more traffic.\nThird, spending ~48 million taxpayer dollars to rip up these lanes (many of which are newly installed), against the wishes of the government the people of Toronto have entrusted to manage our city, is a ludicrous waste of money and an insult to voters.\nToronto, like every major city with a dense population, needs a variety of safe and accessible transportation options in order to thrive. Cars are the most expensive and least efficient means of transportation in a city (not to mention the most dangerous and the worst for the environment). Simply put, they take up a lot of space and money and move fewer people, more slowly, than bikes or trains. The only way to solve gridlock is to make it easier for people to choose not to drive. Bike lanes are just one of many ways of doing this, but removing them is absolutely a step in the wrong direction.\nWalking back the progress we have made in improving cycling infrastructure makes our city worse. And again, most importantly, people are going to die because of this decision.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this policy is deeply misguided.\nAs a motorist, I like bike lanes. When cyclists have designated areas, I don't have to worry about running them over. Providing designated areas for cyclists removes a huge distraction and potential hazard from the road. Bike lanes make driving safer and easier.\nIt is important to remember that cities are more than just laneways for motorists and truckers. Cyclists are part of the community as well, are also trying to \"get around\", and deserve safe infrastructure.\nEven if cost and logistics prevent installing new lanes, removing existing bike lanes is a needless expense and an unnecessary inconvenience, as construction equipment block traffic even further.  It will certainly make cycling more dangerous in these areas, and will certainly lead to deaths.\nAgain, I speak as a motorist, and do not look forward to sharing the road with cyclists again.\nI ask the government to reconsider these proposals, and seek other ways of relieving traffic congestion.\nThank you,\n"

        "comment": "My name is Victor, I live in downtown Toronto on College Street near Bathurst.\nI am strongly opposed to Bill 212 and am voicing that opposition here with evidence.\nI am a driver and also a cyclist. As a driver, I have no issues with bike lanes. As a cyclist, these lanes keep me safe, reduce my emissions, and allow me to access local businesses quickly and efficiently. I've lived in Toronto for most of my life and my experience in this city shows me that cycling is by far the most efficient way to move through Toronto, year round.\nRemoving bike lanes will not reduce automobile traffic and will certainly lead to more collisions on our streets.\nThere is plenty of evidence that demonstrates that more cycling infrastructure keeps people safe and moves more people through the city. Cycling infrastructure leads to more cycling adoption. Putting more cyclists into cars is not going to help traffic congestion.\nThe Bloor Street Bike Lane Pilot Project in Toronto resulted in a significant increase in cycling volumes. Before the installation of the bike lanes, the average daily cyclist count was approximately 3,300. After the implementation, this number rose to about 4,900 cyclists per day, marking a 49% increase.\nThe installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street has led to increased customer visits and spending, with businesses reporting a rise in the number of customers served and visitors arriving by foot or bicycle spending more than those arriving by car according to this TCAT study: https://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bloor-Economic-Impact-St\u2026\nFurthermore, the Bloor Street bike lanes did not reduce the number of traffic lanes for cars! The amount of lanes remain the same in Toronto.\nBike lanes keep Torontonians safe, move more people, reduce emissions, stimulate economic activity, and encourage exercise.\nBeyond bike lanes, I am opposed to Bill 212 for the following reasons:\nFirst, I\u2019m deeply frustrated about what this bill will do to the environment. It speeds up the approval process for projects like Highway 413, but in doing so, it skips important steps to protect nature. Cutting corners like this could lead to significant damage to our wetlands, farmland, and citizens. We need to protect our natural spaces, not destroy them for the sake of more highways that don\u2019t necessarily solve traffic problems.\nSecond, the bill takes control away from cities when it comes to modifying their roads. This is ridiculous red-tape and a huge overstep by the provincial government. It's also counter to the conservative premise of \"small government.\"\nThird, this bill will cost us money\u2014lots of it. Toronto estimates it could cost taxpayers around $75 million just to follow the rules in this bill. That\u2019s money that could be better spent on public transit, community projects, or improving existing infrastructure instead of jumping through unnecessary hoops.\nFinally, Bill 212 could hurt public health. By discouraging cities from building bike lanes, it forces more people into cars, adding to traffic, increasing pollution, and taking away opportunities for people to stay active. We need fewer cars on the road, not more. Encouraging cycling is one way to do that, but this bill stands in the way.\nIn the end, this bill does so much more harm than good. It claims to reduce gridlock and save us time, but it sacrifices our environment, increases our costs, and limits healthier and more efficient transportation options. I can\u2019t stand by while such short-sighted decisions are made at the expense of our future.\n"

The less intimidating bicycle travel is, the more it will be embraced........build it and they will come!\n"

        "comment": "There is no way this bill should pass as it stands now. The only real way to actually solve the issue of too many cars on the road causing traffic issues is to reduce the number of cars on the road. By having things bike lanes, more affordable public transit, and a rail system throughout the province.\nWe don't need more highways (especially plowed through vulnerable land). Accidents would be reduced by less vehicles on the road, not by allowing more places (lanes) for them to happen in.\nTying in bringing broadband access to rural communities on this bill is also seems exploitative (in a \"we'll do this for you only if..\" type of way).\nThis bill also reeks of governmental overreach. You require municipalities to petition the provincial government to change roads within there own boundaries. How is this productive, how does this save money, time, or resources?\nI thought that conservatives were supposed to stand for things like small government (not interfering with city planning at the provincial level) and actually you know, conserving the environment.\n"

Fewer people would need to drive if good, reliable transit was available to them. We would also be reducing our collective climate footprint.\nThe provincial Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria, would do well to turn his attention to solving some of the problems inhibiting the delivery of effective public transit.\nThe Eglington Crosstown, after 13 years, has no completion date.\nThe people in Scarborough are facing years without decent transit while a new Scarborough Subway extension is being built.\nThe TTC is limping along through lack of funding from the province.\nThe service on many of the bus route is inadequate.\nWe need a vision for the  future and not to take giant steps backwards by removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and mostly drive, but also like to get around the city by bike. My kids also like biking, and thanks to the new bike lanes they can safely get around.\nMain streets in the old city of Toronto were already effectively 1 lane in each direction. Even though Bloor or Yonge used to have 2 lanes each way, one lane was always blocked by someone parking, stopping or turning. The bike lanes actually made driving easier, I no longer had to guess if someone was making a left turn since it allowed the city to have dedicated turning lanes at intersections.\nAfter the bike lanes were installed, I also didn't have to worry about a car suddenly parking in the right lane, since there was only one lane and everyone drives. The only spot to park is the new designated parking spots. Anyone who spends time downtown knows the main streets in old Toronto are a little different than the suburbs, the right lane is always blocked by parking (Iegaly or illegally) and before bike lanes there wasn't a designated left turn lane. Anyone could stop traffic by turning left. Traffic flow seemed to improve and be more predictable after the bike lane installation.\nAlso, when I need to be at a meeting on time, biking is the only reliable way to get on time. You never know what traffic is going to be like by car with all the construction. Public transit is unreliable. Destroying the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor or University isn't going to fix that, those lanes were already just parking/stopping lanes. Yonge and Bloor were already effectively one lane streets before the bike lane installation.\n"

        "comment": "I don't see any evidence that removing bike lanes helps reduce congestion. If anything, it adds more traffic to that street as well as nearby streets. If you increased number of lanes on Bloor to 2, have you thought about the impact to roads feeding into and out of it? Why not focus on improving quality of public transit infrastructure like adding express trains along bloor or adding more transit connecting to bloor subway?\nAs a counter point, I live in Mississauga near Mavis and 403 where there are 3 lanes of traffic in each direction, and there's always traffic. Rather than trying to fit more cars onto the streets, how about making our cities more livable and less car dependent? The drive from heartland to Dundas along Mavis on any evening goes at 20 km/h on average based on the distance and the time it takes. These type of trips would be much better served with a subway. If things got built closer together in Mississauga with less space used for roads and parking lots, I'd be riding my bike to get around too. I envy that it's an option in Toronto.\nPlease stop making me have to drive everywhere.\n"

Cyclists displaced by the removal of bike lanes will turn to private cars because of induced demand, which will just make traffic lanes more congested. THIS WILL NOT HELP WITH GRIDLOCK. Research by Canadian (and global!) institutes show that bike lanes decrease traffic speeds, make roads safer for pedestrians, and reduces emissions.\nNot to mention the years of construction that it took to get us here in the first place. Why is the city going backwards?\nI am not a cyclist, but many of my loved ones rely on bike lanes as their primary mode of transport, and Bloor, Yonge, University are popular routes. Unsafe experiences with the TTC and the high cost of car maintenance in the city make biking a cheap and efficient option for Toronto residents. Removing bike lanes actively harms Toronto residents and does NOT put our needs first. This is a highly disappointing bill and I vehemently urge the city to reconsider.\n"
