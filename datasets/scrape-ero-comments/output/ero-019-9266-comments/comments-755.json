        "comment": "My family and I are very troubled by Bill 212, specifically as it relates to bicycle lanes. We are a family of five (including 2 adults, 2 kids and 1 disabled adult) who live near Bloor Street and we all use the Bloor bike path every single day. We were thrilled when it was built, and we will be utterly devastated if it is ripped out. Bloor is not a highway or a simple thoroughfare for commuters. It contains communities, businesses, and most importantly people. All along Bloor Street there are vibrant villages, full of shops and services used daily by many, including many cyclists. Everyone has the right to access these communities and services and to use these routes safely. I am deeply disturbed by the divisiveness of this bill. We are not anti-car. We also drive. But we choose to bike daily around the city because it is a healthy, environmentally friendly, and genuinely enjoyable mode of transport, when it is safe. In fact, contrary to this Bill\u2019s suggestion, our choice to cycle reduces pollution and congestion in the city, as it is one less car on the road. If the government really cares about reducing congestion and creating a safe environment for all, they should focus on completing the public transit projects they are responsible for, not removing bike lanes. Let the city decide what is best for the city and its people. We are not going to stop cycling. And, forcing us and our children out into traffic will not improve congestion; it will only make our roads less safe for everyone. The manner in which the government is pitting cyclists and drivers against each other with this divisive rhetoric and this problematic legislation is deeply troubling, treating us wrongly as if we are enemies working at cross-purposes. It also makes us feel less safe already. For our family, we want to live in a safe, healthy, vibrant community, and not on a highway or in a parking lot. This means fostering safe transportation options for all, including bike lanes.\n"

INCREASE the bike lanes.\nThe key to ELIMINATING GRIDLOCK is to unabashedly INVEST in FREE and ACCESSIBLE public transportation.\nPlease use your imaginations <3 I promise I'm not being condescending. The only way out of the post-apocalyptic  city scape is to design streets for PEOPLE and NOT for PROFIT.\nThink of the Solar Punk Architecture Movement... we can design cityscapes that are accessible, aesthetically pleasing and most of all, that seamlessly support the nature and land we are on. Our city is congested with cars, concrete and ugly highways. We can re-design Tkaronto to fit CURRENT needs for more greenery, higher quality air and more free and affordable housing. The money that would be used to destroy bikelanes can be used instead to plant more trees and add medicine gardens with native plants around Tkaronto.\nConsider WHO is in the room making these decisions... Remember the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action... Settlers CANNOT be the only ones making these decisions, especially one with such devastating consequences. #LandBack\nT&R Call to Action #45.iii: Renew or establish Treaty relationships based on principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect, and shared responsibility for maintaining those relationships into the future.\nMunicipal government leaders can build relationships with local and regional Indigenous organizations and leaders to open space for conversation on issues of mutual interest.\n"

        "comment": "I submitted this comment:\nOntario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212 because it will not reduce gridlock and will waste Ontario tax payers money. Highway 413 will cost billions and will not improve the commute times of Ontarians (does anyone in this government understand the basic concept of induced demand?). Removing bike lanes will cost millions and will make drivers and pedestrians less safe in all cities across the province. Doug Ford is not the mayor of our cities and towns and should not be overriding our municipal government's decisions. Torontonians overwhelmingly support bike lanes. Mississauga residents had bike lanes on the ballot and elected a candidate who supported them. If Ontario is serious about reducing congestion, it would improve transit, give people alternate transportation methods, and reform driver education and licensing requirements.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, as it is written, will not resolve the issues it claims to set out to fix. The only purpose it serves is to further worsen the problem while funneling taxpayer dollars into private pockets.\nBike lanes do not worsen traffic, and it has been shown time and again that removing them, as well as adding more highways, do nothing to actually solve traffic problems. All this does is worsen our overall reliance on cars, thereby increasing our pollution and climate issues. Not to mention the impact on greenbelt spaces that would be appropriated for this purpose as well.\nIt is blatantly irresponsible and a borderline hostile act to follow several parts of this proposal, especially attempting to make Highway 413 exempt from environmental impact assessments. Given the current state of our planet and rapidly worsening climate change, we should be increasing restrictions and more carefully assessing the environmental impact of new developments, not skirting those regulations to make a quick buck. The attempt to expand through the greenbelt has already been stopped once before, and this is a blatantly disrespectful attempt to continue the trend, hidden behind the removal of bike lanes.\nIn regards to bike lanes, myself and many others rely on them to get to and from work and other locations. Their removal would not lessen traffic. Speaking from experience both as a driver and a pedestrian, the easiest way to reduce traffic would be to actually make it more feasible to travel without a car. The majority of slowdowns during busy times in Toronto and the surrounding area are due to vehicles stopping in no parking/no standing areas for various reasons. People with blatant disregard for the rules of the road are a far larger issue, and removing the bike lanes will not fix that.\nI will not disagree that congestion has become and remains a massive problem in our metropolitan areas. However, there are many possible solutions that are not as destructive to the environment or as hostile to pedestrians. We need to focus on less car-centric infrastructure, and fast, before we have nowhere left to go without having to be in a vehicle. I would like to see the province spend more time focusing on actual long-term solutions to these problems, instead of tearing up existing projects and wasting money on bandaid solutions that will ultimately only worsen things.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern about the proposal to remove bike lanes and impose greater challenges on the development of new ones in Toronto. As a resident, I rely on bike lanes not only for my daily commute to work but also to enjoy recreational rides around the city with my children.\nCycling has been a blessing for me and my family, offering a way to incorporate exercise into a busy schedule while fostering a deeper connection to our city. My children love biking, but the most difficult part of cycling with them is navigating areas without adequate infrastructure. The fear of unsafe roads deters many of my friends and colleagues from taking up cycling, even though they acknowledge its benefits. Expanding\u2014rather than removing\u2014bike lanes would encourage more people to choose this sustainable and healthy mode of transportation.\nThe City of Toronto has made commendable progress in improving its cycling infrastructure, leading to a noticeable increase in the number of cyclists. This aligns with broader societal goals, such as reducing traffic congestion, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving public health. Studies consistently show that cities with robust bike lane networks experience reduced air pollution, fewer road accidents, and increased local business activity, as cyclists often shop locally.\nRemoving bike lanes risks undoing this progress and undermining Toronto\u2019s reputation as a forward-thinking, sustainable city. Instead of moving backward, we should be investing in infrastructure that supports safe, active transportation for all residents, including children, seniors, and newcomers to cycling.\nI urge the government to reconsider this proposal and to prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of Toronto\u2019s residents by maintaining and expanding bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The bill is based on baseless claims and incorrect data. The gridlock issues in Toronto are caused by a variety of reasons such as construction, the lack of development in public transit infrastructure. Blaming bike lanes for these broader infrastructural issues seems like a scapegoat. There is not much evidence that adding additional lates to an already stressed roadways will do little to reduce gridlock. As an Ontario resident and a regular commuter of public transit and user of biking infrastructure, I would appreciate if the government focuses their efforts on completion of already delayed public transit projects which would do way more than removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m very disappointed about the proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street. As someone who bikes along Bloor every day for my commute, the bike lanes are busy and well used by commuters in the city, including those on many types of mobility formats (bikes, e-bikes, scooters, etc.). They make cycling safer and more convenient, and they align perfectly with Ontario\u2019s goals for sustainability and reducing emissions. Why backtrack on that progress?\nTaking out these lanes doesn\u2019t just hurt cyclists\u2014it\u2019s going to create a mess for everyone. The construction alone will slow down traffic for months, maybe even longer, and once the bike lanes are gone, cyclists will be forced back into car traffic, making it less safe for everyone on the road. It feels like a step in the wrong direction when cities everywhere are trying to make active transportation easier, not harder.\nOntario has been clear about wanting to go greener and encourage active commuting, and bike lanes are a huge part of that. Getting rid of them feels short-sighted and counterproductive. I really hope the government rethinks this plan and focuses on improving, not removing, bike infrastructure. It\u2019s a win-win for the environment, traffic flow, and public health.\n"

Where there are no bike lanes, especially in inclement weather, bicyclists are forced onto sidewalks or walking pathways in an effort to protect themselves from aggressive vehicular traffic. Too many car and van drivers are unwilling to share \"THEIR\" space with bikes that they, mostly, see as a nuisance - SEE the PC Government's continuing attacks on bikes and bike lanes while lauding  cars/SUVs/vans and trucks of all sizes. These bike lanes ENSURE the safe, efficient and non-polluting transportation for all ages whether it is travelling to School [our most treasured resources], Work [our taxpayers] or Exercise and Enjoyment [a Healthy Lifestyle as recommended by ALL health providers]. However, this proposed backwards \"change\" will lead to unnecessary injuries [most probably, deaths] and major costs that will be passed on to Municipalities [that are reacting to the wishes/desires of their Constituents]. What will be the costs of expanding the roadways of Ontario for the car culture [ripping up the bike lanes that some nameless 'bureaucrat' has been \"ordered\" to identify as 'harmful to vehicular traffic'],  the construction of a new highway [413] that will run through prime farmland and. of course, the staggering \"dream\"/legacy project of a TUNNEL under a portion [for now] of the 401 all to save the commuters of the GTA anywhere from 2 to 5 MINUTES???
