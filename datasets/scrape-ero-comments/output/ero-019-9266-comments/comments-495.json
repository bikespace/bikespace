        "comment": "I am a parent in Ottawa with 2 school-aged children. Thanks to the bike lanes in my city, and the improvements to the bike network, including the increasing amount of safe / separated cycle tracks and multi-use pathways, i use my bike for the majority of daily trips by myself or with my kids, within 5 km from home - this includes getting to work, shopping, activities, recreation, etc. This means my family gets more time outdoors, engages positively with our community, shops our local businesses and saves money. I also own a car - we are a 1-car family. If I didn't use my electric cargo bike the way i do, we would need 2 cars which is a much greater expense. I want my children to have healthy, active and affordable transportation options when they are travelling to school, to see friends and to sports or other activities, allowing them to gain independence as they mature. Safe bike infrastructure makes this possible.\nThe above being said, removing bike lanes will endanger my life and those of my loved ones and members of my community. People like me will still choose to ride a bike for daily transportation, but it will be less safe. Also, many people who ride bikes to get around also own cars. More of us will choose to drive when the route is unsafe. I refer you to this letter by physicians opposed to this bill: https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\nResearch has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/traffic-jam-blame-in\u2026\nWe need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and encouraging people to bike is an important part of this reduction, especially in dense urban areas. I refer you to this important review on the health and environmental benefits of cycling in the Canadian Family Physician: https://www.cfp.ca/content/67/10/739. It is also essential to look at the success story of bike share in toronto over the last few years, thanks largely to an increasing network of safe bicycle lanes. : https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bike-share-toronto-ridership-rec\u2026 This has provided residents with an alternative transportation option that is afforddable, fast and safe. The more people who have such options, the less people in single occupancy vehicles causing congestion in vehicle lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money, and businesses will also suffer from reduced traffic. Study after study has shown that businesses on main streets over-estimate how many of their customers drive to their stores. There are many studies showing that bike lanes are good for business: https://streets.mn/2022/01/26/bikes-and-business-on-bloor/\nOntarians need more options to get around, not fewer.\nLastly, the Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities. Our cities (in my case Ottawa) have spent hours of staff time, community consultations, and millions of dollars investing in cycling infrastructure which is successfully leading to shifts in transportation mode. THis is my tax money that has gone to these profits, and if you suggest ripping it all out, my taxes will be used a second time and entirely wasted. This is fiscally irresponsible.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial overreach into, not even just municipal politics, but the witch hunt the premier has on Toronto, is a complete waste of taxpayer dollars, time and past efforts.\nI am a driver, a cyclist and a pedestrian. I believe there should be FEWER cars in the city, MORE bikes and those bikes should not be on the sidewalk. As someone with a small child who had to push a stroller on cramped sidewalks, alongside bikes, ebikes, motorized scooters, and more during almost a year long street construction, it is not only a nuisance, but it\u2019s dangerous. I had our stroller clipped, I\u2019ve had to quickly dive out of the way, and I\u2019ve been forced to wait while a long line of vehicles that belong on the road passed me by. Removing bike lanes will force these vehicles to either unsafely use the roads where they don\u2019t have a dedicated lane, or unsafely use sidewalks, putting pedestrians, especially less agile ones like the elderly and children, at risk.\nThat\u2019s not even mentioning the environment, since I know the current Ontario government does not give a shit about.\nThe solution is better public transit, more bike lanes (that are standardized and regulated) and fewer cars. As well as education for both drivers and cyclists on how to properly share the road.\nThis government does nothing but pander to Doug\u2019s rich suburban GTA buddies who need to drive their Lexuses to Bay Street. Worry about our healthcare and education or there won\u2019t be anyone left to use all these roads Ford cares so much about.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely opposed to this bill. It is an overreach of provincial authority. I believe that bike lanes, especially protected bike lanes, are critical urban infrastructure and that decision making about them should be in the hands of municipalities. I see no reason for the provincial government to interfere in municipal democratic process in this way. Bike lanes are essential for safety and an important part of municipal policy to combat climate change and traffic gridlock. In my neighbourhood, local businesses favour bike lanes as bringing more, not less business to them. Drop this bill, leave municipalities to make their own decisions on local matters, and provincially, do more to reduce motor vehicle traffic and protect people using bikes and people walking. Removing or reducing bike lanes is a backward approach.\n"

        "comment": "This removal of bike lanes is truly a waste of public funds and a gross over reach of provincial power into municipal matters. Ultimately it comes off as a person vendetta to get cars moving \u201cmore\u201d in the city. However it can\u2019t achieve that, there is no path to better car travel in a major city like toronto that isn\u2019t just \u201cmake better alternatives\u201d. One of those better alternatives was biking, large amounts of people doing that and NOT driving. If even a small percentage of those cyclists switch to driving, these extra lanes will be pointless, more pointless than they are to begin with. Overall a horrid move, costing us millions to rip up infrastructure, only to hope to built it a street across making side streets hell for everyone else.\n"

Individuals who cannot afford a car will not be able to navigate cities as easily and will be put at a disadvantage. Please do NOT remove bike lanes to prioritize automobile lanes, we have plenty and this is a step backward. Not to mention the increase in auto traffic will contribute to emissions and global warming.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI would like to add my opinion that the removal of bike lanes is a detriment to the experience of locals living in the Toronto city core, and broader than that, it will improve the experience of those visiting the city as well.\nNot only is Bill 212 a dangerous move for cyclists, it will not resolve the issue of gridlock and congestion on the roads.\nCycling is not only one of the fastest ways to get around the city, it IS the fastest way to get around the city. Out of necessity, I've become a citizen who utilizes their personal bike and Toronto Bike Share to get around the city in a fast and efficient manner. What makes me hesitant when cycling around is exactly what Bill 212 is suggesting. People, drivers specifically, in Toronto do not respect cyclists on Toronto roads, especially during peak traffic hours. There is plenty of erratic driving to go around, and from my perspective, it's a matter of WHEN and not IF I will eventually get hit by a vehicle or \"doored\" while cycling.\nThe bike lanes in Toronto provide a safe passage for those of us who want to get around the city in the most efficient way, and if anything it's a move of progression to be able to move people around the city faster.\nBike lanes bring more shoppers to local businesses, they keep people safe while navigating the roads, and they make Toronto a more lively place by encouraging people to get outside and enjoy what the city has to offer.\nIf anything, Toronto and the Ontario government should focus on increasing the safety of these passages and work on expanding the cycling networks to encourage different forms of transit. Because the thing I hear often when people are even considering biking around Toronto is that \"it's not safe enough\", \"there's not enough protected bike lanes\", and \"I don't want to get hit by a car\".\nPlease consider the vast research that has been done in this field, and take it to heart. There are plenty of developed cities in other countries that use cycling as a primary means of transportation and have developed cycling networks, and it has only a positive effect on the people living there. Roads are quieter, safer, less congested, and the culture of a city can thrive when the ways of getting around become equitable for its citizens.\nThank you for your consideration,\nRachelle\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge Stree and most importantly University Avenue have been a huge problem for allowing speedy movement of emergency vehicles. The surveys that I have seen that say otherwise appear to be very biased and flawed with special interests behind them. Not everyone is privileged to live within biking distance of their jobs, and transit does not reach a lot of places where people are forced to live because of price. We are not like European cities with good climate and small distances. TO think bikes are a solution when people must commute as much as over 100km to work defies common sense. We see the issues with our own eyes every day. It is particularly offensive to watch our money being spent that way, and then ultimately to see bikes still interefering with pedestrians on the sidewalk. Gridlock is bad for the economy. Building bike lanes will not get seniors on bikes, or mothers with children, etc. It is ridiculous that for less than 2% of the population we have added to gridlock that affects our quality of life and our economy on a daily basis. We need common sense solutions to gridlock - more spending on safer and better public transport - not expecting everyone to grab a bike instead! It is also elitist to think that most people could afford to live within biking distance of their work. Most cannot.\n"

        "comment": "It would seem that the premier is trying to insert himself as the mayor of every municipality in Ontario, instead of governing the provincial affairs. If he is so desperate to relive his glory days with his brother in the Toronto city council, perhaps he should step down and run for as councillor or mayor.\nIn a world where we are increasing noticing the effects of climate change (it was 20 degree in November), we should be encouraging the use of bike lanes and other modes of public transportation, instead of wasting public money to remove already existing bike lanes. Bike lanes are shown to have reduce congestion and obviously do not impact the environment as a car would. It would be fantastic if the premier and the minister of transportation would actually use facts, instead of spreading lies or using data from almost 30 years ago to justify their stupid decisions.\nBy removing these lanes, you are punishing bikers and putting their lives in greater risk. By removing these lanes, we are participating in wasteful spending by an already wasteful government. You are also punishing business owners who occupy spaces around these bike lanes. I thought Doug Ford was open for business?\nNot to mention that all of this seems to be a ploy to simply push along Doug Ford's highway 413 and help his developers buddies. Sure, let's remove destroy the greenbelt and push for a highway that no one wanted and the public adamantly pushed back on. Evidence shows that adding more highways will not fix traffic congestion. It will make it worse for everyone while also destroying the greenbelt, which is important for our environment, especially since we are experiencing higher rainfalls and increased likelihood of floods because of climate change.\nThe premier and minister of transportation should be working on improving out existing infrastructure for mass transit (perhaps like electrifying the go train lines, building more bike lanes and mass transit corridors. Instead of going after bikers, the greenbelt and ultimately drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing with a concern regarding Bill 212 and the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St, University Ave and Yonge St. As someone who is an avid biker in this city, I am aware of the usefulness of these bike lanes as they promote accessibility and ease of transport for many people in far reaches of the city.\nBike lanes are significant for equity of transit in this increasingly expensive city, where owning or renting a car and taking transit is unattainable for many folks. These folks are equally as deserving of a safe and accessible transit route as drivers in the city. As both a biker and pedestrian in the city, I have become acutely aware of the dangerous driving occurring around me, including drivers going through red lights, stop signs, or taking right turns without checking for anyone coming. Bike lanes encourage everyone on the road and sidewalks to be aware of what is happening around them, so, not only would it ensure the safety of cyclists, but also of everyone else who is using the road and sidewalk. Along the lines with environmental initiatives, bike lanes are an easy way to contribute to the reduction of emissions, as well as encouraging citizens to engage with a healthy lifestyle. Finally, the last few years of bike lane implementation on Bloor St and University Ave have been somewhat disruptive, but it has been rewarding to see the outcome and how well-used the bike lanes are. Spending the time to tear out the bike lanes that have JUST been implemented will be incredibly disruptive, expensive, and create far more traffic than the Bill is proposing it will fix.\nI would be sincerely disappointed to see this Bill pass. I think that our city has come a really long way to promote enjoyment and safety with regard to bike transit. During the COVID-19 pandemic, city bikes were utilized to a significantly high degree as an alternative method of transit, and it has propelled a much more developed culture of cycling in the city. Cycling is an incredible way to build community and bike lanes would further encourage folks to get out of their cars and onto the streets of our exciting city, including supporting local businesses and seeing different areas that one wouldn't normally see if they are driving by in a car. Bike lanes save lives, and too many people have been killed while cycling in this year and in the past number of years. This simply must be taken into consideration when decisions are being made about implementing this bill or not.\n"

Bike lanes save lives and since September 2024, in Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes. That is six people too many.\nFurther, not only is this legislation devoid of evidence based policy but it will also cost the province, the city, and its taxpayers, millions of dollars.\nTo sum up: I want the province to stick to its jurisdiction, I want bike lanes to stay for the safety of myself, my loved ones, and my community, and I want my taxpayer dollars spent on other issues such as healthcare and affordable housing.\n"

I rely on the protected bike lanes on Bloor/Danforth to safely and quickly travel across the city. Without these bike lanes, there is no way for me to safely cross this section of the city on bicycle.\nStudies have shown that while there is a slow down to vehicular traffic, it is often under 1 minute slower. Is 1 minute of added travel time really worth risking the lives of people who need to bike on these roads?\nWhile the intention behind Bill 212 is to reduce traffic congestion, the removal of bike lanes is likely to contribute to more traffic! Bike lanes can help alleviate vehicle congestion by providing people an alternative to driving. The less protected bike lanes we have, the fewer people feel safe cycling at all!! Often leading to more cars on the road and increased traffic.\n"

I live 2 minutes' walk from the East Danforth and its incredibly necessary bike lanes.\nI am terrified about the loss of life that is bound to occur should Bill 212 become law and these bike lanes be removed. I am strongly against Bill 212 and the loss of life it will generate if it becomes law.\nDaily, I see hardworking people using these bike lanes to do their delivery jobs, and I see other hardworking people using the bike lanes to get to work. I also see young children (children my own child's age) using the bike lanes with their parents and guardians.\nFor many years I myself was a bike commuter and used the Danforth before bike lanes were installed. It was more dangerous both as a cyclist and as a driver. In fact, studies show that cities with more bicycle users and lanes are safer for people using all modes of transportation.\nIf the government wants to fight gridlock it needs to A. Get the Eglinton Crosstown, which is under the control of a provincial agency, open and working after billions in cost overruns and delays and B. Get the TTC and Metrolinx working together more effectively to get people safely around the city. The province also has control over funding for both these entities.\nFunding transit and bike lanes helps everyone get around quicker and more safely.\nStop attaching bike infrastructure and ease gridlock by actually finishing the public transit projects that the province started years ago and has failed to bring to completion.\n"
