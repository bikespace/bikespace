Getting metrolix back on track and finally letting the public use the LTR that are all but operational will reduce gridlock.\nBuild separate bike lanes off the asphalt. HELP cities have dedicated bike lanes. STOP interfering with the City of Toronto just because Ford is still mad the city rejected him as mayor and is abusing his privilege as premier be a bully!\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes on these major streets proposed would be disastrous for the safety of cyclists; whom already are at a heightened risk of injury and death in the case of collision compared to motor vehicle drivers. The statistics offered by the provincial government as reasoning for reattributing road space to drivers is deeply skewed and fallacious. In the downtown core area, cycling is an undoubtedly popular form of short transit and growing in popularity (paralleling the increase in bike infrastructure in recent years), likely for it's cost efficiency, physical health benefits associated with exercise, and low environmental impact. The proposed act would most greatly affect the residents of the Toronto core, where there is a much higher proportion of cyclists to drivers.\nFor cyclists, these bike lanes, especially on Bloor, Yonge, and University, are essential for completing their trip safely by staying out of the way of cars. Taking alternate routes to their destination simply is not an option considering many of the destinations are along these major streets. Regardless of the presence of dedicated bike infrastructure or not, cyclists will be on these roads, in the same lanes with drivers on Bloor, Yonge, and University. There is also a great incentive for drivers in Toronto to keep these bike lanes in place. For drivers, these bike lanes offer peace of mind knowing that cyclists have their own space and are not creeping into drivers' blind spots, creating dangerous situations for everyone involved.\nWhile gridlock is a concern, it's urgency pales in comparison to the life-threatening risk posed to cyclists and other road users with the absence of these bike lanes. It is in everyone's interest to keep these bike lanes in place and find alternative ways to reducing grid lock \u2013 such as but not limited to, providing alternate routes and forms of transit that make use of road space more efficiently. Time is valuable to everyone, but it is not more valuable than people's lives and safety.\n"

So that there will be two lanes of bumper to bumper traffic instead of one? So that commute times can remain the same, if not get worse? Why is the premier acting on these very specific local \"issues\" when there's a whole province with problems that need to be dealt with? How about, oh I don't know, making sure that people have actual healthcare. I'm sure the folks in Brockville are thrilled that their tax dollars are going towards a personal vendetta against the concrete and lines on the road in Toronto rather than helping to fix their drug use and homelessness crisis.\n"

        "comment": "As a person born and raised in the GTA,  and who has live and worked in Downtown Toronto for several years, I firmly do not support the removal of bike lanes located on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave nor any other main roads throughout the GTA. Not only is this a complete waste of taxpayer money, but it will not deter cyclists from using these routes to get to work, school or recreation but rather would force cyclists to go back to sharing the road with cars, leading to more deaths and injuries, further straining our already crumbling healthcare system. Cyclists are not the reason why Toronto is being strangled by traffic; years of underinvestment in both municipal and regional transit options are. By limiting people's options for transportation, you're inadvertently creating even more traffic for the urban and suburban populations by forcing them to buy a car. Canada is population is rapidly growing, and the solution to investing in our future is not demolishing brand-new infrastructure. The Gardener expressway is actively crumbling down onto cars and pedestrians. Why spend money demolishing bike lanes when we actively need over $500 million taxpayer dollars to fix this crumbling parkway? What happens to traffic when this essential artery falls apart? How does massive amounts of traffic support Canadian economic productivity in its economic capital? Ontario needs to modernize its infrastructure to remain competitive, including with improved roads, cycling lanes and transit. It makes no sense from either a rational or fiscally conservative perspective to make this decision. Keep the protected bike lanes; the lives of your citizens should come first.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI would like to express my strong opposition to the proposal outlined in Bill 212 regarding the removal of bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. I would like to outline several points to consider:\n- Utilization of Bicycle Lanes: Much of the debate hinges on the assumption that the newly installed bicycle lanes are underutilized, leading to the conclusion that they occupy valuable space needed for motor vehicle traffic. However, this perspective overlooks a critical factor: the connectivity of the cycling network. The new stretches of bicycle lanes often lack sufficient connections to other routes, which diminishes their usage compared to better-integrated lanes in the downtown core. A more connected network would likely enhance accessibility and encourage greater cycling participation.\n- Temporary Relief and Long-term Consequences: While returning a lane to motor vehicle traffic may offer immediate relief, this effect is likely to be short-lived. By prioritizing cars over alternative modes of transportation, we risk creating a cycle of increased demand for car travel, leading to inevitable gridlock once again. Every bicycle utilizing a designated lane represents one less car on the road, contributing to a more efficient overall transportation system.\n- Development Stage of Bicycle Infrastructure: It\u2019s important to recognize that Toronto's bicycle infrastructure is still evolving. Enhanced cycling facilities have been shown to stimulate demand for bike trips, as evidenced by the record ridership numbers reported by the BikeShare program this year. There is an unrealistic expectation among some car-reliant citizens for an instantaneous shift in transportation habits, overlooking the natural lag that occurs as preferences change. Developing a robust cycling infrastructure takes time and investment, but the results will lead to increased cycling adoption.\n- Rising Demand for Cycling Infrastructure: The demand for cycling infrastructure in Toronto is on the rise, reflecting a growing awareness of the benefits of alternative transportation. Reversing the progress made with the current bicycle lanes would not only set back the city\u2019s efforts to promote non-car modes of travel, but it would also necessitate a costly reinvestment in these infrastructures in the future. Evidence from countries with similar cold climates, such as Denmark, demonstrates that a well-developed cycling network can become a primary mode of transportation. Closer to home, Montreal\u2019s success in enhancing and connecting its cycling infrastructure has led to a notable reduction in car congestion, particularly for trips that cannot be easily served by other means.\nIn conclusion, I urge the Transportation Ministry to consider the long-term benefits of maintaining and improving our cycling infrastructure. This investment goes beyond merely creating bike lanes; it is about fostering a more sustainable, efficient, and connected transportation network for all Toronto residents. Ultimately, enhancing cycling infrastructure will also benefit car-reliant residents by alleviating congestion and improving overall traffic flow in the city.\nI recognize that in some cases, the introduction of new cycling lanes has led to the removal of a lane for motor vehicles, contributing to gridlock. In these instances, it would be beneficial to explore alternative cycling infrastructure options\u2014such as creating dedicated space for cyclists on the sidewalk, effectively separating them from both pedestrians and cars, while returning the lane to motor vehicle traffic. On very narrow roads, this could be a win-win situation for everyone. This approach has proven successful in many major European cities (for example, Berlin) and could serve as a viable solution for Toronto.\nHowever, dismantling parts of the cycling routes on these major roads could cause irreparable damage to the overall cycling network in the city. A cohesive and well-connected cycling infrastructure is essential for encouraging cycling as a viable transportation option and ensuring the continued progress toward a more sustainable urban environment.\n"

By encouraging cycling, we reduce congestion, lower emissions, and promote healthier lifestyles. The convenience and safety that bike lanes provide are essential for fostering a cycling culture in our city.\nRemoving these lanes would revert progress made toward sustainable transportation and could deter individuals from cycling, leading to increased traffic and pollution. Instead of eliminating these vital resources, I urge the government to consider investing in more bike-friendly infrastructure that accommodates all users and reduces gridlock.\nPlease reconsider this proposal in light of the numerous benefits that cycling infrastructure brings to our community.

        "comment": "As someone who resides in both Markham and Toronto, and commutes via bike and car throughout the year, I am expressing disappointment in this proposed bill. When driving, cyclists sharing the road with us only leads to annoyance from drivers who are too scared to drive next to and overtake a cyclist. Having dedicated corridors for the cyclists to make their commutes greatly benefits drivers. It allows individuals like myself to have the choice of cycling instead of driving, lowering risk of accidents with cyclists sharing the same roads as our drivers.\nI do not believe gridlock would be reduced. Cyclists who are safety-conscious may switch to driving in their commutes, leading to more single-occupant cars on the roads. I hope that more cycling, walking, and transit infrastructure is improved so that Ontarians have the option to choose how they will make their commutes, based on the needs of their day. Simply going back and forth from work should be a valid option on a safer, more efficient transit system. The proposed infrastructure to be removed can also affect businesses. When individuals can freely walk or cycle, making a quick stop along their trip becomes so much more convenient. I always appreciate the chance to support a local business.\n"

I get that drivers in toronto are already annoyed with bike lanes taking up another lane, but with bikers in the car lanes it\u2019s going to make similar amount of congestion for drivers and harder to get around by constantly checking for bikers before turning. I am also a cyclist who\u2019s biked a lot downtown, bike lanes make it a lot safer for me and others to get around without getting in the way of drivers and making it dangerous for us cyclists.
