        "comment": "Opposition Statement to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nBill 212, which proposes the removal of certain bike lanes in Toronto and the imposition of provincial control over future bike lane decisions, undermines proven benefits of cycling infrastructure in urban centers. Research consistently demonstrates that well-planned bike lanes improve safety, reduce traffic congestion, and support local businesses. Removing or restricting bike lanes would not only disregard these benefits but could also hinder Ontario's progress toward building more livable, sustainable, and economically vibrant cities.\n1. Bike Lanes Improve Safety for All Road Users\nEvidence from cities around the world shows that bike lanes enhance safety for all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. A study from the University of Colorado found that adding protected bike lanes in cities across the United States led to a 44% reduction in road injuries overall and a 50% reduction in severe or fatal crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists. By designating safe spaces for cyclists, bike lanes reduce conflicts with motor vehicles, which is especially critical in high-traffic areas like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue.\n2. Bike Lanes Alleviate Traffic Congestion\nCounter to claims that bike lanes increase congestion, numerous studies show that they can ease it. Cities that invested in cycling infrastructure have seen reduced car usage and congestion. For example, New York City\u2019s protected bike lanes led to an increase in bike commuting and a corresponding reduction in vehicle congestion along key corridors. In Portland, Oregon, the city\u2019s network of bike lanes contributes to moving people more efficiently, with each cyclist occupying less road space and creating less congestion than a single car. By accommodating cyclists, bike lanes help to optimize road space for all users, creating a more efficient and balanced transportation network.\n3. Economic Benefits for Local Businesses\nBike lanes support local business growth by increasing foot traffic and making business districts more accessible. Research by the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation found that cyclists and pedestrians spend more per month at local businesses than drivers, particularly in neighborhoods with high foot and bike traffic. A study in New York City further confirmed this, showing that streets with protected bike lanes saw a 49% increase in retail sales. Restricting bike lanes could jeopardize this economic boost, especially in densely populated areas where cycling is a popular mode of transport.\n4. Environmental and Public Health Benefits\nCities worldwide are investing in cycling infrastructure to meet environmental targets, reduce pollution, and improve public health. Bike lanes are a key element in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality by reducing the number of short car trips. For instance, studies indicate that if more people shifted from driving to cycling for short trips, it would significantly lower vehicle emissions, particularly in high-traffic urban areas. Bill 212\u2019s exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act is concerning, as it suggests a disregard for the public health impacts associated with increased vehicle emissions if bike lanes are removed.\n5. Provincial Overreach and Impact on Local Decision-Making\nMunicipalities are best positioned to assess and address local transportation needs. Shifting authority to the provincial level risks creating a one-size-fits-all approach that may not serve the specific needs of communities. The proposal for provincial review and control over future bike lanes could inhibit municipalities from implementing tailored, sustainable transportation solutions that enhance quality of life for their residents. Local governments, with their nuanced understanding of community needs, should maintain the flexibility to plan and sustain cycling infrastructure.\nConclusion\nBill 212 proposes a restrictive framework that contradicts the proven benefits of bike lanes and threatens to stymie Ontario's progress in fostering safer, more sustainable, and economically vibrant communities. Investing in bike infrastructure is not only about supporting cycling but is a comprehensive strategy that improves road safety, reduces congestion, enhances local economies, and promotes public health. We urge policymakers to reconsider this legislation, consult widely, and prioritize policies that promote a balanced and forward-thinking transportation system for Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "This is outrageous. The Province should absolutely not remove these existing bike lanes and should be supporting, rather than hindering, the development of more cycling infrastructure. The research on transportation demand management is clear: more lanes of traffic does not reduce congestion. Getting people out of their cars is essential and we need cycling infrastructure in order to ensure riders of all ages and abilities are kept safe. Stop this waste of public resources. Keep the lanes.\n"

Leave municipal affairs to municipalities. STAY IN YOUR LANE Mr Ford. You've made it abundantly obvious that you hate this city. Get over it.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario\u2019s plan to not solve congestion\nThis blog post was originally published as a newsletter. Subscribe to the Stuckless Consulting Inc. newsletter to receive updates like these first, and directly to your inbox.\nSubscribe\nOn Monday, October 21, Ontario's Minister of Transportation introduced the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, that, if passed, would require municipalities to secure provincial approval for any new bike lanes that take space away from motor vehicles. The bill could also lead to the removal of existing bike lanes.\nThe rationale for this proposal is the province's desire to fight gridlock and \u201cmake life easier for drivers\u201d and it's part of a package that also looks to raise highway speeds, speed up the construction of priority highways like Highway 413, and freeze road test fees.\nIn this newsletter, we look at the specifics of what's in the bill, why it won't reduce gridlock or save you time, and what you can do to voice your opposition.\nWhat\u2019s in the bill\nThe bill was tabled during the first sitting of the House after a prolonged summer break, indicating that this is a priority for government. We've done an initial review of what's in it and provide some highlights (or more accurately, lowlights) below.\nThe proposed bill would amend the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) to require that municipalities get approval from the Ministry of Transportation before building any bike lanes that would \u201creduce the number of marked lanes available for travel by motor vehicle traffic.\u201d\nThe Ministry will consider whether a bicycle lane would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic. The criteria that would be used by the Ministry to do that is not outlined, but the bill allows for the Ministry to ask municipalities to provide information, including traffic information. The bill also allows for the Minister to make regulations about what information may be required.\nAs mentioned by the Premier last week, the amendments target existing bicycle lanes too, with the Ministry able to request traffic information related to existing bike lanes that removed space for motor vehicles when they were installed. There are no specifications in the bill about bike lane removal, however, Global News reported  that the province is offering to pay for the costs of removing existing lanes that don't meet their yet-to-be-determined criteria, and that bike lanes on Toronto's University Avenue, Yonge Street, and Bloor Street have been identified by the province for removal.\nNew bicycle lanes for which a contract has already been awarded, or on which the work is being done by a municipality and has already started on the day the bill comes into force, are exempted.\nA bicycle lane is defined as any portion of a highway, the use of which is wholly or partially restricted or dedicated to bicycles.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the bill\nIt won't reduce gridlock or save you time. Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place (read: induced demand).\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nThis move is out of line with other provincial priorities, such as growth targets, efforts to boost transit, and the current e-scooter micromobility pilot program.\nWhy we need more (not fewer) bike lanes\nA few key reasons why municipalities across Ontario have committed to building bike lanes, which are likely familiar to you:\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\nBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\nReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nCycling is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life, reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nThere is a wealth of evidence in support of building bike lanes, some of which has been summarized in our firm's \u201cActive Transportation Benefits Research Tracker\u201d. Sign-up today to gain access to this free resource to help make the case for cycling and active transportation.\nGet the Tracker\nSo, what happens next?\nThe current government holds a majority, and it's hard to stop a majority government from passing the bills it wants to pass. That being said, that absolutely does not mean that we should accept the bill as-is. It's critical for us to voice our thoughts and opposition for the record, especially when government decision-making is unsupported by evidence. The Act has been posted for public comment for 30 days.\nThis week was First Reading for the bill. It will have one more reading in the House (Second Reading) before being sent to the Committee stage. The Committee stage is an opportunity for witnesses to speak to the bill, and for Committee members (Members of Provincial Parliament - MPPs) to consider amendments. If the Committee then votes to send the bill back to the House, it will undergo Third Reading, where MPPs will debate the bill and vote on whether the bill will pass. If passed, the bill received Royal Assent before coming into force, either immediately, or at a time specified in the bill.\nVoice your opposition\nThere are a number of ways that you can register your opposition to this bill, including:\nSubmit your feedback on the bill through the government's Environmental Registry process. The posting is now open for feedback until November 20th.\nEmail Premier Ford, Minister Sarkaria, and your local MPP to voice your opposition to the bill. Contact info available here.\nEncourage your municipal council to follow Guelph's lead and table a motion for the Mayor to write to the Premier opposing this move (or, if you're one of the elected officials who read this newsletter, bring the motion forward yourself!).\nSign and share this petition from Cycle Toronto.\nOrganize and support an official response from organizations you are a member of. Here's an example from the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), which represents Ontario's 444 municipalities.\nFollow the status of the bill online, and, when the time comes, register to speak at Committee in opposition to the bill, or submit a written comment.\nJoin the Rally & Ride on Wednesday, October 23 at Queen's park (tonight!!) if you can, or participate in one of the associated local rides being hosted by advocates across the province.\nI encourage you to pick one or two (or more) of the actions outlined above and voice your opposition to this bill. It's a tough moment for cycling and municipal transportation planning in Ontario, but progress is not always linear. Let's work to move through this moment together, and continue to support communities where it's fun, safe, easy, and accessible for everyone to get around.\nContact me if you have any questions!\n"

        "comment": "Municipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

On weekends, I use various bike lanes with my active 8 year old to safely navigate the city. We often stop to shop at local businesses - something much harder to do when driving because of the availability and high cost of parking.\nBike lanes keep my family safe. They keep my car parked in the garage - reducing traffic and pollution. They support local businesses.\nSince this legislation was announced, my daily bike commute has become a reminder that this government doesn't care about my safety, my child's safety or the environment.\nBike lanes don't cause congestion - they relieve it. If more people felt safe to cycle, they would leave their cars behind. This legislation is just a cynical ploy to pander to suburban conservative voters at the cost of the lives of Torontonians. It is also a massive over-reach into municipal affairs, which negates our democratic rights as the people who voted for our mayor and councillors. Once again we are being punished for not electing Doug Ford as mayor and bruising his ego in a way he will clearly never forget.\nThis legislation is dangerous and divisive.

        "comment": "It's been proven time and time again that more car lanes only means more cars which equals more time spent waiting in traffic. Every bicycle user is one less car on the road. Building and encouraging bike and alternative modes of transportation reduces gridlock and removes car traffic from the road. It's not hard to figure out that less cars equals less traffic.\nWe need to stop introducing bills that rip up progress forward. Instead we should focus on providing alternative transportation modes and stop just adding more lanes of traffic. This province has been starved of transportation alternatives for decades. We need better pedestrian, bicycle, train and bus infrastructure. Why do I have to take a car to travel everywhere in Ontario? Why can't I take a day trip cheaply and easily between cities or towns by train or bus?\nThe way this bill is written it sounds like it allows the province to make municipalities rip up recently installed bike infrastructure and replace it with car lanes. Why are we wasting money to build infrastructure, only to rip it up a few years later? We have more important things to spend money on like Health Care and Housing than reversing bike lanes that actually prevent traffic injuries and deaths of vulnerable road users like pedestrians, cyclists and those using assistive mobility devices.\n"

The amount of traffic that will be created by tearing out bike lanes that are less than 5 years old is ridiculous. It will make the problem way worse.\nThe less cars on the road, the better. Our roads are clogged in large part because of the relentless building of new condos that in my neighborhood mean lanes of the road closed for months and months on end. These bike lanes are extremely well-used - I see hundreds of people on them every week. We do not want all of these people clogging up the roads in cars. Cycling, along with other forms of active transport are also great health promoters, reducing sedentary time and improving physical activity, which has a run on benefit to health system costs.\nBike lanes are safer for cars as well. When I drive down roads without bike lanes I an constantly veering into oncoming lanes, or slowing to a crawl so I dont hit them. Bike lanes allow for the smoother flow of traffic when cars dont need to share with cyclists. I despise driving down roads without bike lanes. It is so dangerous for cyclists, and we have too many cycling deaths in this city. Every cyclists injured by poor urban planning is a huge cost on our health system\nWe are in a climate crisis, and a traffic crisis in this city (mixed with one of  the most unreliable, filthy transit system of any of the dozens of big cities I've been in around the world). Removing bike lanes, and blocking new builds, is directly contributing to climate crisis. It makes zero sense. why would we destroy the only road infrastructure that facilitates non-fossil-fuel transportation, and keeps people out of cars? Its a backwards move that makes no sense from a public health or urban planning perspective. Please dont let the whims of one premier be responsible for increased road construction delays and decreases in the safety of human beings and our planet!\n"
