        "comment": "Re Bike Lanes on Bloor- THANK YOU Premier Ford and Ford Government for listening - and taking ACTION!\nWe are against the bike lanes on Bloor in Etobicoke and on other arterial roads!!!!\n1.  There is major gridlock with traffic jammed all day long.\n2. The emergency vehicles are obstructed, either stuck in traffic or taking side roads.\n3. Emergency Management Ontario was clearly not consulted- this impacts evacuation plans and moving citizens during disasters. (Only a few bridges long Etobicoke to Toronto)\n4. The bike lanes are extreme under used- maybe 1 or 2 bikes every few hours, while cars are parked bumper to bumper.\n5. These lanes discriminate against anyone who is not able-bodied. The curbs that were installed impede access and present tripping hazards - for seniors, people with canes, walkers, baby carriages etc.  we\u2019ve seen people trip over the curb crossing the bike lane- near miss injury\n6. My mother who is 89 and uses a cane, is not able to ride a bike or hop over curbs.  And the same with me, while recovering from a broken bone, using a walker and  a cane.\n7. The pollution caused by idling cars along Bloor street is awful.  No way you want to walk along Bloor now, inhaling the fumes. Let alone, walk a dog, children or a baby in a carriage.  We avoid Bloor street.\n8.  Business on Bloor street are suffering. There are businesses closing, empty shops that are not being rented.  I used to shop at my favourite  food shops- and now avoid going.  You can\u2019t get there, even though it\u2019s a few blocks away.  The gridlock is discouraging, so I go elsewhere.\n9. This part of Bloor street used to be vibrant land filled with walkers and shoppers. But that\u2019s all gone. This will become a decrepit section of town soon- it\u2019s going downhill.\n10. It\u2019s UGLY!   The bike lanes- and curbs, ramps, painted asphalt, plastic posts look AWFUL- how embarrassing when tourists and visitors arrive to see all this paraphernalia all over the street- blocking everything.  Instead of beautifying the street, City hall is going out of its way to make it look UGLY!!\u2019\n11.  It\u2019s Dangerous.  Any Electric scooters and ebikes using those lanes go much faster than normal bikes.  Turning off Bloor, means triple checking both ways, in case bike or e scooter is coming either way, or hasn\u2019t stopped at red etc\n12 Side roads have become busier- high speed  traffic, looking for alternatives, traffic jams with 10-12 cars or waiting 5 minutes to cross what used to be quiet side roads!!  Also police and emergency vehicles now using side roads! And sometimes high speed vehicles looking for shortcuts.\n13.  PLEASE reopen the lanes that were removed.\nPut the bike routes on quiet side roads- with extra street lights.  BUT don\u2019t put in barriers, curbs, silly plastic posts on the side roads either.  We\u2019ve been biking for decades on these side roads and don\u2019t want expensive obstacles!!!\n14.  The weather in Canada is not conducive to biking- it snows, it rains.  The city should have spent money on building Subways, and buying more buses. Realistic practical PEOPLE MOVERS- not a fantasy idyllic  vision of biking on a sunny day once in a while.\n15. The expense of building bike lanes and taking out car lanes is not practical or justified in Etobicoke- the shops are far, we visit people who live far, and we travel far for work or business. It is a car-based lifestyle. Especially when you add in the need to transport or support families with children, people with health challenges, seniors etc\n16.  The maintenance for these bike lanes is outrageous!  Snow ploughs for bike lanes that clear them more frequently than the defined city standards state- while leaving the snow and ice on treacherous sidewalks and roads- just for the convenience of 1-2 people!!!  The cost of buying these ploughs, the cost of operating them.  The cost of hiring extra \u201ctraffic cops\u201d to direct traffic when the subway stops, and buses and cars now jam the roads.  The cost of repainting the asphalt in the various meaningless colours and repairing the ramps that serve some unknown purpose.  The cost of repainting the squiggly lanes every few years- that swerve around obstacles, and plastic posts\n17.  The City of Toronto should support businesses, and consider the lifestyle and needs of the constituents, and beautify the city to attract visitors.   They should encourage pedestrians- WALKING is healthy and brings a city to life!  Beautiful flower boxes, vibrant cafes, shops with bright windows.  Not plastic bars, painted roads, closed stores, gridlocked cars.\nMayor Chow and Councillor Morely are out of touch with us- and have no vision of what Etobicoke wants.  We were better off before amalgamation, because this certainly looks like these two are out to destroy Etobicoke.\nThank goodness the First government is stepping in- we count on you to help us out here!!!\u2019\nThank you very much for taking ACTION!!\n"

We should only be talking to the province to advise them of our decisions of specific matters & how much $ & other supports they need to provide to us?!

        "comment": "While I do not like the provincial government infringing upon municipal jurisdiction, I do not feel that the city has made good decisions on recent extensions, specifically Bloor West/Jane and west from there.\nI support bike lanes where bicyclists ride. They make sense in central Toronto, and outwards on streets like College, Dundas West, etc as there is bike traffic and streets are narrow and congested.  Bike lanes under these circumstances are important.  However, recent construction of bike lanes in Bloor W Etobicoke makes no sense as traffic is now snarled, side streets are heavily travelled and speed levels have increased significantly.  Of greater significance is the fact that bicycle traffic in the new bike lanes is  almost non-existent.\nCity representatives, most notably Amber Morley, are not listening to voices other than the cycling lobbyists.\nWhile I have issues with the province overstepping municiple jurisdiction, if that is what it takes to inject reasonability into the bike lane decisions, I support the provincial government doing a comprehensive, objective, and balanced review.\n"

        "comment": "This is counterproductive as cyclists have the right to use the full lane and will do so if bike lanes are not in place. It also creates confusion when cars or cyclists are turning, leading to more gridlock and accidents. It\u2019s also money better spent on real solutions like opening the LRT and creating more train track overpasses for vehicles, which would much alleviate gridlock since much of the congestion points are where traffic is funnelled into too few corridors over train tracks.\n"

        "comment": "I used to love shopping on Bloor St W.  Now we have ugly white poles along the road way and I personally know 2 older men, who have tripped and fallen over them.  There are long dark planters filled with weeds.  Green, lavender and red blocks are painted along the roadways.  I feel as if I am living in Clown Town.  It takes me 3-4 red lights to make a left hand turn along Bloor.  No matter how many times you say in a chirpy voice that bike lanes will eliminate pollution, it is not true.  It takes longer to drive anywhere.  I must leave 2-3 times earlier to get out to Mississauga, so am running my car longer.  The noise pollution is 5xs as much because people are constantly honking their horns.  Emergency services are against these bike lanes are now driving through residential areas to avoid traffic.  So are private cars and delivery vans.  I have to be very careful getting out of my car when visiting my son, as there is now much more traffic.  Kids can no longer play road hockey or ride their bikes.  The bike lane committee just lies and has no truth that bike lanes are helping the environment.  They didn\u2019t even ask Emergency Services about their opinions.   STo top it all off, hardly any cyclists use the bike lanes.  I can walk several blocks up Bloor and back home with out even seeing one cyclist.  The whole proposition is ill thought out and has disrupted the whole neighbourhood.\n"

My children use them regularly and without the bike lanes, their travels would be less safe.\nThe transportation priorities of city residents seems to be a hyper local issue, upon which voters in far away places should not concern themselves. While the province has the power to intrude upon municipal affairs, that power should be lightly. I see nothing of provincial concern on this issue, just as the province wouldn\u2019t concern itself with the presence of a stoplight in Little Current on Manitoulin Island.\nI am alarmed by the expansion of the expropriation power embedded in the bill. The 413 should be subject to the same standards and environmental reviews as other projects.\n"

        "comment": "If this bill is passed, it will massively impact the safety of both Toronto residents, and Ontario Citizens. Cycling is a critical form of transportation for many, especially in densely populated city where it is very expensive to own, drive, and store a vehicle. Taking away this critical form of infrastructure will only be a bandaid fix to the solution. Increasing the lanes of traffic will only encourage a car centric built-environment, excluding those who don\u2019t have access to a car and will only temporarily reduce grid lock. The solution isn\u2019t to keep expanding the number of car lanes, but to prioritize other forms of transportation that are better on the environment and ultimately more efficient in densely populated cities like Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "At the end of the day, Bill 212 is a shocking waste of money regardless of your personal feelings about bike lane and city congestion. Can we consider the real financial cost? Yes, the millions to remove. But what about the millions spent installing them? Those too should be accounted for in the total cost.\nThe waste of removing bike lanes, many of which were JUST installed, especially from an environmental perspective, is troubling. Destroying the sections that feature above grade lanes and gardens feels akin to tearing down a brand new building.\nI urge you to consider real, effective solutions to improving congestion. Most of the congestion I see on the road is from misbehaving drivers who run lights, block intersections, stop illegally, bully other drivers, rush, speed-then-brake\u2026basically behaviour that inhibits traffic flow. My other favourite type of congestion is watching 5 cars having to wait in line while one person is parallel parking on a main artery. Bike lanes are not allowed on main arteries, and yet street parking is? It is clear that congestion across much of Bloor Street is from folks inhibiting traffic flow to parallel park, not from a lack of driving lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a frequent user of bike lanes in Toronto I strongly disagree with this proposed legislation. I am also a car owner and driver. I do not think anyone should expect to drive into downtown Toronto and think they have a right to free-flowing, car-dominated streets. That is anti-thetical to city-building. I work downtown, but would not commute to work by car, and noone should expect to have an easy time doing so. Congestion is the mark of a successful city. I use the Danforth, Bloor and Yonge bike lanes. I take my son to school using a bike using these bike lanes. It will absolutely not be safe to do so without the lanes. In many cases there are not any reasonable alternative routes that would not dramatically increase the trip time, difficulty or safety or the trip.\nThis legislation is moving Toronto into the past, and will impact it's status on the world stage. New York City is full of new bike lanes. Montreal is full of bike lanes. Toronto wants to be a world-class city. People will visit and try to bike around and realize what an unsafe disaster it is. This legislation is not world-class, it's embarrassing. Cities are places to live, work and play. A city whose streets are built simply for moving traffic through them is not a real city, it's just a place people pass on their way to somewhere else. It's nowhere.\nThis legislation is anti-democratic and overreach. Everyone knows Doug Ford lost the election for Mayor of Toronto and can't get over it. Now he wants to tell us how we should design our streets? That is not local democracy, it's picking on the most vulnerable road users for political points with his base.\nThe government is using old, misleading and inappropriate statistics to justify removing these bike lanes. They are demanding data to support keeping bike lanes that are in place, but where is the data to justify taking them out? Apparently, unreleased government data suggests nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility vehicle. I wouldn't be surprised if that is true.\nNumerous new high-rise buildings in Toronto have been built with minimal or even no vehicular parking on the assumption that a bike lane network would support cycling use, with huge numbers of bike parking spaces instead of car parking spaces. How is the increased density going to be supported in the current street network if new residents are being encouraged to drive by ripping out bike lanes? Show us the transportation studies that show that that will work and allow the City to meet the government's own growth targets?\nOn streets like Bloor, Yonge and the Danforth before the bike lanes, there was no parking allowed during rush hour - that is the only way there was an additional lane of traffic. These are the city's main retail streets - do you think it's good for business to have no parking allowed in front of your business from 3pm to 6 or 7pm and the street turned into a highway for cars passing through? There's a reason the Annex BIA is strongly supportive of the bike lanes there - they are actually good for business!\nLastly, on some of these downtown streets, adding a vehicular lane will only increase the number of cars - it's called induced demand, and anyone who knows anything about transportation planning knows what that means: when it comes to traffic, if you add a lane, more people will try to drive and the congestion will just return. In addition, increasing capacity on some of these streets will just increase the volumes of cars making it to key choke points like the DVP and Gardiner - they have no capacity for the additional vehicles from additional lanes of traffic.\nCyclists need more protection, not less. We should be encouraging cycling, not discouraging it by ripping out bike lanes. Please don't take away the safety bike lanes give me and my son on our trip to save drivers a few minutes of commuting time.\n"
