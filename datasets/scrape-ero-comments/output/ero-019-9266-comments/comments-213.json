        "comment": "I am submitting this comment as someone who grew up in Brampton, currently lives in Ottawa, and spends much of my time visiting family in friends in the GTA. I drive, bike, walk and take public transit in my daily life.\nAs someone who grew up in the suburbs, I deeply appreciate the stress that gridlock inflicts on drivers and that this is a complicated issue to tackle. I very strongly object to this proposal, which (1) will not appropriately address the issue of gridlock, but will also (2) add excessive burden on municipalities, resulting in poor use of public funds.\n1) Bike lanes provide dedicated, safe space for people to move around communities on bikes instead of vehicles. They reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and reduce conflict between cyclists, vehicles and pedestrians by providing a dedicated lane for bikes. These make our roads safer for everyone, makes the roads more predictable for drivers, and reduces injury or death as a result of vehicle-bicycle collisions.\nI grew up in Brampton in the 1990s, when it had no bike lanes and a very poor public transit system: driving was the only reliable way to get around. My parents still live there and, because the community was planned and designed for the car, this is still the case. Brampton has grown so much since the 1990s, and we only see more and more drivers on the same roads. Bike lanes and dedicated spaces for public transit have helped to reduce the number of cars on the road: This is the leadership we need to make communities across Ontario (especially more urban and dense communities) more sustainable and safe.\nThe City of Ottawa has invested in bike lanes in many places across the city core, and I have seen enthusiastic uptake by families who take their children out for bike rides around the city. I myself am a federal public servant and I bike into work in the spring, fall and summer: I am one less vehicle on the road, and my bike takes up far less space than a car would. Ottawa's investment in bike lanes have only made the city's streets safer for everyone by making biking more practical for people of all ages.\n2) Municipal staff across Ontario are seized with the housing crisis. They are struggling to streamline the process for development approvals so that we can build more housing as soon as possible. This proposal adds unnecessary bureaucratic red tape by requiring a higher level of approval for a basic local amenity. Municipalities are best placed to determine where bike lanes should go, and revoking this power will add more burden on both municipal and provincial staff and make them less able to address more important issues.\n"

        "comment": "Data, both from within Canada and elsewhere, has shown time and time again that doubling the number of car lanes doesn't even come close to doubling the throughput. And each additional lane you add has an even smaller and smaller effect on traffic. And even any minor benefits you might gain are almost immediately eaten up by the new traffic that's produced by the extra space, meaning even the meager gains are erased in an embarrassingly short timeframe.\nJust think how many times we've widened the 401 in your lifetime. Has it solved traffic?\nIt's simply impossible, given how space inefficient cars are, and the psychology produced by driving them, to solve the problem with more cars. But this proposal wears its bias on its sleeve by not saying it aims to get \"people\" around faster, but rather \"drivers\". If you really wanted to end gridlock you could prevent all city streets from being used by cars and have only buses, trams, delivery trucks, and bicycles. That would probably solve the problem overnight, but instead we're moving backwards out of self-centered short-sightedness, pettiness, emotions, and greed. This is not a well thought-out plan.\n"

        "comment": "All this act will do is add red tape to municipalities trying to improve their infrastructure. The province should not have micromanagement control at this level. A complete waste of time and net negative.\nActing like bike lines cause gridlock is also completely misinformed and absurd. We should be encouraging more transit options, not forcing even more people to use cars. That will do the opposite of solving gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with Bill 212. Dedicated bike lanes improve public safety by moving bicycles out of the flow of car traffic. Dedicated bike lanes are also beneficial for the environment because they encourage people to use a greener form of transportation. Bill 212 will add significant obstacles and red tape for municipalities that wish to add or expand bike lanes which means there will be less bike lanes introduced.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a thinly veiled proposal by the provincial government to create more construction work and decrease transit options, whose outcome will only increase gridlock and commute times province wild.\nBike lanes improve traffic, they do not hinder traffic. Improvement of our bike lane system province wide will serve to increase safety and ridership while decreasing our dependence on single passenger vehicles, increasing congestion as a whole. It has been proven time and time again that increasing lanes does not improve traffic flow. The population of ontario is too large to rely solely on cars as a method of transportation.\nI am incensed with the decision to put this bill forth. It is insulting to propose it as a method of decreasing congestion. It is a decisive step in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "I am very enthusiastic about the upcoming multi-use path construction in my neighborhood. As both a cyclist and a driver, I prioritize the safety that the bike lane will provide over the temporary inconvenience caused by construction. The absence of bike lanes has deterred me from cycling frequently, as it poses a significant safety risk.\nGiven the provincial government\u2019s interest in highways, particularly the proposed Highway 413, I believe that mandating provincial approval would substantially deter these projects. Consequently, resources allocated towards highway construction would be diverted away from these initiatives.\nI also recognize the importance of new highways in managing traffic. I can\u2019t see why these projects can\u2019t co-exist.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do NOT create gridlock! In fact, evidence shows they reduce gridlock as more people use cycles to get around. It's common sense and you don't need a PhD to figure that out.\nWe should encourage more people to cycle by providing a safe space, separated from vehicle traffic, for them to travel across town.\nAdding more red tape, reducing bike safety and travel routes for cyclists will actually increase gridlock, cost more money and lives.\nThe provincial government needs to focus on improving its own performance and competence, and stop interfering and bullying Municipal governments with these distraction techniques and petty gimmicks.\nFor example, how's your 'Highway under Toronto' project going? Plenty of consulting fees, over inflated construction costs and more deficit spending on the way for Ontarians to pay for, eh?\nOr should the Provincial government just keep building expensive roads for construction businesses, instead of building and improving alternative means of transport? Maybe, one day, they will understand where gridlock comes from.\nJudging by Provincial debt levels, deficit spending, and regressive policies, the Provincial government has no right to tell anyone what or how to do anything.\n"

        "comment": "I have been cycling downtown to work for over 2 decades. The secondary routes north south are not only very accessible but MUCH safer than dedicated bike lanes on major arteries. The most dangerous part of my daily ride is on the bike lanes on major arteries once I get downtown and need to move east west. The city needs to have proper planning that allows vehicles to flow and cyclists to ride on safe secondary roads that cars generally avoid. Making traffic flow better will make it safe for all of us riders as it will reduce the frustration Toronto drivers face on a daily basis.\nBike lanes must be removed from Eglinton, Yonge and university/Avenue road to make the traffic flow once again.\n"

On the contrary, they tend to ease traffic congestion.\nPlease have this legislation revised to be a Toronto-centric law.\n"

Why the premier feels the need to slow down his and future premiers process is not lost to me or other Ontarians.

If the Act forces the closure of existing bike lanes, it will not help the overall movement of people to the degree that outweighs the negative impact on public safety. I am both a driver and cyclist in the GTA. I've had cyclist friends killed or injured while driving on a road without infrastructure that supports all modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Honestly this seems like a huge overstepping of provincial power, and a huge waste of energy and tax dollars. Why should the ON government have to approve the addition of a bike lane? Obviously municipal elected officials will know more about what their municipality needs.\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any evidence to back up the Ford governments claims about bike lanes. They do not increase congestion, they decrease it. They also increase patronage of businesses along the lanes. And, most importantly, they keep cyclists safe on roads. There have been 6 cycling fatalities this year in Toronto. 6 people were killed. The government should be investing their time in making cyclists safer, not setting up ridiculous bureaucratic road bumps to increasing safety.\n"
