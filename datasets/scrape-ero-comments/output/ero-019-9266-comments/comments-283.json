        "comment": "As a recent PhD graduate from the University of Toronto, that has lived and worked in the downtown area near College and University for over 5 years, please reconsider Bill 212 and its intent to remove bike lanes on University.\nIt seems fiscally irresponsible to spend taxpayer money on removing recent improvements that created safer dedicated bike lanes, especially without further study on the effects on traffic congestion. From my understanding the current provincial study indicates removing bike lanes will not improve traffic flow.\nConvenient transport across multiple methods of transit (be that car, bike, streetcars or subways) is important for young adults when they choose which city they want to live/work in.\n"

The removal would be a waste of taxpayer dollars that could be better served in other areas.\nWhen other countries are improving transit and other modes of transportation beyond cars, Ontario chooses to fall behind. This is a complete waste of taxpayer dollars if it happens.\n"

The government of Ontario should be basing its decisions on scientific evidence. Please review this article on the topic:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nI am all in favour of keeping the existing bike lanes on Yonge, University and Bloor Streets in Toronto.\nWhy is the Government of Ontario singling out Toronto for this draconian, wasteful action? Toronto taxpayers have already paid millions of dollars to have bike lanes installed. They are saving lives. Small business likes them.\n"

        "comment": "Doug's vicious threat to remove bike lanes is going to KILL cyclists. CITIES, not the provincial government, know where bike lanes do and don't belong. Stay out of our local business, Queen's Park! Making cycling safe REDUCES gridlock by taking cars off the road and by making the roads safer for everyone. On top of that, ask every Business Improvement Association in an area that has bike lanes and they will tell you that the bike lanes increase foot traffic and local commerce. Listen to your local leaders; they know their neighbourhoods way better than your cabinet. Doug Ford campagined that he was \"For the People\", but guess what, the People don't want to die getting hit by a truck after you rip up the bike lanes that our local leaders have wisely put in place. Your hatred and disregard for the lives and health of your citizens and our children on the roads is not just disappointing but disturbing.\n"

        "comment": "I am dismayed at this proposed bill and firmly oppose it, for the following reasons:\nFirst, it will have no positive impact on gridlock. Ample data from Toronto and other cities around the world make clear that bicycle lanes reduce gridlock. This effect is tangible and intuitive -- for example, my girlfriend bikes to her job at the hospital using the very bike lanes that the bill proposes to reverse. If the lanes are removed, she will feel less safe cycling to work and will rely more on ridesharing. This means additional Ubers and Lyfts clogging up Toronto streets (to and from each trip) for what could have been a simple bike ride. It is utter lunacy that the basic science of this issue is being ignored.\nSecond, it will reduce safety in the city, DIRECTLY contributing to additional deaths of cyclists. This can be measured.\nThird, it is an overreach of provincial government into what is clearly a municipal issue.\nFourth, given that it will actually make gridlock worse, it is purely a waste of taxpayer money.\nI urge the government to consider the clear and overwhelming evidence that investing more into highways at the expense of public transit and bicycle lanes is precisely what has gotten us into this mess. Continuing this disastrous approach will only secure a future of gridlock, economic loss, and cyclist deaths for years to come.\n"

        "comment": "There is extensive evidence showing that the only way to reduce traffic is by providing viable alternatives to automobile transport. Money should be spent on commuter rail improvements, high speed rail, public transportation, and bike lines. Spending money to remove such infrastructure is irresponsible and backwards. Bike lanes should also be a municipal concern, not a provincial one.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto. This decision would waste taxpayer money by destroying recently installed infrastructure while making our streets more dangerous for the growing number of Toronto residents who cycle.\nThe minister's citation of 1.2% cycling commuters relies on outdated 2011 data and fails to reflect current usage, especially post-pandemic. These protected lanes serve as critical infrastructure on major arteries, connecting key destinations, employment centers, and transit hubs. Removing them would fragment the existing network and force cyclists into less safe conditions or back into cars - potentially worsening the very congestion issues this proposal claims to address.\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario has rightly identified this as significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Rather than spending money to remove functioning infrastructure, the province should work collaboratively with the city to optimize our transportation network for all users. Removing these lanes will worsen congestion, degrade air quality, harm businesses, and potentially cost lives.\nI urge the Ministry to maintain these vital bike lanes and instead focus on evidence-based solutions that enhance safety and mobility for all Toronto residents.\n"

We more people to feel safe taking transit or cycling. Prioritizing roads for single passenger private vehicles isn't going to let Toronto scale to become a world class city.\nI choose to cycle to work rather than drive but I know a lot of people who don't feel safe cycling in Toronto. Bike lanes help tremendously.\nThis bill is short sighted and advances a political agenda that does a disservice to the city. It may be popular with drivers (I drive daily in Etobicoke too) but it's the wrong thing to do.\n"

Bike lanes are good for business, good for the environment, good for public and personal health, offer freedom and mobility, and save lives. If you were series about reducing gridlock, you would be support ways of reducing the need to use cars for the people of Ontario. The only way to reduce traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes will increase the number of cars on the road. You are overreaching and meddling in municipal affairs. Cyclists and pedestrians will die because of what you are doing. Leave bike lanes alone.\n"
