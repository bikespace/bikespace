        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am dismayed by the this proposal and the ongoing rhetoric regarding bicycle transport that Mr. Ford has parroted in recent weeks. The totality of evidence in this realm supports that increasing and improving the construction of bicycle infrastructure in the urban environment not only increases ridership but also improves cycling safety and reduces traffic congestion. This evidence is widely available, consistent in effect, and stems from a variety of urban settings across the world including North America. Many experts in fact have relayed summaries of such studies in major media sources in recent weeks in response to this proposal and its associated propaganda. It is clear that Mr. Ford has either chosen to ignore this evidence and expertise in his pursuit or more likely, his goal is not to reap any substantive public service improvement but rather to politicize an issue which he recognizes plays well with a political base sharing a philosophically anti-cycling perspective.\nIf enacted, this proposal would reduce safe cycling options in Ontario cities. This would be a significant step backwards for several reasons. Of foremost interest to Mr. Ford, it would not reduce traffic congestion. In fact, based on experiences in other cities it would likely worsen congestion, particularly in highly populated areas like the GTA and Ottawa by increasing vehicular demand. Secondly, those who continue to cycle (and walk for that matter) will be at higher risk of serious and fatal road-side injury caused by cars and drivers. Thirdly, evidence shows that the downtown small businesses that Mr. Ford claims to support will be financially hurt by the loss of pedestrian and cyclist traffic.\nI will add that as a family physician in Ontario I am increasingly concerned by the effect car-reliance has on the physical well-being of my patients. It is clear that the population rates of physical activity are far too low and this contributes to the development of many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and liver disease among others. By reducing their options to commute in healthier manners, I do feel that Mr. Ford is actively pushing for policies that jeopardize the health of Ontarians.\nIn summary, I argue that Bill 212 should be refuted due to its likelihood to be ineffective in serving its stated purpose to reduce traffic congestion and given the detrimental secondary consequences its policies portend. Our cities can be less congested, safer, healthier, and more liveable via strategic urban planning and targeted investment in public transit and active transport. Mr. Ford would be wise to consider his actions in terms of their policy outcomes and leave behind these divisive political games.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto is saturated with cars so I get that people are frustrated with delays.\nFreeing up a car lane by removing bike lanes may save time briefly, but it'll eventually just get clogged up with cars again.\nYou don't solve traffic by adding more lanes. The 401 is proof of that...\nAnd making it more difficult to get bike lanes added won't solve the problem of bike lanes not being used. They'll just remain unconnected and inconvenient for everyone to use if they don't adequately link places where people live to where they're going.\nBut the limited bike infrastructure that is available not being used has less to do with people being too lazy to bike, and more to do with people feeling unsafe to bike around all those cars.\nBiking has to be safe for everyone outside of just commuters (ie youth, elderly, people running errands etc)\nInvesting in alternatives to driving gives people options besides just driving. Investing in car centric infrastructure just means we'll continue having to deal with driving and traffic.\nthank you\nsome refs:\nThrowing Good Money After Bad Car Infrastructure - Not Just Bikes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-v2-qyCc8\nDo Your Buses Get Stuck in Traffic?

The government should consult the public regarding this and not move in a heavy handed way. Bike lanes allow citizens to travel safely to work without the worry of being run over by aggressive or distracted drivers. Please immediately reverse this poor bill and move on to more important issues. No one is asking for this who wants a better Toronto and Ontario.

        "comment": "As someone who occasionaly drives, i want cyclists in a seperate, protected lane, not in the same lane as cars.\nThe safety of all road users, including cyclists, should not be sacrificed to save a driver a couple seconds. Bike lanes are often added in response to death or serious injury. This heavy-handes approach will only cost the lives of more cyclists and pedestrians, including children.\nStop wasting time and tax dollars on fake solutions and start impementing solutions that will actually relieve congestion, like investment in viable alternatives to driving like mass transit and safe bike infrastructure. Not everyone drives, and the people of ontario who do not drive should not be treated as second class citizens for not contributing to congestion.\nStop with this extra red tape to improve road safety.\n"

        "comment": "Reverting bike lanes back to vehicular lanes to speed up traffic is a poorly-thought out proposal.\n1) Bike lanes faciliate the movement of people and goods, not hinder the flow of people and goods. The thing that really hinders traffic in downtown Toronto is on-street parking. On-street parking does not bring much business to downtown shops since just two cars parked in parallel would take up the entire parking space in front of any shop, and given how most drivers cannot parallel-park quickly or park successfully in one try, they hold up traffic behind them, and when exiting the parking space, they need to merge out to oncoming traffic and once again hold up traffic. Drivers are also forced to move to the next lane and cause congestion/near-misses/actual accidents when cruising down a street and suddenly encountering a parked vehicle ahead. Rather than removing a bike lane, it makes far more sense to remove on-street parking.\n2) Properly configured/Protected bike lanes ensure the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, especially since most drivers in Canada do not have a habit of checking their respective blind spot when turning. Removal of bike lanes is no different from saying that it is totally acceptable to endanger the lives of people who are not travelling by vehicles as long as those travelling by vehicles are not inconvenienced. Are lives really worth that little in Canada?\n3) Traffic in city downtowns have always been bumper-to-bumper. It was bumper-to-bumper before bike lanes were installed. It is bumper-to-bumper after bike lanes were installed. And it will still be bumper-to-bumper if bike lanes are removed. Is there any evidence from anywhere in the world to show that removal of bike lanes in a city causes a significant decrease in travelling time by car? Cars will still have to stop at red lights at every street corner. Cars in downtown Toronto will still be stymied by poor driving etiquette and habits, such as drivers blatantly blocking intersections. No amount of bike lanes, or the lack of it, can remedy this.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this Bill.\nWhy are we focused on building another highway?!  Look at the wasteful cost of this, and to build with no environmental assessments serves only those who benefit from the land values. Land that will be paved over regardless of where it is or what wildlife or water sources are nearby.  Oh, the Ford family wedding guests who own this land, right? Bill 212 is a personal favour.\nIt is ridiculous that money would be focused on a ROAD when there are a dozen other major issues plaguing this province under the current government. If the Ford government cannot get off their ridiculous highway kick, why dont they spend this money on buying back the highway that another conservative government previously sold to foreign investors? Why not buy back 407 and make it free for the residents to use? There is a perfectly good highway already built.\nAnd further, WHY is this government focused on building HIGHWAYS with no environmental assessments instead of fixing our completely exhausted healthcare system?! Or our broken education system?! Or housing?! What does this act propose besides wanton destruction of the environment off the backs of all of Ontario's taxpayers?\nNO I do not support this ridiculous Bill 212. Shame on this government for proposing it. Shame on the corrupted politicians for even focusing on something so ridiculous. The public is watching you VERY closely. This money needs to be put towards fixing healthcare!!!!\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure. Removing them puts cyclists' lives in danger. Whenever I drive and whenever I bike, I appreciate bike lanes for separating cars and bikes, making for a safer and less stressful experience, especially at night or when there is poor visibility.\nMy use of bike lanes is not reflected in the census because I only occasionally bike to work. I also bike for recreation and medium-distance travel. The census also does not reflect when someone bikes to a transit station to get to work. As such, the Government should not be relying solely on the census commuting numbers for making these decisions.\nBill 212 would add a layer of red tape and bureaucracy that cities do not need. The Bill would add delays for infrastructure projects that have already gone through the lengthy process of receiving approval from City Council. The Government should not impose new burdensome processes that we do not need.\nI ask the Government to seriously reconsider this Bill and allow local governments do what they were elected to do.\n"

They provide convenience to cyclists. However, I would much prefer to have the bike lanes removed to have the main thoroughfares back to the way they were. I say this for several reasons:\n(i) as a cyclist, I can find other roads to bike on,\n(ii) if I need to commute along Bloor and the distance is too far for me to cycle, I can take the subway which runs right under Bloor Street,\n(iii) congestion has increased significantly, there is more road rage, and it is near impossible to live life normally in this suburban environment - anything from grocery shopping to taking my child to school - takes nearly twice as long to do, as well as causing spillover traffic into residential neighborhoods which is more dangerous for residents (especially children), and\n(iv) I don't believe proper protocols for consultation were performed to get feedback from the community. Over the past 1.5 years, I don't know many people who have been supportive of adding bike lanes at the expense of car lanes but I have had many conversations with residents of Etobicoke who are upset by the bike lanes.\n"

I completely disagree with the plan the remove bike lanes from Bloor, Yonge and University. As someone who does not own or plan to own a car having choice in transportation is important to me and is one of the reasons I have chosen Toronto as my home. I use bike share to get groceries, explore the city and just move around the city in an efficient and cost effective way. When planning a route the availability of bike lanes directly impacts which method I choose to use. Having less bike infrastructure is not an option - It reduces the number of options I have available to me and makes quality of life worse. If this legislation is passed I expect the government to look at the facts of each section of lanes and commission studies to ensure alternatives are available to people.\n"
