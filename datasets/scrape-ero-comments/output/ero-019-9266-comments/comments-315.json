        "comment": "This is disgraceful!\nToronto was well on its way to becoming a world class city by creating more transport options in a future where car driving is less and less viable because of the shear numbers on the roads.\nOffering a safe way to travel by bike through the city encourages bike use that should be a plan for any city wishing to overcome the outdated idea that roads are just for cars.\nI don\u2019t usually get politically involved but this, to me, strikes at the heart of a government that is overreaching in its capacity to govern the province. Let the city councillors and local voters decide\u2026.. as Mayor Chow said \u201cStay in your lane!\u201d\n"

We need a proper city-wide bike lane network so that people can actually feel safe cycling instead of a patchwork of safe segments with deadly shared-road transitions in between.   We desperately need to be adding bike lanes, not removing the ones already in place.\n"

The bike lanes and additional restrictions of \u2018No Right on Red\u2019 has caused major traffic issues with very little benefit.  Further to that bike lane usage has remained very minimal.  This has given privilege to a few cyclists at the expense of thousands of cars.\nI believe bike lanes are a benefit.  But they need to be implemented in the right places and in much more intelligent ways than what we\u2019ve from Toronto.\nThis city and province can\u2019t restrict and hinder traffic flow when they\u2019ve taken no steps to alleviate congestion in other ways first.  New transit lines remain closed, no new traffic lanes or roads have been built, and we constantly lose mobility due to construction projects.  This  bill needs to happen please.\n"

When more roads are built for cars, the traffic will shortly default to this, and this will lead to more traffic and thus to more congestion on the streets. Bike lanes also save lives and are good for business by increasing foot traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I feel this proposal is incredibly short-sighted, particularly for large urban centres. I live in Toronto, I own a car but I also bike and use the roads as a pedestrian. I live near High Park where density has only increased and the ability to drive, conveniently is not going to be improved by reducing options for bike lane. Making safer alternatives to driving is key. This is similar to the congestion tax in London, England, where for a short time traffic improved but as folks accepted this surcharge it went back to being as full of gridlock as ever. Large cities need to think about driving differently.\nI am a woman, a mother who works full-time and pays taxes. I do not take my safety on the roads lightly - i started cycle commuting several years ago and always look for safe options but many are restricted by areas that have rail corridors, or river crossing where there are few crossing options without venturing into higher car traffic areas that feel unsafe. I was using the Bloor bike lane near Lansdowne earlier this year and noticed that there were 4 bikes at the red light and there were 4 cars. And the cars, all with single drivers took up more than 4 times the space of all 4 of us bikes.\nI have been quite pleased with my city's investment in cycle infrastructure and making it safer and more convenient, particularly connecting sections of road that are more dangerous to cyclists to make it a more viable option to cycle (around rail crossings, bridges, etc). I have noticed that more women are cycling, in my office i am heartened by my peers who are mothers and are very safety conscious, who have felt safe enough start to cycle to work. Large cities are never going to be traffic free and this proposal just makes it more difficult to begin to have alternatives or even experiment with how to offer alternatives and even just plant the seed that maybe there might be an alternative.\nI grew up in Southwestern Ontario where we drove even the shortest distances but it would be amazing not only for the environment but also for our collective health if it were easy and safe to cycle for short trips.\n"

        "comment": "The Toronto Parking Authority (TPA) is pleased to provide comments on Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nAs an agency of the City of Toronto, TPA\u2019s mission is to reimagine how Toronto moves by creating a seamless mobility experience that delivers on choice, ease and speed.\nTPA is a mobility company responsible for over 60,000 parking stalls \u2013 approximately 20,000 on-street and 40,000 off-street, as well as 400+ EV chargers and Toronto\u2019s Bike Share program.\nBike Share Toronto is an affordable, sustainable and convenient mobility option that has become an integral part of the city's transportation network. Since its inception in 2011, the program has seen tremendous success, growing from a system of 80 stations and annual ridership of 400,000 to North America's third largest bike share system with a network of over 825 stations, 9,000 bikes (including 1,900 E-bikes) and projected ridership of 6.8 M in 2024.\nBike Share Toronto has built a loyal base of riders including both commuters and visitors that have chosen to navigate Toronto on a bike to live, work, learn and play. With over 40,000 annual memberships sold in 2024, over the past six (6) months alone in 2024, over 30,000 new individuals have tried the program that have never used Bike Share before. In addition, Bike Share riders rely heavily on our fleet of bikes, with nearly 60% of riders reporting that they do not own a vehicle.\nBike Share riders rely on safe cycling infrastructure to navigate the City. Since the installation of cycling infrastructure on Bloor Street West, ridership in this community grew by 78%. In fact, ridership at specific Bike Share stations, including Bloor St W / Old Mill Trail, grew by 94% after the implementation of new cycling infrastructure along the corridor.\nWithin Toronto\u2019s financial district, Bike Share has become such a popular mode of transportation \u2013 seeing 1,000 riders per day \u2013 that the station now requires staff to manage and corral the flow of bikes. At Toronto\u2019s Hospital Row near University Avenue and Gerrard Street, Bike Share serves 500+ riders per day, including critical members of the medical community such as doctors, nurses, researchers, patients and visitors.\nWith a vision to become the world\u2019s best provider of sustainable parking, bike share and last mile mobility experiences, TPA must balance the needs of its customers \u2013 both cyclists and drivers \u2013 who are navigating a complex and bustling City. In that regard, TPA advocates for evidence-based mobility decisions to address the diverse needs of residents, businesses and visitors utilizing all modes of transportation in Toronto.\nToronto Parking Authority shares the province\u2019s goal of making life easier for Ontarians and helping get people where they need to go. Our mobility programs play a key role in achieving those outcomes and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed legislation.\n"

Having the Provincial government making decisions to remove and/or oversee future city bike lanes is completely ridiculous and well outside it's mandate to \"make roads safer\", safer for who? The privileged drivers of cars in the city do not need more lanes to race through, they need more education on sharing the road with others like pedestrians and cyclists. Drivers also need more options and incentives to leave their cars at home, better transit and bike lane networks will go a long way to reducing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is ill-advised, not rooted in evidence and is overall poor policy. There is no evidence suggesting that adding bike lanes \u2013 however major the thoroughfare \u2013 creates measurably more traffic or gridlock. Traffic is caused by one thing only \u2013 too much single-occupancy vehicle use, i.e. too many people using their cars to get around. The only proven way of reducing traffic is to get people to use other means of transportation, e.g. active transportation such as cycling or public transit. Decades of studies show that adding more lanes of traffic inevitably leads to more congestion through induced demand \u2013 adding more lanes induces people to drive more because you are increasing supply, thus increasing demand. You may see an improvement in traffic conditions for a few years or less, but gridlock will return, often worse than it was before. This is a well-documented phenomenon, both in Canada and abroad. In other words, the policy objective underpinning the proposed legislation, namely that removing bike lanes and returning lanes to motor vehicle traffic will reduce gridlock, is futile and is not supported by scientific evidence.\nWorse, the proposed legislation will endanger the lives of cyclists \u2013 residents and taxpayers of Ontario \u2013 because cyclists, much like motorists, also want to get to their destination using the most direct, quickest way possible. This is basic human behaviour. Cyclists currently using Bloor, University or Yonge will not stop using those roads simply because the bike lanes have been removed. What will change, however, is the number of conflicts and accidents between motorists and cyclists, resulting in potential deaths. Moving bike lanes to secondary roads that often do not offer the same direct, straight-line path to a destination will result in those lanes being underused or unused.\nMunicipalities may be creatures of the Province but this is an unjustified overreach into municipal jurisdiction. The proposed legislation seems more motivated by political greed than by sound policy. The Government should instead focus its resources and taxpayers' money on implementing long-delayed transit projects such as the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, the Hurontario LRT, the painfully stalemated Hamilton LRT and the Ontario Line. This type of micromanagement into municipal jurisdiction is unbecoming of a provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to your proposed regulation  to permit the province to block new bike lanes in municipalities and to remove existing bike lanes.\nThis will do nothing to improve the traffic situation in the city of Toronto. In fact, it will add more cars to the road, since many cyclists are only willing to face the dangers posed by cars and trucks on the road due to the existence of separate bike lanes. This is (to put it mildly) an unbelievably short sighted and non-evidence-based policy that will result in more congestion and more death and injuries to cyclists. Biking is a cheap, healthy, efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. These are all things that should be encouraged in today's society - and indeed, many cities around the world are expanding bike lanes and access for cyclists (Paris and NYC, to name two), and other cities, such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, have been cyclist friendly for years. Just because none of you cycle (I assume) and prefer to drive, is no reason to prevent the rest of us from doing it.\nAs an example, it takes me about the same time to bike or drive to my office in Toronto's financial district. But unlike driving, cycling is free - I don't have to pay for gas or $35 dollars per day to park. And it is faster and cheaper than taking the TTC. As a bonus, I get a bit of a work out on my way to and from work.\nThere have been numerous studies showing that the addition of bike lanes actually REDUCE congestion. And believe it or not, the bike lanes near me (on the Danforth) and near my office (on Adelaide Street West) and in between are in full use all winter. We are hardier than you think!\nFurthermore, the government of Ontario should not be PAYING to remove bike lanes. We have plenty of better things to spend our (taxpayers like me) money on: I would prefer fully funded hospitals, schools, transit and housing, to name a few, instead of wasting our tax dollars to rip out bike lanes that are fully utilized and are actually one of the answers to Toronto's congestion problems. Our healthcare system is crumbling and my kids attend underfunded public  schools that are short staffed and in serious need of building repair - but you decide to waste the province's limited finances on removing bike lanes?\nI also do not understand why the province is once again interfering with municipal decision making. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, made by the mayor and city council and not made by MPPs who live nowhere near the municipalities in question.\nFinally, in order to assist you in making policy, based on evidence and facts, rather than on anecdotes, I have also attached some links to actual studies for your consideration (also just search \u201cToronto bike lanes\u201d on Twitter/x to see how much popular support there is for bike lanes).\nI sincerely hope you will reconsidered this policy decision - it will ultimately lead to more congestion and more death and injury to cyclists.\nThe provincial government is intended to represent all residents of Ontario: not just drivers. We non-drivers and very occasional drivers pay taxes too, and we have kids who bike because they are too young to drive. And we believe that the roads should be safe and accessible for all residents, whether they are  drivers or  non-drivers or taxpayers or non-taxpayers. You have lost my trust that you represent anyone other than your donors and your cronies.\n"
