        "comment": "I strongly oppose to remove bike lanes.\n1. The budget amount isn\u2019t small, and could\u2019ve been better spent on upgrading public transportation infrastructures.\n2. As an occassional driver, bike lanes makes me feel safer to drive on roads since bikes are guaranteed to be on a separate lane. I don\u2019t wanna mess with bikes and get myself into accidents.\n3. These roads, especially Yonge and Bloor Streets, are important but not major roads. These segments are also well covered by subways. There are many alternatives available in downtown area, deprioritizing cars along these segments doesn\u2019t bring much negative impacts.\n4. On the contrary giving back one lane each for cars will cause induced traffic, causing more gridlocks.\nI don\u2019t see a great value or a great reason to removing those bike lanes. Please don\u2019t waste our money into this work!\n"

I\u2019ve felt safer biking in the city and think it reflects the values we need to hold on to as we move further into a climate crisis. Traffic is a concern in our city but I don\u2019t think tearing out the bike lanes is the answer.\nWhen live nation was operating there was an increase to traffic in the area, a large portion of one lane of traffic was always unusable due cars parked in that lane waiting to pick people up. These things need to be addressed along with improving ttc.\n"

        "comment": "Please provide proof that removing bike lanes reduces traffic.\nToronto would look less like other world class cities that have bike lanes.\nMore and more travellers are choosing to bicycle. Car ownership for Generation Z is dramatically decreasing. E-bikes are rising in popularity.\nBike lanes are the way forward in Toronto. It's the only way to serve the new condo towers that drive the rising population density.\nGoing back to 2 car lanes is like maxing out 1 more credit card before declaring bankruptcy. There's no avoiding the transportation needs of the rising population (which in turn make us a world class city).\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my profound disagreement with this proposed bill. Municipal road use should be the purview of municipal government and community consultation. This bill is a significant provincial overreach and undermines local government.\nMore importantly, there is not a single region in the world that is tearing up bike lanes at a time of profound climate change and vulnerable road user safety concerns. The data being put forward by the government to justify this bill is at best wrong or stale and, at worst, purposefully misleading. Bike lanes are a vital aspect of any transportation network and a continued, exclusive focus on cars ignores the basic, fundamental problem that there are simply too many single occupancy vehicles on the road. The politics of nostalgia are not moving us forward.\nLastly, spending public dollars on this effort while our education and healthcare systems remain underfunded is a wonton disregard for the public interest and fiduciary duty of government.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock and will only make commuting more dangerous for vulnerable road users. If the province's goal is to reduce gridlock, it should improve access to public transit and add more bike lanes. More research is required before any bike lanes are removed from the city. This level of overreach is extremely disappointing and short sighted. As well, adding more highways will not reduce traffic. Instead, this creates more traffic due to induced demand.\n"

        "comment": "Because of the principle of induced demand (https://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf) it is highly unlikely that removing bike lanes will reduce the time that it takes for drivers to drive a particular route. Rather, traffic volumes will increase until the congestion returns to the same level. This means that this bill will reduce the number of people using active transportation methods like cycling, while increasing the number of people driving, without any side benefits such as reducing emissions from idling. As such, it is directly contrary to maintaining a healthy climate for Ontarians, both in terms of risks to us from climate change, and in terms of pollution related health problems.\nTo reduce congestion, Ontario should install more bike lanes:\n\"The effect of cycling on congestion\n5. Cycling improvements lead to 45% less car traffic and faster\npublic transport (Copenhagen, Denmark)\n6. Cycle highway reduces time spent in congestion by 3.8 million\nhours (The Netherlands)\n7. Cycle highway network reduces the need for 50,000 car\njourneys daily (Ruhr area, Germany)\n8. Bike share programme eases congestion during city works\n(Bordeaux, France)\n9.

        "comment": "I think removing bike lanes or preventing municipalities from introducing them on certain roads is flawed legislation.\n1. There is no evidence or studies to support the assertion that traffic flow is increased or driving time is diminished by a significant amount, if any. A far more significant factor for congestion in Toronto is the immense amount of construction.\n2. The province should stay in its legislative lane.\n3. The City of Toronto needs to plan for a massive increase in population. Part of this planning involves how people will get around. We simply have to encourage modes of transportation that do not involve driving a motorized vehicle.\n4. A Toronto Star article investigated how the bike lane issue became so divisive in Etobicoke - without blaming any parties for this divisiveness, I think the province could play an important mediating role in helping calm down the conflict and reaching a compromise.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is absurd and will further endanger the lives of cyclists not to mention the future of our planet. Anyone who has been on a bike lane in Toronto knows how busy and well-used they are. Removing bike lanes will only add to congestion as cyclists uncomfortable with riding without them will be pushed into vehicles, and cyclists pushed onto the road with cars will cause problems for drivers. As someone who moved to Toronto from Vancouver, I was shocked by how dangerous cycling already is in this city. We rely on separated lanes such as the Bloor bike lane precisely because there are no side road alternatives. Separated lanes are better for both cyclists and drivers as they keep us both safe. Bike lanes are better for businesses too, as they\u2019ve been shown to increase sales and foot traffic. The vast majority of people who live in Toronto don\u2019t want to live in a city designed for cars - we could go to Calgary for that. The province needs to stop meddling in municipal issues. \u201cSaving you time act\u201d? Saving WHO time? This bill will only make my commute more challenging, stressful, dangerous, and time consuming.\n"

        "comment": "I appreciate the opportunity to make a comment.  Each muncipality should have agency when it comes to making decisions about gridlock in their communities.  Provincial authorities should NOT be involved in consultations at all.  Stakeholders from the community and city planners are the ones with the expertise.  This is yet another example of complete overreach by the current conservative government into the affairs of Toronto and other urban centres in Ontario.  So many problems facing urban centres in Ontario.  Congestion can be solved with a car tax.  Fund public transportation, not cars.\n"

The province is wasting tax payer dollars (again) with a seemingly odd vengeance towards biking. Biking is a respectable, sustainable, cheap, and accessible method of transit for all people. I do not support the province's interjection with municipal decisions and I see this as a breach of power.\nSidewalks are everywhere and bike lanes should be too. I used to work right in the area (university and college) and never saw or experienced terrible traffic. Stop prioritizing cars before people.\n"
