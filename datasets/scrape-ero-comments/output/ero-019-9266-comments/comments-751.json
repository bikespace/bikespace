        "comment": "I am an active user of the Yonge, Bloor, and University bike lanes. They provide a safe space for commuters who want to live active and healthy lifestyles. These bike lanes also enable me to get to and from work FASTER than using a car, or even public transit.\nBy removing these bike lanes, it will discourage some people from cycling, but will likely not drastically affect the number of cyclists.\nThis means that cyclists lives are in danger EVEN MORE than they already are with designated bike lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes will not reduce automobile congestion/gridlock - it will remain the same, or may slow down since cyclists will be on the roads alongside cars.\nThese bike lanes should be maintained in the winter to encourage more people to be able to commute safely. This can also encourage the reduction of people sharing indoor spaces during the winter, which can contribute lower viral spread like the flu or other infections.\nBike lanes make Toronto a city that is more accessible to more people. Too many cyclists have been hurt or killed by drivers, which also is a tax on the health care system and negatively impacts the lives of many people.\nI moved to my current neighbourhood because of the addition of the Yonge St Bike lane, and have been so happy over the past 3 years because I've been able to commute safely to and from my job at a hospital in downtown Toronto, while enjoying time outdoors and reducing my commute time. Now it feels like my safety is being stripped from me.\nPLEASE KEEP THE BIKE LANES. PLEASE MAKE AN EFFORT TO KEEP MORE OF YOUR CITIZENS SAFE.\n"

        "comment": "This is a comment on the bike lane legislation.  I live in Waterloo, Ontario.\nI believe this legislation is not good.  First, the province is entering into the domain of local politics (i.e., legislative overreach), which is rather presumptuous.  I'm not sure how Queen's Park will have the ability to properly assess past initiatives or future initiatives in all the municipalities in a province of this size.  Just to add to it, I think the current Premier often complained when Queen's Park would stick itself into the business of the City of Toronto, so I'm wondering why things are different now.\nSecond, if this really is about recent bike lane construction in Toronto, then limit the scope of the legislation to just those initiatives. Again, how a bike lane down Bloor St should affect Waterloo or Niagara Falls or Ottawa or Timmins is beyond me.  It's presumptuous an a little patronizing to think that the government of the day would have the ability to properly assess and make a call on such a local issue.\nThird, where are the resources for this?  Will Gov.Ont actually refund the muncipalities for extensive construction works to build, and then tear down and re-build?   I also think of the actually time-cost of getting MTO or whatever ministry to conduct these assessments.  This legislation will make problems where there were no problems before in this regard.\nFourth, I get the sense that this is a political values issue.  The government's MPPs, cabinet members, and premier himself, has done a wonderful job creating a \"car vs. bike\" mentality on this. That's plain wrong.  Stop it.  This is not good civics.  the political expediency is coming at the cost of just general good relations between neighbours.\nThere are a few other issues you'll hear from others - environmental impact, the safety of cyclists on roads, etc.  These are all critical and I invite you to consider all of them carefully.\nFinal thoughts: this one to me comes down to good governance.   Queen's Park should not give itself the authority to over-ride very local decisions.  That's why muncipalities and regions were legislated into being in the first place.  i'm rather offended at the heavy-handedness of this legislation.  The easiest fix is to constrain its scope to the streets in Toronto that the Premier has such a personal issue with.\n"

It is an over-reach in other words.\nWe are in a terrible climate crisis, and need to focus on strengthening municipal bike networks, public transit, and inter-city travel by electrified trains and creation of busways. We need to de-emphasize our reliance on individual vehicles, even electric ones. We need to reduce sprawl and move trucks onto the 407 highway. We need to make it cheaper and easier to use transportation alternatives, and stop privileging car drivers.\nRescind Bill 212 and provide adequate resources to municipalities to strengthen their public transportation and bicycle networks.\nAnd open the Eglinton Crosstown! This will make a big difference for Torontonians' travel time.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the section of this proposal. I do not support anything that would slow or limit the rollout of a safe and comprehensive transportation network for bikes and PEVs.  The buildout of bike lanes in my region, Kitchener-Waterloo, has allowed me to cut my car usage almost in half. Every day the weather is nice, I can bike or take an EUC to work or on other errands. This gets my car off of the road, and improves my physical and mental health. It also would not have been possible where I live 10 years ago.\nThe buildout of bike lanes in our region has made it a better place to live, but it is not yet sufficient. So long as we have multiple stories a year of people commuting dying on our local roads, uptake of this form of transportation will be limited. For those counting, this means more cars on the road and slower traffic. We need more bike lanes, and more support for slow, unprotected forms of locomotion.\nI strongly suspect any extra roadblocks to better infrastructure will reduce the speed at which the network is built out, which will reduce uptake of personal transportation, making our roads busier; non-drivers less mobile; our residents less happy and healthy; our province worse.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider requiring provincial consent for any new bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a newer cyclist in the city and the bike lanes have been a major encouraging factor in starting to bike to get around the city. The bike lanes help me feel comfortable and safe. My major reason for starting to bike around Toronto was the extremely slow and unreliable commute times on the TTC. Biking around the city has given me back control of my commute, and helps me get around the city MUCH faster than I can with the TTC. MY commute to work along King St (E to W) on the streetcar can range from 20-40 minutes depending on the time of day, whereas my commute on the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond are consistently 15-20 minutes.\nI almost exclusively use streets with bike lanes or side streets if not available, and I still feel as though sometimes my commute is unsafe due to cars not respecting the bike lanes. I can only imagine this getting worse if bike lanes were to be removed completely.\nAlso worth noting, if bike lanes were to be removed, it would force me to take ubers in the city even more, putting MORE cars on the road and causing MORE traffic period.\n"

Not bike lanes.\nRemoving these key lanes from downtown will do nothing but make it unsafe for cyclists in the city. People WILL die as a result of removing these lanes.\nInstead of spending millions to remove these lanes - the province would be better served on opening delayed transit projects and supporting more robust transit that would reduce the need to take cars in the first place.\nThis blatant overreach from the province is abhorrent and not good policy in any way.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the downtown immediately adjacent to the Bloor and Sherbourne bike lanes. I use a bike for the vast majority of my commutes to work, as well as to visit friends, shop, and attend restaurants. I have lived in Toronto without a car for almost 20 years.\nTransit and micromobility are the only way to efficiently move the high and increasing downtown population to where they need to go. Cars can simply not scale, and we have recognised this by building many thousands of units that do not have parking spaces.\nPeople on bikes deserve safety - drivers are using larger and larger vehicles and, anecdotally, driving more and more aggressively while traffic enforcement remains lower than in the past. Even on small side streets some drivers seem to get a kick out of tailgating and close passing cyclists.\nThis bill will make Toronto significantly worse for local residents in order to attempt to allow commuters to move through the city more quickly. Counter to the government's claims, this is not good for business. As the Bloor Annex BIA demonstrates - bike lanes are good for business.\nThis bill will take us back into construction pain along University. University had significant traffic issues this year - due to Ontario line construction, pain at the York and King intersection which was causing box blocking on University at King, and water main work on university which was paired with the bike lane builds. Now that the construction on the southbound side is complete the traffic issues have subsided.  The bill will take us right back in to that construction hell - leading to many more months of congestion on a road that is now working efficiently.\nWe need solutions for congestion that actually work. Proper signal priority for our streetcars, bus lanes along Dufferin and other important corridors, improvements to signal timing, enforcement of box blocking. This bike lane bill is posturing - attacking local decision making in a terrible precedent. Toronto overwhelmingly rejected the two loudly anti bike-lane candidates and elected as mayor the most pro-bike candidate. It is unclear why people in Brampton and Niagara should have more of a say over our local roads, paid for with our property taxes, than we do.\n"

Bill 212 will thwart Toronto\u2019s goals in achieving TransformTO and VisionZero. It is a clear overstep from the provincial government and a distraction from the issues of healthcare, education and the housing market that are going unaddressed. This is not just about Toronto however, the smaller municipalities will face the brunt of this decision without the same pushback or organizing in place.\nWhy, on the hottest year on record with the climate crisis and with the cost of living choking out so many Canadians are we choosing to make a car the best option of transport?  This is not a fight between drivers and cyclists or pedestrians and drivers this is a fight between life and death.\nThere is no strong evidence to suggest this bill will solve congestion nor a plan for the provincial government to address the issue beyond this. Cyclists will be forced into the lanes with cars, adding to congestion and putting lives in danger. You have to answer to the family and friends of the thousands of pedestrians and cyclists killed in collisions in Ontario all whose preventable deaths will be repeated with this legislation.\n"
