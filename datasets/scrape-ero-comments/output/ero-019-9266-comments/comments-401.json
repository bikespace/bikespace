        "comment": "Request for Comment on Enhancing Cycling Safety on Yonge Street\nFor the past 43 years, I have commuted for work or school along Yonge Street, traveling from Eglinton down to College or Queen. During this time, I\u2019ve witnessed Toronto\u2019s transformation into a much denser urban environment. As subway congestion increases, cycling has become an increasingly practical, time-efficient, and health-conscious mode of transport.\nResearch indicates that every minute spent exercising can extend life expectancy by up to four minutes, a powerful incentive for integrating exercise like cycling into daily routines. Beyond health benefits, cycling has allowed me to avoid heavy vehicle emissions, enjoying cleaner air and improved personal well-being.\nHowever, this form of transport also carries risks. Over the years, I\u2019ve experienced three accidents on Yonge street prior to the lanes: once when a drunk driver reversed into and destroyed my bike, a second time when a driver sideswiped me due to insufficient space, and a third time when a pedestrian unexpectedly stepped out from behind a planter. Fortunately, none of these incidents resulted in hospitalization, but they serve as reminders of the inherent dangers cyclists face on busy streets.\nThe German adage, \"Trust is good, but control is better,\" aptly applies here. While trust in road-sharing etiquette is essential, effective infrastructure is paramount. To protect both cyclists and drivers\u2014especially those less accustomed to navigating Toronto\u2019s downtown\u2014designing dedicated, well-separated cycling lanes on Yonge Street could drastically reduce risks.\nMy experiences underscore the need for improved cycling infrastructure that prioritizes safety. By keeping cyclists separated from vehicle traffic, we can foster a safer, more accessible, and healthier commuting environment for all. I urge the Ontario government to consider these changes in future urban planning to enhance safety and promote cycling as a sustainable form of urban transportation.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a horrible idea. I'm appalled that, as a tax payer, my money would be going towards the removal of existing bike lanes around Toronto. Bike lanes do not cause congestion and research has shown they actually lessen it.\nFurthermore, removing bike lanes would make the city less safe for cyclists, who would have no choice but to cycle in the middle of the road instead, making it more dangerous to be a cyclist or driver AND increasing congestion.\nEnvironmentally speaking, this project should not be allowed to go through -- cycling is one of the greenest modes of transportation, and we should be encouraging it, not removing infrastructure that allows it to be more accessible. The removal and reconstruction process that making these changes would require would also emit more toxins than just leaving things as they are would. Also, the construction work required by this proposal would dramatically increase congestion in the short term while not even decreasing it long term, because having bike lanes lessens congestion.\nThis proposed legislation is disgraceful and I am firmly opposed to it. The province should instead be building more bike lanes to encourage cycling as a mode of transportation that is beneficial to the environment, the flow of traffic, and individual health. I do not support this piece of legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI'm writing to voice my absolute opposition to what is outlined in Bill 212. As a resident of Toronto for over 10 years, and a nearly daily cyclist that entire time, I'm appalled by the logic (or lack thereof) of the proposal to remove well-used bike infrastructure across the city. The recently completed upgrades to University Avenue in particular. I was struck by a car there last year \u2014 the driver made a sudden right turn from University to Dundas as I was about to enter the intersection on my bicycle (on a green light). The new lanes are fantastic. I feel much safer, there are still two lanes for vehicles, while still retaining room for street parking. To have all of that torn up, like what was done to Jarvis St. early last decade, is fiscally irresponsible for one, and dangerous.\nWhile \"the bike lanes thing\" makes me mad, Schedule's 2 and (especially) 3 of this bill make me sick. Reading, in part:\n\"The Schedule enacts the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nWhat is even the point of having an Environmental Assessment Act? Why bother having any sort of protections or laws if the Premier can just try to bypass them altogether? To what, cater to cars? Good grief, these people need to take a trip to Tokyo or Taipei or even Montreal to see how it can be. Get some light rail projects finished first before paving the Greenbelt.\nTo quote Toronto's \"unmitigated disaster\" of a mayor, Olivia Chow, Doug Ford should stay in his lane. My family in Sudbury would love it if he could stop obsessing over Toronto.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am very concerned about this bill, and its implications for the future of this province. There are many reasons to NOT pass a bill that restricts the development of bike lanes in cities around Ontario. Here are a few:\n1. SAFETY: This is, ultimately, about life or death. We experience road fatalities all the time and removing protected bike infrastructure would make this worse. STOP USING PEOPLE AS PAWNS IN YOUR POLITICAL GAMES!!!! Doug Ford should be ashamed of this plan which WILL lead to more deaths on our roads. I am so sick and tired of seeing this PC party turning matters of FACT into matters of POLITICS. ENOUGH!! The people are sick of it. We need to protect vulnerable road users. Imagine if someone suggested removing all sidewalks to make more room for cars? This would be ludicrous but that is essentially the same thing that's happening here except it's worse because cyclists are even more vulnerable due to their higher speed and needing to balance on two wheels. Please PLEASE PLEASE do not pass this bill. You WILL have blood on your hands. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/she-loved-to-ride-her-bike-cyclist-kil\u2026. Do you want more of these incidents????? I am so depressed and frankly embarrassed of my province that this is even up for debate.\n2. This would be a massive provincial overreach. WHY is the province trying to micromanage decisions that are better left to local leaders and municipalities that know the situation on the ground and can make better decisions for local communities. The Government of Ontario should building housing and improving PUBLIC healthcare, not wasting OUR TAX DOLLARS on this issue.\n3. This would make DRIVING WORSE. As a regular driver, I DO NOT WANT cyclists having to share lanes with drivers. But if this plan passes, this would be the result. That, or cyclists on sidewalks running into old people and kids who are walking. The ONLY SOLUTION is SEPARATION. With proper SEPARATED AND PROTECTED bike lanes, cyclists and drivers are kept separate, allowing safer and easier travel for both cyclists and drivers, and transit!\n4. Children. Think of the children who ride their bikes to get to school or to playdates. Especially when it gets dark early. Do you want them to be forced to bike with cars or take a long and potentially dangerous route through side streets? Side streets are NOT the solution here because they don't connect properly. Eventually you'll have to cross a busy road or ride on one. And when that happens, do you want those kids getting hit by cars because there's nowhere for them to ride safely? I mean COME ON! Think of the poor parents who would have to live knowing that their kid was killed because DOUG FORD AND THE PC PARTY want to play politics with this life or death issue. Get a grip, folks.\nFINALLY, I want to say the public has been so misled on this issue by the Ford Government. At first we were told it was all about reducing congestion, and they would carefully look at the data. Instead, we're getting a bunch of pathetic LOSERS in government who just want to rip up bike lanes to suit their own fantasies and appease their base of sadly misinformed supporters. The proposed bill doesn't even distinguish between side streets and main streets, which, TO BE CLEAR, would NOT solve this issue. The issue is this:\nHave you ever heard of these studies? https://cityobservatory.org/the-fundamental-global-law-of-road-congesti\u2026\nThis is a fundamental law of city design. You cannot ESCAPE MATH AND SCIENCE AND STATISTICS. The ONLY SOLUTION TO CAR TRAFFIC IS VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING. You take out the bike lanes, you'll have more and more people in cars and Ubers. Not everyone can afford to buy a car, and not everyone will take the subway or streetcar or bus. Lots of these people will either drive or bike. And you'd be forcing them to drive. Enough of this nonsense. Look at the damn data and research and stop playing politics.\nIf you can't tell, I AM ANGRY. It is an embarrassment to this province and this country that we are still having this discussion in 2024. Get with the program, get with the times, and realize that the only solution to your \"congestion problem\" is to get people OUT OF THEIR CARS. GOD HELP the people of Ontario if this bill passes. We will be screwed. And Ford wants another four years in power. Seriously. This is a real shame. Please, look at the data and the evidence and recognize that this bill is a waste of taxpayer dollars, is not worth even considering, and will lead to needless loss of life.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is sheer madness.  Its main result will be to reduce freedom of choice for every resident by forcing people into vehicles.  This legislation will make life worse for everyone - including motorists.\nI cannot afford to drive a car as a regular form of daily transportation, so for me riding a bike is an essential part of my daily life as it allows me to access places that would be time-consuming or costly to access otherwise.  This legislation will put my life in danger just for conducting my daily routine, by eliminating a safe method of getting around.  I rely on the bike lane network to get to places, both for work-related purposes and businesses that I patronize.  I use, in particular, the University, Bloor and Yonge bike lanes in Toronto regularly for these purposes and I consider them essential to my ability to perform my daily activities.\nWithout a safe bike network, I would be forced to spend money on either transit or Uber, which would disincentivize these trips for me and hurt local businesses due to my frequenting them less.  Furthermore, both of these alternatives use the roads and cause traffic to worsen, not improve as the legislation naively assumes without evidence.  Every bicycle on the streets means one less vehicle clogging up the roads.  Even the occasional times when I do drive on the roads, the congestion is very bad on streets that don't even have bike lanes, including Yonge St in downtown Toronto and the Gardiner Expressway.  The traffic is not because of bikes, but because of too many cars on the road.  The removal of choice that the legislation brings about is counterproductive for everyone involved and does nothing but play to the biases of the uninformed by ignoring the true causes of traffic in favour of an easy scapegoat, namely bicycles.\nMany people use these bike lanes to get around, including delivery cyclists, as well as commuters and business patrons.  I note that the lanes are always heavily utilized whenever I am on them, and I can also see the University bike lanes from my residence and can verify that they are always hosting bike traffic, contrary to some misleading claims that they are sparsely used.  During rush hour, I regularly see that there are almost as many bicycles going down the road as there are cars.  This bike traffic represents essential commerce, productivity and mobility which will be suppressed if this legislation is put into effect, to the detriment of the local economy and the quality of life of thousands of people, including the motorists who will have to deal with even worse congestion than ever due to the resulting increase in vehicular traffic.\nMoving the bike lanes to \"side streets\" is also not viable, as side streets do not lead to the same destinations without having to take ridiculously convoluted paths that double or triple the normal trip time - not to mention that businesses and destinations usually lie on the main street, not the side streets.  If it was viable to take side streets to reach one's destination, then vehicles themselves could just as easily take those side streets and there would be no issue.\nI urge the government to withdraw this disastrous legislation and to safeguard the freedom of choice of the people of Ontario.  Municipal decisions should be left up to municipalities and should reflect the needs of the people who live there.  This legislation is a massive waste of taxpayer money, and for the sole purpose of making life worse, not better, for everyone.  I will vote against any government that actively meddles with municipal affairs to make life worse and less convenient for people and businesses, and will recommend to all family and friends to do the same.\n"

        "comment": "Please abandon this proposal! It is deeply problematic for the future of Ontario. The provincial government should not be interfering in city roads without very strong cause. This flies counter to how road management has long since been handled. The idea that the people of cities like Toronto can vote for their mayor and municipal representatives yet have that vote overridden due to a provincial government that does not represent the city is undemocratic.\nAs well, the idea that reducing bike lanes would solve traffic problems is deeply flawed. Please consult the civil engineering experts that the provincial government surely has access to. Induced demand means that just adding a lane is not a magical solution for traffic. Bike lanes are highly efficient and most importantly an investment in the future, where we *need* to be reducing our dependence on automobile traffic.\nInstead, to solve traffic, improve public transit! For example, why is there still no high speed rail along the Windsor-Quebec City corridor? There's been plans for one for decades but they always fall through. Use the political energy that you seem to have to drive that through. Completing such a mega project would give you a far better legacy than just retaining a lane for cars.\nAlso, even worse is the recent comments from Premier Ford about *removing* existing bike lanes. Overriding municipalities to prevent new bike lanes is bad enough, but removing existing ones is a horrible waste of resources. The city spent a great deal of money building those bike lanes. The province should not be tearing them down on a whim.\n"

A reduction in congestion, emissions, noise pollution and an increase in the local economy and overall happiness of the community.
