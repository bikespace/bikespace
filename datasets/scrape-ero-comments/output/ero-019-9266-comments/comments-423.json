I chose who I voted for at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels based on their policy positions and this legislation invalidates my choices.\nI fundamentally don't understand why we are prioritising increased traffic flow on routes that are not sensible thoroughfares for cars. Even less so why that would be desirable over cyclist and pedestrian safety.\n"

It does not make sense to confine your bicycle transportation routes to waterfront and river trails - this new trail provides much needed pathways within the city.  Driving across Bloor has never been an efficient way to get through Toronto.  Bike lanes are the responsible way to move people in the city of Toronto!\n"

If urban bike lanes are not the exclusive purview of local municipalities then I can\u2019t think of anything that is. If the Premier thinks he is well positioned at Queens Park to micro manage issues clearly best delegated to municipal councils, he should campaign on rescinding the Municipal Act and disbanding Ontario\u2019s almost 450 municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nRemoving bike lanes is not the way forward, it is a huge step back in progress to make cities cleaner, greener, safer and more livable for residents.\n"

        "comment": "This is an extremely wrong headed decision, from perspectives of environmental policy, urban design, and constitutional order. The province should not be dictating cycling infrastructure at city level. Those are local decisions. It also is, from an Outcomes perspective, the wrong decision. These partial bikelanes save lives, and make commuting easier by bike. Justifying this decision with several year old census data is not grounded in good policy making. Congestion will never be fixed by building one more lane. That is the fact of induced demand - but it works both ways. You can induce cycling demand and reduce congestion by pulling people into bike commuting from their cars.\nI will never support a government that removes critical infrastructure to make the Premier's personal commute easier. I moved here from BC two years ago, and miss the sensible environmental stewardship of the now defunct BC Liberals. This is not conservatism. This is nonsense.\n"

However, almost all research, logic, and experience is against the notion that more lanes improve traffic flow.\nIf reducing congestion is the goal, then increasing car infrastructure is last on the list of effective solutions.\n"

We need more Provincial oversight going forward.\nPlease urgently consider removing the bike lane on Adelaide. That street is a major West-East artery that has been clogged by an ultra wide bike lane and curb left turn lanes.

Why don't you focus on finishing your LRT lines which are a complete boondoggle rather than punishing bike riders who are being unfairly blamed for traffic congestion caused by lazy drivers and vehicles becoming 50% bigger in 20 years.\nDo not dictate terms to Toronto - this is what our government is for.\n"

Do we want more cars in the city? When youre cooking and you forgot the tomatoes, would you rather hop on a bike or walk to the store, or do you think its good to drive? Do you even live in the city and wonder why we ask these things?\nThe perceived lack of cyclists is because the infrastructure is lacking. The overwhelming amount of cars is because the infrastructure is currently created for cars, creating more lanes for cars will bring in more cars, and that through every study and survey amplifies and induces demand and the traffic will never improve as nobody has any safe alternative options.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely horrible. I deeply oppose this bill. Do you want to stop the gridlock? Give people more options for transportation, not less! Our cities should be built for people, not just cars and this is completely going in the opposite direction. What happens when you cut down on other transportation options and more people are forced to drive to get anywhere? How will that solve the gridlock? Buses, trains, trams and biking are all excellent options for reducing traffic. Cars already own so much of the city infrastructure and as bikers, we get so little!\nI live in London, Ontario, where congestion is so bad, on some days it is easier to take my bike than to drive (and it is a nightmare to drive anyway). Every single biker I know has been hit by a car (myself included). When I bike on the road, I risk my life, when I bike on the sidewalk, pedestrians get mad at me (which is fair, I shouldn't be there but it's that or death). All we have are those basic bike lanes and we can't even have that because Doug Ford is bent on building a highway. How do you get a highway? By making congestion so bad in the city that people begin to feel a highway is a good idea. More lanes of traffic don't ease gridlock, studies show it makes it worse. Build it and they will come, build more roads, cut down less transportation options and the gridlock will worsen as more people drive.\nWhat about safety?\nWhere will the cyclists go? In between the cars that can kill us with a touch?\nWhat about the drivers? Do you think they actually want bikers to bike in the streets with them? We're not traffic, we're not vehicles, we're bikes, we're a different category that needs its own lanes where we can be safe from cars.\nTo anyone that says 'We have so few people bike, we don't need infrastructure.' You don't have bikers because you don't have infrastructure. I bike every day, I have lived in London for two years, and I have seen new bike lanes pop up and people flock to them. It is dangerous biking in London, of course, but there is a growing community coming to these bike lanes that I have seen. Do you know what would attract more bikers? Making bike routes safe. Biking is the best! And it's a great thing for cities to invest in it. It is good for your wallets, your health, and pollution (noise and air). More bikers mean less traffic. Doug sees that and that's why he's attacking bikers, because he wants his highway. It has nothing to do with bikers, it has everything to do with a powerful man wanting to make money and willing to throw a whole group of people under the bus (literally) to do it.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am writing to say I oppose the Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several reasons.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that will help reduce traffic and congestion, such as building and enhancing transit options. This approach would better serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nAs more people come to live in the GTA in the next decade traffic congestion will only continue to get worse as more people will want to commute to Toronto. Removing bike lanes will not make any meaningful impact on congestion and traffic. We need to greatly expand transit options so we can provide alternative modes of transportation and get cars off the roads.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\nThank you.\nSincerely,\nA resident of Toronto\n"

Given that another lane of traffic will be reinstalled, the rule of induced demand means that it will just remain gridlocked. the bike lanes had ample reason and rationale to have been installed on these major routes in the city; there are a myriad of bicyclists who actually live in Toronto who rely on these on these bike paths for a safe commute. the fact that Doug Ford and his government deems \"drivers\" to be the priority for downtown commutes shows a biased preference for a mode of transportation we must look to other large metropolitan cities and adopt those policies, and not those that cater to big motor vehicles that take up way too much space and are oftenly occupied by single drivers.\n"
