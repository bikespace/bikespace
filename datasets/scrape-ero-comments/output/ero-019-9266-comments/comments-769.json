        "comment": "I support bike lanes in the city of Toronto where it makes sense. Ripping out 2 lanes of traffic on Bloor Street and executing the most confusing and convoluted set of lanes made no sense. The usage and demand is not there and the congestion it created is unacceptable. We should be installing bike lanes on secondary streets or converting sidewalks to two way multi use trails like they have in Europe. Also, there should be true community consultation when bike lanes are being installed. I participated in the meetings - the decision was made already and they were looking into feedback on how they were implemented - bollocks vs curbs etc. I support Doug Ford\u2019s proposed legislation!!\n"

        "comment": "This issue has really brought to light the mismanagement of city funds for construction and the inability to price and excite appropriately. The bike lanes were inefficiently installed and are limiting to tax payers access to important resources. Bloor ST is a route to hospitals and medical clinics, children's extra curricular activities and work. The work that pays us to afford the taxes. The fact that the driving time has doubled since the bike lanes and the highway construction has begun is crippling.\nWe used to be a city where we could travel around freely and now it feels like we're locked with lanes that rarely have cyclists on them. We don't have the climate for this to work. It also is creation larger issues with the higher speed electric or gas bicycles, dirt bikes, scooters that are using the lanes faster than cars can travel. Children are now riding these vehicles and there is no trainman or licensing in affect. It makes drivers uneasy.\n"

        "comment": "The policy has not been thought through in all its dimensions. The plan may have some unintended consequences: removing bike lanes will mean pushing cyclists onto the roadway and sharing the road with cars - this could slow down traffic even more.  Recall the 90's when bike couriers and other commuters shared the road because there were no lanes, and bike are considered vehicles on our roadways.\nIf bike lanes are removed, I imagine that I and others on bikes will be on the roadways, joined by e- bikes and other e-vehicles - think through what this will mean for the speed of car-traffic and safety for all.\nThe Bill is remiss in its consideration of safety and environmental impact. Inevitably, more people will be injured and killed if they are forced to share the road on bikes and e-vehicles.  The number of cars on the road will grow, and the environmental impact of those cars will also grow.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for collecting comments on this matter.\nBike lanes are an integral part of movement through the city. They should be a municipal project. They help reduce the number of cars on the road, allow individuals to move their bodies and be physically fit, and they create community by allowing people to engage with their environment in a different way than if they\u2019re driving or walking. If there\u2019s a desire to reduce traffic, please improve public transportation. The only thing the proposed effort will do is ADD cars to roads and parking lots. It\u2019s almost as if our PM who proposed this doesn\u2019t understand city design\u2026. -Individual in Ottawa\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor Street are a disaster. They have created traffic not to mention a hazard and safety issue for emergency vehicles. I have been stuck in traffic with no one using the bike lanes and lineup of cars trying to navigate through the city. I have also witnessed firetrucks trying to move on Bloor st and get stuck in traffic because there\u2019s nowhere for cars to move over. Bloor and Royal York area.\nIn addition to safety and traffic jams. The onus falls on the vehicle operators that are making a right turn to avoid the bikes that seem to think they can plow through intersections without slowing down to make sure drivers see them.\nIf they want to share the roadway they should have plates for identification and insuranced for any damage they may cause.\nI have witnessed cyclists hitting cars side mirrors because they felt like the driver did something wrong. No recourse to the driver.\nMove bike lanes to secondary roadways where it\u2019s safer for all.\nThank you\nMike M\n"

No everyday Ontarian wants bike lanes removed, why are is our premier wasting all this money on another of his petty vanity and ego driven projects?\nThis government needs to focus on actually improving things for Ontario, instead they have consistently made choices that make life so, so much worse here while wasting money. Stop wasting money on vanity projects like removing bike lanes while you literally strangle the public healthcare system while screaming \u201cTrudeau\u201d and refusing to accept accountability for the choices the Ontario government has made. We want healthcare, not a government that forces people out of their homes for the 413 and forces municipalities to remove bike lanes.\nIt is the provincial government and this deliberately sneaky legislation that will destroy this province. This entire bill is a mistake, fiscally irresponsible, and a demonstration that the premier doesn\u2019t care about the actual needs of the people of Ontario. We need to invest in healthcare, not force municipalities into removing bike lanes. This bill shows that the government of Ontario\u2019s priorities are not only fiscally  irresponsible but the values of this government are irredeemably broken.\n"

Cyclists should be held accountable for not paying attention to the rules of the road. Cyclist should pay for insurance just like we do driving a car.

        "comment": "It's so typical that Ford wants to keep cars moving on Toronto streets, but bikes and other slower devices like scooters come a distant second (if lucky). Bike lanes allow its users to \"save time\" too, as well as staying safe, but heaven forbid they should interfere with the privilege of cars. Instead of investing more in public transit and other travel options, he wants to keep people in their cars, taking up more room on roads than bicyclists do. Those roads will be clogged with or without bike lanes. Many cars are on the road to make a living, but for others who are there merely for convenience, does he look for useful and fair travel alternatives? No.\nBicyclists and other lane users are not second class citizens and they deserve to share the roads in safety, not be relegated to back streets and alternate routes that take them out of their way. But I guess the bicycle industry doesn't donate as much to his campaigns as the car and oil industries. And those who can afford 5-digit vehicle prices probably spend more money on his campaign than economic bicyclists.\nIt's been painfully clear ever since Ford took office that he hates Toronto and looks for any opportunity to get in our face. If Ford gets his way on this, is he prepared to reimburse Toronto for money already spent in good faith on the existing lanes, or to fund the destruction of those lanes and rebuilding of the streets? This is a ridiculous waste of money, no matter who pays for it.\nToronto's plan to add more bike lanes has been known for many years. If they were such a problem, why didn't he wield his authority over them before now? Oh right, because he wants to be sure the complaining car-driving voters will check his box on the ballot. And now he wants to give me $200 leading up to a new election? Ya thanks, I'll take that $200 and donate it to the competing parties and candidates. My vote is NOT for sale!\n"

        "comment": "While I fully support providing cyclists with safe passage, I believe the current approach to accommodating cycling in Toronto is flawed. The reality is that only a small percentage of the population is both able and chooses to commute by bike. Designing our city's infrastructure in a way that leads to significant gridlock to cater to such a small group is not the most effective solution for the majority of Torontonians.\nOur priority should be to invest in road improvements at a faster pace and to expand and enhance our public transit system. Both of these efforts directly address gridlock and benefit the largest portion of our population. Once we\u2019ve created a city where these essential modes of transportation are safe, efficient, and reliable, we can then explore how to integrate complementary cycling routes. These routes should never come at the expense of the main transportation systems that move the majority of our population.\nWhile the idea of more people cycling sounds appealing in theory, the reality is that the lifestyles of most Torontonians don\u2019t align with cycling as a primary mode of transport. The logistics simply don\u2019t make sense when you consider our weather patterns, retail setups, distances between destinations, time constraints, and the many activities families juggle. Cycling is a wonderful recreational option, but it\u2019s not efficient or realistic for the majority in a city as large and diverse as ours.\nBike routes should be thoughtfully placed\u2014within new developments, along quieter roads, and in areas where space allows\u2014without compromising the already congested main streets that serve the bulk of the population. In fact, rather than reducing road space, we should be working to add lanes for cars and improve traffic flow. Cyclists who have the time and preference for biking can use less-traveled roads that are inherently safer, without creating unnecessary strain on our city\u2019s infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I moved to Canada in 2001 from the US to run a biotech company in Toronto.  After the company was sold, I decided to stay in Toronto because it was a great place to live and I became a Canadian citizen in 2022.  In the past several years the city has significantly expanded bike lanes and I can now cycle safely in lanes from my house (near Casa Loma) all the way to Tommy Thompson Park.  I own two cars but use my bicycle almost exclusively for commuting around downtown.  The bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge have been extremely useful.  The prospect of removing them baffles the imagination.\nRemoving existing bike lanes and preventing others from being created will lead to increased traffic congestion because of induced demand.  Induced demand is a well-established economic principle and \u201cis the phenomenon whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in price and an increase in consumption\u201d (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand).  As regards urban planning, creating more vehicle lanes will initially reduced congestion but that will soon be eliminated as more people start using the new lanes (\u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d).  You will end up with the same level of congestion only with more vehicles involved in producing it.  A major cause of traffic congestion in the downtown core of Toronto stems from the ceaseless rezoning and construction of \u201clux\u201d condos.  There is a half-dozen such projects currently underway within a one-kilometer radius of my house near Davenport and Dupont.  The congestion doesn\u2019t stop once the condo has been completed because now the city has to repair the road that the construction has destroyed.  I\u2019m not saying stop building condos \u2013 just don\u2019t delude yourself into thinking that removing bike lanes will decrease traffic congestion.\nThe 401 ranks as the most congested highway in North America.  How many bike lanes are on the 401?  Bike lanes and other forms of public transportation are part of solution to decreasing traffic congestion in the GTA.  Removing them will make it worse.\n"
