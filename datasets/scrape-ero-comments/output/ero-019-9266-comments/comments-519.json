        "comment": "Although I am extremely supportive of cycling and supporting safe cycling routes, it cannot be an overnight step change that literally upends people\u2019s commutes and impacts local business revenues.  Most people impacted by the needless (and horribly unflexible) bike lanes on Bloor are families.  It is those people working hard day to day trying to get to and from work, to pick up a child and get them to after school activities.  As one person in that group, I promise you there are enough stressors not to have to deal with a commute time that is doubled to get to and from work, drop one\u2019s child at math tutoring or hockey (with all the gear), or get to the dentist.  Our commutes for afterschool activities have increased 3-fold and are simply not viable by bike nor public transit given where we are and lack of regular options.  When there are other options for clean commuting that are reasonable for the masses then, it might be time to consider bike lanes.  Until then they should be removed until proper planning and solutions are in place.  Please remove the Bloor Street bike lanes west of South Kingsway.\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nI had lived in Ontario for 23 years and now live in British Columbia where I work. Since moving to BC (not on the coast) I have taken up cycling as a means of getting to and from work for most days that the weather permits. This commute takes just as much time as driving would, as traffic in my City, and congestion around traffic lights and pedestrian intersections on main roads, dramatically slows down road traffic. As such, I have taken to biking on a separate trail that keeps the pedestrian and cycling infrastructure relatively distinct from the car infrastructure. Not only is this type of movement more beneficial to my health, but in effect, having the option to move in a different way means I have the ability to a)get to work quicker b) get good exercise and stay healthy c) reduce the amount of cars on the road, and so too congestion during rush hour d) engage with the City at a human scale. e)Contribute to more considerate infrastructure for people to move, helping to create a stronger ecosystem of transit options that will not fail as easily if a major problem arises in one of its sectors (i.e - transit strikes, car accident on highway, road construction). People will use what is provided to them, and there is an induced demand to creating more or adapting existing infrastructure to be focused on the efficiency of movement of cars. If you make something more convenient, more people will use it. This is not to say that we ought to strive to make driving more inconvenient in allowing for bicycle infrastructure to be built, but rather that most people take the option of least resistance. The issue becomes, when you are stuck in gridlock on the QEW, and wasting 1000's of human hours each and every day to stagnation (i.e - QEW), we realize that many in Ontario do not have other options that are reasonable to move around. Cars take up space. We park them and leave them sitting most of the day. They need infrastructure to support their use (wide roads, gas stations, car dealerships, stoplights, parking lots- etc.). With the cost of land, and the sheer amount of people moving to Ontario - one would think the government would realize that their is a downstream cost to building for cars first. All of the supporting infrastructure takes up valuable space and uses needed tax revenue for upkeep and construction. Not only this, but the tax revenue recouped from a fast food joint and its gargantuan parking lot (minimum parking requirements) is going to be much lower than a shopping centre with minimal parking on the same footprint. An single underground car parking space alone costs several thousands of dollars - adding an immense cost to any new build that is just \"presumed\" in the midst of an extremely unaffordable standard life in Canada (I am an Architect, and so see this firsthand).  It is an ethos of how we wish to design. If you design for the car first, you lose many of the elements that make a city livable for people on the street, as cars operate at a different scale of both size and speed than people. Not only this, but people do not generally interact in between cars, and if they do, it generally is not positive. Having people on foot or on bike means that we can interact as people were designed to. I am not against cars, but I am against short sighted thinking and scape goating. Bicycle infrastructure is needed as a choice in the tapestry of movement within a City. Subjecting its development to stringent government oversight will likely remove any incentive to build it, so too crippling ridership numbers (as bicycling is not safe or convenient if I cannot get from point a to b on infrastructure designed with the bicyclist in mind to any degree), and encouraging more people to continue using cars as the sole means of movement. Which means - more traffic. More justification to spend incessant amounts of tax money on \"needed\" highway or roadway infrastructure. Less people interacting with each other and their cities on the streets. And I would imagine, a much less healthy populace, and a healthcare system that continues to crumble under the weight of an increasingly unhealthy populace, that has little choice but to spend multiple hours of their day sat stagnant just to work. I disagree with many elements of this bill and hope it can be reformed. I find the language loaded and ignorant of what \"could be\", if we actually committed to making the Province more livable for people rather than wasting money tearing up what progress has been made. I know many do not want to, but look to countries like the Netherlands to see what has been, car-centric planning principles in the 60's and 70's leading to the death of many children in traffic, vs. now, some of the most livable and beautiful places to visit in the world. I hope you can reconsider, and I hope people can consider that there are different ways to design our cities. Traffic is very much a reality, but also a choice, if we choose to prioritize cars over people.\n"

Jane Jacobs is a good place to start.\nAdding more car lanes does NOT reduce congestion.  Adding MORE BIKE LANES does. By making safe places for people to ride less people take cars! Adding more streetcars with independent lanes so they aren't encumbered by traffic does. Adding more subways does. adding more trains does. Japan and more of Europe figured this out a long time ago.\nThis Bill needs to NOT proceed. It would be detrimental to those who live and work in Toronto and use these streets.

        "comment": "This is a bad law and regulation, for several reasons, and I oppose it. Bundling removing and banning bike lanes with exempting a freeway from environmental assessment is a blatant attempt at politicking and creating a wedge issue to shift the conversation and hide the real goal of the law. Discouraging bike lanes disregards existing data and disregards best practices in urban design from around the world, and it considers the time, wellbeing, safety, and health of anyone not in an automobile to be worth nothing.\nHere's only a few of the considerations from provincial point of view:\nOn a practical level:\n- This adds provincial red tape to matters that the province has delegated to municipalities.\n- This mixes governmental responsibilities. If the Ministry of Transportation wants a say in how streets operate, an obvious answer would be to assume the streets as provincial property and responsibility. Yet, this act does not provide for the Ministry to pay for increased road maintenance that will be required due to increased automobile volumes.\n- This sets up a game of cat and mouse with municipal governments. We've seen that municipal governments are very good at putting up creative barriers to provincial policies, for example on the housing file. Municipalities will be able to take other actions, not proscribed here, to reduce vehicle throughput. Now instead of converting car lanes to bike lanes, they'll convert car lanes to parking lanes, or set a really low speed limit, or put a stop sign or traffic light on every block, or set up modal filters to remove through traffic from streets. Is the Ministry of Transportation prepared to check every change to every street in Ontario?\n- This might have an unintended consequence of municipalities avoiding widening any streets or roads, fearing they won't be able to adjust them ever again.\nOn an ideological level:\n- What is the purpose of the Environmental Assessment Act if we exempt projects from assessment? Is it only for projects the government doesn't like?\n- Some of the worst congested highways in Ontario are provincial highways like the QEW and the 401. Congestion on the 401 is legendary. The QEW is newly clogged through Hamilton and Burlington due to failures of provincial transportation policy and planning. Having failed to keep provincial highways free of congestion, the province now wants to use our main streets as highways.\n- Outside of 400-series highways, some of the worst congestion in the GTA is on streets that have no bike lanes and no road safety changes. These are areas such as around Square One in Mississauga or around Yorkdale in Toronto. Why are these not a focus for the province, rather than three specific streets in central Toronto?\n- It is unclear why the Ministry of Transportation is taking on more responsibilities considering their failures on the freeway file, and their current problems delivering projects like the Crosstown LRT (now at least half a decade late with no opening date set). Why does it need more responsibilities?\n- Why is this a priority for the government during the week that province announced that it is not meeting its own housing starts goal? Which do we need more, homes or cars?\n- If the province wants to see municipal data before making a decision, how come a decision has been made already for Bloor, Yonge, and University? Which data has the province seen there to make this decision?\n50 years ago, the Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis stated about a proposed expressway: \"If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\"\nIs Ontario interested in building transportation to serve people, or to serve the automobile?\n"

There is no proof that this change will lead to faster or more efficient traffic; rather, it\u2019s likely that Bloor, like Bathurst, will simply serve as another idle waiting area for cars, contributing to congestion and harming the neighborhood\u2019s walkability and safety.\nReducing the current bike and pedestrian space directly impacts the quality of life for Toronto residents and undermines our city\u2019s limited, much-needed livable space.

The reason why traffic is so bad is due to the lack of safe and reliable alternative transit options. Cars take up about 5x as much space a bike and 10x as much as a pedestrian despite usually only carrying one or two passengers during commuting hours. Beyond the two major subway lines and few streetcars, there are not enough ways to get around the city. Bikes are an efficient, eco-friendly, and healthy way to get around downtown. We should be investing in more and safer alternative transit options, including dedicated bike lanes, to prevent accidents from happening.\nI recommend watching these Youtube channels/videos as inspiration for what the city should be doing:\nOh The Urbanity!

        "comment": "I am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024). This legislation\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is misguided and is not supported by evidence.  This policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development. It is a step backwards in many respects.\nPublic Health and Safety Risks\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nPromoting Sustainable and Multimodal Transportation\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\nAlternative Investments for the Greater Good\nRather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban commuters and drivers.\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Transportation policies should be grounded in sound evidence and scientific principles. Rather than catering solely to drivers, which is very short-sighted, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express serious concerns regarding Bill 212, which seeks to grant the provincial government the authority to approve or remove bike lanes on municipal roads where they require the removal of a traffic lane. Specifically, this Bill would authorize the dismantling of existing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto and reallocate these lanes to vehicular traffic. I strongly urge the government not to proceed with this legislation, as it undermines municipal authority, as well as the environmental, social, and economic objectives that bike lanes help to achieve in our urban areas.\nBike lanes play a critical role in supporting environmental sustainability. By providing dedicated space for cyclists, they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality by encouraging residents to opt for bicycles over cars. Removing bike lanes would discourage cycling, pushing more individuals to rely on personal vehicles, thus increasing traffic congestion and emissions. This move directly conflicts with Ontario\u2019s stated goals of reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmentally friendly transportation.\nCycling infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of injury or fatality for cyclists by providing a safer, separated space for them on the road. Reverting bike lanes to vehicle lanes on high-traffic streets in Toronto and other cities would make cycling more dangerous and discourage a mode of transportation that promotes physical activity, benefiting public health. Cities across the world have recognized the safety benefits of bike lanes, and Ontario should support\u2014not undermine\u2014efforts to make active transportation safer.\nIncreased congestion is often used as a justification for removing bike lanes. However, evidence suggests that bike lanes reduce congestion by encouraging alternative transportation methods. Bike lanes help alleviate traffic by reducing the number of cars on the road, contributing to a more balanced and efficient transportation network. Many cities that have invested in bike infrastructure have witnessed smoother traffic flows, even in dense urban areas. Removing existing bike lanes - where time, money and effort has already been spent by municipalities for planning and installation - would reverse progress in making these areas more livable, walkable, and accessible.\nBike lanes stimulate local economies by attracting cyclists who are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses. Studies have consistently shown that bike-friendly cities benefit from increased foot traffic and stronger local economies. Returning these lanes to general traffic could harm businesses along these routes and weaken Toronto\u2019s vibrant street life and economy. As our cities grow, supporting bike infrastructure aligns with economic growth and job creation goals, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is essential to consider the role of MUNICIPAL AUTONOMY in shaping urban environments that reflect the unique needs and values of local residents. Municipal governments and their citizens are best positioned to make informed decisions about bike lanes and road use in their communities. The provincial government overriding these decisions undermines local governance, disregarding years of work and consultation by municipal staff and elected officials, and all of the associated costs related to this work and construction of the lanes themselves.\nOntario\u2019s urban areas need forward-thinking policies that align with global sustainability, health, and livability goals. Bill 212, with its proposal to override municipal decisions on bike lanes, runs counter to these objectives. I respectfully urge the government to withdraw Bill 212 and instead collaborate with municipal leaders to expand sustainable transportation options across the province.\nThank you for considering this perspective.\nSincerely,\nResident of Toronto\n"

In general, I am supportive of building infrastructure in Toronto to reduce the reliance on cars, and that includes robust bicycle lane infrastructure. In particular, I am strongly against wasting taxpayer money to remove bike lanes that have already been built.\nIn my opinion it is totally backwards in 2024 to be so focused on automobile traffic. In a city as large (and growing) as Toronto, you are not going to have smooth automobile traffic. Removing bike lanes is not going to improve traffic. We need strategies to reduce the number of people who attempt to use automobiles in the city. Bicycle infrastructure is one piece in that puzzle, but we need additional tools, such as improved public transit and introducing tolls on incoming vehicles, to be in play as well. The way to to improve city life is to build a city that can be best enjoyed without driving a car at all.\nThe provincial government should be supporting and collaborating with Toronto in order to achieve a better experience for Toronto residents. There's literally no logical explanation for this legislation, other than that this provincial government has a vendetta against Toronto that is juvenile and irresponsible.

So while the government likes to cite that 1% of Torontonians bike, they\u2019re completely ignoring the exponential growth in BikeShare over the last few years. What a coincidence that that coincides with the implementation of bike lanes! This is a regressive policy decision that will lead to cyclists being injured or dying.
