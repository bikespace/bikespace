        "comment": "I'm a grad student at U of T and I bike every single day (weather permitting). My commute includes Bloor and University. Bike lanes are essential for me. I know many others that bike and not just students, other employees at SickKids where I work. If the argument is there aren't enough bikers using the lanes... One, I would heavily disagree based on the traffic I see daily. Two, this number is only going to grow as the bike lane network grows and connects more areas (Toronto's bike network is still in its infancy). And three, you don't have to take my word for it, the city can look at the number of rides taken in its bike share program yearly and see this number has been growing and will continue to grow as the bike network expands (https://schoolofcities.github.io/bike-share-toronto/growth).\nI think this bill is a huge step backwards for the city's transit. I think it's extremely short-sighted to take steps to eliminate biking infrastructure and put red tape on it in the hopes of improving car traffic. This will only take people off bikes and put either more cars on the road or more people on the subway, adding to their existing congestion. As our bike infrastructure improves it will only serve to relieve more and more strain on the other commuting options. The width gain on roads for cars does not outweigh an entire commuting option.\nWhen I arrived in Toronto I was very impressed by the existence of good bike lanes in the inner city and the ongoing construction of new lanes. It made me proud to be Canadian that Canada's biggest city was taking steps towards a more European style, commuter friendly city. I really hope that the people considering enacting this bill think about its long term consequences that won't just hurt bikers but drivers too.\n"

        "comment": "It is odd that a government ostensibly committed to reducing bureaucratic overhead is instead adding more in what should be a municipalities' jurisdiction. As someone who uses all forms of transit available, I will take the most expedient and convenient option whenever possible. I enjoy driving and cycling, but driving in the city is a nightmare and removing bike lanes will make that worse due to induced demand. More people will see driving as an option in an already crowded city and the gridlock will be worse than it was before, without the benefit of having a safer alternative in cycling.\nPeople choose to use a bicycle for various reasons that are too often politicized but usually truly boil down to efficiency - in time, convenience, cost or fitness. By removing safe routes and putting up provincial barriers to cities deploying more safe routes, people riding bicycles will instead be in traffic and in much greater danger. When riding a bicycle safety is a top concern for me, and when driving I find it much more calming to have a dedicated, protected bicycle lane to keep people cycling out of danger.\nProviding safe, extensive and effective alternatives to driving is absolutely necessary for growing cities as the density precludes widespread car usage. People should have the *freedom* to choose to cycle or take transit and not be forced into a situation where car ownership or driving is still a necessity because transit service is underfunded and not sufficient. This is why we need alternative routes to get around the city such as a connected grid of protected bicycle lanes.\n"

        "comment": "A large but often forgotten demographic in the conversation regarding bike lanes. Is young Professional starting their careers and new Canadians starting their new lives. Costs of living have never been higher. Rent, Groceries, Gas, it's all gone up exponentially in the last 10 years. As such, I have made the decision to not own a car. It saves me thousands of dollars a month. Money that can go to rent, or saving for a down payment on a house. I am only able to do this because I live in Toronto. A city with an expansive transit network and dense urban areas where everything you need is within walking distance. This in my\nopinion is what makes this city great.\nCycling is a big part of that. I use the new Bloor bike lanes everyday and they have made a big positive difference in my life. Removing them and others is dangerous and reductive. There are millions of people here, thousands more coming every year. If the only option for transportation the government cares about is cars, then nobody will be going anywhere. Bike lanes are ESSENTIAL for the growth and progress of the city. Especially for someone like me. Knowing that I can safely ride my bike somewhere is a huge incentive for where I choose to live. There are millions more in my position facing the same ultimatum.\nBeyond the health and environmental benefits of cycling it actually in the long term IMPROVES congestion. Because bikes are so much more space efficient you are taking thousands of cars off the road.\nThis bill is sacrificing the future health and prosperity of this city for millions of people to the short-sited complaints of a select group annoyed at a temporary inconvenience.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes in the core is absolute nonsense. Traffic congestion is NOT caused by cyclists. With the world progressing to be more eco-friendly, this is the most backwards proposal I've ever heard of. The city caters to drivers enough as it is and all removing the bike lanes does is push more people into driving. Looking at traffic on the 401, DVP, and Gardiner should illustrate enough that it doesn't matter if there's 3 lanes or 7. The only way to alleviate traffic is if people use alternative transportation methods such as cycling or transit.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Ontario, born in Ottawa and raised in Whitby, and currently living in the downtown core of Toronto for 3 years, I am very aware of Toronto\u2019s traffic congestion and would very much like to be able to get where I am going as efficiently and safely as possible. This extends not only to the downtown core but also to the surrounding suburbs and cities where many of my family and friends live.\nI believe that the Conservative Party\u2019s plan will not only make the traffic worse but also will take power away from all the residents of Ontario by not allowing us to decide what is best for our own communities and adding more bureaucracy through the province.\nThe obvious issue with this plan is that of induced demand. By designing and expanding the cities transportation network specifically for cars as it currently is, more residents of Toronto and commuters from surrounding suburbs and cities will see driving as the most efficient means of travel. By adding more car infrastructure the provincial government is taking away the ability for the residents like myself who take other means of transportation and demanding through design that I take a car for my travel. This will then add more cars onto already congested routes, making the issue worse as many parts of Toronto\u2019s streets are too narrow to expand due to buildings containing housing and businesses.\nIf the provincial government were serious about reducing traffic, the objective would be to reduce the number of cars on these congested streets, not to add more, and to give alternative routes of transportation to people, like walking paths, public transit lanes, dependable and frequent regional transit, and specifically bike lanes.\nThe Conservative party claims to want to reduce the cost of living for working people like myself, but if driving a car becomes the only safe and practical way for me to travel through the city I will have to buy a car, pay for insurance, maintenance, fuel, and parking, which will astronomically raise my cost of living and may price me out of the city. I am far more able, and would much rather, pay for efficient public transit and the purchase and maintenance of a bicycle.\nThere are no bike lanes on the Gardiner Expressway, and it is congested. There are no bike lanes on the Don Valley Parkway, and it is congested. There are 16 lanes on the 401, all are for cars, and no bikes, and it is congested. Maybe the cause of congestion is cars and not bikes.\nThis proposal is anti democratic, counterproductive, hypocritical of the parties claimed beliefs, and clearly a power grab.\nI obviously do not support this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "It is a complete waste of taxpayer's money to destroy or remove public infrastructure that was built by the City of Toronto. If this government truly cared about taxpayers and citizens in Ontario, the premier and the ministry of transportation would not be rushing to rip up existing infrastructure to make streets even more unsafe for people using bicycle lanes to get around the city. It is bad policy to misuse statistics (like ridership percentages in one riding like Etobicoke) to create wide-reaching policy that affects people across Toronto but also across other towns and cities in Ontario. The premier has no business dictating policies at a municipal level, specially when they add red tape, waste money and time. It is widely known that widening streets, building highways and destroying existing cycling infrastructure will not alleviate gridlock. This will actually worsen it, as more people will want to drive. This is a principle called induced demand, meaning as more car-centric infrastructure is developed, more cars will use it, not less, and gridlock and congestion will continue. Good transportation policy to actually tackle gridlock would require the province to invest in all modes of transportation, not just car-centric ones, including intra- and inter-city public transportation, and protected bike lanes for people who want to get around faster. This is not an issue between cyclists and drivers but about people not having safe alternatives to get around the city. I am a pedestrian, a driver and a cyclist in the city, because I use all three of these methods to get around. I often choose to take transit or walk because traffic has always been heavy, and will only worsen if people currently cycling to get around lose the option to do so safely. One cyclist or pedestrian death is too many and will only increase if the protected lanes on Yonge St,  Bloor St, and on University get ripped up.\n"

        "comment": "The most important thing when deciding which measures to adopt to reduce gridlock is - will it work? - and not - is it the most popular? - and not - does the general public think it will work?\nThis can be researched. Beat practices from other places and modelling using actual data are a better way to figure this out.\nGridlock happens because the city is a destination. People are going there. They stop. They park. They buy coffee. They have dinner on a cafe TO patio. They don't zip through. If we could zip through it wouldn't be a city.\nPeople biking reduces gridlock in many cities. Bikes are just smaller than cars. Roads don't get wider. Cars seem to get wider. Restricting left turns speeds up traffic, as does enforcement of no parking in rush hour, off street parking lots, more reliable transit, etc. Money spent on reducing gridlock that doesn't actually reduce gridlock is waste and inefficiency. One car parked illegally during rush hour clogs up a road for many blocks in a way a bike lane just can't. Don't waste money on feel good solutions that are fake. Deliver results. Many squeaky wheels predicted the death of bars once smoking was banned. Same same with this bike lane drama. Change is hard but in retrospect it will prove to be the right move. More people moving around with bikes on the road leaves more room for cars. Cities are destinations.\n"

The current bike infrastructure, and proposed new lanes, are essential to my commutes to and from work everyday.\n-Biking around the city is only made a safe and consistent option through these bike lanes, and, as a driver, it makes me feel more comfortable knowing that cyclists around me have their own protected lane for their safety and my peace of mind.\n-Not infrequently, my commutes contain both the TTC and cycling. Cycling gives me greater access to buses and stations, and the TTC allows me to travel greater distances on biking trips/commutes.\n                                   - - - - -\n     Cycling in the city is an inexpensive, fast, and consistent method of travel which takes cars off the road and lightens the load on the TTC system, especially at peak commuter hours. The maintenance of biking infrastructure and the presence of safety measures is a benefit for all who currently struggle with congestion in the city.\n     Consider reallocating the tax dollars which would be used to tear up the bike lanes into public transit improvements, and safer commuting options for cyclists.\n"

Every person knows that if you do not build out infrastructure, people won't be able to use it. Much of the Toronto and other cities biking infrastructure is still young and not connected, and YET many people still use it, helping both public transport deal with volume as well as drivers who now have fewer cars to contend with, and I'm not going to even go into the health and environmental benefits.

        "comment": "This bill is absurd on multiple levels and I am shocked that we are not only regressing to outdated and ineffective concepts of transit, but also spending money to undo any progress that is made. The GTA's skyrocketing population is far exceeding the capability of its current infrastructure to effectively move people around. Bike lanes are space efficient and comparatively cheap compared to car-based infrastructure, and speaking form personal experience, make cycling the fastest and easiest way to get around the city - even in inclement weather. Toronto's booming bike-share program is an incredibly effective means to get around the city and these lanes will help grow an already effective program. I would like to highlight a few key points:\n1. Bike lanes are safer for both cyclists and drivers! It can prevent dangerous and fatal accidents, making everyone able to safely use the roads and it makes driving easier not having to worry about aggressive cyclists\n2. Simple economics of space - bike lanes provide substantially more throughput than cars and better, safer lanes in tandem with programs like bike share promote people to cycle more\n3. This completely ignores street parking which contributes nothing to throughput and is far less profitable for the space than programs like CafeTO\n4. This adds bureaucratic red tape in a province already struggling to keep up with its population growth\nAs someone who only recently started cycling - due in large part to Toronto's push to make safer lanes and programs like Bike Share, I am incredibly disappointed to see the province overstep and regress to a solution that is already not working.\n"
