Bikes are one of the best inventions in human history and should be valued and protected. This government is going backwards when the rest of the world is going forward on this issue.\n"

Ford only wants to do this as a political move for election, but he is not listening to the experts and just wants to appease drivers with misinformation that bike lanes are the issue.\n"

        "comment": "Why are we trying to waste money in order to downgrade our transit infrastructure? Replacing bike lanes with car lanes isn't gonna make traffic better; it's gonna make it worse. Where are the cyclist gonna bike with no bike lane? Oh, that's right, in the car lanes! Now you have poor safety for cyclists, and drivers now have to deal with slow bikes in their lanes! Yay!\nAdding one more lane for cars isn't going to improve traffic. Y'know what improves traffic? Getting people off the road. Supplying other transit methods. Giving people more choices. The less cars there are on the road, the better traffic is. The more public transit there is, the less cars there are on the road.\n"

        "comment": "This is completely unnecessary and would strip bikers of the few bike lanes they use to get around the city. Toronto bike lanes are also already small as is, they wouldnt be large enough to provide another whole lane. It would simply just force bikers to use a whole lane and slow down traffic for cars while giving them less protection.\n"

You should applaud every cyclist on the road, since that's one less car clogging your precious path. Give us MORE bike lanes, MORE and BETTER transit, and then you'll see traffic improve.\nThis proposal makes me cry.\n"

        "comment": "Upon reading this bill, the section about removing existing bike lanes and adding red tape to create new ones that take away a lane would greatly impact my personal safety and finances.\nCurrently I go to work 5 times a week, and get groceries around once a week using my bike. The portions of my commute that do not have bike lanes are unsafe, where I have fallen before (thankfully I only scraped my knee and elbow) due to having a shared lane with parked cars.\nRemoving the bike lane portions of my route to work and groceries would fully force me to take public transit for my own safety, which is slower, and less affordable than me cycling.\nThe decision to chose saving a few minutes of commute for those who can afford to drive, and punishing those who can't at the expense of their life and affordability is an unfair one.\nCycling to work has saved me many hours and thousands of dollars over the past few years, and I would hope that others would have the freedom in the future to chose the option that works best for them, and not limit them in their transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep frustration with the recent proposal outlined in Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, particularly the framework regarding bike lanes that necessitates the removal of existing traffic lanes. This approach raises several significant concerns that merit immediate attention.\nFirst and foremost, the bill fails to differentiate between various types of streets and neighborhoods. Not all roads are created equal, and a one-size-fits-all policy risks undermining local initiatives aimed at improving transportation options tailored to specific community needs. The absence of red tape and bureaucratic obstacles for local governments is essential for fostering innovative solutions to our transportation challenges. Removing bike lanes only serves to exacerbate car congestion, counteracting the very goal of this legislation.\nAs an active user of bike lanes, I can attest to their importance as essential transportation infrastructure. These lanes not only promote cycling as a viable commuting option but also enhance overall road safety. The removal of bike lanes would increase risks for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. Bike lanes serve as a crucial buffer, separating vulnerable road users from motor vehicle traffic. When cyclists are relegated to shared spaces with cars, the likelihood of accidents increases, jeopardizing public safety.\nMoreover, the existence of dedicated bike lanes facilitates a smoother flow of traffic for drivers by reducing conflicts between different modes of transportation. When cyclists have designated paths, they are less likely to interfere with car traffic, resulting in less frustration for all road users. This separation can lead to a more organized and efficient road system, ultimately benefiting everyone.\nAdditionally, bike lanes support various forms of transit, making them more accessible and encouraging a shift away from single-occupancy vehicle use. By promoting cycling and walking, we can create a multi-modal transportation network that alleviates congestion, reduces emissions, and enhances the overall quality of life in our communities.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the implications of Bill 212 as it relates to bike lane infrastructure. Removing these lanes not only jeopardizes the safety of cyclists but also undermines broader efforts to improve our transportation system. Let us work together to find solutions that enhance mobility for everyone, rather than reverting to outdated practices that prioritize cars over people.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response and hope to see a reconsideration of this bill\u2019s approach.\n"

        "comment": "The best way to reduce gridlock is to get more people out of their cars and into other modes of transportation like bikes and public transit. This bill is ridiculous and I strongly oppose it. The provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure. This bill is trying to increase the number of cars on the road while simultaneously reducing road safety. It's baffling that a government even proposed such objectively stupid ideas that this bill is trying to implement.\n"

        "comment": "To get rid of the bike lanes in downtown Toronto makes life for folks who live here more dangerous for bikers, pedestrians and drivers. Without dedicated lanes, bikers will either endanger themselves by biking with car traffic or endanger pedestrians by biking on sidewalks. If the government cares more about traffic than it does about the physical safety of it's citizens, to make car traffic better, we must invest in alternatives to get around the city including well maintained bike lanes. If Torontonians who are able feel safe and empowered to bike in separated bike lanes then there will be fewer cars on the road so that folks who do choose to drive will experience less gridlock. The only way to make traffic in Toronto better is to encourage folks to choose alternative modes of transportation to driving.\n"

By removing bike lanes this easily, many cyclists will be forced to unsafely cycle with cars and will loves their lives as a result of this dangerous decision. For the safety of cyclers and drivers, public consultation should be required for all proposals for bike lanes to be removed on a municipal level\n"

The issue has always been parking and stopping during rush hour and bikes having to doge in and out. With the separated bike lanes that's gone.\nThey just spent years and millions of dollars building these bike lanes and now you plan to remove them out of short sighted bike hating\n"
