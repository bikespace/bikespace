        "comment": "This bill is dishonest and harmful to the future of the province. It's been proven time and time again that highways DO NOT reduce traffic. Investments in infrastructure, public transit, and--guess what--giving people the choice to safely commute on bikes DOES! You are hiding the fact that you want the liberty to expropriate peoples property--their HOMES, to build these highways. You're using this to make up to developers their losses when Doug couldn't gut the Greenbelt for his developer friends and their awful plans to further commodify housing.\nWhen will the province actually do things to help Ontarians? When will you build denser housing projects that lower housing costs AND reduce commute times? When will they actually tackle the rising costs that come from the rich elites who steal money from hardworking Canadians by fabricating inflation and paywalling our basic needs?\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are relevant to the municipality in which they are located and the individuals who reside in said municipality. As such, the decision around bike lane installation and removal should be left to the municipal government and neighbourhoods affected should be engaged in the decision process. Ontario should stick to inter-city transportation decisions and not try to impede on city-specific decisions.\nFurthermore, there should be a push toward increased use of bike lanes, ensuring this is a viable method of commuting by connecting bike lanes in various streets along commonly used routes. I would encourage the city to consider how bike lanes can be modified during the winter months when a natural shift toward alternative transportation methods occurs but keep the option available when the weather permits.\n"

        "comment": "I agree with the removal of Bike lanes on Bloor west. We went from from no traffic in the corridor between Islington Ave and Runnymede RD to having downtown traffic where no existed before. I run everyday down Bloor from  Islington Ave to Prince Edward Rd. I use the bike lane to run as there nearly zero bikes through out the day and during winters it is completely empty. I am not against the bike lanes, but putting on Bloor was wrong decision as it the major artery street that leads to QEW and Gardner Expressway. It was so badly planned that I had to help an old lady get out of here car because they placed the parking lanes so close to live lane that opening a car door fully is next to impossible and old people are afraid to open them that this old lady I helped was screaming for help to get out. Also, they made the horrible boxes to make turns. AN example is at the Old Mill road and Bloor junction. Cars wanting to make a right turn at the Kingsway have to not only make a 180 degree turn, but must navigate a 90 degree turn merge on to Bloor. The safest way is to sit in the on coming lane and have more of a 45 degree turn.  They have crated such unsafe roads around hear it crazy and with all suggestion they have ignored. Placing a single 2 way bike lane on Dundas street would have been the best idea as you have the railroad to the north of Dundas, few business and fewer residential  building and majority of 3 way stop lights vs 4 ways on Bloor.  I really hope you pull these lanes out ASAP as we were lucky the 1st year with little to no snow, once ice and snow do fall there will be many accidents. They say its only increase in traffic during rush hour, but the busiest times have been on the weekend. So, please remove them and force city to come up with a real plan not this high school project plan they came up with. Who ever designed these bikes lanes should be fired and never hired again. Delays sometime a huge. It took me 18min to go from Old mill RD which I live on to my son's mother who live on Bloor and Riverside drive and that is just not acceptable.\n"

        "comment": "With Toronto traffic being notoriously bad, you\u2019d think reducing vehicle traffic would be a high priority to relieve congestion. By removing bike lanes, one can only imagine it would be to increase vehicle lanes. Which would interrupt main bike routes, cause more bikes to be on \u201cvehicle only\u201d roads which is quite dangerous and ultimately would cost money to remove lanes that cost money to be installed.\nI think putting more emphasis on vehicle transportation will just magnify the congestion problem. So the solution should be to move toward more bike lanes, not less. More creative ways to travel the city, less reliance on vehicular travel inside the city core.\n"

These are the options I choose. To allow for more people to choose these options we need wonderfully connected bike lanes from our outer surrounding suburbs making this delightful mode of transportation an option for them to choose. Safe, connected, fast, healthy, no bike traffic congestion.\nI can't imagine ripping up our sidewalks and not allowing for people to walk. Similarly, I can't imagine ripping out our bike lanes and removing this choice.\nThe choice for rich and poor alike. Biking.\nWe can not let only rich choice and rich voice be heard.\nHousehold incomes do not buy today 2024 what they bought in1980's. the rich who graduated from universities in the 80 and are relaxing in their luxurious sole ride into the city for the last couple of years of their working lives need not weigh in on this..... We need to listen to the commuters of the future.  University graduates of the 2000- 2024 and beyond ... this growing cohort will not afford the sole ride into the city of years past... the bike lanes will become more and more used as they years of wealth disparity and disintegrating middle-class erodes.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nI'm a resident of Toronto, and I don't think it is acceptable for the municipal government to have to ask the provincial government for permission regarding bike lane approval/removal. Bike lanes are a municipal issue that should be looked at from community to community. Further, there is no evidence that removing bike lanes will in any way help with gridlock in the city. Do you know what might help? Finishing the Eglinton line, being more efficient with construction projects, and spending money responsibly.\nThe reason we have traffic issues is:\n1. There is not enough reliable transit. Toronto has a similar population to Chicago, and a great population than Montreal. We have two 2 main subway lines and 2 complimentary lines. Please look at the maps of the other two aforementioned cities. Toronto is an embarrassment. The Eglinton line has been under construction for more than 10 years.\n2. Poor planning. Toronto is the biggest city in Canada, and has the most newcomers. I support immigration. I also support thinking things through. If you add more people, you need more infrastructure. We do not have enough transportation for the influx of people, nor do we have enough housing for people coming to the city. This means that it's too expensive to live in the city. Where do people live? Outside the city. You can't bike downtown from Mississauga. Well, you could. Good luck. But if housing were affordable, people could live in the city and there would be no need for so many cars on the road.\n3. No follow-through. Construction in this city is unbelievable. Why do we not invest in better materials so we don't have to keep fixing the roads?\nI apologize to the person who has to read this if it seems forceful. I'm sure none of this is your fault. But Premier Ford is out of control and running some kind of mafia ring with companies who will only benefit his pocket, not the citizens of Toronto, or Ontario.\nThank you very much for your consideration.\nJ.M.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply disappointed with this legislation on a number of levels.\nFirst, regarding the more prominently mentioned issue of bike lanes, tearing them out after all the consideration and effort of putting them in in the first place is a massive waste of time and resources. Bike lanes have been extended into my neighbourhood in Etobicoke in recent years, which I see as a positive development and would hate to see them removed, and I expect the many people using the lanes currently slated for removal would similarly feel their loss.\nLess advertised but perhaps more concerning, the legislation is packed with changes to prioritize the construction of Highway 413 - in the process putting both the rights of homeowners and environmental concerns at risk. There is no reason to change the rules for environmental impact assessments, or how to treat homeowners in the case of expropriation of their property, for the construction of this highway.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist. I cannot afford a car. Like baby in the city, bike lanes are the only way I can safely and affordably traverse urban areas to get where I need to go. Studies have shown that bike lanes reduce congestion, not increase it, and that adding car lanes does NOT reduce congestion. Reducing the number of cars in the inner city also increases the speed and reliability of public transportation. We need to add more bike lanes, not remove them, and support public transit infrastructure, not focus on cars. This is better for people and better for the environment. It's common sense. Do not remove bike lanes, add more of them.\n"

        "comment": "Hello - My wife and I live in the downtown core. We moved here from the Suburbs in Sudbury Ontario 5 years ago. I love this urban life. I live in Concord City Place. It is a vibrant community where people live, work, and play - all of these things are within an easily accessible 15 minutes by walking, cycling, taking transit, or driving. This is the lifestyle we should be promoting in our city. I still use my car - mostly for going out of town on vacation, but in my opinion, the traffic problem is caused by having too many (often single) people in cars. The resources and space wasted by this type of mobility choice is astounding. I see the traffic lines at Spadina and the Gardener every day. This traffic is caused by people who do not live in the city, but choose to commute to the city on a daily basis from the suburbs. It is this behaviour that is causing the traffic. We need to focus on ways to get as many people out of their cars as possible. This should include - encouraging people to live closer to work, tolling car traffic (odd/even days, fees for entry, mileage based fees, etc.). Increasing transit availability will also help. Transit should ultimately be Fast, Frequent, and Free. Also - supporting other alternatives like Go Train, TTC bus, streetcar service, and subway service. And yes - cycling and more walking space. Removing bike lanes from roads will not solve the problem it will make things worse. Please let the city manage its own affairs. I do not want my lifestyle in my city being negatively affected to support people who live in the suburbs and choose to drive to work rather then take resonable and available alternative transit options.\n"

Add into that congestion the shuttle buses when the subway isn\u2019t working as well as buses being diverted due to road closures for construction and accidents.\nRoyal York Rd also has bike lanes, which are used a great deal, and don\u2019t interfere with the flow of traffic. There are no barriers and the speed limit is 50 (except in school zones). Why then is the speed limit on Bloor St, which has barriers, 40? There is a great deal of foot traffic on RY Rd especially before and after school.\n"
