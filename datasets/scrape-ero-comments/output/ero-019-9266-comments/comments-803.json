        "comment": "I submitted this comment:\nOntario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\n### Conclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

We use bike lanes so that we can stay away from cars and not bother them, and we can be safe. My kids are 11 and 15 years old. They LOVE to bike, riding bike has zero exhaust or impact on the environment, which will allow for there to be a planet for humans to live on for many years to come. If we destroy the planet for us, then we will be greedy and inconsiderate of future generations. This is not \u201cfor the people\u201d. We will all die, but we need to leave something for future generations. Furthermore, bikes take up less space. Please. This is not rocket science. Doug Ford even tried riding a bike and said literally he felt unsafe riding when there was no bike lanes. Please DO NOT REMOVE THE BIKE LANES. Please please please.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for common sense legislation. The city has been hijacked by a small bike lobby. Every meeting and forum I have attended is overwhelming against the bike lanes and yet a tone deaf city council persists.  It is bad enough that you have 50 cars lined up and every second or third time see a single bike in the good weather.  To have traffic congestion, impede medical services and hurt business in the winter for the odd bike is a terrible idea.  The mayor only seems to car when Taylor Swift is in town because the world laughs at Toronto.  A friend recently moved back from a decade in England and was appalled at how Toronto has gone downhill.  Especially traffic.  Please do the right thing, ignore the small big lobby and pull the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong disapproval of the proposal to override municipal decision making regarding the addition or removal of bike lanes. As someone who both drives a car and occasionally bicycles to work, I consider bike lanes a very important infrastructure for rider safety and for driver awareness and security. As a driver I would not want to be in a position of putting a cyclist at risk and as a rider I am always aware of the dangers of riding when there are no bike lanes available. By having clear and separate, well-marked lanes, everyone knows where they should be and  how to behave.\nIn my view, the Ford government is stirring up sentiment about an issue that has a clear path forward. Increased bicycle infrastructure reduces cars on roads and in most cases is quite compatible with driver needs. In those rare cases where it is not the case, municipalities are best positioned to make those decisions in consultation with residents.\n"

Toronto is a biking city.\n"

He hasn't got a clue about the path forward in a world that is finally starting to wake up to the disasters that are imminent due to global warming, and vehicular traffic is very much a part of the problem. The fact that he thinks that ADDING more roads will decrease gridlock is proof that he can't see more than a week into the future. He's a man without foresight who doesn't belong in power in the 21st century. Let him go back to 1950 and let the rest of us move forward.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. Bike lanes both help to improve the carbon footprint of our city and province, but also provide necessary safety and access for the millions of people who use them.\nBike lanes should not be a provincial decision but based on the needs and desires of the city. By passing this bill, you are instead prioritizing the bill of a political representative and his friends, and wasting the resources already spent putting these in place.\nCities all over the world have seen how bike lanes help to reduce traffic. While the result is not immediate, the increased safety the bike lanes allow gradually increases the number of people using bikes for transportation, and as a result reduces the number of cars on the road. As such there is less traffic congestion and accidents. Ultimately, the more bike lanes available, the fewer cars on the road, and overall the safer the roads are for Torontonians and its visitors.\nWith bike lanes increasing demand, this means that the shared city bikes will also be more in demand, and benefit the city as an increasing  revenue source. With less cars on the road, there is also a reduction in emissions and noise pollution.\nInstead of spending so much taxpayer money on undoing the city\u2019s work, it should instead consider congestion charges and using BikeShare revenue to improve the Gardiner, finish the TTC, expansion projects, and reduce the cost of both the TTC and Metrolinx.\nRemoving bike lanes is a municipal issue, not a provincial issue. By passing Bill 212 you are taking away safe and vital access across the city, from all Torontonians.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 would be devastating for our city, our province and the environment.\nWe need more affordable options to get around our city, not less. Many people cannot afford food, never mind a vehicle to get them to their jobs so they can make money to feed their families. Removing bike lanes would remove a safe option for travelling to work everyday.\nAs a person who drives all over the city daily, it\u2019s clear that construction projects and people parking illegally cause the majority of the traffic we see in on our local streets. More lanes doesn\u2019t equal more movement, it means more cars and more cars means more traffic.\nI do not support this bill and think it will be devastating should it move forward.\n"

        "comment": "I totally oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes are hugely important for numerous reasons.. They save lives, have physical health benefits for the general population by promoting active transport, and have far-reaching health benefits by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (with the climate crisis being named as the largest health threat of the 21st century). By justifying the decision to stymie bike lanes on the basis of congestion concerns, the Ontario Government is laying bare that it values an increased travel time of between 2-5 minutes on roads like Bloor St. over the benefits to human health and human life. In my opinion, this is a horrifying position, and one that is not widely held among Ontarians (and certainly not amongst physicians as evidenced by the 120 signatories on an open letter to the government). Moreover, other jurisdictions, such as Copenhagen and New York City, that have expanded bike lane networks have found that over a period of just several years the bike lanes ultimately led to decreased congestion and travel times. Municipalities in Ontario need the opportunity to expand their networks to prove that this is a more sustainable healthier way to reduce congestion rather than preventing development or - worse - ripping up bike lanes which will result only in death and morbidity rather than long-term congestion gains.\n"

Bike lanes are integral to a safe street for pedestrians cyclists and drivers, with no bike lanes cyclists will have to bike on the road which will make it more dangerous for them and the drivers. Also with more people biking, less people will be driving, meaning less congestion! Finally why are we spending good taxpayer money on ripping out bike lanes we just payed to put in, it's SUCH A WASTE!! Please reconsider this stupid plan, it will hurt businesses and make navigating the city more dangerous for everyone!\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford's Bill 212, proposing to remove bike lanes that occupy a lane of traffic, is a poor solution to gridlock. Traffic is caused by an overabundance of cars, not bikes, and removing bike lanes forces cyclists into unsafe conditions or back into cars, worsening congestion. Bike lanes encourage cycling, reduce car reliance, and create safer, more efficient streets. They also benefit small businesses by increasing foot and bike traffic to local shops. Instead of dismantling bike lanes, Ontario needs more public transit and cycling infrastructure to tackle gridlock effectively.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford's Bill 212, targeting bike lanes that occupy a lane of traffic, fundamentally misdiagnoses the cause of gridlock: an overwhelming number of cars. Research shows bike lanes don\u2019t create traffic; they reduce it by encouraging cycling as a viable alternative to driving. They also make streets safer and more accessible for all users. Small businesses benefit, too, as bike lanes boost local foot traffic and draw more customers who shop locally.\nEliminating bike lanes would undo these benefits and further entrench car dependency. A sustainable approach to gridlock must prioritize diverse transportation options, including robust public transit and cycling infrastructure. These alternatives not only ease congestion but also contribute to healthier, more vibrant communities. Removing bike lanes undermines these goals and misses an opportunity to design cities for people, not just cars.\n"

Moreover, they support small businesses by attracting more foot traffic and local customers.
