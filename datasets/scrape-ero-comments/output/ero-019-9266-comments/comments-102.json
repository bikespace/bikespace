This will not reduce traffic as it only encourages vehicular transportation. It only makes it more unsafe and more cyclists will DIE. It\u2019s absurd the province refuses to take care of its people and is making crazy decisions for Toronto without knowing the needs of the city. Inevitably, more people will try to drive and traffic will pile up again. Please do not remove the bike lanes. We should be prioritizing active transportation and transit, not wasting money on this.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a critical, underfunded infrastructure that keep our communities safe. They are not directly correlated to congestion in downtown Toronto. In fact, several busy Toronto streets could benefit from MORE BIKE LANES - not less - making our communities safer and easier to navigate for ALL modes of transportation, not just cars.\nDriving in downtown Toronto is inconvenient, and it should be! It is a luxury. I have a car and I try not to use it in the downtown core. Bike and subway infrastructure benefits everyone. Difficulty driving in downtown Toronto is a natural deterrent, working in our favour to increase the overall health and safety of the city. Less people should drive to the downtown core.\nPlease, I\u2019m begging you, keep these bike lanes intact. I have a young daughter that is growing up in this city - and at her young age we can only safely bike in the few areas that aren\u2019t 100% prioritizing car driving convenience over the safety of everyone else on the road.\nThink of the future, think of the children - build more bike lanes in Toronto (not less) to encourage a healthier lifestyle and a safer community that is more welcoming, and well-balanced (I.e., it\u2019s not car drivers versus everyone else).\nPlease be thoughtful, and do not undo the bike infrastructure that is making this city a better and safer place to live.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government's latest proposal to hinder the implementation of new bike lanes is a glaring testament to the corruption and ineptitude that have become hallmarks of Doug Ford's administration. This thinly veiled attempt to prioritize outdated car-centric policies over sustainable urban development is not just shortsighted\u2014it's a direct attack on the progress Toronto has made toward becoming a more livable, environmentally conscious city.\nDoug Ford and his gang of so-called ministers are transparently catering to special interests at the expense of public health, safety, and the environment. By imposing provincial approval on municipal decisions, they are undermining local autonomy and stifling innovation. It's a classic move from a government more interested in lining its pockets and appeasing lobbyists than in serving the people who elected them.\nCyclists and advocates for sustainable transportation will not be silenced. This community is prepared to vehemently oppose these regressive policies and hold the Ford government accountable for its blatant disregard for the needs of Toronto's residents. The administration's attempts to roll back bike lanes will be met with unwavering resistance, both in the streets and at the ballot box.\nThis proposal doesn't just ignore the environmental implications\u2014it actively exacerbates them by discouraging eco-friendly modes of transportation. The so-called \"Environmental Implications\" section of the proposal is nothing more than a hollow acknowledgment without any substantive commitment to sustainability.\nDoug Ford and his ministers are on notice: the people of Toronto will not tolerate this assault on their city's future. The government's corrupt practices and incompetence are laid bare, and the backlash from the community will be a powerful force demanding real leadership and accountability. It's time for this administration to step aside if it cannot act in the best interests of all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly feel that this newly proposed part of the Traffic Act - which allows the provincial Ministry of Transportation to be informed before municipalities may construct bicycle lanes in certain circumstances, and to require municipalities to provide the Ministry\nwith information, including information relating to bicycle lanes - will result in stalling the construction of new bicycle lanes and even might result in the demolition of already existing bike lanes. In doing so it takes the decision making out of the hands of municipalities, who have the key knowledge of what needs to be done in their cities and towns. This is first hand knowledge about traffic flow, safety for all traffic participants, and environmental impact of the various components of the traffic. That is the reason why municipalities create these bike lanes in the first place. There is no reason why the province would do better. In contrary,  my grave concern is that it will result in a much lower number of bike lanes  and so have a negative environmental impact in cities already congested with cars. More and more people will use bikes as their means as urban transportation and it is a proven fact that bike lanes increase safety, health and help a lot to a get cleaner environment in our cities and towns. Thank you!\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes so more cars can sit in traffic makes zero sense.\nBuilding the 413 across prime farmland also makes no sense.\nThe best way to reduce gridlock and get Ontarians moving is for there to be appreciable investment in public transportation including regional transit outside of the GTHA. Better for commuters, better for the environment.\nThe police could also enforce traffic laws on occasion to keep traffic moving, too. Added bonus of ticketing offsetting their inflated budget.\nIt's embarrassing that the premier is obsessed with being the mayor of Toronto. Doesn't he have an entire province to worry about?\n"

        "comment": "Why exactly is the so-called party of fiscal responsibility so obsessed with wasting as much of the taxpayers' money as humanly possible on stupid, counter-productive nonsense?\nThe rest of your corruption is horrific enough but the removal of these bike lanes is just a vindictive waste of time and money. Premier Ford, you lost the election for Mayor of Toronto - get over it. Stop meddling in minutiae that you have no business interfering with.\nBike lanes are not the enemy of cars. Cyclists are not the enemy of cars. And while we're at it, pedestrians are not the enemy of cars, and buses are not the enemy of cars. None of these things are the reason Toronto is drowning in its own gridlock. There is, however, one clear enemy of every driver on the road. Say it with me:\nCARS ARE THE ENEMY OF CARS.\nSpending money to rip out a few bike lanes only means that cyclists will either a) have to drive to get where they're going, adding yet more traffic to these already clogged routes; b) ride their bikes in the same lane as the cars, slowing down traffic anyway; or c) die when the drivers they're sharing the lanes with run over them. That's to say nothing of the impact on traffic when you actually do the road work to remove these bike lanes.\nThe only way to fix gridlock - the ONLY way - is to encourage people to find alternatives to driving. Study after study after study after study confirms this. \"Just one more lane will fix everything, trust me\" is a MYTH. The fact that this government is willing to throw bad money after good to ultimately make the city's gridlock even worse means that you are dangerously incompetent individuals who have no business being anywhere near the levers of power, or to have any access to the tax money at your disposal.\n"

        "comment": "PERSONAL\nI am a life long rules-of-the-road cyclist. I've ridden 95% of my cycling on roads in traffic following the rules of the road. I've been a competitive, recreational, and commuter cyclist. Although retired, I am still active, riding a bike being my preferred means of transportation. My total life time of bike travel approaches 500,000km. I HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOCKED OFF MY BIKE BY A MOTORIST.\nI have been active in the Ottawa cycling community since 1987 when I joined the Board of Citizens for Safe Cycling (CfSC). As a volunteer, I assisted the organization's delivery of the national CAN-BIKE cyclist education & on-road training program. During ensuing years I've been an advocate for the legal rights of cyclists. In 1994, I led the successful campaign to rescind the then Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton's single file cycling by-law. I convinced members of Regional Council that riding in a group side by side is safer than in a long single line.\nFrom 1997 to 2003, I served on the Board of the Ottawa Bicycle Club. As Touring Director from 1997 - 1999, I wrote policies including it's group riding instructions which still exist today. I was elected President  2000 - 2003.\nBased substantially on my own extensive safe cycling practices and from study of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act, I have a different point of view from both sides of the current public discussion over Premier Ford's plans for bike lanes.\nI AM NOT A FAN OF BIKE LANES IN URBAN AREAS.\nBike lanes are not only inconsistent with the Highway Traffic Act (sections 141(2) Right turns and 148(5) Passing) but, with few exceptions, they do not belong in urban areas where every intersection and driveway is a potential turn conflict point. Bike lanes offer a false sense of security by channeling cyclists to the right of right turning vehicles into what is known among knowledgeable cyclists as the \"hook zone\". On an approach to an intersection (or driveway) it leads cyclists into the blind spots of turning trucks, buses, and other motor vehicles. Such has led cyclists to be seriously or fatality injured. Essentially, in these lanes, cyclists are treated by municipal engineers as \"pedestrians on wheels\" , despite the fact that sidewalk cycling is a very high risk practise.\nOn the other hand, bike lanes - as implemented technically in the form of paved shoulders - make sense on high speed rural roads and highways where intersections and driveways are few and far between, and where vehicles turning tends to be infrequent. Existing paved shoulders however need to be upgraded to the level of bike lane standards particularly at intersections.\nEDUCATION OF CYCLISTS ESSENTIAL. MOTORIST NEED EDUCATION UPGRADE TOO\nMissing from the current media and public discussion is the responsibility of cyclists to acquire the skills and practices to stay safe on a bike. The Netherlands, like much of Europe, is often cited by bike lane activists as a \"cycling paradise\" even though bike infrastructure makes travel inconvenient for all modes. Regardless, the Netherlands requires all children in middle school to learn how to ride in traffic and to obtain a certificate of compliance by the age of 12.\nAlso missing is the responsibility of motorists to acquire a better understanding of cyclist legal rights to the road, including respect for cyclist positioning in vehicular lanes. (* 1st supporting link -Vehicular Cyclist).   Education of cyclists and motorists should be the Province's number one priority, yet neither the Ministry of Education nor the Ministry of Transportation assume much responsibility for such critical safety programs. As a consequence aggressive driving, characterized by threatening motorist behavior, such as verbal abuse and blasting of horns, results in cyclists being intimidated into riding at the far edge of roadways -  a high risk place to be where Illegal and dangerous close passes are frequent.\nSUMMARY\nSimilar views to mine are articulated in a July 11, 2023  Ottawa Citizen article by a Canadian national cycling instructor (* 2nd supporting link below).  She states, \"Education is critical for mutual understanding, safety and respect. Contrary to what many motorists believe, the Ontario Highway Traffic Act (HTA) treats a cyclist as a driver of a vehicle. It is the adherence to this principle that makes the HTA the best possible framework for protecting the safety of cyclists\".\nI AGREE\n"

        "comment": "I live and work in downtown Toronto. As a frequent road user by driving, cycling, and walking, I strongly oppose this proposed legislation as an unnecessary and harmful overreach of provincial authority into municipal matters. Streets should serve people of all abilities, not just those who can afford cars. Every time I choose to bike down Bloor Street, that\u2019s one less car adding to the congestion. People don\u2019t cause gridlock\u2014cars do. By stalling the progress of sustainable transportation options like bike lanes, the province risks worsening traffic and reducing the quality of life for everyone. Additionally, it's bad for business. I will actively avoid going downtown if the bike lanes are poor, because I don\u2019t want to drive and sit in traffic. This plan would discourage sustainable, traffic-reducing transport options, ultimately making cities less accessible and livable.\n"
