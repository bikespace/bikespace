If the bike lane is removed I\u2019ll be forced to drive bc it\u2019s too dangerous. Removing bike lanes will kill people and put more cars on the road. This bill is completely backwards, dangerous and completely overstepping the bounds of the provinces role.\n"

        "comment": "Have any studies been done to determine the amount of people who drive vs the number of people who bike? Because this bill is highly favourable only towards making traffic slightly more convenient for those who drive. It does not at all consider that it is trading the convenience of some for the safety of others. Biking in Toronto is the only means of transportation many people have, and even with bike lanes, it can be dangerous for cyclists. Bike lanes often get blocked when cars park in the bike lane, and cyclists are forced to go around them into traffic. A young woman died in Yorkville in July because a construction bin was left in the bike lane.\nInstead of removing bike lanes to create more traffic lanes, which would encourage more people to drive, which in turn will continue to cause gridlock, the city should be looking at ways to discourage traffic. Separately, the city should be looking at ways to ensure the safety of cyclists in the city. I personally have a car, and a bike. I would prefer to walk or cycle to places I need to go, and use my car for travel, or errands that require it. I only felt safe biking in the city with the past five to six years, after safe, divided bike lanes were installed in the city. I don\u2019t need traffic to ease up. I\u2019m smart enough to plan for traffic if I need to drive in it. What I need from the city is to feel safe as a cyclist. For them to actually care that cars will block bike lanes if there is an opportunity and it\u2019s convenient for them. The fines for endangering someone\u2019s life should be large enough to discourage that behaviour. But instead, the city\u2019s resources are put into parking ticket officers. I\u2019ve never witnessed someone getting a ticket for blocking a bike lane, but thousands of tickets are issued for safe parking infractions like not paying the meter. I\u2019ve also never seen the city put out an educational campaign to educate drivers why they shouldn\u2019t block bike lanes, or what, if any punishment there is for doing so.\nParking in a bike lane should have such a serious repercussion that no one would do it, like having their license suspended and be required to take an in-person full day driver education course before getting it back.\nIt\u2019s very disappointing to think the city wants to place the convenience of some over the safety of others.\n"

        "comment": "I am a car driver who lives in Hamilton, having moved from Toronto. I enjoy walking, driving my car and riding my bike. I want to feel safe in each of these ways of moving through the cities I live in. I have travelled widely and have seen the benefits of bike lanes on main streets everywhere I have seen them: everyone has a safe space to move through their city, the local small businesses thrive by having people walk and bike by their stores, more people take their bikes rather than drive, reducing their own costs, and improving the air for all. It should be up to city councils to make decisions about local transportation options. Our city taxes pay for them and our city councillors are accountantable to us. The provincial MPPs should focus on their own areas of need ( e.g. Health and Education) and not interfere in local decision making. This is a large overreach by the province, and will only result in unnecessary costs to undo work that has been paid for, and which will likely be redone in the future. It seems petty and vindicative.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives. They protect cyclists and make it easier for car drivers to share the road. They promote local business and make sidewalks safer for pedestrians. Biking is environmentally friendly and good for your physical and mental health.\nIn large cities especially one cannot expect to easily take a massive vehicle with them wherever they go. Compare the space 100 bikes take up versus 100 cars on the road or in a parking lot. Safe alternatives to cars must be provided to create a functional city.\nIt strongly goes against the ethos of a \"conservative\" government to tell municipalities what they can do. To spend money ripping out a project that was already approved and costs millions should have conservative voters and politicians appalled.\n"

At least once per week, I have a confrontation where a driver gets mad at me for being on the edge of the road. I prefer not to ride on the sidewalk as I am not supposed to but sometimes that is my only option.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212.\nAs someone who uses the bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge Street in Toronto daily, I know how safe they keep cyclists. I would not feel comfortable riding as much as I do (year-round) without the bike infrastructure we have. Over the last few years, bike lanes have saved many lives, and I have noticed that many more people use them year-round.  When people feel safe, they ride more.\nAlso, the impact on business has been positive, especially in the Anex and Danforth areas.   I am more likely to stop and shop at businesses that are on a bike line than when I am in my car. Pulling over, locking up your bike, and shopping is so much easier.\nIt is wrong for the provincial government to tell communities where they can and can not have bike lanes. The people who live in an area should decide where bike lanes should go.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m deeply disappointed about this proposed decision to remove bike lanes from much needed corridors in Toronto. Bike lanes are proven to prevent deaths and keep both drivers and cyclists safer. As a driver, I prefer dedicated bike lanes that allow me a clearer line of sight of cyclists. As a cyclist, I feel much safer on routes that have bike lanes. We should be encouraging more people to consider biking instead of the opposite. We are in a climate crisis, and reducing emissions through bike travel should be part of the plan. Also, the money that will be required for this plan is money that would be much better spent invested in communities and social infrastructure. Children, youth, and families are struggling to find the services and supports they need. We need stronger human and community services organizations to address many of these challenges. We need to address the cost of living crisis, food insecurity, housing shortages and affordability, and access to child care, health care, addictions support, and more. Stop prioritizing destroying existing infrastructure and put our tax dollars where it will really benefit Ontario communities.\n"

I don't appreciate paying double to end up with the same infrastructure.\nFor the sake of the environment and global warming, do we not want to encourage people to  bike rather than drive?  Biker safety is an important component of this.\nAs a driver, I HATE having to maneuver around cyclists. Roads with bike lanes eliminate this need (and this risk to cyclist and driver safety).\n"

        "comment": "To Whom it May Concern,\nI am incredibly concerned about this bill. I am a car-lover and also an avid biker for getting around my region of Kitchener-Waterloo. As someone who appreciates driving, I think this bill is going backwards and is a lousy pander to suburbanites in attempt to earn votes.\nIf the goal is to reduce congestion, bikes are a fantastic solution that should be ENCOURAGED. Less cars on the road is the only way to reduce gridlock. As we have seen in the terrible experiment that plagues us all, the widening of the 401 has had diminishing returns and clogs up as soon as that magic new lane is opened. When I want to drive, I appreciate that others are choosing to bike so that I can get where I need to when I need to. A mixed approach of biking, transit and personal auto travel should be options when we all pay for the infrastructure.\nNot to mention the hilarious greenwashing Ontario ads I have seen during Sunday football as of late. Airing ads like this while demolishing brand-new bike infrastructure is remarkable.\nAs cars become increasingly unaffordable for the average individual, bikes are a fantastic substitute. I guarantee there are many people in office who order food from users of bike infrastructure.\nTo conclude, as a concerned driver and biker who believes more options are the solution to reduction of traffic, I believe this heavy-handed legislation and overall appalling infrastructure planning from Ontario as a whole is pathetic. Decades of short-term planning continue to create messes for the long-run success of this province, and I see this bill as evidence that there is no stopping this for the future.\nThank you for reading my concern,\nBen\n"

Keeping people in cars only increases congestion, worsens gridlock, and perhaps most importantly negatively impacts the physical and mental health of Ontarians.\nLet's eliminate food deserts so families can walk to their nearest grocery store.\nLet's improve public MASS transit systems, making them the more attractive option.\nLet's keep our sidewalks in good repair, making them safer and more enjoyable to get outside and walk!\n"

        "comment": "I don't think this makes much sense, we need to be looking to ways in which we can reduce carbon emissions while increasing methods of transportation that can be used by all people not solely those who can afford cars and the associated fees.\nI have used various modes of transportation through my life in the city of Toronto, while I am in a car, I am constantly stressed because many people do not seem to understand the rules of the road and stop their cars randomly, there are also a number of vehicles that try to squeeze through the intersections and block traffic. When I go into the downtown core I much prefer to use alternate modes of transportation which generally do not have these higher levels of stress. When I walk or bike I am also able to stop at a wider range of shops that tickle my fancy because I am not stuck in traffic. Biking in the protected lanes has also been much safer for bikers and drivers as there is a bit less of the intermingling between the transportation types. Further bike lanes provide further protection for pedestrians who seem to no longer look both ways before crossing the road.\nRather than remove bike lanes, we should look to increase the amount of protected bike lanes within the city to create a connected network that does not rely on going through parks. Through an increase in protected bike lanes I have already noted a greater number of younger people and children learning to navigate commuting through the city. We have to recognize that safety and access to the city is intended for all residents regardless of age or access to a moto vehicle. We should also recognize that drivers are no longer obeying traffic laws and that even being a pedestrian has become frightening at times. Bike lanes increase safety for cyclists and pedestrians while also getting bikers out of the way of motorized vehicles.\n"

So many, so many accidents in the news about cyclists getting hitting because they as passing a car on the right side while the car is turning right into a driveway.\nAlso some bikes come flying down the bike lanes. It is so  challenging for our car drivers to look behind them and look down a block or two to see if they can turn right into a driveway while making sure they don\u2019t hit the car in front of them while in terrible congestion.\nTechnically making a right hand turn from the second lane in a roadway is illegal and these bike lanes are to the right of the car lanes. So it is illegal for a vehicle to turn right.\nPlease make the roads safe and legal again.\n"

It is unfortunate that Doug does not live with reality.  Riding your bike leaves cleaner air and is much healthier for the individual who chooses to ride rather than drive a vehicle - saving health care funds that Doug does not know how to manage.  We will never have proper public transit given that Doug thinks the current Metrolinx knows what he is doing.  The head of Metrolinx should have been let go years ago.   The Eglinton LRT is an embarrassment.  I hope common sense will not only stop this Bill.  There is no valid reason to remove existing bike lanes.\n"
