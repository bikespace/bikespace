The gridlock in Toronto has nothing to do with bike lanes and everything to do with DEVELOPMENT in a city which does not have the infrastructure to support these new buildings.\nWe just had one of the warmest Halloween\u2019s on record, could someone please explain to me how opening up access to cars, one of the biggest polluters, is a way of solving the climate crisis?\nLastly, bike lanes SAVE LIVES! If you get rid of the bike lanes and even ONE CYCLIST DIES, the blood will be on your hands.\nI am asking the Ontario Government to STAY IN YOUR LANE and get out of ours!\n"

        "comment": "I find the approach to this puzzling.  Most of the gridlock is on highways like the Gardner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway, 401, 404, and QEW.  Yet these roads do not have bike lanes.  The problem is that there are too many cars.  The Government should be encouraging and subsidizing alternate forms of transportation to reduce the number of cars.\nRemoval of bike lanes in cities is troublesome as it may encourage more driving, therefore increasing gridlock.  Bike lanes and other infrastructure can protect bicycle riders from injury or death.\nBuilding safe bicycle lanes can promote cycling as a safe alternative form of transportation and help reduce gridlock\n"

Instead, please focus on reducing congestion by offering more ways to get around the city  such as with public transport, walking, biking, etc, NOT BY CAR. There is a climate emergency and we need to reduce vehicles on the road, not add more to it. This is a crazy move by a horrible provincial government that is deeply unpopular in the city of Toronto. After destroying Ontario Place and almost destroying the greenbelt this is another move against nature and climate solutions. Please keep our bike lanes and keep your dirty hands out of our cities!!\n"

        "comment": "This is a significant step back in providing safe transportation options to all municipalities of Ontario. Not only is this a  corrupt move by the premier, it is on baseless evidence that cycling infrastructure causes gridlock on the streets. All studies, research, and evidence point to the opposite. The Cities have presented facts and evidence that have been ignored. Irresponsible use of tax payers money. The purpose of the government is to use this money to benefit the residents of this province. Yet it is only being used to line the pockets of the premiers friends, the developers.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential infrastructure for large and growing cities.\n1. Safety. They provide safety for people who ride bicycle, whether they are commuting or going to school or exercising or running errands or making deliveries or conducting their businesses. All people benefit from bike lanes - it separates bikes from cars, meaning that cars are able to have their own space as well and can travel at the speed limit, rather than being forced to slow down and move around bikes.\n2. Environment. Encouraging people to choose modes of transportation other than cars is an important way of reducing Ontario's carbon footprint and meeting environmental goals. Bike lanes regulate the speed of traffic and encourage not only bike use but walking as well. Additionally, bike lanes can be used be delivery vehicles to reduce the environmental cost of last-mile deliveries.\n3. Accessibility. Many people cannot use cars, whether due to cost, age, medical condition, or legal reasons. Having bike lanes means creating a space for those people to exist safely and get where they need to go without fear.\n4. Cost. The targeted bike lanes are new and well-used. Removing them now just means pouring bad money after good. Bike lanes have been proven in multiple studies to actually increase the revenue of stores along those routes, when compared to car lanes or parking lanes.\nAdding this bill as an addendum, at such short notice, and targeting those streets is simply the vindictive act of a premier who doesn't know about or care about his constituents. All evidence points towards bike lanes adding positively to a city where car lanes detract. Having one more car lane isn't going to make commutes shorter, but it will materially and negatively impact the lives of everyone who relies on them.\n"

I commute from Major Street to Lansdowne Ave. These lanes have make my commute active and safe. If removed, they will endanger me as I continue my commute, on bicycle, on Bloor. This legistlation aims to make my day more dangerous.\nWhy is my provincial government, which has no mandate to conduct this gross overreach into municipal decisions, making my commute more dangerous? This is a disgusting piece of legislation.\n"

The government apparently wants to waste my tax dollars to tear up bike lanes that were JUST put in.  If the vast majority of Torontonians oppose this bill, it is a disgusting overstep by the provincial government to reach into their city and change things against their will. This bill was the talk of my workplace this week - literally not one single person thought it is right for the provincial government to do this. Everyone deemed it a massive overstep by Doug Ford, even my coworkers who live in places like Barrie and Vaughan. If this bill moves forward it could legitimately cost Ford the election because it is completely opposite of Conservative government and voter values.\n"

Secondly, spending taxpayer money to rip up bike lanes that are already installed is just idiotic. The construction alone from doing that will cause all kinds of gridlock. This government is spending taxpayer money on things that don\u2019t matter or that it has no business interfering in when healthcare and education in this province is falling apart.\n"

The last thing we need is the provincial government exercising unnecessary oversight and trying to control something that is clearly a municipal issue. It'd be a waste of funds, time, and hassle of having to deal with the construction. Bike lanes save lives. If the premier is so concerned about congestion, he should be looking at more productive suggestions (e.g., provincial subsidies for public transit and...you guessed it...cycling infrastructure).\n"

The Bloor, Avenue Road and Yonge Street bike lanes have been a godsend for city cyclists. They ensure less chance of being injured or killed by vehicles much larger and more powerful than ourselves. They also keep bikes OUT of the way of vehicles! Millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on this infrastructure only very recently. For a Conservative government to be wasting our dollars to rip out lanes that have only just been installed is completely nonsensical. If the government of Ontario were wasting money in this way in any other context there would be an outcry. You are actively discriminating against the large number of Toronto residents who use bicycles as their means of transportation. If this action were used against any other group in our society it would be deemed prejudicial.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a resident of Toronto. I mostly use transit to commute to work, cycle when I need to get around the core and drive when I'm going further distances. I do not support removing bike lanes, especially the University, Yonge st and Bloor st lanes!\nI can't speak to Bloor West Village area, but I'm a regular user of the Danforth/Bloor bike lanes from Coxwell over to Christie. Those lanes are very heavily used, not just during typical commute times, but weekends as well. Without those lanes, I would not feel safe cycling along Bloor, which would lead me to use a car instead and would just delay other drivers that are unable to walk/cycle/transit.\nRegarding Yonge and University, I will continue to cycle on these roads with or without bike lanes and I will be taking the whole lane, as is allowed under the HTA.  I am not comfortable moving toward the curb to allow cars to pass because they try to squeeze by with much less than the required 1m clearance. This will slow down the entire right lane for all drivers.\nWhen I am driving around the city, I appreciate having cyclists in a dedicated lane because I am less nervous at intersections that a cyclist may end up\nIf you want to stop bike lanes from being installed out in Parry Sound, Milton, or wherever, that's fine if that is what those areas want. Toronto, and particularly downtown Toronto, has seen big increases in cyclists (see the increases in Bike Share trips over the last 5 years). To keep traffic moving bike lanes will take drivers off the road for shorter trips, which will allow those making longer trips in the city to have a less congested drive.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nLong time city cyclist here.\nI think that bike lanes on major arterial roads are insane. Aside from any concerns about motor vehicle traffic, they are a terrible experience for cyclists. There is so much chaos between pedestrians crossing, delivery vehicles, ebikes, swinging car doors (door prizes) and right-turning cars that I actually feel very unsafe and I avoid them if possible.\nI'm speaking specifically about the big roads like Bloor and Yonge in downtown Toronto. The bike lanes on smaller secondary streets like Davenport, Harbord and Christie are great.\nSo, I have 2 main comments here:\n1. Rip away the bike lanes on big streets, go for it. But please don't make restrictions on bike lanes for secondary roads.\n2. (This is out of scope for the current proposal, but it's worth mentioning). If we want to improve traffic on major arterial roads, can you also rip out street parking? It seems insane to me that a handful of people parking on major roads can choke traffic for everyone.\nThanks,\nMark\n"
