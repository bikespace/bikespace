        "comment": "Last week I witnessed an Ambulance having to travel on the wrong side of the road (eastbound on a westbound section of Bloor) for two blocks before they could travel onto Royal York heading to the emerg sept at SJHospital.   The one eastbound lane was backed up with cars from Royal York to Brentwood Ave ( which is 2 blocks west of RY.  The other lane has been taken over by a bike lane. The Ambulance came from avail ke south North to Bloor but could not turn onto Bloor due to the congestion and obviously the cars could not move out of the way thus the ambulance hesitated and waited for the westbound traffic to clear to the west and then took the single westbound lane in an easterly direction for 2 blocks befor turning off Bloor onto Royal York.    First responders safety issues here:  hesitantly in transporting a person to hospital lost valuable 1-2 minutes then safety of travel on the wrong side of the road for 2 blocks (central  median).  Distorted traffic patterns due to volume overloaded road congestion caused by reducing traffic lanes available by half!  Poor and dangerous non-planning by the the city traffic planning department?\n"

        "comment": "I am  not in favour of the bike lanes along Bloor in Bloor west village to Kingsway.  Bloor is now a very congested street for vehicles, I have seen fire trucks and other emergency vehicles who cannot get through in Kingsway area as there is no place for cars to pull over the let them pass, it is almost impossible to turn onto Bloor from side street and there are few if any cyclists using the lanes when I drive or walk along Bloor street in the Kingsway area.   To be honest people do not cycle to work downtown from Bloor west or Kingsway as it\u2019s too far a bicycle commute.   If you are not convinced have some research done to track how many bikes actually use the bike lanes and on the vehicles that are stop and go on Bloor from west of Islington right to and through Bloor West.  My travel time has doubled in this stretch. Revisit and remove\n"

        "comment": "We want to be able to get around Toronto quickly and safely. The bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University help us do that. We live a block away from the Bloor bike lanes. Depending on where we need to go we bike, take transit or drive. Removing the bike lanes would remove an efficient option for getting around and push us to drive more. More driving would increase gridlock.\nMy partner relies on the bike lanes to get to work quickly and safely. We just want effective transportation and this bill would remove that.\nThe removal of these bike lanes would also make the experience of driving in the city worse. Keeping cyclists separate from drivers is easier for everyone. The removal of the bike lanes would put more cyclist back in front of vehicles.\nA tremendous amount of study and consultation has gone into every Toronto bike lane. The conclusion of that has been clear: bike lanes are efficient, good for local business, and make us all safer. All we need to do is let cities keep making these decisions themselves.\nThis removal of these bike lanes by the province would be expensive and wasteful overreach. Don't waste the taxes I pay.\n"

Additionally, this style of bike lane places the car driver in danger as the driver must exit vehicle into a traffic lane.\n"

        "comment": "I take Bloor St. from the DVP exit all the way to the west end as part of my drive home so I have first hand experience on how the bike lanes can be both hazardous to pedestrians and vehicles.\n- The parking spots are difficult to get in to and force drivers to open doors into traffic\n- Cyclists act like a privileged class - the drivers are the ones who pay the taxes to maintain those roads they bike on. Cyclists don't pay to maintain the roads. I have had cyclists spit on me when I honked at him after he too the car lane because he was too impatient in his own protected lane. They also are known to kick cars when a car is turning, even if the car was there first.\n- When there is an emergency (fire truck or ambulance), there is no wiggle room when traffic is heavy due to the concrete curbs that are in place. Second matter when it's an emergency - it could mean a loss of life.\n- During winter, there are very few cyclists (if any, especially outside of the city proper) and vehicular traffic is impacted still. It's really stupid.\n- Some roads like Bloor are very tight and landlocked (especially where there is a bridge). To provide a dedicated cyclist lane is ridiculous.\n- Cyclists downtown (especially food delivery cyclists) just weave in and out of traffic. They should be redirected more to a parallel street with less vehicular traffic.\n"

There are a large number of fellow healthcare workers who I see daily biking to and from work. It's terrifying to think of the loss of these bike lanes as I would not feel safe getting to work by bike without them. Please reconsider this bill and ensure that Toronto bikers have safe options to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "The premier\u2019s decision has unfortunately not been data-driven and will:\n1) Reduce affordability - travel costs are frequently the most impactful after shelter costs. Car ownership is the most expensive form of movement, negatively impacts those in low-income groups disproportionately and the supporting car-based infrastructure is a high drain on tax payer dollars. Offering multiple modes of transit provides transportation equity and better bang for your buck.\n2) Reduce road safety - all road users (pedestrians, cyclists, car users and public transit) are safer when roads are fairly divided and segmented for different road users. Cyclists do not drift into roadways meant for cars or pedestrians and vice versa leading to accidents.\n3) Increase congestion/ traffic - studies show that the only effective means of reducing traffic is to provide alternate modes of travel. The more individuals are forced into car use due to non-existent or unsafe cycling conditions, the more existing car users will see the increased traffic on their routes.\n4) Reduce health and well-being - transportation is the highest source of emissions in Canada. Poor air quality impacts mental health and cognitive functioning. Climate change is driving a slew of issues ranging from health to infrastructure. Offering alternate transit modes such as cycling is imperative.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide a safe route for people that commute by bicycle by separating them from drivers that are increasingly distracted and aggressive.\nThe only thing that causes gridlock is traffic(cars, trucks, construction vehicles).  Remove the bike lanes and you are only inviting more motorized vehicles which leads to more gridlock.  Alternatively, remove street parking, or restrict it during rush hours.  Stop allowing construction sites to take over road lanes. Restrict the size of vehicles.\nIt is short-sighted to continue to push agendas supporting cars.  In a 2019 survey by Canada Black Book, less than 50% of people aged 18-34 own or lease a vehicle siting they can't afford, the rising price of gas and the desire to go green. Let's face it. The situation has not improved.\nBut most importantly, you can't use a broad brush to paint policy.  Every community has it's own needs.  Toronto needs and wants bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "1. Grid lock is caused by lack of transport alternatives to driving and poor zoning and planning in the GTA. If it were possible for people to walk, bike, and or transit, to their work, their home, and daily amenities, we would solve grid lock. Making fewer transit options by getting rid of bike lanes will increase drivers and make grid lock even worse.\n2. Bikes are being used as a scapegoat here. Construction, Uber and other such delivery services, and a sudden population increase with little or no infrastructure improvements are most likely far larger contributors to grid lock than anything else. If we are serious about reducing grid lock we should be managing  these issues better.\n3. It is irresponsible for government officials to use scapegoating and emotional theatre instead of data to make policy. These politicians are obscuring the truth and preventing diligent rational decisions from being made.\n"

        "comment": "My comment is focused on the proposed Bike Lane Framework.\nAs a citizen of Ontario and a resident of Toronto for 10 years now, I am deeply concerned about the prospect of bike lanes in the city being removed. I beg the province reconsider this proposal; passing it in its current form would put lives at risk, including my own, and make this province a worse place in which to live.\nProvincial overreach and increased red tape\nPassage of this bill would increase red tape for municipalities across the province, making it more difficult to build critically needed infrastructure and improve cities. Decisions around transportation and city planning should be left to municipalities.\nWaste of taxpayer dollars and harm to small businesses\nRemoval of critical infrastructure such as the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes in Toronto would be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars at the hands of the province. Local businesses have seen an increase in sales/customers since the installation of the bike lanes, and multiple BIAs have come out in opposition to this proposal.\nCyclist and pedestrian safety\nRemoval of these critical bike lanes would put lives at risk, full stop. I cycle to work daily and fear for my life even with bike lanes. A young woman my age, Alex Amaro, was killed by a driver on Dufferin Street in 2020. Her life could have been saved had there been a bike lane, and every day I fear that tomorrow this could be me. Countless studies show that narrower streets with fewer lanes of traffic and reduced speed limits are safer not only for cyclists, but for pedestrians and drivers as well. Human lives should always come first, full stops. Even if bike lanes did cause congestion (which they don't!), the safety of a city's residents is far more important than saving a few minutes in a commute. There's no comparison.\nPolicy founded in fact\nThe statistics that the province has cited around Bill 212 have been erroneous and shared without context. Yes, congestion has increased in big cities in the province, but that has kept up with the pace of population growth, not the installation of bike lanes. Bike lanes globally have been found to increase the number of cyclists, decreasing the number of motorists on the roads and decreasing congestion, or in the worst cases, not resulting in any change. Please listen to the advice of experts, including the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, on these issues. The removal of bike lanes will not help with congestion.\nEnvironmental impact\nOntario is also facing a climate crisis, and the province should be doing all in its power to fight against global warming and reduce emissions. The switch from motor vehicles to more sustainable forms of transit, including cycling, is key to solving the climate crisis. The province needs to encourage more cycling in order to protect our environment for generations to come, and removal of bike lanes is in direct contradiction to this.\nPassage of Bill 212 would be disastrous for the health and safety of the people of Ontario. This government must respect the lives of its constituents.\n"

        "comment": "As a local resident and regular cyclist, I strongly support the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor Street West.  Despite the frequently referenced, scientifically skewed statistics the city has touted regarding the benefits of the bike lanes, we have personally seen our commute times increase dramatically and we have stopped frequenting certain local businesses in Etobicoke because there is no longer anywhere to park and/or the travel times are now too long.  Unfortunately, we have seen one of these businesses go out of business in that time due to a loss of customers, and we are also reducing our spend on after school programs with local businesses as traffic takes us too long to get our children to these activities on time directly from school.  This represents an economic loss to our community, and a reduced quality of life for our whole family.  As a regular cyclist, I feel considerably less safe on the newly installed Bloor bike lanes than I did when there were 4 lanes of traffic due to their design and therefore avoid it as much as possible when riding.\n"

        "comment": "Municipal governments are better placed to make decisions about roads and road users.\nTraffic congestion is a complex issue and making more lanes of traffic available to cars often does not lead to less congestion. Construction, parking, how drivers use roads (blocked intersections are fairly typical in downtown Toronto during rush hours) have more far more impact than bike lanes on select roads.\nEvery person on a bike is one less car on the road while in motion and one less car in the road while parked. Protecting and encouraging  road users who are not causing congestion with a car is a better long term solution to traffic congestion.\nNot to mention walking and cycling are healthier ways (for our environment and our bodies) of moving around the city than driving a car.\nWe should be encouraging people to find car alternatives to moving around and not making infrastructure changes that make non-car modes of transport less safe. Doing so will just mean more cars and more congestion.\nPlease allow municipalities to make their own infrastructure decisions. Constituents elected their municipal representatives to do this NOT the province.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes when studies show that they've increased safety and provide economic benefits to neighborhoods is asinine.\nAs a delivery courier, both bike and truck, removing these lanes would be a mistake, simple as. They keep cyclists safely in the bike lanes where we're/they're more predictable and visible. Having no lane would return said lane mostly to parked cars which would have cyclists take the only remaining lane. Traffic would weave in and out of lanes more chaotically and random junctures increasing the likelihood of collisions.\nHighway 413 might be seen as a necessary project but doing so without assessing the surrounding environment puts various wildlife at risk and can have long lasting effects to the Humber River watershed. I happen to enjoy the Humber River and after what's happened with the chemical spill in Mimico Creek, I've been more concerned and observant about waterways.\nProviding broadband to rural communities is good. That should be a separate bill.\n"
