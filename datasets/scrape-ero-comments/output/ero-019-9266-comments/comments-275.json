        "comment": "The recent Ontario Bill 212, requiring cities to seek provincial permission to build or maintain bike lanes at the cost of car lanes, introduces unnecessary red tape, contrary to Ontario\u2019s commitment to reducing bureaucratic barriers. This oversight infringes on local governments\u2019 autonomy to implement essential safety measures and undermines the urgent need for safer, more sustainable urban mobility.\nBike lanes are a critical safety feature, especially on high-traffic streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University, where cyclists are at significant risk. According to Teschke et al. (2012), segregated bike lanes reduce cycling injuries by 90% compared to streets without cycling infrastructure, underscoring the necessity of these lanes in Toronto\u2019s most congested corridors. The presence of bike lanes also legitimizes cycling as a form of transit, catering to vulnerable road users whose safety must be prioritized over mere convenience (Aldred, 2018).\nFurthermore, the notion that removing bike lanes will improve car traffic flow is a misconception. Research shows that more lanes don\u2019t alleviate traffic congestion; instead, they encourage additional car use, a phenomenon known as induced demand (Duranton & Turner, 2011). This misguided focus on road expansion not only worsens congestion over time but also undermines efforts toward greener, more efficient transport systems. Allowing cities to prioritize cycling infrastructure\u2014even at the cost of car lanes\u2014is a meaningful step toward a safer, more accessible, and environmentally responsible future.\nReferences:\n\u2022\tTeschke, K., Harris, M.

        "comment": "This legislation is counterproductive. The only way to reduce congestion in Toronto is to reduce the number of cars. That requires providing people with alternatives to driving. I have lived and worked on Bloor since before the bike lanes were added, and the second vehicle lane was alway blocked by parked cars. So in reality, the bike lanes have not reduced the lanes available for drivers. It is also less stressful to drive with the bike lanes because I do not have to worry about cyclists. Like many people, I both drive and bike on Bloor, Yonge, and University and the bike lanes are better for everyone.\nIt would be a better use of my tax money to focus on improving transit, especially GO and the TTC, so that fewer people need to drive.\n"

        "comment": "It is an inappropriate overreach of power for the Ontario government to override municipalities regarding local infrastructure issues such as bike lanes. Municipal governments are voted in by city residents, and should be able to make decisions that reflect the health, safety, and transportation needs of those residents. The provincial government must refrain from interfering in such municipal matters.\nBike lanes are a health and safety concern in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes make the city safer, period. I commute on weekdays on the Bloor St. bike lane and am continuously impressed by how well-used it is. Removing the bike lane would force many commuters (including parents biking their children to school) to either compromise their safety by continuing to bike without the safety of dedicated lanes, or change their method of transportation. I have no doubt that many would instead opt to drive or use taxis or Ubers. This would for course further contribute to the gridlock the province is claiming they will solve. (It is also worth mentioning that it is safer for everyone, including pedestrian and drivers, when bikes have proper dedicated lanes.)\nNot only do the bike lanes on Bloor greatly decrease gridlock, they also help relieve the issue of overcrowding on the TTC during rush hour.\nThis Bill is not based on evidence, and goes against the wellbeing of all of Toronto's residents. The province must refrain from imposing suburban and rural interests onto urban environments.\nGovernment of Ontario, stay in your lane!\nMJ\n"

        "comment": "What a stupid waste of money. The city has spent money on a good peice of infrastructure for the city. Thousands of people, including healthcare workers like myself use this infrastructure to safely get around the city. If there\u2019s an issue with gridlock, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t get a fricken transit project launched. Why don\u2019t you take the money and spend it on things that will reduce congestion, instead of vanity projects that will be expensive, and cause even more gridlock and disruption.\nIf you used your pea sized conservative \u201cbrain trust\u201d you\u2019d realize that cars cause congestion, and removing cars from the road (I.e. bike lanes) would *gasp* reduce congestion. If you go through with this, I\u2019ll be donating my \u201cDoug bucks\u201d to whichever opposition party has the best chance to defeat the pc party in my riding for the spring election.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes from sections of Bloor and Yonge streets and University Ave. would have extremely negative impacts on my quality of life, and on many in my community. As a Toronto resident who depends on these bike lanes to get around the city to work; to social occasions and events; to appointments and more.\nI choose cycling as my main form of transportation because it has little-to-no negative environmental impact, allows me to travel quickly around the city, and is good for my physical health. I cannot afford to buy a car or take regular Ubers to get around, and our underfunded public transit system is consistently unreliable.\nEven with the current bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge streets and University Ave., I am endangered on a daily basis as a cyclist. On every ride I take, cars illegally parked in the bike lanes, trucks or other types of construction or obstructions force me into the road. Many drivers are aggressive when this happens, tailgating me or passing me closely.\nIn 2020, a cyclist friend of mine was killed while biking on Dufferin Ave. off of Bloor, when a car hit her from behind and forced her unti oncoming traffic. She was 23.\nJust last week, another cyclist friend of mine flew over her handlebars after someone opened their driver-side door as she was going by. Luckily, she sustained only minor injuries.\nAlmost everyone in my community, cyclist or not, has similar stories.\nPlease reconsider removing these bike lanes in downtown Toronto that me and so many others depend on for environmentally-friendly, cheap and physically healthy transportation. If these bike lanes are removed, my life will be in more daily physical danger than it already is \u2014 because I will continue to bike around, only on the roadway, potentially slowing down the flow of vehicular traffic.\nPlease consider increased TTC funding as an alternative. A more reliable and affordable public transit system would keep me off the roads entirely, benefitting both road traffic and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolute disgrace.  Bike lanes are safer for all road users.   Removing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock, it's actually been proven time and time again.  More car lanes means more cars.  What an significant provincial overreach and all because Doug Ford has some rich friends who told him bike lanes are bad.  If the minister of transportation actually used the provincial infrastructure, ie: Go, to get from his house in Brampton to downtown Toronto he'd get there faster regardless of how many bike lanes there are or aren't on Toronto streets.\n"

As we all know, the planet is heating up. It is good whenever it is more convenient to bike (with zero emissions) than drive. Bike lanes save lives and promote healthy living, and more more people per hour than any road lane.\nIf Doug thinks bikes cause congestion, I\u2019d encourage him to stand in the middle of the 401 and see how fluid the circulation is with no bikes.\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly against this proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University in favor of more motor vehicle lanes. This plan is counterproductive, sacrificing sustainable urban infrastructure and worsening Toronto\u2019s traffic and environmental issues.\nBike lanes are essential for reducing congestion, improving air quality, and promoting healthier, alternative transportation options. Removing them ignores their role in mitigating gridlock by encouraging cycling as a viable mode of transport. Increasing vehicle lanes may offer a short-term solution but will likely lead to more cars, more emissions, and worsened air quality, detracting from the quality of life in Toronto.\nThe decision to exempt this initiative from the Environmental Assessment Act is a blatant disregard for the environmental impact of increased motor vehicle traffic and the loss of green transit options. Such an exemption raises serious concerns about transparency and the government\u2019s commitment to sustainability, making it crucial that any review of bike lane removal includes a full environmental impact assessment.\nThis proposal moves Ontario backward, prioritizing cars over comprehensive urban health and environmental sustainability. I object to this plan and urge the government to maintain and expand bike lanes to support a balanced, forward-thinking approach to urban infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential for the safety of cyclists in a big city. I cannot believe the Ontario provincial government is contemplating removing them in Toronto. This would be a massive step back from a safety and environment perspective. It makes us, the people who actually live in the city, suspect that the Ontario provincial government cares more about the vote bank of suburban drivers as compared to the lives of the ordinary people who live and bike here.\n6 cyclists have died on Toronto roads so far in 2024, up from 1 in 2023. And instead of making the roads safer for us, you are trying to make them more dangerous. I am appalled at this inhumane attitude.\nPlease, support cyclists and pedestrians. Stay away from what should be a city issue, NOT provincial.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is part of the culture of a developed municipality where citizens of all ages can have the freedom of mobility, especially for short range commutes.  It is essential to support the continuously growing network in an ever expanding metropolitan area to promote dense living.\nThe Bloor, Yonge, University arterial roads carry a huge number of cyclists each day bringing them into the core to engage in business and pleasure.  Without major arterial bike lanes, cyclists, many of whom do not own cars, are left with the following choices\n1) Take an entire car lane, holding up traffic - Essentially, car traffic does not benefit, and traffic flow remains the same.  Bicycles share roads with motor vehicles, and increase the danger of collision and safety is greatly reduced.  Car traffic does NOT increase, only the perception of it.  Cycling on car lanes is not for the faint of heart, for instance, youth and seniors would definitely not feel safe.\n2) Take alternate cycling routes - This is not possible in many scenarios.  This increases frustration in cyclists if there are not roads where cyclists feel welcome.  It gives priority to motor vehicles to roads, which have been designed for ALL commuters into the city.  No roads have been proposed as relief routes to take in the reduced traffic.\n3) Abandon cycling, and use alternate means.  The TTC network has already been proven to not be able to provide a reliable commuting service.  The King street car pilot showed that extensive traffic controls are necessary in order for street cars to pass through the downtown core.  Metrolinx projects are currently under construction for several more years but until then we need to wait.\nLike it or not, cycling is here to stay.  The province MUST work together with the cities to manage how bikes, pedestrians, transit and drivers ALL can coexist.  Whether it is by dedicating entire roads to separate, or split lanes, Ontario cannot become a world-class province without creating a common solution for all its people.\n"

Expanding bike infrastructure enhances urban mobility by encouraging safer, eco-friendly transportation options and reducing vehicle emissions. Increased bike lanes foster a healthier community, promote active lifestyles, and relieve road congestion over time. Prioritizing cyclists aligns with broader environmental goals, supporting sustainable city growth. While adjusting vehicle lanes may initially slow traffic, this investment in cycling infrastructure ultimately contributes to a balanced, multimodal transit network that benefits all road users.\n"

        "comment": "As a bicycle commuter I disagree with the proposal. Adding more car lanes to a roadway often fails to alleviate traffic gridlock due to a phenomenon known as induced demand. When additional lanes are created, they may initially reduce congestion, but this can lead to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road as more drivers are encouraged to use the expanded capacity. Over time, the influx of new drivers can quickly fill the new lanes, returning traffic conditions to their previous state or even worsening them. Moreover, expanding roadways can lead to longer commutes and increased urban sprawl, further exacerbating the problem. Effective solutions to traffic gridlock often require a multifaceted approach, including improved public transportation, better urban planning, and policies that promote alternative modes of travel such as bicycles.\n"

        "comment": "This is a horribly short sighted decision putting cyclist lives in danger. I personally use these lanes frequently and will be negatively affected by their removal. It is embarrassing the emphasis we put on car traffic in this city. Caronto. If resolving gridlock was actually a concern, fixing our painful transit system should be the first thing to look at. I bike, because the TTC is awful. Illegally parked cars, blocking boxes, running lights cause more gridlock than bike lanes. If a lane is getting removed, it must be replaced immediately. And not through dangerous parts of the city like the city did with Sherbourne. I refuse to use that lane after being nearly stabbed.\n"
