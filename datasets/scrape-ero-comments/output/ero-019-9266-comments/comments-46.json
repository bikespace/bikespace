As a renter close to Bloor street I rejoiced when the bike lanes were installed as I finally had another option to commute and get around the city in a more pleasant way. The only way to reduce traffic congestion is to give people alternatives to driving, and removing bike lanes to \u2018solve traffic\u2019 is proven to not work.\nBike lanes also add a backup option to the transportation network, for example when there was a subway delay it was quick and easy to just hop on a bike share and bypass traffic. They also make it safer for all road users, not just cyclists, by narrowing the roadway and slowing cars. And keep in mind that we still have highways for cars to go fast on, but we need to prioritize safety first on residential and urban streets.\n"

        "comment": "My family primarily uses bicycles to get around the city. We also own a car but prefer not to add to traffic congestion when we don\u2019t need to. Taking out bike lanes will only make it more unsafe for cycling and will force families like mine to use our car more frequently which will only add to the already bad congestion in the city. Transit and bike lanes help to reduce traffic congestion so this bill has everything completely backwards and will only serve to make congestion even worse.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential to our city's infrastructure, and I highly recommend that they be maintained and expanded. The idea that bike lanes cause traffic congestion is not evidence-based. Instead, I believe it's important for environmental and community reasons. Bike lanes provide an opportunity for people to use a different form of environmentally friendly transportation, especially as we're experiencing unusually warm weather in October, which is an indication of global warming. We should focus on reducing our carbon footprint instead of making more space for cars, which won't solve traffic congestion. We need fewer cars on the road, and we could achieve this by expanding bike lanes and improving public transportation. There's mounting evidence that investing in public transportation methods such as bike lanes, pedestrian areas, and public transit can improve our lives. Let's focus on innovative solutions that will genuinely benefit our city, province, and country, rather than removing bike lanes, which is a step in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation does little to help the sustainable, environmentally sound development of urban communities because it emphasizes only one mode of transit in urban areas, the private vehicle. While all studies indicate that mixed modes of transit are necessary for the healthy functioning and development of cities this legislation abandons gains made in the realm of urban cycling and mass public transit.  The removal of bike lanes that are already established in cities is costly and dangerous to cyclists and municipalities. Moreover it is legislative overreach. Why should urban taxpayers be beholden to some bureaucrat from the province? Cities plan for their citizens, their residents and their businesses.  Why should they be forced to plan and pay for the needs of people outside their jurisdiction? Additionally the legislation works against the government\u2019s goal of increasing density along major roads in cities because it doesn\u2019t allow for pleasant and safe pedestrian walking - sidewalks that are safe, clean and quiet enough to walk on and that actually lead to the services in the area, also on these streets. Who will move their families beside a four lane street with cars whizzing by at 80 Kpm? Would you want your children to play and cycle on such streets? Would you consider strolling to work on such a loud dangerous street? The way to reduce congestion in cities is to reduce the number of cars on the road. Yet this legislation does nothing to limit cars in urban areas, something that is key to creating a modern sustainable higher density urban environment. To reduce cars in the city you need to recognize, study and set capacity limits/estimates on  how many cars you will allow into the city. The suburbs can\u2019t develop endlessly with the expectation that every single person living in them has the god given right to enter the city at will without any cost or penalty. The government must start to estimate how many cars are too many in the city. To limit capacity of vehicles entering into the city legislation should include congestion fees, higher parking rates, fees for oversized vehicles, prohibition of parking on main streets directly in front of businesses, fees on overly wide vehicles, and fees for vehicles that contain only a single driver. Cyclists will still use the main streets and without providing them with safe bike lanes most likely they will use the centre of the street because they will not want to win the door prize from parked cars. How does this create traffic flow? Instead of increasing traffic flow this legislation will have the opposite effect. It will be dangerous and slow down traffic as cyclists will not vanish into thin air.\n"

We elect local officials to make local decisions in accordance with local needs, and it is inappropriate for the province to enforce partisan beliefs from one area onto another.\nFurthermore, this overreach is not done with evidence or benevolence. In addition to unfairly prioritizing some commuters over others, removal or prevention of bike lanes decreases choices, increases costs of commuting, decreases cyclist safety and worsens traffic. This data is already widely available.\nIt is not within the mandate of this provincial government to use our taxes to overrule municipalities for the benefit of a few while objectively worsening transportation in our cities.\n"

This policy will have the exact opposite of its stated purpose - it will increase traffic congestion by removing options for commuters in the city, while also increasing the number of injuries and deaths by making the streets less safe. Evidence does not back the decision to prevent the construction of bike lanes, nor their removal. The proposal to encourage the use of side streets for bikes is not practical as no side streets run parallel to major throughways in a way that would provide a serious alternative commuting option.\n"

Not only do bike lanes make our city safer for cyclists, but they also contribute to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.\nIn order to achieve our goal of becoming a \"world-class city,\" we need to encourage alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling. By providing safe and convenient bike lanes, we can make it easier for more people to choose to ride their bikes instead of driving their cars. This will help to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and make our city a more livable place for everyone.\nI urge the city to continue its efforts to expand and maintain our bike lane network. By doing so, we can create a safer and more sustainable city for all.\nDenying our residents and cyclists the right to safe and accessible infrastructure puts their lives at risk. Unnecessary fatalities and accidents are a direct consequence of failing to provide adequate cycling infrastructure.\nAs our city's population grows, we cannot continue to rely solely on car-centric infrastructure. We must invest in alternative modes of transportation via transit and cycling to ensure the safety and well-being of all our residents.\n"

Many people, including young people like myself, rely on cycling, walking, and transit to get around the city safely. Many of my peers and I rely on services like bike share that make our commute times easier, and allow access to other green spaces around the city, beyond the core. It's been proven time and again through case studies and real life examples across the world that cycling is great for businesses, for the health of a population, for making cities more liveable, and for meeting our climate action targets. By limiting where bike lanes can be built you're limiting people's transportation options, and are backtracking from Toronto from becoming a good example of what it means to build greener, liveable, intentional cities that meet the needs of a growing, diverse population. This is not a forward thinking bill, its doing the exact opposite - please ensure that we build a city and a province that addresses the needs of majority of residents, and not only car owners.\nBoth the Ontario government and the City of Toronto have set ambitious climate targets. Bike lanes play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging cycling over car use. Limiting bike lanes is inconsistent with these goals and could hinder progress on reducing the city\u2019s carbon footprint, improving air quality, and promoting healthier lifestyles through active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "As a professional planner in the province of Ontario, it is my professional opinion that Bill 212 and the subsequent effects are poor planning, are the exact opposite of what study after study finds are effective, efficient, and sustainable transportation policies, and will negatively impact the ability of Ontarians to travel for years to come.\nThe Province of Ontario should be supportive of cycling infrastructure and avoid enacting restrictions whenever possible, as Bill 212 would do. Cycling infrastructure and truly multi-modal corridors provide many benefits over car centric and car dedicated corridors. They are as follows.\nCycling is a significantly more space efficient mode of transportation than automobiles. As space is the most valuable and restrictive resource in urban environments, this is a very important consideration. Additionally, cycling infrastructure requires significantly less maintenance than automotive or public transit infrastructure resulting in higher availability of infrastructure.\nThe viability of cycling within a given jurisdiction has also found to have measurable public health impacts in two distinct ways. Firstly, while widespread cycling has not been found to have a measureable impact on life expectancy, it has been found to have a measurable impact on cardiovascular and respiratory health and on obesity rates. Secondly, cycle paths built to an appropriate specification have to been to be incredibly beneficial for first responders. It is often significantly easier for cyclists to make space for first responders than it is for drivers resulting in faster response times that can be the difference between life and death during certain medical emergencies. In many urban areas, building cycle paths of an adequate specification WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE without removing a lane for automobiles.\nAdditionally, high quality cycling infrastructure has benefits for environmental sustainability, affordability, senior and youth mobility, and many others. The adoption of Bill 212 by the province of Ontario would remove the ability of municipalities to exercise their local knowledge and expertise to implement a high quality cycling network, and allow for the province to unnesssaisly add barriers to transportation projects that are to the benefit of Ontarians. As a result of the above, it is my professional opinion that Bill 212 represents poor planning and should not be adopted by the Province of Ontario.\n"

Any bill with the intention of reducing congestion that doesn\u2019t even mention public transit is just laughable. This bill seems to be designed to get more people into cars, and trying to take away vital alternatives such as cycling. Cars cause congestion; getting people out of singularly occupied cars would be the greatest thing to reduce congestion. Increasing bus and train riderships, promoting walking, cycling, and active transportation, carpooling, travelling outside of rush hour; these are things that reduce congestion, not building vanity highways or removing bike lanes. Where are the proposal to increase the number of trains, to make them more regular and travel in both directions all day, how about reintroducing bus services between major towns and cities, or comments on the new subway lines?  Also, I thought that red tape and provincial oversight was supposed to be being reduced. Why in the world would municipalities have to get provincial approval for installing bike lanes when so many other decisions are at the municipalities discretion? Finally, has any type of impact assessment been done on how this will affect cyclists and users of active transportation, and how it will make using those more dangerous? How many people will die or get seriously injured because of the removal of bike lanes?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing this comment to urge the Ontario government NOT to pass Bill 212, particularly the parts regarding bicycle lanes. If passed as is, Bill 212 will kill and maim cyclists and other vulnerable road users. We need bike lanes, and this attempt by the provincial government to limit them is an overreach into what should be local city matters.\nI only began cycling this year, but I quickly realized how necessary bike lanes are for safety. In June, I was cycling on a road when the bike lane suddenly disappeared. I continued close to the side of the road, as I am legally obligated to do. A person in a car decided this meant I should be assaulted, and they smashed a full bottle extremely hard into the back of my head, nearly knocking me down (possibly falling into the path of a vehicle) and splashing liquid all over me.\nI am also horrified at hit-and-run news stories like when 81-year old Doug Fritz was struck by a car, shattering the windshield, and the driver treated this as a minor inconvenience for her appointment. She drove away as if nothing had happened and left him to die.\nIt is clear that there is a significant amount of drivers that will actively assault cyclists and have zero consideration for their lives. Not to mention distracted drivers, who could easily kill cyclists by accident. We need bike lanes, as many as possible, so that cyclists can have separation and protection from drivers and their increasingly lethal motor vehicles.\nIt is an inhumane farce that \"congestion\" is treated as more important than the lives of cyclists and other VRUs, when the reality is that bike lanes enable a modal shift away from driving so that congestion can in fact be alleviated.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed legislation that would prevent cities from installing bike lanes if it means losing a car lane in the process. As a dedicated cyclist who relies on my bike for daily transportation, I find this proposal deeply concerning and short-sighted.\nCycling is the most cost-effective, healthy, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. It takes up significantly less space than cars or trucks, and promoting cycling infrastructure is essential for reducing congestion and improving the overall quality of life in our cities. People will not switch to cycling if the infrastructure is not safe and accessible.\nHaving bike lanes boosts the economy by encouraging more people to cycle, which in turn reduces traffic congestion, lowers healthcare costs, and promotes local businesses. This is crucial for Ontario to be a place to grow and thrive.\nTeens rely on bikes since they can\u2019t drive, and many young high schoolers have also taken on road biking as a sport, just like me. They don\u2019t want the rug being pulled from under their feet. Road biking is a fantastic way to stay fit, enjoy the outdoors, and engage in a community of like-minded individuals. It is baffling that the provincial government would seek to undermine such positive developments.\nAdditionally, the many takeout delivery guys who work down rely on bikes to deliver food. Having bike lanes will make it safer for them to work and reduce deadly and costly collisions.\nPremier Ford\u2019s plan is not only car-centric but also unsustainable for the future of Ontario\u2019s economy. Encouraging more cars on the road will only lead to increased congestion, pollution, and a decline in public health. We should be working towards a future where cycling is a viable and attractive option for everyone, not just those who have no other choice.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation and support the development of safe and efficient cycling infrastructure across Ontario. It is time to prioritize the well-being of our communities and the environment over outdated car-centric policies.\n"
