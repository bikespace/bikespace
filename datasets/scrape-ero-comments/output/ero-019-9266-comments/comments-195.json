Do you think they will just disappear? No, they're going to be on those roads, but now mixing with traffic, taking the lanes, slowing more cars down.\nBut you don't care.

It will damage the environment for no gain but the people who already own land up there for development of houses for people who already wouldn't be affected by gridlock. 3) the pathetic attempt at sneaking in a massive change to the construction process of getting rid of unbiased environmental assessments. These environmental assessments should be getting MORE rigorous not eliminated all together. The environment is complicated, and people who actually understand that should be doing the assessments, NOT people who have a vested interest for either the implementation or the blocking of a project.\nIn conclusion, this is a rude affront to people's intelligence and you should be ashamed of yourselves for trying to destroy our province like this. So selfish of you. So UnCanadian.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives a couple of hours away from any major Ontario city, I absolutely despise the thought of driving in the cities but bike lanes are not the reason why. As a matter of fact, I believe bike lanes are part of the solution. If more people used bikes and transit, there would be less vehicles on the road. Period. I prefer to go park my vehicle and take transit the rest of the way. Sometimes solving the gridlock issue is less about adding capacity but rather encouraging people to use the other options. I grew up in Etobicoke and east Mississauga at a time when we used to go and bike down to lakeshore mostly through a series of parks and then bike downtown, I loathe the idea of doing that today due to all the traffic we may have to encounter. Maybe instead of wasting money trying to rip out these bike lanes, let's use that money to encourage people to use the other modes of transportation. I used to use MiWay to get to Humber College when I lived in Mississauga, it was often faster than taking the freeways by about 10 minutes and I didn't have the stress of driving.\nLet's get more transportation options to more rural communities that people are commuting into the GTA from such as Shelburne and Dundalk along highway 10. Highway 10 is full of drivers who drive erratically. They pass on solid yellow lines, going uphill and around curves, not to mention sometimes going 50+km/h over the 80km/h speed limit. The GTR route between Owen Sound and Orangeville had to recently stop taking on people from Shelburne in order to ensure there was enough space for the people the GTR intended to serve, which is the people of Grey County. There's demand for this service but it's difficult to use when it has limited service times.\nI currently live in a town (Port Elgin) where I have the luxury of walking to work, but most people around here don't. In fact the major employer of the area once had a bus that ran to the local towns but they removed it simply because people didn't use it. People didn't use because they either didn't know about it or it didn't run often enough, which meant they sometimes had to wait an hour or more, which sucks when you have to pick up your child from school because they are sick. There's also a bike path/trail that leads to that particular employer ironically along an old rail bed that people don't like to use because, get this, you have to cross the highway, sometimes at multiple points which you can be stuck at waiting for awhile due the enormous amount of traffic that is created by all the employees going to or from at shift change. Not too mention the employer's cost of private security who also do traffic enforcement along their roads. This local employer is Bruce Power. A company whose costs get passed on to the people of Ontario who buy the electricity they produce. Imagine if the rails were still there and used for passengers and freight? The thousands of people who commute into this place of employment could easily walk, bike, or even drive to a local train station and be at work much sooner and with less stress and less cost, especially since many around here insist on driving pickup trucks. Especially in the summertime when many people come to this area for vacation, the roads become a mess, arguably gridlocked on highway 21. People driving dangerously, sometimes intoxicated, sometimes just lost, sometimes on paved paths intended on for cyclists and pedestrians. Many people end up speeding and running stop signs on the local side streets simply to avoid congestion on the main thoroughfare. This is not very inviting for someone who would like walk or bike, as a matter of fact, it's discouraging. I can only imagine how much nicer a trip into the GTA would be we could just board a train and vice versa, how nice a trip from the GTA would be to a vacation destination such as Port Elgin/Southampton would be without the stress of driving.\nWhen Port Elgin shuts down highway 21 for the couple days of Pumpkinfest every year, the pedestrian only streets become pleasant to walk on without the worry of traffic.\nNot as much maintenance for the roads is also a benefit since there would be less vehicles. Arguably, there would be more rail maintenance but I highly doubt it would be as much as trying to upkeep the roads.\nBuild more bikes lanes, please. Don't rip them up. Rather, encourage them everywhere! I would like to bike more, but the limited options and shared roads aren't very enticing. Build more bike paths, but separate from the roads. Bikes don't want to mingle with traffic if they don't have to. Create bike paths from town to town. Southampton to Port Elgin is nice to bike between with the exception of crossing the highway. Norway managed to build dedicated, separated from car traffic and paved bike paths through remote communities along much more difficult terrain, why can't we? Create more options to get around and make our roads more efficient and safer by getting more vehicles off the road not by trying to pack more cars in. That way, when we have to go somewhere that cannot be reached by any other mode of transportation, the drive can be safer and the roads safer and more efficient for everyone involved.\nThank you,\nJakub\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI find this to be an absolutely absurd policy. As cities in Ontario become more dense, biking increasingly becomes a more viable, popular and more efficient way to get around. There is no way around it. Cycling will increase in popularity with or without bike lanes.\nConversely, because cars take up so much more space on the road, as cities become more dense, there inevitably comes a point where there simply isn't anymore space to accommodate them. That is the case in Toronto.\nToronto is expected to hit 3 million people by 2030. There is simply no such thing as the roads necessary to accommodate 3 million people. The only way to ease congestion is to offer viable alternatives (e.g. walking, biking, transit). Walking and biking are simple choices people can take themselves. Sidewalks are a requirement of a road network. Bikes can easily occupy the street. The only thing you are doing with this policy is making cycling more dangerous. You WILL increase fatalities.\nFurthermore, I don't understand why any consideration is being had for the very well studied and observed concept of \"induced demand.\" Traffic is like water. It flows to wherever it can. If you add more lanes of traffic in a city, like Toronto, where the roads are already over capacity, those lanes will simply fill up with more traffic. The reason being, they are OVER capacity. Again, the only way around this is to offer viable alternatives to driving, like cycling!\nLastly, the idea that a conservative government would make the decision to remove infrastructure that 1) will inevitably be needed again and reinstalled at some point down the line as Toronto grows, and 2) that taxpayers have already paid for, is completely ludicrous. Instead of paying once for great cycling infrastructure, taxpayers will now have to also pay to have it removed and pay to have it reinstalled when a new government comes into power. How incredibly fiscally responsible of you. Thank you for that.\n"

Big city and yet I can easily cross it on my bike. I have cycled in Norway, lanes for bike commuters and you can easily take your bike on the train. I have cycled in Nantes France, now there is a city that embraces cyclists. Every time I come home I am so disappointed by our poor infrastructure and that we have to fight so hard for a space. I also drive a car and I can tell you I much prefer that a cyclist has their own lane than having to try to pass them in a single lane.\nI think it's time that the people who are making this policy spend a week or two riding a bike to and from work, errands and social excursions.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI'm submitting this to join the list of others requesting the bike lane on Yonge St be relocated.  It has been a nightmare ever since the bike lanes have been put in.  I work in a store on Yonge where the bike lanes are, and it bumper to bumper traffic all day long. When emergency vehicles try coming down that section. I see them sitting there for multiple traffic transitions because the cars have no where to go. Not only that, it has made that section on Yonge street look like such an unorganized mess.\nI'm not against bike lanes, but choosing a main street and then reducing a lane on an already busy street doesn't make any sense.  A quieter side street that runs parallel might be a better idea, or maybe place the bike lanes on a wider street that can accommodate bike lanes without losing a lane of traffic.  Avenue Rd perhaps?\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "We dont need more highways, we need more infrastructure that dont rely on cars. We need more rapid transit, subways, and trains especially. Why does it take over an hour to take a train into toronto from less that 100km out? Why is ontario so far behind the rest of the world. You are limiting everyone from living outside of toronto because we have to drive instead of take a train in.\nBike lanes are important and are a huge way for people to get to work without the added expense of having to have a car, or even pay for a parking spot. We need more bike lanes that are positioned properly. Look around the world, New York City even has more bike lanes then downtown Toronto. Its a joke. You should stop trying to stop things and start actually adding to infrastructure.\nIt feels like we haven't updated our train lines since 1800s, build more trains and better ways for people to travel then you would have less people on the road. Its simple.\nStop highways and build railways. And keep the bike lanes, they are important to the cities infrastructure. Too many people have died on the roads without proper bike lanes. And you want to remove them? Just stop it.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI live in Toronto and drive downtown for work regularly. Although I deal with many bikers getting to and from work, I would rather they have a safe space separate from my vehicle lane than me having to go around them in vehicle lane which would be a lot slower getting around. On certain downtown streets without bike lanes, bikers have to go into my lane and I end up having to slowly drive behind them until I can find a chance to pass them which slows down my drive and other drivers having to go around them. This would make traffic even worse than it already is. Do not remove the bike lanes that already exist as it makes both cars and bikes move around quicker. Finish building the transit lines in Toronto so people who can take those lines to work will get out of their cars and there would be less traffic. Thank you.\n"

The evidence supports safe cycling infrastructure to both keep everyone on the road safer as well as help get people out of cars to reduce traffic. Removing bike lanes will instead increase travel times, increase harm to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians alike. This appears to be a move based on feelings and politics rather than facts.\nOur government seems to want to increase traffic as building highways will just create more traffic  which means we are spending billions to ruin prime farmland and make traffic worse.\nI applaud the government for working to build more transit as that is another way to reduce traffic.Providing safe,reliable and affordable alternatives to all the many single drivers in cars is the path forward.\nI drive.I bike. I walk. Pitting different modes of transportation against each other is senseless. Facts and case studies should be the main source of any updates to our infrastructure, not ideology.\nIn a time with increasing costs, supporting low cost transportation like cylcing should be key. When we live in a province where thousands of people die each year from air quality, we should support methods of transportation that do not cause any emissions. With socialized health care, we should also consider the health benefits of biking that will lead to increased fitness as long as we give people a safe place to ride.\nIn short, any legislation that can not be supported by facts, should not be put forward. More safe separated bike paths,not less. More transit of all methods. Open the 407. Moreover, the people of Toronto support bike lanes with the last mayoral election seeing resounding defeat for the 3 candidates that ran against them\n"

Bike lines are installed after significant research and careful city planning. An important note in that sentence is CITY planning, not provincial planning. A well-known fact learned in every urban planning degree is that adding more lanes does not mean cutting traffic. decisions like these should be left to the people who know about them, CITY planners in the CITY.\n"
