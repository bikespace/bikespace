        "comment": "I strongly oppose any measure which acts to decrease the availability of bike lanes. Bike lanes have numerous benefits, from improving the health of individuals through exercise (and therefore reducing healthcare expenditures), reducing the total number of cars on the road, and increasing the number of visits to local businesses. Bike lanes do not cause traffic: Cars cause traffic, because cars ARE traffic. When bike lanes are available, cars do not end up stuck behind bikers. If they are removed, more bikers will bike on the road, taking the whole lane, and car traffic will again be in conflict with bikes. There are no bike lanes on the 407 or DVP, and they are still regularly backed up for miles.\n"

Bike lanes are a crucial part of transportation infrastructure, providing a critical alternative to driving and protecting vulnerable cyclists. Cars should not be the only way to get around our cities, and need to stop getting priority. Also, this bill meddles into local issues that the provincial government should leave to the municipalities. The Bill 212 proposal is simply an overreach of power.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford.  I live in the City of Toronto.  I am a white middle aged man.  I own a car.  I also cycle or walk for most of my work and personal activities in the City.  What is most important to me is safety.  What I don't want is to be maimed or killed while riding my bicycle.  I use the Bloor and University bicycle lanes often and I can tell you that my life is so much safer and my quality of life so much better than it was before these key east-west and north-south routes were installed.  I use them to frequent businesses I would never go to before without proper bicycle access.\nWhat is most worrying me is your statement that these bicycle lanes will be removed.  There is no science, logic or fiscal responsibility behind doing such an irresponsible thing.  You will be PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK.  There is no public interest in creating more red tape for municipalities, and wasting taxpayers money to undo something that has had no or, at best, minimal impacts on vehicle travel times.  What is next - rip out all the sidewalks to add car lanes? Remove the playgrounds for parking lots to store all these cars you want to accommodate?  Are you planning to pay the City of Toronto for the taxpayer's money it spent on planning, designing and installing the cycle lanes, as well as tearing them out?  Please be realistic here.\nIf you want to work with municipalities to try to reduce congestion, then work with them, but don't target safe bicycle infrastructure.  Talk to Mayor Chow about how to implement a variety of safe, reliable transportation options, rather than hiding behind this pointless legislation that will just cost us all money and make our quality of life worse.\nResearch has shown that adding more traffic lanes does not solve congestion problems.  Think about it - Ontario has been building more and more roads for decades at great up-front capital cost, and burdening future generations with maintenance and replacement costs.  And we still have traffic congestion.  Ontario communities have only been building cycle lanes for about 10 years.  And the congestion has not significantly increased despite accommodating a massive population expansion.  Cycle lanes are not the problem you are trying to solve, Mr. Premier.\nTrusting you will care about public health and safety and not move forward with this wasteful proposal.  Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the proposed amendments to Part XII: I am deeply concerned about the negative impact this legislation would have on cyclist safety and sustainable transportation initiatives in our community and across Ontario. I strongly reject the arguments presented by the Conservative government in support of this bill, which seem to be rooted in short-sighted concerns about traffic congestion and parking availability. Research consistently demonstrates that well-designed cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety for cyclists but also improves overall traffic flow and reduces congestion in the long term (Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 2018). Additionally, studies show that businesses in areas with protected bike lanes tend to see an increase in sales, driven by greater foot and bicycle traffic (New York City Department of Transportation, 2014). These facts contradict the government\u2019s claims that bike lanes negatively impact local businesses and inconvenience motorists. I strongly urge you to remove the amendments to Part XII from Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is terrible for many reasons.\nFirst off, this is bad policy.  Bike lanes do not cause gridlock.  The real cause of gridlock is that there are more cars on the road.  This is because successive provincial governments - including the current one - have not created the conditions for densification that would provide people real alternatives to needing a car to get around. The current government is only making this worse by building more roads farther from urban centers AND at the same time not incentivizing - or even mandating - higher density construction across ALL municipalities; something that is clearly within provincial control and within the provincial mandate.  How are all those people who will be living up near the 413 going to get to work?  They are going to have to drive.  And that is what makes gridlock.\nSecondly, it is poor allocation of the provincial gvernment's resources. Why should the province be spending its time regulating bike lanes from Thunder Bay to Whitby?  This is ridiculous.  How long will it take to even get bike lanes that offend no drivers (if such a thing even exists) approved?  Controlling bike lanes is in the hands of cities for a reason.  Leave it there.\nThirdly, this decision is anti-democratic. The city of Toronto just had an election not too long ago for mayor, where one candidate was very anti-bike lane and promised to rip out bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge street.  Guess what?  He lost.  Just because some people are unhappy with that does not justify the province stepping in to override the collective will of the people in the city of Toronto (yet again).\nFor all of these reasons, I disagree with this proposed legislation.\nIf the government wants to truly impact gridlock, they should speed up the opening of the Eglinton West LRT and Eglinton West LRT extension, the Finch LRT, all-day 2-way Go service etc and other cycling projects, like the West Toronto Railpath extension that get people on bikes off of roads etc.  They should also stop parking expansion in crowded urban areas, such as the massive parking lot that is planned for Ontario Place.  Building parking down there just encourages people to drive, increasing traffic on the already busy Gardiner Expwy and Lakeshore Blvd.\n"

We need more, not fewer bike lanes. In the many years since I\u2019ve been commuting to work by bike, I have seen ridership increase and office bike cages fill up. It is so encouraging to see. And the more people travel short distances by bike, the less congestion there will be. Please help us keep moving forward. Our children and their children will thank you.\n"

It is not the provincial government's place to micromanage municipal affairs and instead, they should focus on provincial issues such as housing and healthcare.\nIt is disheartening to see this government place such a focus on cars. I cannot afford a car nor do I want one. Yes, cars are a necessary form of transportation but they are also a selfish form of transportation. They take up tons of room on the street (whether driving or parking) and very often only carry one person. Biking is an efficient and cost-effective method for many. It is also better for the environment and helps provide exercise.\nWhy does the provincial government want to make it more difficult for people to go anywhere? Why does the government want to spend tax money on ripping out infrastructure that is completed and actively being used by thousands of people? No part of this bill makes sense. It is clear that the province is focused on making things more difficult than making things better and that is so disheartening.\n"

It spits in the face of municipal autonomy, democracy, and the will of the people that live in, and best know the city. Furthermore, the inclusion of this section in this bill is ridiculous, ideologically driven, and feels as though it's purposely included in an otherwise reasonable bill, because it WOULD NOT PASS ON ITS OWN.\nI will link studies that suggest that replacing bicycle lanes with car lanes, or preventing the removal of bicycle lanes doesn't affect congestion, but honestly, those don't really matter, since it's the job, and interest of the CITY not the PROVINCE, to judge the efficacy of their roadway policy.\nEven in the best-case scenario, where the city HAS made the correct judgement, in their decision of roadway management, this section ONLY SERVES TO INCREASE THE OVERHEAD AND BUREAUCRACY in an already mired process. This will ultimately just increase the money spent on justing stupid regulations.\nI also have reasons to believe this section of the bill will be ultimately ineffective, but I'll keep those to myself, as a measure in case this horrendous regulation does go through.\nIt almost feels as though this bill is spitefully targeting Toronto, because of some sort of political feud between its mayor and Doug, AND US NON-TORONTO RESIDENTS ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.\nTo summarize, Part 4 of Schedule 4 of this bill should be omitted, as it sets a bad precedent, undermines the will of the people, undermines the intelligence and competence of city planning departments across the province, does not address the core issues behind traffic, and will increase government overhead, and waste taxpayer money adjudicating these requests.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a horrific step backwards for the province of Ontario because it has been proven that bike lanes reduce congestion (see link).  All cities in Ontario and Canada should be enabling non-automotive (pubic transit, biking, walking, etc.) traffic because it is  in all cases better for the environment. Plus active modes of transport reduce obesity and improve people's health leading to better quality of lives and less strain on am over-strained health care system.\nOn top of that it has been proven that more lanes just increase congestion, so as much as there might be a temporary reprieve the traffic will increase and the congestion will only be worse.\nIf this proposal passes I will never vote Conservative again... and I have always voted Conservative.\n"
