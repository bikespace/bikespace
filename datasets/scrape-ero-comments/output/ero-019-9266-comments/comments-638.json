The bike lanes that the city of Toronto has put time and money into are an invaluable method for me to get to work, to grocery shop, to simply act out my day to day life safely. Toronto is a bike-able city, the time it takes me to get to my destination is half that of transit and significantly reduced from driving. It\u2019s better for my health and the earth. Why, would we rip them up for more cars. More cars equals more congestion. What do we want to leave as a legacy for the city of Toronto??? One of vision, that provides safety for those that choose to bike, that supports a climate friendly means of transportation? Or endless gridlock, with emissions rising at a staggering rate. It simply does not make sense to me. I support bike lanes and bike safety. I will fight to keep them in the city, and further develop them where there currently is none. I bike, I\u2019m proud of it, and I believe we should encourage others to do the same.\n"

They further separate people walking from moving cars making less likely for a car to strike a pedestrian.\n- They separate cyclists from the flow of traffic and from pedestrians on the sidewalk making collisions between people walking, cars and people riding bicycles less likely.\n- The narrowed road naturally slow down the drivers reducing speeding and making an collision less likely to cause serious injuries and damage.\nI bike with my child on the Bloor bike lane to the ROM and I can do that because I feel safe on the protected bike lane. This is faster than taking TTC and more convenient than driving (not to mention trying to find parking). This is my preferred choice of transportation in Toronto.\nAs for the gridlock and bad traffic, there is no solution to car traffic except viable alternatives to driving.\nTraffic on Bloor was always bad, it has nothing to do with bike lanes.\nCars on the roads are not water in pipes as each driver acts according to their own best interests and does not follow the laws of physics. You cannot successfully apply \"common sense\" to this problem.\nThe congestion is caused by the limiting capacity of intersections, not the roads themselves. Not enough cars can get through the intersection to saturate the capacity of road lanes. Adding more lanes will not solve the congestion. Many congested streets in Toronto don't even have bike lanes.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\nRemoving bike lanes will make the roads less safe for everyone.\nI further oppose Bill 212 and its provisions exempting Highway 413 from the environmental assessment. This move bypasses safeguards needed for sustainable infrastructure planning.\nThis decision disregards the highway\u2019s effects on Ontario\u2019s ecosystems, Greenbelt, and communities; it ignores severe, documented threats to local watersheds, air quality, habitats, and farmland. Bill 212 allows the project to cut through vital Greenbelt lands and major watersheds that provide clean water to GTA.\nExperts highlight Highway 413\u2019s release of additional carbon dioxide into the air, undermining our climate commitments.\nIndependent assessments exist to protect the public\u2019s interest, yet with Bill 212, the government will controls the environmental review skirting accountability.\nYou should withdraw Bill 212 and advocate for comprehensive environmental reviews of such projects based on the reasons I outlined above.\nSincerely,\n"

I am a car driver but I am recognizing the fact that we must get out of our cars as much as we can.  So now I push myself to take public transit and to ride my bike (where it is safe to do so).  This is the way towards a healthier future for all.\nAdditionally, bike lanes keep bikes out of traffic.  Congestion will only get worse and the situation will be much more dangerous for cyclists because bikes will be forced to take up a lane of traffic (as is their right) and this will frustrate drivers.\n"

Outside of work it has allowed me to visit my family members and do my errands with peace of mind knowing i'll be safer not being next to vehicular traffic going twice as fast as me.\nPlease do not block the building of bike lanes and remove any current ones. The cost of doing so isn't just the cheque you'll write to the builders, contractors, and administrators that will be destroying the progress that was made, but also people like me who not requiring a car for daily transport allowed me to create value to this city in a way that is getting me out of poverty.\nI love cars, and I am working on my drivers license to be on the road soon, but i also recognize the value of diversified methods of transportation beyond cars like trains, busses, light rail/streetcar trams, and road infrastructure that allows many methods of transport including bicycles, walking, and smaller vehicles like mopeds and motorcycles.\nThe sacrifices we pay now with more vehicle traffic will pay off we just have to be patient. We cannot afford to make the same mistakes we made in the past like the attempt of building the Spadina expressway, and now today building more roads and destroying progress that creates the continual reliance on cars. The solution is somewhere in the middle of the extremes. Please consider more options and for example; adding reserved bus lanes that go out to parking in the GTA bringing more people downtown that do not need to rely on cars anymore. This is cost effective as it does not need a huge change in infrastructure that needs to be build and can be approved very quickly on the side of Governmental costs. This is one example but there are many many more to keep exploring.\nMuch love to all the parties and people who work at all government levels keeping this city drowning in dept afloat! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n"

Given the large number of bicycle couriers that are using Toronto bike lanes--it's especially evident on the Bloor Street lanes--it's hard to believe that removing the lane will improve traffic. The bicycles don't obstruct traffic when they \"park\" or stop to make a delivery. If cycling becomes too difficult there will be more delivery cars on the road and one suspects that traffic congestion will increase.\nThere are, of course, strong environmental reasons for why bike lanes leading to increased bike traffic is a preferable option to more cars on the street.\nAnd please, Government of Ontario, respect municipal authority and ability to make good judgments for ourselves.

Removing existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University will have no impact on traffic congestions on those roads or other roads in Toronto. Moreover the construction work to remove those lanes will make traffic worse and all taxpayers in Ontario will ultimately pay for removal of these lanes. Such money could be better spent to help improve public transit throughout the province. The other cost will be road safety, since some cyclist will continue to use those roads.\nAs someone who regularly uses a bicycle as transportation and in the past taught bicycle safety courses (Can-Bike) with the city of Toronto, I have a strong interest in road safety. I have also found that to travel longer that a few blocks, main roads are the fastest and shortest way to get to my destination. Side streets do not provide the most direct routes and beyond a certain distance, it is impossible not to use a main road for at least some of ones trip.\nUltimately, we should focus on moving people, not vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Here\u2019s my reply, if anyone would like to borrow some talking points:\nI am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation, and sincerely hope the government reconsiders it. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons:\n1. I live near Bloor Street West, and as a pedestrian I feel significantly safer on the street since the bike lanes were installed (all three phases). The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel.\n2. I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3. I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4. It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government pretends to care about, taxes. I am confident that when the government changes, whether that\u2019s in 1,2, or 6 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014pedestrians to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5. I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

I am writing this comment in support of bike lines, and urge you to consider the negative impact of Bill 212, on the environment, our province's broader ecological goals, and the well-being of commuters and travellers.\nWe know from overwhelming evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\n- improve the safety of cyclists\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options, who need to cycle for financial or health reasons, or who have made commitments to cycle for its positive environmental impacts. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nOn a personal note, as a long-term cyclist, I personally rely on bike lanes to commute to work on a daily basis. On roads where I do not have access to a bike lane for my commute, I am forced to drive within and among car traffic, which has noticeably slowed my own commute, slowed the commute of drivers around me, and increased the risk of car accidents.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing Toronto's pressing environmental and transportation challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nOn the contrary, the proposed bill will increase congestion on our roads, not fix it: cyclists will be forced to either bike on the roads proper (which is dangerous and clogs traffic), or switch to commuting by car themselves (causing potentially devastating environmental impact while also similarly clogging traffic). In addition, it's a waste of resources and money - undoing environmentally-friendly work that has already been completed, in a way that will increase gridlock and danger on the roads rather than fixing it.\nThese actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city and province, they also betray a lack of true vision and leadership. We need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence, and that makes a strong commitment towards our environmental and ecological goals. This bill will do the opposite.\n(M5B 2J5)\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist who frequently uses the bikes lanes on University Avenue and Bloor Street. I am a former driver ( I no longer have a car, by choice) who, for over 30 years, has driven through the streets of Toronto. It is my opinion that safety will be greatly compromised for all concerned by proposed removal of the bike lanes.  I also am convinced that traffic congestion will NOT improve. My reasons are listed below:\n-the separated bike lanes are used by regular cyclists, but increasingly by those on e-scooters, e-bikes, motorized skateboards and all sorts of other motorized / electric modes of transportation. A lot of food delivery workers use the bike lanes.  Without these bike lanes, all of these riders will be forced to ride in car lanes.\n-when I was a driver, I found it very difficult (and somewhat frustrating) to drive alongside cyclists, as one would have to slow down and give a wide berth in order to move around them safely.  So having more cyclists and scooters on the regular lanes of traffic will simply slow drivers down.  At least, the drivers who take everyone's safety into consideration.  There will be many others, however, who will succumb to their frustrations and simply drive too closely to a cyclist and risk hitting them.\n-The current design of the bike lanes is quite good and increases safety not just for cyclists but for pedestrians.  In some sections, parking is available in spots parallel to the bike lanes, so pedestrians are even more protected from the possibility of drivers jumping the curb.  As you know, there have been some tragic incidents of drivers hitting people on sidewalks due to speeding, so having more distance between vehicles and pedestrians can only be a good thing.\n-restricting drivers to a single lane plus turning lanes (on Bloor) or two lanes and turning lanes (on University) makes it more likely that drivers are forced to keep moving.  When there are multiple lanes, it seems like drivers take advantage of these to stop or even park illegally in the lane closest to the curb.  I know this to be true, as it is not an uncommon occurence to see vehicles parking or stopping in bike lanes.  So I'm not sure that congestion will ease very much, if at all.\n-should the government proceed with its plan to remove the bike lanes on Bloor and on University, I believe that we will soon start to see more cycling fatalities due to interactions between drivers and cyclists.  I refuse to call these \"accidents\".  These will be predictable events that are very preventable at the moment.\n-as a cyclist, I likely will continue to ride along University and on Bloor when necessary, but I will choose to ride in the middle of a traffic lane to protect myself as much as possible.  I believe other cyclists will choose to do the same.\n"

        "comment": "As a pedestrian in Toronto, I greatly benefit from the bike lanes. They keep the bikes away from the cars and the streets. Removing the bike lanes would mean the bikes would harass pedestrians and car drivers alike. On top of that, bike lanes do a great job to reduce congestion by removing cars off of the road. They make things safer for bike riders, as all 6 of the accidents involving bikes in Toronto this year have happened off of a bike lane.\nThe bike lanes in Bloor, Yonge, and University serve as a foundation for the ever-growing bike network in Toronto. These are vital to make Toronto much more of a biking city. You can tell just from the ever-growing bike-share network; clearly there is huge demand in Toronto to bike, and we need the infrastructure to make everyone bike. When you look at European countries, the places where they bike a lot have very good bike infrastructure everywhere. Places like Finland bike even in the cold. This isn't because Europe is special, but because they put in the infrastructure to make it happen. These things can happen in Toronto as well if we keep our bike lanes and expand on them.\nThe congestion in Toronto, especially on these streets, isn't there because of the bike lanes. It is there because of the amount of cars. There is no real solution for the congestion other than taking cars off of the road. This means investing in public transportation, and yes, more bike lanes. Bike lanes do a great job of moving people more quickly than car lanes do. They take many cars off of the road and make the trip quicker. The congestion in Toronto has grown in spite of the bike lanes, not because of it. And even if it did make congestion worse, removing the bike lanes to get one more lane would barely save any time. When more than 2 hours are spent on the 401, what does 5 minutes saved really mean?\nRipping out the bike lanes will not solve our congestion problems, which leaves it as a solution that hurts pedestrians, bikers, AND car drivers. It is a solution where nobody really wins, but there are many people that absolutely lose. Businesses along the corridor lose a lot more revenue, pedestrians feel less safe, bikers feel less safe, and car drivers feel less safe and have worse congestion.\n"

I have used my bike in this city for 40 years, commuting to work, to school, on errands, up to 9 months of the year.\nI have learned to be hyper-aware of everything around me when I am cycling. It gets harder and harder though, to feel safe when cycling in this city. I know so many people who would love to cycle regularly, but are terrified. Effective bike lanes make it safer, and make it feel safer, which encourages more people to use bikes to get around for all kinds of purposes.\nThe main arteries in the downtown core are for everybody to get around, not just people in cars. For sure, there are some people and activities for which a personal vehicle is the only reasonable transportation mode. That is not what is causing congestion. It is people using cars who don't need to.\nIf we want to relieve congestion, the number one answer is to improve public transit. The number two answer is to stop using the roadways as an extension of construction sites. And the number three answer is to repair roadways faster and more efficiently. All the major congestion I encounter is actually due to these last two items.\nYou are talking about removing bike lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor. These roadways are served by subways. You want to relieve congestion on these roads? Make the subway the most attractive way to get around. Make it faster, more frequent, with parking lots at key stops to facilitate transfers to/from cars. Make it cleaner, safer, more comfortable, more attractive. Make it reach farther, and with better connections to other transportation, to other parts of the city/region. Make sure there are clean bathrooms, elevators, and staff to help people find their way. I know, many of those things are worked on. Why undermine its success by providing more roadway?\nThe key thing you have to realize about providing more lanes for cars, more highways, more space for cars, is that the more you provide, the more people will use them, and the demand will ALWAYS outstrip supply. Every traffic engineer with experience will tell you that. You CANNOT get rid of congestion unless you control who or how many people in cars can use the roadways, and provide great alternatives.\nExcellent public transit is the first, most important alternative.\nBikes (and some other forms of \"micro\" transportation) are also great (and healthy and carbon-free) alternatives. They are often as fast or faster to get from point A to B. It is much easier to find parking, and it's free. They are also a growing part of the urban economy, as vehicles for fast delivery of food and other products. Bike lanes are full of delivery bikes.\nThose routes you want to remove - they are hugely popular, and they are streaming with cyclists at key points in the day. Your cycling usage data are greatly out of date, do not focus on areas where cycling makes the most sense, and do not account for the fact that cycling usage increases gradually and steadily where effective bike lanes are provided.\nStop blaming bike lanes for congestion and get to work on the real issues.\n"
