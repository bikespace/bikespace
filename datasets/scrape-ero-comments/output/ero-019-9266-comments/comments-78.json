        "comment": "According to the Canada Energy Regulator, the largest share of Ontario's GHG emissions comes from transportation (which comprised 32% of Ontario's GHGs in 2022). As such, adding more regulatory burden to the construction of cycling infrastructure, which is one of the cheapest and greenest forms of travel, seems incredibly irresponsible.\n"

        "comment": "If the Government of Ontario:\n1) Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\n2) Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\n3) Is building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\nIt is not clear how the proposal to discourage bike lanes in busy areas like Downtown Toronto would help significantly help meet these needs. With respect to each point above:\n1) Priority highways can certainly be an excellent way to facilitate personal vehicles travelling long distances in rural areas. However, gridlock will decrease in dense urban areas by encouraging active and public transportation. How do you get more people out of gridlock? We put give them room to travel on bikes, buses, or trains!\n2) Accidents and lane closures can certainly worsen congestion. How can we avoid this? We create protected bike lanes and we encourage public transportation!\n3) Building Highway 413 has absolutely nothing to do with bike lanes in dense urban areas.\nI suggest that the Government of Ontario will do a much better job addressing their concerns of reducing gridlock by adequately funding active and public transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential for promoting safer, more sustainable transportation in cities. They reduce the risk of accidents by providing cyclists with dedicated space, separate from cars and pedestrians. By encouraging more people to cycle, bike lanes help reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and improve air quality. Additionally, they support a healthier lifestyle by making cycling a more accessible and attractive option for daily commutes. Which is also a relief on the rather strained healthcare system. Rather than removing bike lanes, expanding them can foster a greener, more livable city for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who both bikes and drives in the downtown core, I find the removal of bike lanes under Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, to be not only shortsighted but a step backwards in our city's progress. Cycling infrastructure is essential for promoting sustainable transportation, reducing congestion, and improving safety for everyone on the road, including drivers.\nBy removing bike lanes, we\u2019re forcing more cyclists into dangerous situations, which will ultimately lead to more accidents, more traffic as cyclists and cars share tight spaces, and slower commutes for everyone. Studies in cities worldwide have shown that dedicated bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow by reducing the number of cars on the road and encouraging alternative modes of transportation.\nThe goal should be to build a more modern, livable city for all road users, not to regress into a car-centric approach that doesn't serve our long-term needs. We should be expanding cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\nI urge the government to reconsider this counterproductive move and invest in a future where people feel safe and encouraged to bike, drive, and walk in Toronto.\n"

It doesn't take a genius to know what causes CAR congestion. It's...cars?? Who knew! How about improving public transit and city infrastructure to reduce car usage?\nStop wasting our tax payer money destroying the few things Toronto has that make it great.\nAlready did that with the Science Center and Ontario Place, what else would you like to take from us?\n"

        "comment": "If we remove bike lanes, we will push all of those bikers from small, dedicated lanes, to taking up an ENTIRE vehicle lane as allowed by the law. While some of these bikers may decide to take transit, a large percentage will revert to driving, adding additional cars on the road. Imagine thousands of bikers blocking lanes or getting in their cars and adding to traffic - this I do not want to see.\nThere is fundamentally no logic in this decision and as proven by countless studies, removing bike lanes will increase traffic, congestion, and most importantly, cyclist fatalities\n"

More congestion.\nWhat time is going to be saved with two lanes of traffic and street parking? Two lanes of congestion.\nRemove street parking along major routes and start putting parking infrastructure elsewhere. Congestion is not going to end by removing bicycle lanes because congestion on our roads have already existed before them.\nThis government is a farce with Doug Ford at the helm. No money for Health Care, but there is more than enough money to remove bicycle lanes, break a contract for alcohol in corner stores, and offer individuals $200 cheques.\n"

In fact, the existence of bike lanes not only make traffic faster but also, much safer for cyclists and pedestrians.\nI know one OPP employee whose sole job it was to drive Ministers around who \u201cclocked in\u201d from home, for 20 minutes, during Covid and received a full salary. So I realize the government prioritized my tax dollars to fund drivers. The same government is willing to spend more of my tax dollars to remove new infrastructure installed to make me safer, and potentially add more drivers to an already congested road. I own two cars - maybe I\u2019ll just start being another driver ahead of you on your way into the office.\n"

You have now increased gidlocks, and increased time for Ontario citizens - the literal antithesis of this bill.\nFurthermore, a situation that actively delays the implementation of other modes of transport for residents of a municipality leads to increased costs for both the municipality and the province, when such costs can go to maintaining and improving provincial highways, to ensure faster commute times for Ontarians.\nThis bill will add more red tape, endager peoples lives and livelihoods, and ultimately, cost some MPPs their seats come the next election.\n"
