This bill is a massive overreach of the provincial government. You are not a king, Doug. Let municipalities, and the people who voted for their management, decide how their municipal development will proceed. I understand the province needs to have reasonable boundaries on municipal decision making, but forcing them to never be able to reduce a car traffic lane for bike lanes is ridiculous. This is NOT what is causing congestion. Do you just hate exercise that much Mr Ford? Let people have joy in life please.\n"

The food dropoff drivers on those fast electric bikes and scooters are so dangerous, especially the ones from India, Pakistan, and Brampton because they just don't care at all about anyone's safety. It's better to have like at least 20% to 30% of them in bike lanes instead of 100% of them on the sidewalk. Thanks for asking for our feedback.\n"

        "comment": "I think that this is an incredibly foolish move, and an attack on the people who actually LIVE in Toronto. If the goal was actually to \"get people to where they need to go faster\", emphasis would be placed on improving public transit and ENCOURAGING bike lane use, NOT clogging the streets with more single-user cars. Further, bicycles run on muscle power. Transit runs (primarily) on hydro-electric power and nuclear power. Cars run on petroleum products, which add to the already...let's call it 'distinctive' odor of the city, that being of hardening concrete, jet fuel, scorched fry oil, and suffering.\nFor my part, I believe that 'vehicle' portions of the road should be primarily for moving supplies (e.g. foodstuffs, materiel to keep businesses running, etc.) in and out of businesses, and to assist with the larger chores of life (e.g. moving house, etc.) not for the daily commute of rich folks who don't want to share space with \"the poors.\"\nIn short, we should be focusing on 'walkable' cities, not 'drivable' ones.\n"

If people do not like bike lanes built by a municipal government, we can already go to our municipal governments to have our voices heard. The province has enough work to do at the provincial level.\nAlso, as a driver I want bikes in bike lanes. I don't want them in with car traffic. Separated bike lanes are better for drivers as well as cyclists. They're safer for everyone. I don't see how forcing bikes back into car traffic is going to make driving better for people.\n"

Adding more lanes for cars is not going to relieve congestion due to induced demand.\nRelocating the bike lanes to side streets is going to significantly lengthen the journey for cyclists, while making it more dangerous due to the significant right and left turns. The city has suffered through more than enough cyclist deaths.\nAdditionally, the numbers used by the ministry to justify the removal (1.2% of people cycle to work) are misleading - this data is from 2011 (over 10 years ago), and includes suburban areas of Toronto where biking is not commonly used to as a primary mode of transportation.\nPlease take a look at the scientific research I included in the supporting links.\nThis also sets a precedent of the province interfering in municipal matters.\nLastly, as a taxpayer, I believe the money allocated to remove the bike lanes (especially\nthe ones that have just been installed) is better invested elsewhere such as transit,\nhealthcare, or education.\nI also do not support the changes to the rules around environmental assessments - especially\nfor new highways.\n"

        "comment": "We should not be adding vehicular lanes on top of high-level transit modes below.  Biking is first and last mile public transit allowing people to safe get to their subway station.\n2 of the bike lanes run through University of Toronto. These are staff and students that take transit and cycle.  26% of students cycle to classes.\nIf this legislation is about \"scientific\" addressing of traffic, release the data of how many people cycle in these affected neighbourhoods.  If I cycle to the subway and transit rest of the way to work, am I cycling or transiting to work? What about those that use their bikes to get to classes, errands, shopping, and other weekly transportation needs.\nThe Province should be covering 100% of the costs to remove this and not leaving Toronto taxpayers left to pay.  The people of Scarborough or North Etobicoke should not have their city services reduced because the Province was too cheap to cover the costs downloaded on to city.\n"

        "comment": "Dear honourable MPPs and all committee members,\nI am reaching out to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, recently proposed by the Ontario Provincial Government.\nI've lived in Toronto for more than two years now. I chose to attend graduate school here partly because the city offers me independence throught its pedestrian-friendly urban planning, affordable transit, and bike lane systems.\nBill 212 undermines the city's dedication to expanding bike lanes and takes us in the wrong direction. Reducing bike lanes, particularly those that have already been built with city money, with property taxes that I have paid as a homeowner, to prioritize vehicle traffic is counterproductive to reducing congestion.\nStudies consistently show that adding traffic lanes only induces demand, which means more cars, more congestion, and higher accident rates in the long-term. It seems like every other day I go online and see local news reporting of yet another byclist or pedestrian death or life-changing injury due to a collision, reckless driving, or speeding.\nIn contrast, protected bike lanes encourage more people to choose cycling, which reduces car traffic over time and creates safer roads for everyone. In Toronto, many of my own colleagues and loved ones cycle regularly either with their own bikes or using the paid Bike Share system.\nIf the goal of the Provincial government is to ease congestion, then giving people MORE transportation options, not fewer, is essential. Toronto is an ever-growing city that is still recovering after the pandemic. To accommodate this growth sustainably, we need to provide infrastructure for all modes of transportation. Limiting this choice will lead to greater congestion, lower mobility, and a heavier reliance on vehicles\u2014outcomes that many in our community are actively trying to avoid.\nPeople want options. As more families choose single-car households, as more people prefer walking or cycling to work, and as more parents want their children to walk to school safely, we must ensure our streets support these choices. Many in the city are also mindful of their environmental footprint, especially the young people I know who will be the scientific and political leaders of tomorrow, and are looking for transportation alternatives that align with these values. I respectfully demand that the city makes their safety and the safety of all of its residendents a priority.\nBill 212 represents gross overreach by the Provincial government, and cities should be allowed to make decisions regarding transport in their jurisdictions based ONLY on the needs of their city's residents and no one else. This bill would remove municipal independence and waste taxpayer dollars.\nThis bill does not reflect the needs, values, or desires of Toronto's residents. I urge you to oppose this bill and to encourage your voting colleagues to also oppose this bill, and to advocate for the safe, sustainable, and community-centered transportation infrastructure that all residents across the province want and deserve.\nThank you very much for your time.\n"

        "comment": "We have always been avid cyclist and enjoyed the recreational cycling trails in Toronto, such as along the Lake Shore.  We always wanted to make cycling a part of our daily routine in the city, beyond the weekend rides.  However, the lack of safe bike lanes along Bloor Street highly restricted our movements.  We tried cycling on sidewalks (which is officially prohibited), as cycling next to cars was extremely dangerous.  In the end, we gave in to using the car, due to lack of viable options.  Our son really wanted to bike to school, but with no safe lanes, this was not possible.\nEven since the bike lanes in Etobicoke were added, the whole family uses the Bloor St bike lane to get to work, school, pick up groceries and visit friends.  Even with the falling temperatures I use them everyday to addend classes in the evening, knowing that I will be safe.\nWith more people able to cycle safely in the city, the number of cars on the road decreases, greatly contributing to the air quality to everyone.  Not to mention having a positive impact on the activity level and positive health outcomes stemming from cycling.\nThere is definitely a car culture in the city (and beyond), and it will take time for people's mindsets to shift to a more sustainable way to move around.  Having dedicated bike lanes is just the first step to give people of Toronto a healthy option to move around in the city, and in the end contribute to limiting congestion.\n"

I do not own a car, and bicycling is my primary mode of transportation, even during the winter!\nThe data is clear that when people can bike safely on bike paths, they choose that option.\nBicycling has positive health benefits, and reduces emissions. The city and the province should be doing everything they can to encourage more biking.\nBut changing lifestyle doesn't happen overnight! It requires consistent, dedicated policy improvements. Toronto's efforts at expanding bike paths are starting to pay off. From 2015 to 2024, the number of bikeshare rides has increased by 10 fold to 6 million per year. When making big life decisions,, like where to live or whether to buy a car, residents need to know the city will continue to support them. Removing the bike paths will make transportation more dangerous, more expensive, or more time consuming for thousands of residents like me who rely on bicycling.\nFinally, there is strong evidence that bike paths improve economic activity, so the push from businesses to eliminate this healthy, inexpensive and environmentally-friendly feature of our city is unfounded.\n"

        "comment": "I'm vehemently opposed to Bill 212. I believe removing bike lanes will only make gridlock worse by forcing people who would commute by bike to instead take their car, since it's left as their only option. Bike lanes help clear congestion on sidewalks, prevent accidents, and give right of way for bikes to move efficiently. The Province of Ontario should instead look to FUND and ENCOURAGE more public transit so people who would drive could instead take efficient, reliable, and safe public transit options to get to their destination. This is a real solution to reducing gridlock rather than a band-aid solution as Doug Ford's government is proposing with Bill 212. To reiterate, objectively this is a poorly thought out bill and will only make gridlock continue to get worse into the future.\n"

This is by far the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard. First of all, bike lanes are good for any city, they reduce pollution, encourage people to stay active. The more people are active , the less the cost of health care. Why would you build less of them, you should build more. It\u2019s the the province that should decide this issue, it our municipal government that should be in control. Not every city or community is the same or faces the same traffic problems.

Induced demand has been proven in plenty of research, so this will not reduce gridlock at all, it will just encourage more people to drive and get stuck in gridlock traffic, and increase the number of cyclists injured or killed by vehicles.\nThe numbers you have used to show cyclist usage do not accurately reflect the actual percentages of people in those neighbourhoods who use the bike lanes, as you have included numbers for the greater GTA areas outside of the downtown area, so that is deliberately misleading.\nRequiring provincial approval for bike lines is a ridiculous addition of red tape and is completely unnecessary.\nThis proposal is also trying to sneak through not needing an environmental assessment for expanding highway 413, which is also unacceptable.\nThis proposal should not be accepted.\n"

Bike lanes, especially protected ones, are essential to their safety (all of our safety).  This past year, we have provided almost 900 rides to over 1500 passengers in the Hamilton, Burlington area.\nOrganizations like CWA bring a different perspective to the utility and need for bike lanes. It's an equity issue: seniors and people with limited physical mobility would otherwise be unable to enjoy the benefits of cycling, being out and about, experiencing social interaction and conversation, etc. Thanks to CWA, they can participate in ways their circumstances would otherwise preclude. Dedicated, safe bike lanes facilitate their social and physical participation in an activity from which they would otherwise be foreclosed.\nMunicipal governments should have the exclusive right to determine when and where bike lanes should be located.  I strongly believe that the issue of bike lanes should not be interfered with by the provincial government.\n"

It makes sense to have options downtown or around Bloor and Spadina where it\u2019s a viable daily commuting option for more people.  It just doesn\u2019t make sense in our area especially with this section bounded by the Humber river and Etobicoke creek.\nThe only reason this bill needs to be proposed is that our mayor and city councillor have refused to listen to the residents in our ward.   They have treated our residents like we are all bike-hating imbeciles addicted to our cars instead of acknowledging our concerns.   We should NOT need legislation to solve for the issue that city councillors are refusing to advocate for the citizens in the area they represent but I appreciate the spotlight being placed on this issue.\n"
