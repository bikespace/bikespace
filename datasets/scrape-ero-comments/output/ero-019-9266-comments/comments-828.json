        "comment": "This bill is goes entirely in the wrong policy direction and will negatively impact the lives of Ontario residents. Removing bike lanes from popular Toronto cycling routes is a shameful and disgraceful act that will reduce the safety of all vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and others). These bike lanes are needed for many reasons. The primary reason is safety; the provincial government should not be hurting safety with such clear opposition from local government and local community groups. Secondary reasons are sustainability and mobility, where bike lanes are provide good solutions that help people get around in a sustainable and accessible way [1][2][3]. The Bloor bike lanes in particular are identified to be critical for the overall cycling network in Toronto, since they link different areas of the city and also serves local destinations on one uninterrupted route[4]. The traffic problem is caused by too many cars, not bike lanes. The Premier, and his partisans, are promoting this policy to feed a pro-car culture war, not to have a meaningful impact on traffic or any objective metric. The government needs to amend Bill 212, stop attacking bike lanes, and not block (with bureaucracy or other methods) any future cycling or road safety projects in Ontario.\n[1] OSPE, \"Response to Bill 212: Why We Need to Rethink Bike Lanes and Embrace Multi-Modal Solutions\"\nhttps://ospe.on.ca/advocacy/response-to-bill-212-why-we-need-to-rethink\u2026\n[2] Association of Ontario Municipalities, \"Working Together to Tackle Congestion\" https://www.amo.on.ca/sites/default/files/assets/DOCUMENTS/Reports/2024\u2026\n[3] University of Toronto News, \"Toronto\u2019s COVID-19 bike lane expansion boosted access to jobs, retail: U of T study\" https://www.utoronto.ca/news/toronto-s-covid-19-bike-lane-expansion-boo\u2026\n[4] University of Toronto News, \"U of T experts use machine learning to analyze where bike lanes should be located for maximum benefit\"\nhttps://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-experts-use-machine-learning-analyze-w\u2026\n"

        "comment": "As traffic engineers have long known and American cities periodically rediscover at their great expense, increasing road space to any feasible degree doesn't reduce congestion. To reduce congestion you need to get as many cars off the road as possible to free up space for the people who absolutely have to drive. The way to get cars off the road is to provide excellent alternatives that as many people can use instead. Every person taking public transportation or riding a bicycle is a person who is not in a car taking up all of that road capacity. Every person taking a Go train to their destination is a person who is not taking up highway space.\nRunning Metrolinx effectively so that the Eglinton Crosstown would finally come into service would do more to reduce Toronto congestion than any amount of removing bicycle lanes. Removing bicycle lanes and preventing new ones will only increase congestion across Toronto, as the people who are currently bicycling will either start driving or start taking up more space on shared roads. People do not vanish when you remove their current means of transportation; they shift to other means.\nBuilding more Go lines and operating more attractive Go service would do more to reduce commuter traffic on our highways than building another one, which will just fill up again. Building highways through the Greenbelt destroys more of Ontario's limited good farmland and ultimately wastes taxpayer money.\nThe bike lane portions of this bill are also fundamentally undemocratic. Toronto voters have expressed their views about bike lanes through their elected city council representatives; that is local government making decisions about local government activities. Now the provincial government is overriding those views, the views of the people who live in this city. Our democratic voices do not matter to the Premier; Toronto's views are to be actively stomped on by MPs who do not represent any of those voters.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI have lived in this city my whole life, and have lived in an apartment building near Bloor for the last 18 years (I am 10 minutes away by foot, so I am very close).\nI do not own a car.  I don't even have a license.  I get around the city mostly by foot, with some TTC use peppered in.\nThough I'm not a driver, it's plain to see that these bike lanes have been influenced by some asinine ideology, and not actual reality.  Because every time I walk down Bloor street, I see a sea of car congestion, and next to no bikes.  I see bikers that have zero regard for traffic lights (which they routinely flaunt) or fellow citizens.  I see entitled babies that have further handicapped an already bursting-at-the-seams metropolis.  They do not care about people with families, that must use a car for shared travel.  They do not care about the elderly who can't ride a bike, the disabled, and frankly freedom of choice when it comes to transport.  They do not care about small businesses that are losing foot traffic and the ability to make an honest living.  These same people who would shake their ironic fists at large corporations and grieve the loss of the ma and pa shop.   They don't even care about 911 vehicles that can barely maneuver in traffic because the necessary extra space has been taken up by physically ramped up lanes, complete with idiotic pylons and concrete parking spot slabs (total overkill if you ask me but the babies must be placated).  I've come to realize that this city hates itself, and bike lanes everywhere are yet another manifestation of that.   So thank you for restoring a shred of functionality (and dare I say sanity) back to this over-priced, over-hyped city.  Bikers are not saving the world.  They are destroying the livability of this place and even undermining their own environmental goals by having countless vehicles idle endlessly while average people are just trying to get around in a region plagued by snow and cold for half the year.  I only hope that this change in direction will stay in place for a long time.  And while you're at it, please consider getting rid of the speed bumps on every residential street.  They're totally ridiculous and solve nothing.  I'm sick of city council taking a helicopter-parent approach to everything in this place.  Pretty soon we're going to need a city permit every time we convert oxygen into carbon dioxide.\n"

        "comment": "The quicker you remove bike lanes from major roads the better. Bloor street West has become a nightmare, whereby cyclists do not obey the rules of the road. I\u2019ve almost been knocked down twice as they do not stop for pedestrians. Turning right is a nightmare whereby for a second at a certain angle you cannot see them coming. Plus instead of stopping for the car they speed up trying to beat you possibly causing a future accident.\nThey should be regulated to side roads. It has slowed traffic down terribly. As an example from Royal York station to the Bloor Lights what once took only 5-10 minute wait has now turned into a 20-25 minute backup.\nCutting out two lanes of traffic obviously is causing terrible gridlock. Instead of putting flower boxes in the middle of the road for gods sake remove the bike lanes.\nAlso emergency vehicles have a tough time reaching there destination possibly causing death in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I believe that the question of bike lanes is a rather simple one provided the community approaches the issue with the right attitude. Unfortunately, we seem to live in a world where the sense of community has been lost.Self-interest seems to prevail over any sense of comity. \u201cComity\u201d is a great word, meaning care for each other-the sense of mutual concern for common benefit. The issue also requires citizens to take the time to understand the details and data before taking a stand.\nIt is very easy to say \u201cI drive to work and these lanes are a nuisance, further stalling already congested traffic\u201d. But not everyone has the means to afford a car. But more than that, studies have shown that before bike lanes were introduced traffic moved very marginally faster. Furthermore, the more people are encouraged to ride a bike the less traffic will be on the road.\nRemoving bike lanes will not remove bikes from the roads. What it will do is make riding bikes more dangerous, for bikers and drivers. To what end? The vast majority of those living on the City take some form of public transit. Those and the growing numbers of bike riders make up the vast majority of commuters in the City. Why should we cater to the wealthy car owners who have disproportionate political  power because of their wealth. Anyone who denies this is not being honest.\nFinally, this ought to be a City not Provincial decision. Commuters who pass through the City once a day do not add anything to the daily life of the City, rarely being part of neighbourhood life here. The many small businesses who are the backbone not only of the economy of the City but its character rely on the bikers who shop, eat and enjoy the City life. Not those commuting from Markham.\nFinally in this time of global climate crisis we should be encouraging as much bike riding as possible. Not turning back the clock to rip out bike lanes that has helped the growth of commuting without cars. This is not the time to think about the immediate perceived interests of a few car owners. Rather we should be encouraging more bike riding in all our interests. That is what commits and good sense dictates.\n"

You reduce traffic by building alternative options: transit and active mobility.\nI want to be able to bike safely on streets where I live, both on my own and with my kids. We bike for transport to school, daycare and local shopping. Currently, our main street is an unsafe route for biking for adults, let alone kids. There is plenty of room in the right of way to share. Full bi-directional bike ways can take the place of ugly and dangerous street parking on just one side of a street. We should do this on all major routes.

She doesn't know yet if the woman was a neighbour. In a time when 2/3 of our population are overweight or obese, we need to be doing everything we can to create the conditions to allow people to be active - and what a better way to be active then the use active transportation to get to where you need to go. I would like to help my children develop healthy behaviours such as walking, biking or taking transit. I know this is good for them physically, but also socially and mentally. The more independent they can be, the better, but I am very nervous about the safety of our streets in Peterborough.\nOur community has spend a lot of time, effort and money on developing a Cycling Master Plan that fits in with our Transportation Master Plan. These plans have been rigorously reviewed and discussed and our community is excited for the vision they present. The thought of the Province allocating precious funds to meddle in municipalities' ability to install bike lanes is so frustrating. What a wast of money and an unnecessary hassle and set-back for municipalities who want to build the foundations for a healthy and vibrant city.\nMany professional organizations have spoken out against Bill 212, and have laid out the arguments for way Bill 212 should be dropped. So I am writing from the heart. I want to live in a City where I know my kids will be safe getting to school, getting to work and going to see their friends. We all know that people want to live in walkable communities. Alleviating congestion has to be about providing options for people to get out of their personal cars.\nThank you for reading.\n"

Businesses in the Kingsway are suffering, traffic is being diverted to neighbourhoods due to gridlock and I have witness emergency vehicles stuck as cars cannot move over to let them pass. Fire trucks are routinely using my little east west side-street as a faster route to emergencies which is unsafe and makes no sense, except that the arterial roads are not moving.

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a car owner living in Toronto, I can appreciate the frustration of traffic. However I strongly believe that using taxpayer money to rip up downtown bike lanes is not an effective or logical use of resources. I am opposed to Bill 212. The bike lanes along Bloor Street in Toronto, for example, were built after consideration, planning, and piloting over many years. The evidence shows that the bike lanes have not negatively impacted traffic times, while they have positively impacted economic activity and reduced collisions. There is no logic behind this bill and frankly I consider it to be waste of time and money. The bike lanes were considerable infrastructure projects which were not installed frivolously. In fact, what is shown to negatively effect traffic congestion the most is construction, which would be required to remove the bike lanes. More cyclists use the lanes all the time, and later into the winter months. Please do not use money to pursue an ideologically-based policy of removing bike lanes, when an evidence-based policy supports their use and even their expansion. Cities around the world are expanding their bicycling networks because of the proven benefits for reducing collisions. Local governments know best what works in their jurisdictions. Considering Ontario is larger than many countries, surely there are other issues which actually require provincial attention. The provincial government\u2019s attempt to micro-manage municipal road planning is poorly conceived. Cyclists will continue to use those streets, property will be damaged by collisions, and people will be injured. Please reconsider this costly and shortsighted bill.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern:\nI am a resident of Toronto and an avid cyclist, who cycles almost every day within the city, all year round. I use my bike as my primary means of transportation for errands, work, and leisure. I have deliberately chosen not to own a car, as I prefer to use my bike for reasons of efficiency, value, environmental impact, as well as maintaining my health and fitness. Central to the success of cycling within Toronto is the network of bike lanes that have slowly come to fruition in the city over many years.\nI am writing to express my absolute opposition to the provincial mandate calling for the removal of bike lanes from Toronto's roads. As a regular cyclist in the city, and a proponent of sustainable transportation and safe urban spaces, I believe that the removal of these bike lanes would be a devastating step backward for the city and its residents.\nBike lanes are a vital part of our urban infrastructure, serving not only as a key mode of transportation but also as an essential aspect of Toronto's broader strategy to address climate change, reduce traffic congestion, and promote public health. By removing these lanes, the provincial mandate will not only harm the environment but also limit the mobility options available to residents, particularly those who rely on cycling as a low-cost, eco-friendly mode of transportation.\nThe removal of bike lanes would disproportionately affect those who are most vulnerable in our city\u2014commuters, students, and low-income individuals\u2014who rely on biking as an affordable and efficient means of travel. In addition, removing bike lanes would lead to an increase in congestion, as more people would be forced to rely on cars for their daily commute. This will not only worsen traffic flow but also increase air pollution and carbon emissions, directly contradicting our city's environmental goals.\nFurthermore, bike lanes enhance the safety of all road users. Studies consistently show that cities with well-designed cycling infrastructure experience fewer accidents, with both cyclists and motorists benefiting from clearly designated lanes. Removing bike lanes will only increase the risk of collisions, particularly in an already congested urban environment like Toronto.\nToronto's population is growing, and with it, the need for diverse transportation options. Removing bike lanes undermines the city's commitment to being a forward-thinking, inclusive, and sustainable urban center. Rather than dismantling the progress made in cycling infrastructure, we should be investing in further expansion and improvement of these networks to encourage safer and more efficient commuting options.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this mandate and to support efforts that promote safer, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options for all Torontonians. Our future lies in investing in transportation systems that reduce congestion, improve air quality, and encourage active lifestyles\u2014bike lanes are an integral part of that vision.\nI am also concerned about the environmental implications of \"Bill 212\", particularly in relation to resource extraction, land development, and environmental regulations. Ontario is home to diverse ecosystems that must be protected for future generations. Weakening environmental protections would be a step backward in the province\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\nThe Ontario Greenbelt is an incredibly important ecological, environmental, and social resource for several reasons:\n1. Environmental Protection\nPreservation of Biodiversity: The Greenbelt spans over 2 million acres and includes a wide range of ecosystems such as wetlands, forests, and agricultural lands. This diversity helps to maintain local biodiversity by providing habitats for native plants and animals. Many species in the Greenbelt are rare or endangered.\n2. Climate Change Mitigation: The Greenbelt acts as a natural carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and helping to mitigate climate change. The trees, soil, and wetlands trap greenhouse gases, which is critical as cities like Toronto continue to grow and industrial emissions rise.\nWater Quality and Management: The Greenbelt is also key to maintaining clean water. It surrounds the headwaters of many rivers and streams that supply drinking water to millions of Ontarians. Wetlands and forests within the Greenbelt help filter water and reduce flooding by absorbing excess rainwater and preventing soil erosion.\n3. Agricultural Land Protection\nSustaining Local Agriculture: The Greenbelt is home to some of Ontario's most fertile farmland. It helps to preserve agricultural land from urban sprawl, ensuring that local food production remains sustainable. The Greenbelt includes vital agricultural areas like the Niagara Escarpment and the Holland Marsh, which are essential for producing a wide variety of crops and supporting Ontario's agricultural economy.\nFood Security: By protecting farmlands, the Greenbelt plays a role in maintaining a secure, local food supply. It helps reduce the environmental footprint associated with food imports and transportation.\n4. Urban Sprawl Prevention\nControlled Development: The Greenbelt serves as a barrier to prevent uncontrolled urban sprawl, which can lead to the destruction of natural areas and farmland. Its boundaries help ensure that cities grow in a more sustainable, compact way, encouraging higher-density development and reducing the pressure to build on sensitive land.\nUrban Quality of Life: By preserving green space, the Greenbelt provides areas for recreation, relaxation, and escape from urban life. Access to natural spaces in urban areas is shown to improve mental and physical well-being, and the Greenbelt offers these spaces to residents of Ontario\u2019s urban centers.\n5. Cultural and Recreational Value\nOutdoor Recreation: The Greenbelt is a popular spot for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, birdwatching, and nature walks. These recreational opportunities contribute to the physical and mental health of the population and provide a place for people to connect with nature.\nCultural Heritage: Many Indigenous communities have cultural ties to the land within the Greenbelt, and it also contains significant historical sites that reflect Ontario's colonial and indigenous past.\n6. Economic Benefits\nTourism: The Greenbelt boosts tourism by attracting visitors interested in outdoor activities, environmental education, and local produce. This contributes to the local economy, especially in rural and farming communities.\nSustainable Land Use: The Greenbelt fosters a balance between urban development and environmental stewardship. By ensuring that some land remains untouched or used for agriculture, it provides long-term economic benefits, including sustainable food production and environmental tourism.\n7. Public Health and Well-being\nClean Air and Recreation Spaces: Access to green spaces in urban areas is linked to better health outcomes, including lower rates of heart disease, obesity, and mental health disorders. The Greenbelt offers urban residents opportunities to escape the stress of city life and enjoy the benefits of nature, contributing to improved well-being.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 and engage in meaningful dialogue with the public, experts, and communities who will be directly affected by these changes. It is vital that any policy changes prioritize the well-being of Ontarians, safeguard our environment, and ensure equitable access to resources and services.\nThank you for your attention.\n"

They are a waste of the City of Toronto's tax money and have resulted in a much more dangerous situation for seniors.  I live in an apartment looking down on Bloor Street West.  For over a year now in all seasons, there have been hardly any bikes along Bloor Street West on the new bike paths.  Meanwhile, I watch cars clogged up in the one lane that is left.  The parking along Bloor Street West is very hazardous to seniors leaving or entering a car.  The different colour boxes on the roads and the removal of right turn lanes has left a great deal of confusion and has made driving or walking more hazardous.  Although it will cost a lot of money to remove the bike lanes, the result will be worth the cost.  If the City of Toronto had bothered to listen to its residents, rather than to the bike lobby, it would never have spent money installing the dangerous (and nearly unused) bike lanes to begin with.\n"

As a rational, reasoning driver, it's obvious that the reason for traffic is the volume of cars. As a safe driver, I welcome cyclists having their own lanes so that I have no worry and concern for their safety (as is my duty) and so that they don't impede what little vehicular flow there is. Removing the bike lanes will simply put cyclists back in the lanes with those very cars that want cyclists removed from the road, and in harms way.\nBicycle lanes increase transportation options. They enable people to get to their place of business, school, and conduct daily life. They connect communities. And bicycle lanes save lives.\nDoug Ford and Bill 212 clearly aim to remove these benefits from the citizens of Toronto.\n"

Firstly, this is a MUNICIPAL issue. Why the province should be allowed to control things that only affect the city of Toronto, not the PROVINCE that it governs, is absolutely beyond me. The whole purpose of the municipal government is to deal with local issues. Why have it at all if the province can just overrule what the city wants at will??\nAdditionally, getting rid of the bike lanes that the taxpayers already paid money for and suffered through months of construction for will not serve anyone. There will only be more money wasted and more gridlock caused by the construction needed to remove the lanes and redo the roads. The safety of cyclists will also be GREATLY reduced. As a low income person, I cannot afford a car or to take transit all the time so a bike is the only affordable and fast way to get around the city. With the lanes being taken away, the risk to my personal safety and all the other people like me will be much, much greater. For what? So that the people from Etobicoke like Doug Ford don't need to sit in traffic for a few extra minutes?\nLeave the governing of the city of Toronto to the government that was elected to do it!

I am firmly opposed to the removal of bike lanes.\nIn 2024, reducing gridlock and prioritizing drivers is no longer a cause worth investing into if you truly intend to improve the lives of Torontonians in a sustainable way. Sustainability is not simply environmental -- I am talking about long term improvements to pedestrian mobility, safe public transit, air quality, community, space to play, and more. Bike lanes are an essential part of the sustainable fabric of Toronto, especially along the street level of subway lines.\nAdding traffic lanes to reduce gridlock is not only not based in evidence, but poses an immediate threat to the increasingly worsening air quality index in the City, frequency of traffic accidents and deaths, noise pollution, and fossil fuel consumption. There is no scientific evidence that points to removing bike lanes as a solution to these problems.\nPlease, be real with yourselves and the public: this project is meant to line the pockets of highway developers. With this proposal, you are brazenly ignoring the health and safety of millions of people in favour of the few, and you should be ashamed.

        "comment": "Ref. ERO number019-9266\nTo Minister Sarkaria,\nAs a driver and a cyclist, I am opposed to Bill 212, \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\", and therefore request that this bill be altered or withdrawn.  Several reasons make Bill 212 unacceptable for Ontarians:\n1. Bill 212 will reduce mobility and increase gridlock:\nBill 212 will force an already increased population of drivers and cyclists to share roads, rather than each moving within the appropriate infrastructure designated for each type of user and vehicle. In fact, Bill 212 will contribute more to gridlock because\n       A. people who already use bicycles as their vehicles, especially for commuting and for work, will most likely continue to do so; however, they will now be forced to ride on the road along with cars and other vehicles. This will inevitably create slower road conditions.\n       B. other people who will be forced to change from using their bicycles to using their cars (because they will not feel safe to ride on the road) will increase the number of cars on the road, again creating slower road conditions.\n2.  Bill 212 will reduce safety:\nGiven the above, where especially on major arteries, cyclists and drivers will need to share the road, Bill 212 will contribute to more dangerous conditions for cyclists. By forcing a larger number of cyclists and drivers on the same roads, Bill 212 will inevitably contribute to an increase in collisions and deaths. Protected bike lanes remain the safest ways for cyclists, especially cyclists who are not as experienced and who are less confident road riders.\n3. Bill 212 will reduce Ontarians\u2019 mental health and overall physical wellbeing:\nBill 212 will reduce Ontarians\u2019 mental health and physical wellbeing whether they are cyclists or drivers or both. For cyclists, Bill 212 will create a barrier to perhaps the only activity that gives them a sense of freedom and joy, and physical exercise (when they commute to work, or school, or to their activities, or run errands). If the idea is to increase Ontarians' wellbeing by helping them have access to more physical activities which also greatly contributes to their mental wellbeing, then Bill 212 does the opposite. The bicycle as a vehicle is very inclusive and provides exercise and mobility for people of many ages and abilities from children to the elderly. For drivers, Bill 212 will create undue stress and reduce their mental health, as they navigate driving with a large number of cyclists of various abilities on the road. Further, re: 1 above, less bicycles = more cars = more polluted air we breathe.\n4. Bill 212 will contribute to increased pollution and climate change:\nSee 1 above - more bicycles = less cars = less pollution and greenhouse gases. The opposite means more pollution and more greenhouse gases.\n5. Bill 212 will waste taxpayers\u2019 money:\nRemoving infrastructure which has been implemented based on actual data and with very positive results is simply wasteful, and makes citizens question the governments\u2019 motives.\n6. Bill 212 looks to the past, not to the future:\nMany cities around the world have changed their infrastructure to accommodate cycling as part of their active transportation plans, and to reduce their gridlock.\nI and thousands of fellow Ontarians use bike lanes more than ever, many on a daily basis. I cycle to and back from school with our 7 year old - a 3 km ride which we both enjoy immensely.\nWhen I explained to our 7 year old that our provincial government has introduced legislation that will allow the government to remove bike lanes, and specifically bike lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street, he was shocked and asked \u201ccan they do that? Why?\u201d. How do you explain to a child something the government is doing that simply does not make sense on so many levels as explained above? We teach our 7 year old how to be a good person, an informed citizen, how to care for others and for the environment, and we model those behaviours.\nI ask you Minister, can you explain to our 7 year old why you are doing something so harmful to so many Ontarians? The cynic in me says this is a political move to satisfy your conservative base.\nCycling is a form of transportation used by thousands of Ontarians for many beneficial reasons - health, affordability, environmental reasons, convenience. Cycling enhances many people\u2019s lives. By passing Bill 212, \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\", you will effectively contribute to the harming of Ontarians and our environment.\nRespectfully, alter or withdraw Bill 212.\nThank you.\n"
