The money could be better spent on subsidizing the ttc, or speeding up the Eglinton crosstown, or literally anything else. This bill reads like Ford has a personal vendetta against the city of Toronto, and it is a huge overreach of provincial powers.\nI strongly hope this bill does not pass. Ford needs to focus on the problems his government is responsible for, and not make new problems for other governments. He doesn't know what the city needs, and he should step off.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier and his esteemed colleagues,\nI am deeply concerned over all of the suggested plans for changes in bike lane policies, and most importantly, in the removal of three of Toronto's most important cycling paths. As someone who has lived in both Scarborough and the KW area, I have found cycling paths to be wonderful pieces of infrastructure. Examples of planned and converted bike lanes from all around the world have shown how these have helped to create happy and healthy communities. Paris, France and cities in The Netherlands get a lot of attention, but also look at the snowy cities of Bergen, Norway and Oulu, Finland. Projects from both Ontario and abroad have shown that bike lanes offer all of the following benefits:\n1. Bike lanes are good for business;\n2. They\u2019re good for the environment;\n3. They\u2019re good for public and personal health;\n4. They give us freedom and mobility;\n5. Bike lanes save lives.\nProtected bike lanes promote strong cities and communities, while ensuring the health and safety of our communities that should come first and foremost. Offering a safe place for cyclists to ride on main roads allows them to get to their desired destinations more directly than moving these to side streets.\nMoreover, these offer an alternative path for emergency vehicles to get around vehicles and pedestrians, and cyclists can get out of the way much faster than cars. I have seen this occur before in Kitchener, either to park the emergency vehicle out of the way of drivers, or to avoid a buildup of traffic.\nFinally, the lanes earmarked for demolition are only part of a growing bike network. Closing these down based on currently low cycling traffic would be inconclusive reasoning, as the team at Oh The Urbanity! on YouTube has pointed out. Once the missing sections are filled in along Yonge, Bloor and University, there will be numerous people using these to get to popular destinations along these routes by cycling. Cutting off lanes that have yet to reach maturity will only necessitate expensive rebuilds in the future.\nPainted bike lanes could never replace the benefits that these protected lanes offer, and having no nearby bike lanes would hurt communities that are developing in cities today. I request that you rescind this proposal so that the future of our communities may remain bright.\n"

I own a car and a bike and when I have the opportunity to do so, I use my bike for my commute from Bloor and Dovercourt to Yonge and Dundas. My car is off the road and I am using the bike lanes to safely get to and from my office.\nThe challenge for most cyclists or those aspiring to become cyclists is the feeling of safety on the road. Physically separated bike lanes give commuters options to not use their cars, which many like me do. And they keep cyclists safe. Being safer and feeling safer encourages more people to use their bikes more often, thus taking even more cars off the road.\nJust the notion that the Government of Ontario would choose to make citizens less safe makes my stomach turn.\nThis bill needs to remove the sections related to the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I am extremely disappointed in these proposed changes.\n1. Data used to support the proposal do not accurately represent the issue. The census was taken in 2021 in which a our province experienced knockdowns, restrictions, and overall safety precautions, thus inaccurately representing Toronto residents' bike usage within the proposed areas.\n2. The data accounts for the entire city of Toronto in which already lacks biking infrastructure, more specifically in the suburban areas. the \"1%\" is not considering the usage of the lanes itself and rather the entire city, thus falsely representing bike lane usage.\n3. The data does not account for persons under 15 and delivery drivers. Many people in the city depend on delivery personnel (Uber, Skip, Doordash, etc...) to deliver their food, many of whom do so via bike or scooter. By removing the lanes, we are putting at risk these hard working people who help give business to our local restaurants and fuel working Canadians , jeopardizing their lives. furthermore, the delivery persons will utilize the road regardless, which will still contribute to \"traffic\", thus maintaining a seperate lane with at least provide a safe method to do so.\n4.bike lanes provide alternative means of transport which gives commuters options and the freedom of mobility. Removing mode of transport to slightly alleviate another is counter intuitive as then the reliance of car and public transit increases - creating more congestion. with the option of biking, commuters are allowed to pick between biking, walking, transit, or driving - freeing space for latter 3. mathematically, 4 is a greater number than 3, this having 4 options of commuting rather than 3 is mathematically more intuitive.\n5. lastly, this is a great waste of our tax dollars. as someone who claims to be looking for the tax payer, I challenge Doug Ford's commitment to such morals as many of his decisions have been systematically wasting our taxes. If what is said is true, then the 40 or so million dollars that will be spent on removing such infrastructure is a great waste of money. not to mention the demolishing and relocation of the science centre (which is also costing tax payers). Could the 40 million dollars not be spent in maintaining the science centre which has served the local community for decades and providing education and jobs for our city? Could the money be spent on strengthening our transit system (more service, Eglinton LRT??????????) to then alleviate congestion on the roads?\nI hope this proposal is revisited so that it does not go through.\nthank you\n"

        "comment": "The rhetoric about reducing the gridlock with this plan is unsupportable. Utterly. The only way to reduce gridlock in this city is to have less cars, period. Bike lanes can actually help with that.\nAnd as both a driver and cyclist, bike lanes are safer for both, keeping bikes away from road enraged drivers -- who would be enraged whether there are bike lanes or not. Because bike lanes have not made gridlock worse -- more people and more cars are what have made it worse.\nThe Ontario government's proposal to use taxpayer money to remove what taxpayer money put in place is an offensive and irresponsible waste of public money. A MUCH better use of taxpayer money would be to address issues of homelessness and improving public transportation -- which would go much further in reducing gridlock than removing bike lanes.\n"

Cycling has always been a very efficient, cost effective and enjoyable way to get around the city. The bike lanes have enabled more people to bike safely including kids and the elderly. The removal of bike lanes has not only a cost impact but also a negative impact on the quality of life for people who live in the city.\nFunds should be spent on supporting those people who drive to have viable alternatives to getting into a car. This includes expediting transit, creating more accessible parking near major subways stations and ensure that the TTC and Go trains run on time and have capacity to bring people into our city.\nAs a tax payer, I am prefer the government to think more strategically about how money is spent. Thinking broadly about improving people's health by giving them the ability to cycle safely and reduce the cost to our healthcare because people are more active and there is less pollution in the air.\n"

I know several bikes were built and in use for years before I even knew they'd existed. I avoided major arteries for safety reasons only to later find out a bike lane existed which cut down my commute time.\nOn that note, I do appreciate commute times are a concern, but I'd also point out that cutting 3 minutes off a cycling commute in the cold is more significant than for car, where people are in the comfort of a warm mobile shelter.\nIf you want to reduce gridlock, study after study has shown the answers is not more roads.\nIt's not more lanes for cars.\nIt's investment in transit, bike lanes and various other things that reduce the need for people to use cars.\nFrankly, the idea that more roads and more lanes will help gridlock has been disproven over and over. Even the ON government's own assessment of the 413 has said this.\nI'm disappointed by the government's lazy thinking here.\nLet's build a sustainable province for the future, not a bigger version of something that only sort of worked 50 yrs ago.\n"

It is a question of budget and inefficiency of your plan.\nI consider bike infrastructure the best way to commute over relatively long distances. With the higher cost of housing, of food prices and even of College education, I think that the demand for safe and high quality bike lanes will continue increasing. Some research provided to justify the removal of bike lanes said that they were barely being used. I don't think this information is true, a lot of people use the Yonge Street and University Avenue bike lanes.\nI think the whole idea of removing bike lanes for cars will cost Ontario more in the long run, more cars will create induced demand which will lead to even more traffic congestion then there already is. As we see with suburbs, more car lanes does not reduce transportation time!\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I am against the removal of the Yonge St. and University Av. bike lanes because it will damage people's wallets and will increase comuting times for people who live in the city!\n"

        "comment": "The government of Ontario should not be micro-managing the streets of Toronto. Bike lanes are good - they encourage more people to bike instead of drive (which improves traffic congestion, since bikes take up less space on the road than cars), make roads safer for cyclists, and increase business to the shops and services in the vicinity. Someone riding a bike is more likely to stop and spontaneously go into a business they pass by than someone driving a car. If cyclists have their own lane, they won't be in the way of cars in the car lanes, which will improve car traffic movement.\nSome of this data has already been published, after the Bloor Street bike lane pilot project was studied (see supporting link). With every expansion to the Bloor Street bike lanes, that route has improved, especially for vulnerable road users.\nBloor has been ripped up several times in the past few years with various construction projects, and to go through that again to undo all the good work that was done on that corridor is a huge waste of time, money, and will cause even more gridlock. There does not appear to be any benefit in removing the bikes lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University, except to generate more contracts for construction companies.\nI am against Bill 212. Leave the existing bike lanes alone. The government of Ontario should not be wasting time and taxpayers' money opposing cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes in Toronto serve an important purpose in helping to manage traffic. Without them, cyclists are forced to weave between vehicles and squeeze past illegally stopped trucks, causing additional points of conflict and slowing traffic. This trait is well observed on Yonge Street near Dundas Street.\nAdditionally, the introduction of bike lanes typically comes with dedicated parking spots (ex. College Street, the planned lanes for Eglinton Avenue). These dedicated spots mean vehicles don't have to constantly merge back into the left lane as vehicles are intermittently parked by the curb, keeping traffic flowing more smoothly overall. The \"second lane\" becomes mostly useless when vehicles are forced to merge back and forth, or simply stick to the left lane and don't use the capacity of the road.\nRemoving bike lanes, and restricting their removal, is a short-sighted move that will not improve traffic throughput, will significantly increase the danger to cyclists and drivers alike, and will be a waste of public funds already dedicated to reducing emissions.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose the updated Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. The decision to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto is a costly, short-sighted move that jeopardizes public safety, undermines urban sustainability, and wastes public funds.\nAs someone who rides a bike daily, I know firsthand how essential these lanes are for safe and efficient commuting. Removing them will not alleviate congestion as claimed but will instead reverse years of progress, endanger lives, and increase chaos on Toronto\u2019s busiest streets. Toronto city staff have estimated that dismantling these bike lanes will cost $48 million, including the loss of the $27 million already invested in their construction. This wasteful expenditure comes with months of construction closures, severely disrupting traffic during the removal process, while providing negligible improvements in travel times for drivers once completed.\nThe safety benefits of these bike lanes are undeniable. After their installation, conflicts between vehicles and people riding bikes decreased by 61% on Bloor Street alone. These lanes have transformed our streets into safer spaces for everyone, not just those on bikes, by calming traffic and reducing accidents. Forcing people back into unprotected traffic lanes will undo these gains and increase the risk of serious injuries and fatalities. Claims that emergency vehicles are delayed by bike lanes are also unfounded. Toronto\u2019s deputy fire chief confirmed that response times have not been negatively impacted by bike lanes on University Avenue, directly countering misinformation used to justify this bill.\nThe economic and environmental consequences of removing bike lanes are equally troubling. Local businesses along bike lane routes have reported increased sales due to greater foot and bike traffic. Tearing out this infrastructure will harm small businesses, while also setting back Toronto\u2019s environmental goals by encouraging more car use, which increases congestion, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe motivations behind this legislation are deeply concerning. The influence of politically connected groups like Balance on Bloor, whose claims about bike lanes have repeatedly been contradicted by hard data, undermines the integrity of this process. Ridership on these bike lanes has surged since their installation, with increases as high as 650% on Bloor Street and 603% on Yonge Street. These numbers reflect a growing demand for safe, reliable cycling infrastructure, not a failure of their implementation.\nExempting this plan from the Environmental Assessment Act is a troubling precedent that disregards the environmental and social impacts of removing infrastructure designed to support active, low-emission transportation. Municipalities like Toronto have spent years studying and implementing these bike lanes to meet the needs of their residents. This provincial overreach undermines local governance and disregards the voices of those who rely on these lanes daily.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider this misguided amendment to Bill 212. Rather than dismantling essential infrastructure, the province should focus on expanding bike lanes and fostering safer, greener cities for everyone. Removing these lanes would be a step backward for public safety, sustainability, and urban livability.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n"

I don\u2019t believe any substantial infrastructure should be allotted to bike lanes until there (are licenses; or something to that effect), with a serious amount of accountability placed on these fellow road users. Would also love to see a report on % of tax payers that actually use bikes lanes.\nI sympathize with those responsible riders who wish to ride their bike to work; both for their health & the environment but witnessing daily how cyclists (and now scooters) have no respect for road signs/signals, rules of the road and a blatant disregard for pedestrian safety makes me side moreover with those that are licensed, insured and can demonstrate that they deserve to use the road.\nSuggestion would be some sort of identification as a vehicle operator/road user that would have their full info available. Service Ontario can run it and it can create more jobs for both issuing of the \u2018licenses\u2019 and monitoring day to day road use. This also allows to irresponsible operators to be held accountable if/when they cause an accident.\n"
