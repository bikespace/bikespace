        "comment": "These comments are regarding ERO 019-9266\nThis policy inclusion of removing bike infrastructure is incredibly short sighted.  Bike infrastructure helps to enliven a city, promotes healthy movement and exercise that leads to performance and productivity gains as well as promotes local shopping as opposed to online shopping.\nPlease do not spend our tax dollars removing ownership over something our tax dollars paid for.   Hasn't the province learned from the 407 debacle or scrapping renewable energy projects?  The honorable (sic) premier of Ontario should encourage Ontarians to be as healthy as can be, due to the fact that defunding our public health system is a tool that has been used carelessly by his government.\nUtilize the money that may have been used to remove bike infrastructure to build new homes, study the environment to ensure the development is sustainable for future Ontarians and enrich our schools so that our children can receive better education from educators that feel respected and well funded.\n"

        "comment": "Hi I just wanted to share my voice as a cyclist in the city. I use a bicycle to get around because it is faster than driving or taking transit at this point which is mainly due to congestion in the downtown core where I live. I also enjoy the healthy lifestyle cycling provides as well as that it is a zero emissions form of travel. I have felt much safer on my bike in the city since the formation of many new bike lanes such as the Bloor lane and the Adelaide St Lane. I have a friend who was killed on her bicycle on Dufferin street by a vehicle where there is no bike lane installed. These bike lanes encourage riders who wouldn\u2019t otherwise ride to cycle as they would be afraid to otherwise. I don\u2019t necessarily support the building of new bike lanes that get rid of a lane of traffic because at this point it is integral that traffic moves by any means possible as it can take half an hour to move the course of three city blocks in a vehicle during peak times. I absolutely resist Doug Fords proposition to remove existing bike lanes. This would be a flagrant waste of taxpayers money and encourage the use of single occupancy vehicles which is the number one contributor to congestion in the downtown core. Thank you for hearing my comment.\n"

        "comment": "Good afternoon,\nI have submitted a formal letter to the editor of Engineering Dimensions - the magazine for Professional Engineers Ontario - detailing my opposition to Bill 212 on the grounds that it contravenes public safety, and requesting that PEO leadership denounce the Ontario government's proposed amendments as part of Bill 212. The submission, with personal information removed, reads as follows:\n\"Letter to the editor, Engineering Dimensions Magazine,\nSubject: Concerns Regarding Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nGood afternoon,\nI am writing in my capacity as a licenced professional engineer to express my concerns regarding the Ontario Government's proposed Bill 212; \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\". As specified in the Professional Engineers act, it is my duty as a licensee to report situations that may endanger the safety of the general public, and I strongly believe this bill poses significant risks in that regard.\nPrimarily, my concerns revolve around the complete lack of safety input specified in the proposed bill. The amendment as written fails to mention the use of metrics related to the safety of vulnerable road users when assessing bike lane installations. The only apparent metrics, aside from the Ministry's unspecified judgment, is the reduction of marked lanes for motor vehicle traffic and whether the proposed bike lane would \"unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\". This is a clear prioritization of the convenience of motor vehicle traffic over the safety of more vulnerable road users, particularly those for whom no alternative protected roadways exist. Road users who are unable or opt not to use motor vehicles must in such instances travel alongside larger, faster, and heavier vehicles at great personal risk to themselves. In many instances where few available roadways exist (such as expressway overpasses, viaducts, and bridges), protected infrastructure is imperative to allow all road users - not just motorists - to safely reach their destination.\nIn my capacity as a licenced engineer, prioritizing convenience and ease of movement over the physical well-being of the public would not only constitute gross negligence, but arguably professional misconduct as well. I am frankly appalled that Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria - the highest provincial authority in matters of transportation safety - would support, let alone propose, a bill which will impede road safety, and almost certainly result in increased near-misses, injuries, and deaths on Ontario's roads.\nAs exemplified by the six cyclists who were killed on Toronto roads in 2024 thus far, it is crucial that we install more protected infrastructure to ensure the health and safety of the general public. Instead, Mr. Sarkaria's bill adds layers of bureaucracy, costs, and baseless requirements to the installation of such infrastructure, directly contravening decades of effort by municipal governments to make roads safer for all users.\nMoreover, the provincial government\u2019s public statement committing to the removal of already-installed, paid-for, and well-utilized bike lanes on Yonge St., Bloor St., and University Ave. at the taxpayer's expense is particularly shocking. In this instance, the Premier appears willing to spend public funds in an effort to reduce safety and remove infrastructure which is actively preventing accidents. Increases in injuries or deaths along these corridors following the removal of bike lanes will have been facilitated by the provincial government, and made possible by taxpayer dollars. As a provincial taxpayer, road user, and licenced engineer, I feel it is imperative to voice my opposition to this bill, and to the Premier's proposed actions.\nI urge Professional Engineers Ontario to take a strong stance on this matter and engage with government officials to ensure that any legislation enacted does not needlessly undermine the safety of Ontario's road users. To maintain the integrity of our profession, we must advocate for policies that prioritize public safety over speed and convenience.\"\nAs exemplified by the above letter, I am more concerned with the safety of road users in Ontario than I am about the speed and convenience of motorists. As an engineer, it is my duty to speak out for public safety, particularly when it is so egregiously contravened. I do not expect the Premier or the Transportation Minister to be held to that same standard, though I am profoundly disappointed in their lack of care for public safety. As elected officials, one would think they would be concerned with the physical safety and well-being of their constituents.\nEvidently, they are not.\nI am also dissatisfied at the haste with which the Premier and Transport Minister have opted to remove installed lanes. One would think that issues such as underfunded health care, housing affordability, homelessness, child care affordability, and the cost of living would be higher up on their list. But apparently, that is not the case. Instead, the Premier has chosen to kick off the fall legislative assembly by going after vulnerable road users. Not only is this disappointing - it's head-scratchingly asinine, given that the reasons put forward for this bill, and the solutions proposed, hold as much water as a threadbare fishing net.\nUsing taxpayer dollars to remove already-installed bike lanes is laughable, particularly coming from the so-called party of fiscal responsibility. Not only that, it's undemocratic: it was local councilors who approved those lanes at the request of the voters who elected them. Now, Queen's Park wants to meddle in municipal politics (again) to appease outlying motorists whose only concern for local streets is how fast they can speed through them. These are not the actions of a party concerned with the safety and well-being of their constituents - this is bald-faced electioneering, plain and simple.\nSupposing the provincial government does remove the lanes, where do they think cyclists will go? Demand has already been established as exemplified by Bike Share Toronto's estimates of 4.7 million trips taken at the time of writing (September 2024) - a roughly 8.5x increase from 2015's trips. Note that this number does not include trips taken with personally-owned bikes - just those taken via BST.\nRemoving the bike lanes will simply spit all those trips out onto the car lane. On four-lane streets with car parking on the rightmost lanes (as is the case on many major thoroughfares in Toronto), cyclists will end up taking the left lane for their safety so as to avoid winning the door prize. As per the Highway Traffic Act, motorists must leave 1 meter between their vehicle and the bicycle's left-most extremity in order to pass safely - something most modern vehicles cannot do due to their ever-expanding width. Thus, in attempting to appease suburban voters, Bill 212 and the associated removal of installed bike lanes will inevitably result in further congestion, lowered safety standards for vulnerable road users, and frustrated motorists.\nOh, and the slight inconvenience of dead cyclists' bodies hindering the flow of traffic.\nIt does not require an engineering degree to see that Bill 212 is flawed, callous, and ineffective in its supposed goal of improving traffic flow. It will do just the opposite; increase congestion by mixing incompatible transport modes, cost tax payers more money, increase road deaths, and introduce unnecessary red-tape to infrastructure planning.\nFunny, I recall a certain Premier promising they would cut red tape, and now they are laying it on by the roll.\n"

        "comment": "The only thing that reduces gridlock is less cars on the road. Removing dedicated cycling lanes will only cause cyclists to bike in regular car lanes. This causes cars to be overly cautious and slow down their driving and attempt to merge into a different lane to avoid cyclists. This is a huge disregard to the safety of the citizens of Ontario. Or cyclists may choose to drive cars again because they feel it is unsafe to cycle in car lanes. This causes even more cars causing more gridlock.\nAs well, trying to rush to build a highway by being exempt from environmental assessments will irreversibly destroy the land it is being built upon. It is also very short-sighted because it is still a means for cars to travel on when gridlock is reduced when there are less cars. If highways are your priority, then you should focus on buying out of the contract that the 407 is under. If it costs billions, then do so, especially if you are able to spend billions to bring alcohol to convenient stores a year earlier than expected.\nThere are many other obvious and easier solutions that can soothe the issue. For example, not requiring public servants to go into office so frequently when it is clearly not necessary and it is proven that productivity when working from home is actually increased. This will reduce gridlock. Pour funds into public transit to increase frequency to stops at stations and add more stops in other areas. This will encourage people to use these methods more which will reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I am submitting this comment as a transportation engineer who works every day to build infrastructure for all modes of travel. I am not deterred by the spirit of the bill but there are specific details that need to be addressed or it will impair our ability to support cyclists anywhere in the transportation networks.\nPremier Ford claims that his intent is to encourage bike routes to be installed on side streets rather than main streets. However, as currently written, this act would also prevent the installation of bike routes along side streets, and would enable the Province to cancel any qualifying cycling project without justification.\nTo enable quiet street bicycle routes to be implemented without creating an unreasonable burden on Ontario Taxpayers, the act should be adjusted such that review is only required on roadways with more than 5000 cars per day.\nTo ensure that cycling projects are only cancelled if the Province has actually reviewed the information provided by municipalities, the act should be amended to provide a maximum response time following the receipt of documents from a municipality. If the Province fails to provide a response within that timeframe, the municipality may consider the project to be approved.\nThank you.\n"

The environmental assessment act exists to protect Ontarians and the natural environments we rely on to survive. The inclusion of a blanket exemption for the Highway 413 Project goes against this notion of doing good for Ontarians, particularly given that Highway 413 is expected to be developed through ecologically sensitive environments which house species at risk. Making this development project exempt from the environmental assessment act seems nonsensical and harmful to the people of Ontario.\n"

It will only make things more dangerous for those who bike, and force them to share the roads with cars which will slow down traffic even further.\nAlso, removing bike lanes that already exist is a complete waste of time and money. Make-work projects such as removing already existing bike lanes, takes away resources that could be spent resolving actual problems that could improve traffic flow. Some examples include fixing the roads riddled with potholes that slow everyone down, damage vehicles, and cause accidents; better public transportation, or improved driver's education.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this legislation is terrible on multiple levels. First, it represents an absurd overreach of provincial power\u2014why is the province wasting time and resources micromanaging municipalities? Second, removing existing bike lanes is just a foolish waste of money.\nIf we want to reduce gridlock, we need to focus on decreasing the number of people in cars. That's the only effective solution, supported by endless data. Adding new lanes or spending billions on tunnels won't solve the problem. Instead, we should:\na) Divert growth away from high-density areas; people shouldn\u2019t be moving through Toronto unless their destination is there.\nb) Provide effective alternative transportation options, like robust public transit and bike lanes, so people have choices beyond driving.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed-use neighborhoods, enabling people to live close to where they work and access shops and services without needing a car.\nIgnoring these evidence-based solutions just because the Premier has a personal issue with bike lanes will only worsen gridlock. Our time and taxpayer money would be better spent on real responsibilities like healthcare and education, rather than micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to act like the mayor of Toronto, he should resign and run for that position, leaving the role of Premier to someone more qualified.\n"

By facilitating politicized backsliding into a car-centered approach to infrastructure development, this bill would not only impede the government's climate targets, but do the exact opposite of what it claims by actually worsening congestion.\nThe only way to combat car traffic is to improve alternative, much more efficient methods of transportation. This is a known fact in the field of urban planning, with hundreds of international examples to back it up. This bill is a short-term populist superficial action that would have disastrous effects in the long-term. I sincerely hope that our provincial lawmakers will not compromise our future by caving to Doug Ford's government in adapting this harmful bill.\n"
