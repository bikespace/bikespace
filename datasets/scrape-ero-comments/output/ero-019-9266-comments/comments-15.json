If Ford wanted to decongest traffic, he would invest in public transit and build *more* bike lanes in order to get Torontonians off the road's he's so concerned about.\nThe idea that our tax dollars would go towards reviewing bike lanes instead of investing in healthcare (which is in crisis thanks to this government!) or housing (again, crisis) is a farce!\n"

        "comment": "This is an undemocratic overstep into municipal affairs. The people of Toronto have elected a mayor with a mandate to prioritize active transportation and transit - this is what the people want.\nThe issue of bike lanes and traffic has been studied to death all around the world, including here in Toronto. Evidence overwhelmingly suggests bike lanes are a positive impact in reducing traffic - it provides an alternate choice, and clearly separates users in different lanes. Removing bike lanes means cyclists will take over vehicular lanes. This Ontario act will result in injuries and deaths all for the sake of your governments subjective and emotional opinion regarding traffic. Do people's lives not matter? Do you no longer listen to facts? Does municipal-provincial scope boundaries not matter?\nScrap this. Stick to provincial issues, stay out of the way of municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my support for the proposed legislation to reduce bike lanes on main thoroughfares like Bloor Street.\nFirstly, I believe that bike lanes are better suited to secondary roads rather than primary arteries. Main streets like Bloor Street are crucial for vehicular traffic flow, and dedicating lanes to bicycles can exacerbate congestion and delays for drivers and public transit users alike.\nSecondly, the presence of bike lanes on major roads can impede emergency vehicle access. In situations where every second counts, unobstructed main routes are essential for first responders to reach those in need promptly.\nThirdly, bike lanes are significantly underutilized during the Canadian winter. Harsh weather conditions make cycling less practical, leading to wasted space that could be better allocated to improve traffic flow or winter road maintenance.\nLastly, the temporary bike lanes often lack aesthetic appeal and can detract from the visual character of our city streets. Investing in well-planned, permanent infrastructure on secondary roads would be more beneficial.\nAs an avid cyclist who commutes to work almost daily (except during the winter months) I believe that reallocating bike lanes to secondary roads will create safer and more efficient pathways for cyclists while maintaining the functionality of our main thoroughfares for all users.\n"

The city of Toronto, and first responders have confirmed that emergency response times have actually improved with the installation of bike lanes.\nDo not implement this framework.\nIt is dangerous,  expensive, irresponsible and is a troubling overreach of the province into the affairs of municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to voice my disappointment with the proposed Bill 212. It is a blatant example of confirmation bias (that bike lanes cause traffic), and disagrees with all research on root cause & solutions for congestion in cities.\nIt is widely accepted within the transportation engineering community that addition of lanes designed for cars does not decrease traffic congestion, but rather increases congestion in the long term as more people elect to drive as their primary option.\nReducing opportunities for an improved cycling network with our cities is a short-sited approach that may negligibly decrease car traffic for a year or two, before making it much worse. Conversely, improving the cycling network has potential to decrease congestion as more people elect to cycle as a primary mode of transportation.\nMajor streets that are congested see high traffic volumes because they are the most efficient route for drivers. This is no different for cyclists. Cycling as an alternative to driving needs to be efficient to be viable. By eliminating cycle lanes on major streets the province is making cycling a less attractive option - and will subsequently promote driving, more congestion.\nI hope that the province considers the overwhelming scientific evidence, the climate, and the safety of its people, before enacting a bill that is not supported by fact.\n"

More bike lanes make sense, improve the safe use of city roads by me and my kids, reduce traffic, and reduce emissions.

        "comment": "Dear members,\nI oppose Bill 212 as it fails to adequately address the needs of our communities and the importance of inclusive transportation options. While promoting active transportation is vital for reducing congestion and improving public health, the bill lacks comprehensive planning and investment in safe infrastructure.\nResearch shows that increased investment in active transportation leads to significant health benefits. A study published in Preventive Medicine found that communities with well-designed biking and walking infrastructure saw a marked decrease in obesity rates and related health issues. Additionally, the Journal of Transport & Health reports that active transportation can reduce air pollution and improve mental health outcomes.\nMoreover, studies indicate that enhancing active transportation options can significantly reduce gridlock. For instance, a report from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy found that cities that invested in bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure experienced a measurable decrease in traffic congestion. Another study in Transport Policy demonstrated that integrating cycling and walking into public transit systems can reduce overall vehicle trips, leading to less congestion on roads.\nHowever, without dedicated bike lanes, pedestrian pathways, and proper funding for public transit, we risk sidelining vulnerable populations who rely on these modes of transportation. Instead of merely promoting active transport, we need a holistic approach that ensures accessibility, safety, and equity for all residents.\nI urge lawmakers to reconsider the bill and prioritize a truly integrated transportation strategy that supports all members of our community.\nThank you.\nA Torontonian\n"

        "comment": "I am resident who commutes to the Financial District for work, and I want to stress the importance of bike lanes. I've been a regular user of Bloor, as well as College, Richmond, and Adelaide, for years. I have seen how the increase in bike lanes has led to an increase in usage\u2014particularly with the Toronto Bike Share network. I recently went back to law school, and would have loved to bike from downtown to York University campus\u2014however, there was no safe north-south route across the city for me to do so.\nI would recommend examining the growth of the Toronto Bike Share network in recent years, and consider the number of trips taken there alone. Growth in these trips has been increasing significantly in the past few years, particularly in the downtown core, and it is worth studying if this is due to the growth of the bike lane network.\nI would also like to add that each of these trips means one less person taking our already disastrously crowded TTC network, or one less car or Uber occupancy. The population of Toronto will continue to increase, and we are not going to build any more roads. When thinking about how we can move people across the city, we need to consider how to make more trips with less reliance on cars, or gridlock will only get worse\u2014and will be especially frustrating for the people who have no choice but to use their cars.\nI acknowledge that there are fewer trips on bikes during the winter\u2014but they don't entirely disappear. It may be worth looking at a seasonal system to grow on a core all-year cycling network artery: there may be sports where it is possible to add a lane back during December-March, and other sections where additional bike lanes (or spaces for pedestrians) are added during the summer.\n"

Our leaders should be encouraging us to shift away from resource-intensive transportation like person vehicles, and move towards more sustainable options such as public transportation, walking, bikes, and e-bikes.\nThese alternatives to personal vehicles not only support our emissions reductions goals, they are more active forms of transportation. Supporting active transportation = supporting the health of Ontarians.\nFinally, cycling is free. Cost of living increases are hurting the people of Ontario. We need ways to cycle safely as an affordable alternative to personal vehicles.\n"

I've been waiting 30 years for sensible, safe, and data-backed solutions for mass transit infrastructure. Bike lanes are an integral part of that solution, along with investment in public transit.\nWe have already reached critical mass for cars in Toronto, as well as a number of other cities in the Province. Bike lanes are proven to drive biking demand over time, which decreases congestion and emissions, while also fostering economic growth for small businesses in those areas. Additionally, these lanes SAVE LIVES.\nAside from being a horrible policy decision, this legislation also represents a gross over reach by the provincial government into areas of responsibility reserved exclusively for municipalities.\nDoug, if you want to remove Bike lanes from Etobicoke, run for Mayor. Otherwise, focus on investing in healthcare, education, and other PROVINCIAL responsibilities.\nSincerely,\nThe next generation of Ontarians\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential for reducing traffic congestion, especially in densely populated cities like Toronto. Adding more car lanes may seem like a solution to gridlock, but it actually encourages more driving, worsening traffic and pollution over time. Accidents are one of the most likely causes of death for all people and the highest for young people. This legislature will only worsen that.\nBike lanes offer an alternative, sustainable mode of transport that can help alleviate car dependency, free up road space, and promote healthier lifestyles. They are not just about making room for cyclists but also about creating a more efficient, multi-modal transportation system. Prioritizing bike lanes means reducing the number of cars on the road, ultimately leading to less traffic and a more livable city for everyone.\n"
