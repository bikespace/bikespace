        "comment": "We need more bike lanes!!!! As a young student with a disability in Toronto, transit has become a place of anxiety for me. The TTC is often WAY too packed making it feel like a can of sardines, running late and not safe. Taking Ubers or Lyfts are much too expensive but i am forced to take them out of no choice (subway closures etc) or it is too unsafe.\nBecause of this I have recently taken up cycling. It is reliable and inexpensive. However, the lack of bike lanes already in the city stops me from going many places. I am only comfortable travelling on streets with proper lanes for riders and that is not many. We are forced to put our lives and even the lives of drivers at risk to get around the city.\nBikes are the BEST WAY TO REDUCE GRIDLOCK. We do not need much room for parking, and when we do, that parking is a whole lot cheaper than cars. Our vehicles (bikes) do not damage the roads like cars do -saving you money.\nBikes are the solution for the congestion that is Toronto. Moreover, bikes are the solution for the population that are vulnerable to the dents of our city. People using public and self transportation feel the effect of your decisions the most. Put this one in our favour\n"

        "comment": "Please stop playing wedge politics with this issue, and stop pretending that bike lanes cause more traffic--they demonstrably do not. If you care about people getting places on time (by car, bus, or bike), you should be encouraging MORE bike lanes, since bikes are far more space-efficient than cars and reduce traffic. This legislation is misleadingly titled and it pits people against each other to the detriment of all commuters. Plus, it is an overreach on municipalities--as if the province has any idea what works for downtown cores.\n"

I am a registered nurse at TGH and riding my bike is an essential part of maintaining my physical and emotional wellness. Many people in this city have found riding their bikes as the healthier transit option, and having bicycle infrastructure is a crucial part to that being true. The construction and maintenance of safe, multiuse infrastructure encourages more people to cycle which builds a healthier and happier society, and reduces the number of cars on the road. The promotion of alternative modes of transportation is the one sure way of reducing cars, creating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians, and improving air quality for all.\n"

Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lanes is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be going THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "DO NOT REMOVE THE BIKE LANES!!!\nThe recent news that Doug Ford is going to remove our city bike lanes is an absolute joke. Bike lines are NOT the reason for the ridiculous congestion in this city. Shitty infrastructure, lack of subway or other public transport options and WAY too many people / cars on the road is. Not to mention the never ending, painfully slow construction everywhere you go. Not only is biking the fastest way to get around in this city, it\u2019s good for local business, improves safety, provides environmental benefits, and gets more cars off the road. Less cars = less congestion. Any suggestion otherwise is an absolute farce and what Ford is doing is completely transparent. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about Torontonians or Toronto.\nWe are sick of tired of Doug Ford taking out his hatred of this city on the people who live in it. I\u2019ve lived in Toronto\u2019s east end all my life, 35 years, and it is embarrassing what it\u2019s turned into. Overcrowding, inflation, homelessness, violence, lack of leadership or any sort of political cohesiveness, you name it. What our city needs is better healthcare, more housing and cheaper groceries, not wasting taxpayer dollars on removing NEWLY BUILT bike lanes that so many are in support of. The thought of gutting bike lanes that we\u2019ve just spent millions of dollars on makes me want to leave and never come back. Why should I continue to pay taxes to a city that does not care about my well being?\nWork together, be better, DO SOMETHING. We\u2019ve put up with enough of this shit for far too long and we deserve more. We are disappointed and we are angry, and that\u2019s putting it mildly. Enough is enough!!!\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI wanted to take time out and express my displeasure at the proposal of removing the bike lanes from streets.\nI think it is regressive and frankly speaking a stupid move to remove the bike lanes which are already installed.\nWith so many incidents of cyclist being killed due to being hit by cars it is imperative that we keep the bike lanes on and allow people the ability to commute to work on alternative sources of travel other than cars. With the government heavily working on climate change it is imperative that the local municipalities support them.\nRemoving bike lanes will force the cyclist to drive along with cars which posses a greater risk to them. Which inturn will also cause more congestion and delays. Imagine multiple cars being stuck behind a single cyclist who is incapable of riding consistently at 30-40 km/hr.\nHow will that ever reduce traffic or congestion ?\nEvery cyclist on the road is one vehicle less which will benefit the environment and in turn decongest the city of traffic. Imagine if all cyclist also commute with cars instead. That is just increasing congestion on road and polluting the environment as well.\nAll the European countries are encouraging cycling and multiple places prohibit cars. I am not advocating for that but in the interest of environment and safety of people the bike lanes must stay on.\nThank you.\n"

Stay in your lane.\nI don't know how it's hard for people to understand that bike lanes DON'T cause traffic.\nWhat causes traffic is cars. It's all the people sitting idly cause they're too fat to bike. It's the 905ers clogging up the highways and streets because there's no other way to commute. It's the population boom in a city where the infrastructure didn't keep up with the growth. It's the grossly underfunded and shitty transit system. It's the street parking taking up space for no reason.\nWhat do you think is going to happen when you remove bike lanes? All the cyclists need to get places some how. They won't just disappear. They'll get in their cars and increase the size of traffic.\nYou guys are clowns.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes seems like a colossal waste of tax payers money, and would be better served being used to either improve transit further, or encouraging taking cars off the road via other means.\nThe ultimate driver of traffic is the need to drive absolutely everywhere, and if we reduce that we can have noticeable reductions of traffic.\nThe most immediate reduction in traffic we can have is by providing incentives for wfh instead of forcing people back into offices. For every worker we can keep off roads, that is another vehicle not stuck in traffic. Covid showed us what a reduction of vehicles ultimately means for our roads.\nBikelanes provide alternative means of travel, and if we remove them, we just put the cyclists on the roads themselves, which move slower than any car, which would just make traffic worse. Ever have to share a lane with a cyclist in traffic?\nby keeping bikes separate, we keep roads moving.\nBesides, bike lanes etc will do nothing for our highways which will continue to be clogged no matter how many lanes we add.\nBike lanes should first and foremost be a municipal matter and I do not want our provinical tax dollars going into removing them.\nPerhaps ultimately are largest issue in this province is car centric development, and we're not focusing enough on peoples ability to get by without a car. Perhaps if the jobs weren't so over concentrated in business districts with downtown and affordability wasn't such an issue, people wouldn't need to drive absolutely everywhere to get by.\nTraffic congestion is well studied, but we dont ever seem to listen to the experts and we keep trying the same thing we've been doing for 50+ years. Maybe the solution isn't more expensive roads, but offering alternatives that could be more cost efficient long term. How much money do we poor into keep our roads in good shape every year?\n"

        "comment": "This piece of legislation will do the opposite of the intentions it has. Cyclists, who are already extremely vulnerable on the road, will have less safe spaces to travel. Also, wouldn\u2019t less cars reduce gridlock? Seems like giving them more lanes will allow more cars on the road, increasing gridlock. Several real life examples of this exist (mega highways in Texas, any major city).\nI\u2019d personally rather see the energy you invest in this legislation focused on something that will actually reduce gridlock, like public transit.\n"
