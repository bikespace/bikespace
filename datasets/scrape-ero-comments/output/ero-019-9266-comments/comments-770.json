        "comment": "I oppose removing the bike lanes for the following reasons:\n1. The bike lanes have improved my beighbourhood. I live in Bloor West Village in Toronto. Since the bike lanes were installed, I have dined on the patio of various restaurants many times, something I never did before the bike lanes were installed. The bike lanes make the street feel less like a highway and much more pleasant to spend time along.\n2. The bike lanes have made the street safer and quieter. Prior to the bike lanes, cars routinely sped along Bloor street, which was not only unsafe, but also loud and obnoxious. Since the bike lanes were put in, the street feels much more safe and consistent with a neighbourhood feel.\n3. The bike lanes have reduced our car use and improved mobility. I have used the bike lanes to get downtown, and our daughter is now able to ride her bike to High Park or the Humber River, something we never would have done in the past. We walk and bike more and use our car less.\n4. New condos with younger residents will need bike lanes (and good transit) to get around. Expecting to absorb more cars will only lead to more traffic.\n5. The Province should respect local democracy and let city council decide on the best place for bike lanes. The Province  should not undermine local democracy.\nUltimately, I am in strong support of leaving the bike lanes alone and out of the jurisdiction of the Province.\n"

        "comment": "Why is this bill actually happening? This country needs FEWER incentives for people to drive individual vehicles.\nFact-based evidence clearly shows that reducing/denying bike lanes doesn\u2019t improve gridlock, all over North America. More roads for cars equals expensive maintenance, and minimal extra space for vehicles anyways, effectively doing nothing to reduce gridlock and eating more of taxpayers\u2019 dollars. What research has actually been done about this?\nDo we not want our cyclists to be safe? Do we not want to incentivize a non-polluting mode of transportation? Why are municipalities (the ones who ACTUALLY know their constituents\u2019 needs) not allowed to decide if they need bike lanes or not?\nThe money used to fund MPPs and their debates on this bill, as well as research consultants, public servants, and construction workers should have been used to subsidize new public transit options or improve existing ones; expand GO service to London, Kitchener, Barrie, and beyond, or install LRT options in small cities surrounding the GTA. If not public transit, this money could be used to improve the healthcare system that is in shambles. Anything that actually serves the province.\nThis bill WREAKS of ulterior motive and being out of touch with voters\u2019 needs, and makes me disappointed to have EVER voted PC. What an absolute waste of time and resources to be pulling power away from municipalities for this.\nI have chosen not to add links to the research/papers I have referred to on this one- this is YOUR JOB AS THE PROVINCE TO BE DOING YOUR OWN RESEARCH.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support removal of bike lanes or the prioritization of additional car infrastructure over alternative transportation methods such as bikes or transit. Car and truck infrastructure is undoubtedly critical for transportation and economic activity within Ontario but there has historically been an over reliance which must be gradually moved away from if we want long term, sustainable solutions that support further growth of economic activity and reduction of traffic.\nThis bill is moving in the wrong direction and promises to waste money while making the long term situation worse. It also over steps bounds on property rights and on the self determination of local municipality populations to decide what infrastructure they want to build.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. While the goal of improving transportation infrastructure is commendable, I have serious concerns about the implications this bill has on property rights and the judicial process, particularly regarding expropriation.\nThe bill proposes amendments that would remove essential procedural safeguards in the expropriation process for designated projects. Specifically, Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 aim to expedite expropriations by eliminating hearings of necessity and adjusting possession dates, effectively sidelining property owners' rights to fair consultation and compensation.\nIt is deeply troubling that a government, over which since the Greenbelt debacle an odour of corruption floats, is positioning itself to bypass judicial scrutiny in matters of expropriation. The controversies surrounding the Greenbelt have already eroded public trust, raising questions about transparency and accountability in land development decisions. In such a context, granting the government greater powers to expropriate land without adequate oversight is not only inappropriate but also poses a risk to the principles of democracy and justice.\nExpropriation is a profound exercise of power that must be balanced with the rights of individuals and communities. The judicial process serves as a critical check to ensure that expropriations are conducted fairly, justly, and for the genuine public good. Removing or weakening these safeguards undermines property rights and could lead to abuse of power.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions within Bill 212 that diminish the role of judicial oversight in expropriation processes. It is imperative that any efforts to improve infrastructure do not come at the expense of fundamental rights and democratic principles.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I hope that you will act to ensure that the rights of Ontarians are protected.\n"

Cycle lanes make a huge difference in my ability to safely navigate the city, and lack of cycling infrastructure costs lives.\nIt is inappropriate for the provincial government to interfere in municipal details, particularly when it's being done as cynical virtue signalling to shore up their political base.\nI'm sure the Premier and Transportation minister are well aware that adding lanes to roads does not lessen traffic, it simply incentivizes more people to drive. We should be promoting active transportation and transit, as these are the only proven solutions to traffic.\nThis bill will make our streets less safe for cyclists and pedestrians, cost Ontario tax payers millions, and will not achieve its stated aims.\nIf the Premier wants to make political statements, he should not do so at the cost of Ontarians tax dollars, and certainly not at the cost of Torontonians' health and lives.\n"

A few years back I never used to bike around the city as I felt it was dangerous to be on the streets with city drivers and bike lanes were few and far between to be convenient. After more bike lanes started popping up around the city I felt it was safe to start biking. Now my commute time is cut so significantly that I joke with my friends that biking is comparable to teleporting. I wouldn\u2019t have started biking or had the confidence to continue it weren\u2019t for the lanes.\n"

        "comment": "(1) Having biked in Toronto for the last 35 years, I have seen the new bike lanes as a welcoming addition.  I have seen far too many cyclists being hit by cars over the years - we cannot safely share the road with bikes, and we cannot use sidewalks as that endangers pedestrians.  For far too long, cyclists have been treated as having no right to the roads in Toronto.\n(2) In the last couple of years, there has also been a surge of delivery motorized bikes that also are using the bike lanes - if the city was to remove the existing bike lanes, where would the large number these speeding delivery people be going?  They are fast for regular cyclists, but slow compared to cars.\n(3) If you cannot get through traffic while travelling in the city's core, tough luck, leave your car at home and use public transportation!  Most of the city's transportation infrastructure has been dedicated to cars.  Some of us who cycle do not have the budget to own a car or even use public transport.\n(4) We need more bike lanes, not less!\n"

        "comment": "I fully support the proposed legislation.\nBicycle lanes have, and will continue to have, an important role in the transportation mix of the City.\nHowever, they must be installed in places and in ways that make common sense. In other words, given that bike lanes materially increase automobile congestion and commute times, impose material psychological and economic costs, they should only be installed where:  (a) they are not likely to impede emergency vehicles;  (b)  they are not likely to cause material irreparable harm to small businesses;  (c) there is convenient alternative public transportation; and, most importantly (d) there is strong bicycle use currently and even stronger future demand (so that the legitimate safety interests of an extremely small minority do not impose unacceptably high costs upon the vast majority).\nIn the case of the bike lanes along Bloor Street in Etobicoke, it is only necessary to consider biking demand. I drive along Bloor Street every morning and evening, and for much of that ride there is a virtual absence of cyclists. Moreover, the bike lanes have been in place for over a year, and I don't see any material increase in the number of cyclists (as few as they are).\nThe decision to install bike lanes along Bloor Street in Etobicoke was not based on objective evidence or community consultation. More importantly, they have not produced any noticeable increase in bicycle use. It makes no sense to maintain them for now.\nFor this reason, it is completely appropriate, and much appreciated, for the provincial government to step in with this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes in Toronto need to be done better.  What exists now is very bad for everyone, even the bikers.  There is no way to make biking perfectly safe on major routes.  Bike lanes should be on secondary roads, like Harbord, where they work okay.  Bike lanes should not be a way of controlling the speed of traffic.  Bike lanes on Bloor make parking very dangerous on Bloor, where you have to open your door right into traffic.\nThe provincial government is doing the right thing.  Stop putting in bike lanes where they are not used, and clog traffic.  If possible, remove bike lanes from Bloor Yonge and University.\nThe city is just lying about the cost.  The cost is just for salaries that are already being paid.  That money is spent one way or another.  And it's stupid to say that taking the lanes out will cost more than putting them in.  They had to buy all that stuff in the first place, so obviously the installing costs would be higher than the removal costs.  And they won't have to pay upkeep.\nGood work, provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I am not an eloquent writer but I have to comment on this mess of a bill. I do not agree with any of the proposed sections. The most bothersome is that highway 413 (another completely ridiculous thing this government is gifting us) would be exempt from environmental impact assessments. I understand that they are expensive and add to a timeline but for something as large as building a highway, this should not be skipped. Our undeveloped land is precious and finite. It is not a pot of gold for developers. There are other ways to move people around. Perhaps investing in public transit? We need to think long term. A highway is proven to not reduce traffic.\nThe other big issue is taking out bike lanes. Removing bike lanes will put bikes back in the active traffic lanes. How does that reduce traffic? And for Toronto, requiring them to help pay for the removal of the lanes is asinine. The city wants to keep them. Why does this government insist on meddling in city (specifically Toronto) matters? People want healthcare. Use that money that was to pay for bike lanes to add more family doctors, pay nurses more.\nThis bill is full of waste and should not go through but sadly I know that it will.\n"

        "comment": "I live 2 blocks south of Bloor near Montgomery.  The bike lane changes have been poorly implemented, created many safety issues and from my daily visits to Bloor street there is limited usage of these lanes despite the significant disruption they have caused. Even on beautiful days it is rare to see more than a bike or two making use of the lanes.\nI have personally witnessed many situations where ambulances and fire trucks need come to a full stop as there is no where for cars to pull over and the traffic is very heavy due to their being only one lane. This was not the case before the bike lanes.\nI have felt unsafe parking in the Royal York and Bloor area and in Bloor west village due to how close to the moving car lanes the parking is located. When you open your door you are basically stepping into traffic. I know many people who now avoid the shops on Bloor because of this dangerous situation. I attend a foot clinic on Bloor (Bioped) and when i had surgery on my foot I was unable to park outside of the office because of the bike lanes. Many people with disabilities are being challenged getting into medical offices due to the bike lanes.\nI was taking my granddaughter to a program at the Runnymede library and have needed to stop attending due to the heavy traffic crossing the  Humber bridge and approaching South Kingsway. What should be a 10 minute trip for us has turned into a 30 minute drive. This happens each and every week so has become the norm not the exception. Seems a shame that for poorly used bike lanes we are limited in the programs we now can attend.\nThe traffic congestion on Bloor is like never before and according to many of the small businesses along Bloor has significantly impacted their bottom line and viability.\nThe local councillor has not been receptive to any feedback from local residents, simply responding \"change is hard.\" Based on this response I believe it is essential for the Province to wade into this critical and unsafe situation. I believe our local representative and the Mayor lack any objectivity on this important subject as they themselves appear to be bike lane advocates. This action by the Province would not be necessary if city representatives were in any way receptive to feedback and the use of common sense.\nAlso, if safety is the issue i finding it interesting that it is rare to see any bikers on Bloor street wearing helmets.\n"

        "comment": "About time, a provincial government who has seen and experienced the gridlock as a result of these bike lanes and is listening to the people. They are useless, very expensive where the money spent on them could be placed elsewhere. There are more cars on the road than bicycles, plus how many cyclists are out driving in the winter compared to cars???  The emergency vehicles cannot get through when both lanes are full of cars, no where to pull over for them. Seconds count in those situations. The city certainly did not think or even investigate for that matter the chaos that these bike lanes have caused in emergency situations as well as day to day traffic.\nHow about the businesses who are losing money as no one wants to go up to Bloor Street. I\u2019ve seen a handful of cyclists on Bloor Street and that\u2019s on a good day. There are far more cars stuck in traffic because of the lane reductions, but yet no cyclists can be found. This certainly does not warrant spending taxpayers money on useless bike lanes. Plus Parkside Drive is also a main thoroughfare to the lakeshore/Gardner, absolutely no bike lanes should be put on that street.\nThe city certainly did not think any of this through. It\u2019s bad enough these cyclists have taken over High Park, which is another joke.\nI agree 100% with Doug Ford\u2019s legislation on the lanes. At least he thinks about the outcome. Get rid of them.\n"

        "comment": "As an avid cyclist that cycles over 10,000 km annually for the past 15 years, most of these within the GTA area, I have a strong desire to achieve safe cycling outcomes while respecting the needs of motorists.  I reside at St Clair and Yonge, and the increase in road traffic congestion over the past 4 years, due to the installation of bike lanes and roadside dining by restaurant patrons, has been undesirable and unnecessary.   Alternate cycling paths exist and need to be promoted, instead on taking away lanes or major through-fares.  For example, Russell Hill Road and Poplar Plain Road, Bayview extension, Spadina, and many other roads have adequate bike lanes.  Not every road needs a bike lane.  Nor should any of the bike lanes include the installation of physical barriers.  These barriers become road hazards, for both cyclist and motorists. The road barriers are expensive to install and maintain, with dubious benefit.  A clearly demarcated bike path along the curb is sufficient.  Cycling is clearly not for everyone, as some do not feel safe in close proximity to cars.  These cyclists should take training courses or find \u201csafer\u201d modes of transport.  To ask every road user to put up with unreasonable traffic delays to address the needs of less capable cyclists is grossly unfair.  Not should the citizens tax dollars be spent on this over the top infrastructure.  Please remove all unnecessary bike lanes and associated road hazards, while guiding bike road users to safe bike lanes along side streets or wide roads with sufficient space.  Thank you.\n"
