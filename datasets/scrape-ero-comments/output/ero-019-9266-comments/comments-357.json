        "comment": "As someone who commutes equally by car and bicycle during the warmer months and by car only during the colder ones, I highly value the existing bike lanes in Toronto where I live, and in Mississauga where I work. Years ago, I lamented how far behind our cities are compared to many other cities in the world. Since then, Toronto has done a commendable job at expanding our bike lane network.\nI've noticed with time more and more people commuting by bicycle along these routes. And while I do see a lot more traffic on the express ways in and around Toronto, I don't find the streets any worse regardless of the presence of bike lanes.\nI'm also very concerned about my safety when commuting by bicycle. The safety of bike lanes has improved tremendously over the years. This is my number one concern when biking and reducing the bike lanes will put me and other cyclists at far greater risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. In fact, removing bike lanes along my commute will likely push me to give up on commuting by bike and instead only drive my car.\nI really hope the Ontario government reconsiders this proposal and keeps all existing bike lanes and works with municipalities to expand their existing bike lane networks.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the proposed bill for the following reasons:\nMoney matters: taxpayer money should be respected. A bike lane built at great cost should be allowed to show that it grows ridership and reduces congestion before spending another large chunk of money to remove it.\nDemocracy matters: local decisions should be respected, not overridden, without proper consultation or  a vote.\nSafety matters: pedestrians and cyclists have just as much right to safely get to their destination as car drivers (this includes workers such as delivery cyclists for uber eats etc.). Cycle lanes greatly help safety, by ensuring cyclists are separated from cars, and pedestrians from both cars and cyclists.\nEfficiency matters: pedestrians and cyclists have just as much right to efficiently get to their destination as car drivers; there is no reason they need to take longer routes. In downtown Toronto, cycling is by far the fastest method of transport and the only one in which arrival time is predictable. That this attracts people is obvious from the success of BikeShare. Outer regions of Toronto, which are rapidly getting denser, should have the same opportunities to travel efficiently and safely.\nEnforcement matters: bad behaviour that causes accidents and congestion should be stopped. No blocking of intersections, no speeding, no double parking or parking in bike lanes or on sidewalks. More cameras, more police presence, stiffer fines, including loss of driver's license are warranted.\nInformation matters: just as people expect to operated by doctors, not by quacks, people should be able to expect to be governed by people who study what works, rather than go by their \"guts\". For instance, in my neighbourhood of downtown Toronto, businesses initially were very wary of cycle lanes, but became strong supporters as it turned out they bring (far) more clients than car lanes, now warning you that removing the bike lanes will make many go bankrupt. The lesson is to study first before making decisions. And let businesses in outer regions of Toronto prosper similarly.\nHealth matters: people should be encouraged to be active and safe, not sit in cars, becoming obese and getting diabetes and heart disease, while producing pollution that causes asthma and premature deaths in others, especially among those unfortunate enough to live next to the busiest roads.\nNow bringing up the bill, perhaps the government is simply happy to be responsible for all the above negative effects -- including for a couple of deaths from avoidable accidents -- for the sake of getting votes from people who hope for faster traffic. Unfortunately, from experiments from all around the world (my personal experience is from The Netherlands, where this all played out 50 years ago; in some respects (fortunately only some) Ontario is really a remarkably ignorant backwater), it is clear that is just a hope: congestion will remain just as bad, as cyclist turn back to using cars, and as more and more people arrive, who will have no choice but to use a car because they have no safe alternative, yet the roads cannot be made wider to accommodate them.\nIn summary, please stop this bill in its tracks and avoid making Toronto yet more congested.\n"

        "comment": "I support Bill 212.  Toronto being the city with the worst traffic in North America, the situation is getting worse by the day.   Most of the bike lanes are hardly utilized even in summer time while they tremendously slow down the traffic flow.  As an example, many road are reduced to one lane to accommodate bike lanes.  Whenever a single car waits for a turn, the whole traffic is at a standstill.  Bike lane should be on secondary roads and built based on the potential bicycle traffic instead of blandly adding them to every road.\nKen\n"

I am a car wonder and driver, as well as a cyclists, and this act won\u2019t help drivers or cyclists.\nIt is archaic and short sighted, not to mention it goes against what data says. Studies show that bike lanes and encouraging cyclists decreases traffic. We need fewer cars on the road, not more car lanes. Not to mention the climate crisis we are facing, we should be increasing investment on green infrastructure. And finally, the province needs to stay out of municipal affairs and let cities plan what\u2019s best for them, in consultation with their citizens. You\u2019re disrupting democracy for this idiotic move that will increase congestion, increase the risk to cyclists and increase cyclist injuries and fatalities, hurt the environment and make streets less pleasant and less safe for pedestrians and people who live and work along these roads.\nStop this nonsense and do not pass this act.\n"

When I visit Toronto,which I do regularly, I am glad to see people on bikes. My small town has bike lanes. We actually need to see more bike lanes on County Roads so cyclists can get around safely. In fact,  we should do what the Europeans do. Automatic jail for all automobile drivers who hit cyclists and pedestrians. Be kind to the environment! More bikes! Less cars!\n"

That will bring you up to a safety level applied in many jurisdictions outside of this province.\nYou could also put more funding into transit and rail, as well as make the \u201clast mile\u201d trip easier for many, so they are not compelled to dive a car RIGHT ABOVE A SUBWAY LINE.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government once again is making policy decisions that are not based on the evidence but on 'common sense' that is based on ideology and outdated thinking.  Further considering how the majority Ford government has regularly used the ERO comment period as a merely procedural step and not as an honest part of the process to judge whether there is public support or not, I have little faith comments will be considered meaningfully. The Ford government has publicly signalled that no evidence would sway them from their policy decision, and today we heard from the government that they are moving forward with bike lane removal regardless of public opposition, and legitimate jurisdictional concerns of the municipal government.\nNonetheless, here are the facts as found by a study by the Bloor Annex BIA on the effect of bike lanes on Bloor...the very same street that Ford says bikes are causing congestion and hurting economic outcomes.\nEVIDENCE-BASED HIGHLIGHTS: (Source \u2013 Bloor Annex BIA)\n\u2022 Monthly customer spending and number of customers in the Bloor Annex increased after bike lanes were installed\n\u2022 Retail vacancies in the Bloor Annex have not changed in eight years since bike lane installation\n\u2022 Road safety for all users has improved since the installation of bike lanes resulting in fewer fatalities and better road safety outcomes for all road users\n\u2022 No evidence of increased emergency response times due to bike lanes said chiefs of Toronto Paramedics and Toronto Fire to city\u2019s Infrastructure & Environment\n\u2022 Putting bike lanes on residential streets would have an extreme negative impact on street parking for residents\n\u2022 Bike lanes reduce congestion\nBY THE NUMBERS:\n\u2022 1 million: approximate number of cyclists who rode the Bloor Street bike lanes between Avenue Road and Shaw Street between February 2018 and February 2019\n\u2022 8,000: number of cyclists per day that Bloor Annex BIA believes currently use the Bloor bike lanes today\n\u2022 9 years: number of years that Bloor Annex bike lanes have been part of complete street renewal\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who walks, drives and uses transit, I am aware of how well our city has adjusted to the radical density increase by developing a variety of ways to move around.  And now the Provincial Government wants to disrupt this system, stating reasons that have little grounding in what is actually happening.  It's the number of vehicles on streets not designed for them, that causes slow movement in some parts of the city. Just as other large urban centres have embraced bicycle travel as one important piece of urban movement, Toronto must do the same. Please stop pretending that we are living in 1975.\n"

My family of four, including two young children ages 6 and 8 years old does not own a car. In fact we have never owned a car. We use bike lanes to get around daily. We count on these bike lanes for our safety as we navigate our daily lives with our children. It upsets me that the province is punishing the population of Ontario that does not own a car at a time when it is increasingly difficult to afford daily expenses. Let's focus on improving our public transportation system instead of removing the only form of transit that is getting anyone anywhere on time these days in the City of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m against Ontario Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. Removing bike lanes to tackle traffic is a step backward, especially in a growing city facing the challenges of climate change. Eliminating bike lanes only makes us more dependent on cars, which increases congestion, pollution, and accidents. It\u2019s a regressive move that ignores the need for safe, sustainable transit options in a city that\u2019s only going to get bigger.\nInstead of dismantling infrastructure that promotes greener and safer travel, the province should be investing in solutions that meet the needs of today and tomorrow. Supporting bike lanes and other transit options is part of building a livable, accessible city for everyone\u2014not just drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI work as a musculoskeletal radiologist at a Toronto trauma centre.\nIn my clinical duties, I see a lot of bad motor vehicle collisions. Broken bones, spines, brain bleeds, shattered organs, etc. These patients undergo a tremendous amount of suffering -- and so do their families. Their care is invariably extremely expensive. Even after getting patched up -- if they are fortunate enough to survive -- these patients frequently develop longstanding mental health issues. As a trauma surgeon once said to me, \"trauma is a psychosocial disease.\"\nWe need to get serious about preventing these injuries.\nBike lanes are a part of that.\nBy encouraging people to cycle, we gain in so many ways:\n1) A healthier population\n2) Cleaner air\n3) Reduced health care costs\n4) Fewer cars on the road\nWith protected bike lanes, parents can allow their kids to cycle around the city and know that it is safer. That peace of mind is worth something.\nMr. Ford has, very selfishly, politicized and polarized this topic. This is not cyclists versus motorists. We are all people.\nNew York City, London, and Paris are all taking steps towards better urbanism by removing cars, through a combination of pedestrian only streets, congestion charges, and bike lanes. In the interest of scoring cheap political points, Mr. Ford would have us fall behind. That isn't leadership. That is cowardice.\n"

They aren\u2019t used for about six months of the year and they aren\u2019t used that much at all during the milder temperatures to justify them.  I drive downtown everyday  and they cause so much more traffic.   The university bike lanes have increased my commute time by about 25 minutes.   Unacceptable!!  Bikes lanes must go.

        "comment": "I'm a driver who often drives around the city. I've seen the improvements in traffic that these bike lanes have caused.  Driving across bloor st used to be a parking lot. Now with the added bike lanes, there is always a simple orderly flow of traffic that moves along. I can go from Jane and dundas to bloor and Bathurst in 20 mins. That was unheard of before.  Also, since the addition of bikelanes, Kingsway south traffic is a fraction what it used to be. Traffic on Kingsway south used to span all the way down to the petro canada by Queensway. I haven't seen anywhere close to that since the addition of the lanes.\nIf we really want to reduce congestion,  maybe your efforts are better spent focusing on developers who seem to have free reign to block lanes. Bikes aren't the problem and the data shows.\n"

Cities and municipalities across Ontario should be empowered to design cycling networks that are best fit to their population, as decided by the experts in the municipality itself.\nThe (re)addition of lanes will further induce vehicle demand, leading to continued gridlock, more dangerous streets, and a worse environment. I humbly suggest the province explore a more pragmatic approach, wherein the funds are reallocation towards delivering public transit projects, reducing vehicle demand, and allowing cities to continue to build safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles alike.\n"

They make negotiating Bloor easier for vehicles, as they have removed left turns at any intersection without a designated turn lane and removed right-turns on red lights.
