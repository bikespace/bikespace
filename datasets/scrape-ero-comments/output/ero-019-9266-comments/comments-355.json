        "comment": "This is a comment on my experience as a Resident of the City of Toronto - and use all options for transport available to me(car, ttc, go train, bicycle, cabs(uber/lyft)) to get around the city and conduct my affairs.\nMy primary mode of transport is a bicycle that I use to commute to work, and have been doing so since 2016(when I started working in Toronto). I live on Main/Danforth and my office commute involved me riding a bicycle to Liberty Village for the first few years and currently my office has moved to Dundas West so I've adjusted my route accordingly. I ride around 14 kms (one-way) to get to my place of work and conduct other affairs in the city(shopping, community centres, food/cafes) after work with the bike as well. I do occasionally drive, and that usually involves me having to travel across the city over larger distances and/or have something that cannot be accomodated on a bicycle or transit.\nI've been using the Bloor/Danforth route whole time(for 8 years, except during COVID when we were WFH). Before the bike lanes were a thing on this route, I've had frequent incidents where cars would cut me off(causing near-collisions multiple times), I've had cars/trucks parked on the street, open doors without looking (again causing near-collisions or forcing me to swerve into traffic), I've had 3 incidents where I've been swept off my bike by car who \"genuinely didn't see\" me. Ever since the protected bike lanes have been established, I haven't had a single incident(since late 2022) when I started commuting to the office again.\nI understand that, traffic across the city has gotten worse over the years and I sympathize with the folks who drive. I also own a car and drive occasionally(as I mentioned before) and do not enjoy being in traffic. However, traffic congestion has always been a thing in Toronto with it getting worse every year, even before the bike lanes were put in. I've opted to commute by bicycle because I can RELIABLY get to work on time compared to TTC(multitudes of issues related to incidents) and car(issues with traffic, parking, cost), and have been making that choice for the entire time I've worked\\lived in the city.\nCurrently, my commute times are fairly same accross all three options(bike: 46 mins, car: 43 mins, transit: 45 mins - and yes, this is during rush hour). If my commute via bike gets more difficult/longer/risky, I would have to consider driving or TTC. Personally, I would chose to drive over the TTC, because if something happens on transit, I'm stuck in limbo (has happened multiple times) while the systems sorts itself out. I, as a single occupant, will add another car to the mix contributing to traffic as well - not to mention the cost of driving more(gas, insurance, parking, maintenance). Right now, because of the bike lanes, I can CHOOSE to commute via bike and I'm fairly confident that I can come back home to my family safe and not narrate incidents on how I survived the bike commute(this was a common thing before the bike lanes).\nI really hope that the proposal will take into consideration my access to equitable modes of safe transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Please remove the bike lanes, it was a terrible change, a misguided use of resources, and whoever thought of it clearly was asleep on the job.  East/west corridors downtown are scarce enough as it is even without the construction and the Ontario line, by trading in lanes for bike lanes we are cutting traffic by close to 50%, all for paths that are seldom used for 8 months of the year, so the trade off is extremely weak.  Toronto is not a major global metropolitan city with a sprawling mass transportation network, nor is it a small city with unburdened infrastructure, so we should not be attempting to mimic cities that don't have these issues.\n"

I use my bike most days that weather allows. I fear for a return to the old Toronto with cars with 1 driver filling the streets with no place to go on a bike except for a few Parks where the paths are full of walkers and no direct connection to the downtown area. How about removing street parking. 15 spot's per block just clog up the street. Can we also address the driver's coming into the city from far away. They pay taxes for the suburbs but drain the city of Torontos resources. Charge each car entering the city a daily use fee like other large cities. So many options. Please Do Not remove bike lanes.\n"

It would be (yet another) waste of tax payer money by the city to remove already constructed infrastructure. What causes gridlock in Toronto is ongoing construction and parking along major streets, whereas bikes move people through the city more than twice as fast as cars at rush hour. This proposal is completely wasteful, shortsighted, and uninformed.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out existing bike lanes is a distraction and waste of money.  Cars create congestion, bike lanes do not.  More car lanes do not alleviate car congestion, more transit and bike lanes do.  Also congestion management policies reduce congestion, like more efficient traffic signalling, and parking management.\nBike infrastructure also makes streets safer for pedestrians, as well as cyclists and drivers.\nAlso, make transit so efficient that it makes no sense to drive.  I happen to be lucky enough for that to be the case with where I live in proximity to a GO station and downtown.  Make that the same for everyone.  Etobicoke-Lakeshore could use increased investment in all transit, including GO.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is literally SO dumb. Everything out there, every single policy recommendation out there, says that the actual way of reducing traffic is by ADDING other forms of transportation, and bike lanes are one of those!!! More bike lanes mean more bike on the streets and less cars, reducing congestion and making safer cities. You are stupid if you decide to remove bike lanes, this is actually a terrible policy proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposal to decrease/remove bike lanes in the downtown core. Bike lanes don't cause traffic congestion; cars do - and there is plenty of research showing that the more car lanes and roads exist, the more cars there are using those roads. Creating more traffic lanes will simply just increase traffic.\nAs someone who lives in the downtown core of Toronto and who does own a car, I firmly believe that restructuring the city to favour car transportation is not sustainable. Encouraging the mass amounts of people who live in downtown Toronto to choose vehicular transportation over active transport such as cycling or walking, or public transportation, will inevitably lead to greater congestion.\nBeyond just the concern of traffic on the streets, demolishing bike lanes also entirely goes against the ethical priority we should have as a community towards greener transportation, taking every step we can to address global warming. Furthermore, cycling and walking are features of healthy lifestyles, which all Ontarians should strive for - something that our overburdened healthcare system would greatly benefit from.\nAnd none of this even begins to cover how great of a government overreach this action would be, as this is clearly a matter of municipal politics. As someone originally from Northeastern Ontario, I know of many, many other places that would benefit from the level of scrutiny Doug Ford has decided to focus on the few streets of Toronto surrounding Queen's Park.\nI am disgusted by this proposal which clearly goes against the desires of those living in the areas it will affect. Do better!\n"

        "comment": "I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to the changes proposed by Bill 212 regarding cycling infrastructure as they reinforce the idea that car is king within Ontario. The idea that the province can overrule municipal planning decisions is absurd and SHOULD NOT be passed. Cities around the world have found that creating safe and dedicated cycling infrastructure attracts more people to use active transportation. They are also encouraged to find alternative means of transport such as ride-sharing, public transit, cycling and walking. The space one car, with one driver, takes up on the road could be replaced by at least 4 people on bicycles providing local businesses along routes 3x more potential customers compared to a gridlocked vehicle throughfare with 1 more lane.\nProviding Ontarians with a choice in transportation options would reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reduce traffic for those, for ex persons with physical disabilities, who absolutely need to use a personal car for transportation. Reduced traffic would also reduce the noise in local residential and business districts, providing a more friendly walking environment. Personally I would like to cycle more often, however, the lack of separate/dedicated cycling infrastructure makes cycling a higher risk and more inconvenient than driving, even for short distances or where multi-modal options exist.\nOne critique of cycling lanes I often hear is that, by taking a lane away from vehicle traffic, it creates gridlock and hinders emergency vehicles from making their way through car traffic. This is easily rectified by creating wider cycling infrastructure to accommodate emergency vehicles! The Netherlands & France already does this. You see quick and efficient response times from their Emergency Services. Bikes are more easily maneuverable, making them quick to move out of the way of emergency vehicles and they can leave the bike lanes if necessary. A network of wide dedicated bike lanes across cities like Toronto and Ottawa would allow emergency vehicles to quickly bypass traffic and decrease response times drastically!\nI truly hope you take this feedback and those of many Ontarians to rework the changes in approval for planning and changing cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "RE: Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nI live in Downtown Toronto and I own a car.  I completely disagree with this proposal.\n(1) Bike lanes reduce gridlock by allowing people to safely bike in their city instead of causing more gridlock by driving.\n(2) !I think the province should stop trying to control Cities so much and leave cities to decide how to best move traffic within the City.\n(3) The province should provide more funding for public transit for within and between cities.  Public transit should be integrated.  I shouldn't be able to take multiple forms of public transit to get to any desitnation with multiple service providers.  Just provide one integrated system.  Take a look at how Switzerland does it.\n(4) The provincial government should implement more taxes for drivers to discourage driving and they should allow Cities to restrict the number of cars within a city, for example: In Zurich a car can't enter the city limits until another car leaves.  Gas taxes should also be increased.\nI should not have any reason to own a car.  I live right downtown in a walkable neighbourhood.  I can walk to Union Station.  But the reality is that it's still faster to drive between subway stations than to take the TTC -- It should be the other way around!\nIn summary, more initiatives to discourage drivers and make public transit & bicycling more enjoyable, faster and less expensive is what will reduce gridlock in our Cities.\n"

        "comment": "Dear MPPs,\nIf you remove the Bloor/Danforth bike lanes in Toronto I won't be able to reliably get to work daily. I commute via cycling for approx 9 km each way (18 km total in a day)  between home and my job on days I'm not on other streets running errands in addition to this number. There are no side street options for me to get from home to the office. Even to get to the Bloor/Danforth lanes I must go on other main roads without bike lanes.\nMy husband has had long-COVID for nearly 3 years now, so travelling on TTC isn't ideal since I'm more likely to get him sick (even though I wear a mask when I do have to travel that way). Moreover TTC is kinda sketchy these days, slow, often breaks down, etc. Commuting by car is impractical, costly, environmentally unfriendly, boring, etc. Cycling is my preferred traveling method, the fastest, most enjoyable, mentally/physically best option, most cost effective, environmentally friendly, etc. numerous positive benefits for it.\nDon't pass this legislation it will make commuting so much more unsafe for me. It will place me into more main roads with cars, which is not ideal since it is unsafe and will slow down both car and cycling traffic to make a mega gridlock mess in the city.\nPut money into improving cycling across Ontario cities and also public transportation improvements so it's more reliable!\nDon't support this bill. Vote NO to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is outrageous. Removing bike lanes will hurt businesses along these streets and will needlessly put cyclists at risk. We need more bike lanes not less. The Bloor Annex BIA has released a statement about improved sales following the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor. What further evidence is needed to support these existing bike lanes? This government alleges to support small businesses. I have yet to see any evidence that this is true.\nThe idea that these lanes can be moved to other parallel side streets is completely out of touch with reality. Are cyclists meant to mix with traffic at every point they need to make their way to their ultimate destination on the main street? Don't you think this will add to congestion as cyclists need to mix with regular traffic at every street connecting these parallel side streets to a main street without a bike lane? This will not help traffic congestion in any discernable way. Where is a traffic study by an accredited professional? How much time will it save drivers? Adding lanes does not improve congestion. How many different cities need to do this with no improvement before we start to learn from their mistakes?\nThe Province should not be able to exert authority over a municipal road. This is government overreach at the very least.\n"
