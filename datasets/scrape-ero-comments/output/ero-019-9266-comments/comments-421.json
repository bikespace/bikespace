        "comment": "I was born and raised in Brampton, and spent countless hours during childhood waiting to be picked up from places by my parents in cars, because it was too unsafe for me to bike home and they worked late. Protected bike infrastructure helps protect the independence of kids like I was, and helps offload responsibility from overworked parents like mine. Plus I feel like food delivery drivers are just gonna bike on the road anyways, since trying to do food delivery in a car in Toronto is a fool's errand. May as well make it easier and less annoying for everyone involved by keeping them separate.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver who frequently commutes downtown for work in a vehicle due to the equipment requirements, the removal of bike infrastucture would mean those commuters end up on motor vehicle infrastructure and cause additional delay especially during my work hours. I do not want bike infrastructure to be removed from Toronto and I want more mass transit options available for the people who despite being issued a license, frankly should not be operating a motor vehicle on public roads. If the government is truly concerned with reducing collisions on the motorways they would be making the roads harder to access for unskilled users. This bill will not save me time and will do the exact opposite, with the added bonus of extra stress dealing with the increase in dunces who are now forced to take a car.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the so-called \"Reducing Gridlock Saving You Time Act.\" This legislation, which includes the removal of bike lanes across the province, is deeply concerning and, in my view, misguided.\nAs someone who values efficient transportation and environmental responsibility, I am dismayed by the proposed elimination of bike lanes. Not only does this bill risk setting back progress in building safe, multi-modal infrastructure, but it also ignores the benefits bike lanes provide in alleviating congestion, improving air quality, and promoting public health. By removing these crucial pathways, the government appears to be shifting away from policies that prioritize sustainable, diverse modes of transportation.\nBike lanes reduce gridlock in ways that cars alone cannot. Every cyclist represents one less car on the road, helping to reduce congestion rather than add to it. The approach proposed in Bill 212 risks pushing more people into cars and increasing the very gridlock it purports to reduce. In an era where many cities and countries are investing in bike-friendly infrastructure as a way forward, it is disappointing to see our province proposing legislation that effectively reverses this trend.\nFurthermore, this legislation feels like an overreach that undermines local governments and communities that have invested in bike infrastructure as a means to create safer and more vibrant urban environments. Municipalities should be empowered to choose transportation options that best fit their needs, and they need the flexibility to adapt to the growing demand for safe cycling infrastructure.\nI urge you to reconsider the elements of Bill 212 that call for the removal of bike lanes and to recognize the value they bring in making our cities healthier, safer, and more accessible for all.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to seeing a government response that reflects a genuine commitment to addressing transportation challenges in a way that considers the needs of all road users.\n"

        "comment": "The government shouldn't increase red tape and bureaucracy, to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options like protected bike lanes. I use bike lanes every day to compute to work and for leisure and consider them essential infrastructure like sidewalks. We need to guarantee a baseline for safety and options for vulnerable road users of all physical ability, instead of increasing the amount of cars on the streets. When I do drive, I would much prefer cyclists to be in their own protected lanes. Bikes lanes provides public transit such as subway and street car the last mile connection for commuters from home to public transit and from transit to their final destination.\nI support safe bike infrastructures.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal. I'm a resident of Ottawa and I use bike lanes all the time for my short and medium length trips. Without them, I wouldn't feel safe enough to take my bike and scooter, and would instead be driving everywhere. I would be yet another car on the road contributing to all the traffic.\nAlso, it makes zero sense for the province to be involved with city infrastructure like this. I doubt Doug Ford has ever even visited Ottawa, so I certainly don't want him making decisions on what bike lanes get to stay or get removed. In the best case scenario, this adds an unnecessary and stupid amount of red tape to a trivial municipal function. In the worst case this removes bike lanes, increases traffic, and kills cyclists.\nIn summary, bike lanes save lives, remove bikes from roads (and out of drivers' way), and are critical to helping alleviate traffic congestion. I do not support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "To remove bike lanes and prevent new bike lanes from being built in an effort to reduce travel times, you are blatantly ignoring the facts.\nFewer cars on the road means less traffic, which means faster commute times for drivers. A reduction in car traffic would also improve air quality and make the roads safer, leading to a lightened load for healthcare, which would improve those wait times as well.\nThere is no way to improve car traffic other than providing viable alternatives to driving. You can build more lanes, but that signals to people that driving is the easiest method of transportation, thus leading to more car trips and wouldn't you know it, traffic is just as bad as it was before. Induced demand.\nGiving people proper functional bicycle infrastructure is essential to reducing congestion. Anyone can get a bike a learn how to ride it, bicycles physically take up a fraction of the space that a car does, cycling is active transportation so it improves the health of the riders (again, good for healthcare). If there were a comprehensive bicycle network that could get people where they need to go quickly and safely, more people would choose to leave the car in the driveway. I'm a delivery driver myself, but when it comes to doing personal errands, I take my bike if possible.\nWhat we need is to give people options. If someone's only real option for transportation is driving, they're going to drive. If they also had the options of cycling and public transit like buses and trains, that would get them where they need to go faster, cheaper, safer, or maybe just less stressful, they could use whatever is the best option for them.\nNot having bicycle infrastructure also alienates certain populations. Bicycles are cheap to buy and maintain, and are quite safe to ride (Cars are the biggest threat to cyclists and pedestrians and general. When cars aren't around, cycling is very safe.). Since bicycles are so cheap, it allows people who can't afford the enormous price of owning a car to still go where they need to go, whenever they need to go there. Cars are expensive enough on their own, but we also need to factor in gas, maintenance, insurance, the cost of getting a license and lessons, and even the cost of parking depending on where people live. It costs thousands of dollars every year to own a car, but I can go on Facebook Marketplace and buy a bicycle right now for $100 and start riding it today, since I learned to ride for free when I was a child.\nSpeaking of children, bike lanes also enable children, teenagers, anyone of all ages (yes, even the elderly) to ride safely and independently.\nIf you want to talk about actually putting money in people's pockets, build more bicycle infrastructure so people can choose to save thousands of dollars annually by not driving.\nAdditional benefits: Businesses see increased sales when more people are walking/ cycling, as the slower movement makes it easier for people to stop and enter the store. When driving, if you happen to see something interesting as you're driving by, which is less likely because there are more important things to focus on than the buildings you whip past, then you'd have to find parking, and if there isn't any, then you don't go into the store, and that business lost a potential sale. Cycling is also a monetary net positive for cities when everything is accounted for. Cars require more space, more space for cars is less space for homes, businesses, parks, etc. Cars are heavy and degrade road surfaces many times faster than bicycles, so roads require repairs more often than bike paths. Driving is more dangerous and leads to more serious accidents, and these accidents can injure or kill people, putting more strain on the healthcare system, businesses lose productivity from workers needing time off or never returning to work, car crashes can damage other infrastructure like barriers, buildings, road signs, street lamps, electrical poles, etc. Cars obviously pollute through emissions, but also particles from various parts of the car, like the rubber tires, end up in our water ways, and they also contribute to noise pollution. This pollution can have effects on people's health, by breathing in the polluted air, and even the noise from cars can cause health effects, like interrupting sleep. Again, more strain on the healthcare system. Bikes are quiet and have no fuel source. Since bikes are much lighter than cars, and the tires are much thinner in width and fewer in number, they should also produce fewer particles over the same time frame.\nThe information and application is abundant. Other parts of the world have figured it out, why haven't we? That's rhetorical, I'm pretty sure I know why. It's insulting and pathetic that we even need to have this conversation.\n"

Even if it was all removed and more lanes were added, congestion would not improve, because building more lanes for cars will always induce demand for them, and they'll fill up regardless. The inherent inefficiency of the car is why we have traffic, not because there's enough space on the side for bike infrastructure that doesn't kill people. Please reconsider.\n"

I think its important to provide and maintain infrastructure that makes navigating our roads safer and more accessible to everybody, especially people who don't use cars for transport. I would encourage the city in fact to approve more bike lanes moving forwards, and am confused why this bill proposes to destroy existing infrastructure. Why? It would cost the city more. Why the focus on this rather than building more accessibility - such as connecting bike paths, which also encourage tourism? Or making roads safer for riders, and pedestrians? Or making the city easier to navigate via wheelchair or mobility aid? This is a backwards step, and both a waste of peoples time, and tax payers money should it go ahead. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike infrastructure in Toronto, particularly on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University, would be a major step backward in making the city safer, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable. Prioritizing car traffic at the expense of bike lanes ignores the clear benefits of cycling infrastructure, including reduced congestion, lower emissions, and increased safety for all road users.\nToronto\u2019s bike lanes have proven to be highly effective in promoting safer, healthier, and greener transportation options. They are essential for reducing our reliance on cars and cutting down on urban congestion \u2014 a goal that aligns with the province\u2019s stated aim to \u201creduce gridlock.\u201d By encouraging more people to cycle instead of drive, these lanes help reduce the very traffic they are now being blamed for.\nMoreover, bike lanes make roads safer for cyclists, who are vulnerable road users in need of dedicated space to avoid being forced into mixed traffic. Removing lanes on major thoroughfares would lead to increased danger for cyclists, which in turn discourages people from using bicycles altogether. This would exacerbate congestion as more people choose to drive, compounding environmental harm, and adding to the public health burden.\nFinally, considering the environmental implications of such infrastructure decisions is crucial. In a time when cities worldwide are investing in sustainable infrastructure to address climate change, Ontario\u2019s proposal to reduce bike lanes sends the wrong message. We should be expanding, not restricting, infrastructure that reduces emissions and supports a resilient, sustainable urban future.\nInstead of cutting back on bike lanes, the province should prioritize and accelerate investments in cycling infrastructure, ensuring that Toronto \u2014 and all of Ontario \u2014 can reap the benefits of safer, greener, and more efficient transportation.\n"

        "comment": "This is an ill-advised proposal. Removing bike lanes on Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St will not ease traffic congestion.\nRemoving this vital transit infrastructure will have multiple negative impacts: 1) the proposal will put citizens who commute by bicycle in greater danger of injury or death on Toronto\u2019s streets; 2) the proposal will have a negative impact on local economic activity on main street shops (i.e, many local businesses will lose out on customers who would have passed through the area on their bikes); 3) tearing out bike lanes will be a waste of taxpayer money and it will only cause more temporary construction (which is one of the major causes of urban congestion).\nOver the past ten years of living in this city, I have seen too many ghost bike memorials. These memorials are signifiers that both the city and the province have failed to modernize and thoughtfully design our transit infrastructure with all citizens in mind. This has resulted in unnecessary deaths, and this proposal to remove bike lanes only serves to worsen the problem and make people less safe on our roads.\nI urge the province to reverse this proposal and instead focus on improving our transit infrastructure with safety and sustainability in mind. Thank you.\n"

And the proposal legally but unconscionably interferes with the roles of municipal governments in planning for local traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes along major roads are the conservative solution to bikes on major roads. Removing the bike lanes will reduce the number of cyclists using those roads, but not eliminate them. In what world will adding bikes moving at 20 km/h to major streets that previously contained bike lanes help with the speed of traffic moving through an area?\nPeople have to get from one part of a city to another. Bikes and micro-mobility are one method to accomplish doing so that is affordable to lower income individuals. Removing bike infrastructure and focusing on motor vehicles also reduces the ability for the poorer citizens to freely move through the city. This gate keeps transportation accessibility to wealthier members of society while also forcing people who can't afford to own motor vehicles to sacrifice other necessity or quality of life items to have transportation.\nThe fiscally responsible solution to traffic congestion is to support removal of motor vehicles from the road by providing quality alternative method through public transit, bike, micro-mobility and walk-ability; also, removing vehicle parking from streets would significantly help traffic congestion.\n"
