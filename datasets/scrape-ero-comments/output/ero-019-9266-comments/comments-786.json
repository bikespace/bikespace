        "comment": "Ontario is experiencing rapid population and economic growth, particularly in urban centres and surrounding regions. This growth demands a modernized approach to integrate land use and transportation planning to accommodate increased development while maintaining the ability to move people and goods effectively. On a municipal level, cities are responsible for providing safe and efficient transportation networks for all users. Cities achieve this by using a variety of tools available to build wisely and maintain effective, affordable and connected transportation networks:\n\u2022\tcities are obligated and committed to provide public service facilities, including roads and active transportation corridors with a goal to reduce traffic and create safe roadways that include multiple options including walking, cycling, public transit and driving;\n\u2022\tbike lanes are an integral component of a connected system that supports inclusive and complete communities in accordance with the direction of provincial policies; and,\n\u2022\tbike lanes are a tool to help ensure that road design is convenient, equitable and provides options for people to access their daily needs.\nProper planning for growth is an essential service municipalities must provide for the benefit of all people living in Ontario. Without careful planning the increasing development could:\n\u2022\tcompromise the integrity of existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tlead to increased congestion, reducing the efficiency of transportation corridors, goods movements and transit;\n\u2022\terode environmental sustainability, including impacts on green spaces, agricultural lands, cultural heritage and waterways;\n\u2022\tcreate challenges for municipalities in balancing infrastructure investments with growth needs; and,\n\u2022\tadd to a growing asset base of infrastructure for which municipalities are not able to sustainably afford the full lifecycle costs of maintaining those assets.\nBill 212 introduces measures contrary to the principles of good planning, including those in Environmental Assessment Act, municipal Official Plans and the Provincial Policy Statement. The proposed Bill establishes an additional bureaucratic layer for infrastructure improvements, contrary to Provincial initiatives to reduce red-tape. The proposal will restrict municipalities\u2019 ability to plan, design and implement safe multi-modal transportation systems in accordance with community-developed and Council-approved visions and priorities.\nTo support growth while still moving people and goods effectively, Bill 212 should be revised to:\n\u2022\treinforce municipal authority to align development with existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tsupport municipal initiatives to encourage travel by transit and active transportation, recognizing these modes are more cost effective and more efficient in the long term;\n\u2022\tprioritize policies that support investment in transit infrastructure and active transportation, ultimately with a goal of building communities with reduced car dependency; and,\n\u2022\tmaintain protection of natural and cultural heritage features through a strong and robust environmental assessment process for major highway corridor projects.\nBill 212, in its current form, undermines the very transportation and land-use planning principles necessary to support Ontario\u2019s growth. To ensure sustainable development, the legislation must be amended to reinforce integrated planning, preserve strategic transportation networks, and align growth with economic, social and environmental objectives.\nThe need for a rethink of this Bill is reinforced by the outpouring of statements and positions being released by countless organizations representing  the many professional fields that grapple with the intersection of land use planning, infrastructure investments and planning our transportation systems daily. We support the positions to revisit this Bill put forward by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, the Canadian Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Ontario Traffic Council, the Association of Ontario Municipalities, the Ontario Public Health Association, Good Roads, the Ontario Association of Architects, the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects, and countless municipalities across the Province of Ontario.\nCity of Peterborough staff would be happy to assist provincial officials in making improvements to Bill 212 that would achieve the stated goal of reducing gridlock through evidence-based approaches. Further, we would be willing to assist the Province with development of new policies and programs to support municipalities in their efforts to plan and build efficient and connected transportation networks for all users.\n"

Even as a driver, I would much rather have cyclists safely in their own protected lane, as opposed to watching fellow drivers crowd too close or getting anxiety myself that I\u2019m going to hit somebody.\nI don\u2019t understand all this talk of cyclists slowing down traffic. It\u2019s not like having another lane free for cars will double the number of cars on the road \u2014traffic flow mostly depends on intersection lights and cars parked or delivery vehicles at the side blocking a lane.\nPlease keep cyclists safe on our roads and keep the bike lanes we\u2019ve already paid for!\n"

The bike lanes provide access to Toronto residents to quickly and efficiently get around the city.

        "comment": "It's genuinely baffling to see all this money and time wasted on an evidence-free fantasy of \"reducing congestion\" that won't succeed but will make vulnerable road users less safe (including people who work at the hospitals on and around University Ave). It's also troubling but not surprising to see this government attempt another act of antidemocratic overreach: Elected municipal governments have a mandate to decide what kind of cycling infrastructure is or isn't appropriate for their communities. This simply isn't an issue the province needs to weigh in on at all - and that poorly understood issue is being used as a wedge to cover up even more unpopular measures related to Highway 413, including exempting it from the EPA. In the short term, removing existing bike infrastructure will significantly increase congestion, but the long game is just more dead cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Environmental Registry of Ontario,\nBike lanes are integral to a healthy city. I will first address this as mother and citizen of Toronto and then speak from my vantage point as a health researcher. Bike lanes allow my teenage children to travel on their own to their extracurricular sports practices, and other activities, without me having to drive them. They often travel by bike with several friends. This means that there are fewer cars on the road as none of us parents need to drive to and from practice--and back again for pick up. Fewer trips by car supports health by lowering emissions and easing gridlock. Also, safe road infrastructure, like the separated bike lanes that the Premier has said he wants to tear out, keep our kids alive and uninjured. We depend on these bike lanes for safety.\nAs a health researcher, I know that bike lanes support health by promoting active transit. People get to ride their bikes to work and exercise while getting there! Cycling is an enjoyable way to get around the city\u2014as long as the safe bike lane infrastructure exists. We know from studies in Canada and from other counties that more and more people will choose to cycle if there are safe bike lanes. One study (Imani, Miller & Saxe, 2019) found that if people can get to work on safe bike infrastructure, the chance that they will choose to do so goes up by 40 percent. And since safe bike infrastructure gets people out of their cars, it means less air pollution, less gridlock and a generally happier and healthier city.\nI ask that the Government of Ontario keep teens and other cyclists safe and prioritize everyone\u2019s health and wellbeing and change direction on this legislation. Bill 212 will seriously endanger the lives of cyclists and contribute to more gridlock when, lacking safe bike infrastructure, people leave their bikes and return to their cars. Let\u2019s choose health over death, injury, and gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I am over 70 years old and I drive quite often. Also, I enjoy riding my bike.\nBefore the bike lanes were installed, I had to\na) ride next to the curb and have cars passing dangerously close to me, where a small adjustment of my part would throw me under the cars o a small adjustment of a driver would make the car hit me or\nb) take the whole lane (as I am entitled to do) and have the cars driving close behind me, trying to persuade me to get of the lane. I have been yielded at, insulted and threatened for doing what is my right.\nThe bike lanes are not only safer for cyclists but they also avoid road rage and accidents.\nAs statics have demonstrated bike lanes brought more cyclists and therefore less car traffic. Build them and they will come (more cyclists, less traffic). The 1.2% people using bikes might be correct away from the Toronto downtown core however, it is inaccurate on Bloor St, Yonge St. and University Ave.\nAs statics have shown, the traffic congestion in Toronto did not start nor has it been exacerbated by the bike lanes. An obvious example is the 401: no bike lanes, terrible traffic congestion.\nThe obvious solution: a much, much better public transit system. And making it free, as it is been done in many cities around the world, including Canadian cities, would entice more people to leave the car at home: less traffic congestion, less pollution, less accidents, less police work, less health problems.\n"

We don\u2019t need more highways without environmental considerations, we don\u2019t need the government forcibly taking land to continue pushing the motor vehicle paradigm, and we don\u2019t need more needless deaths caused by unsafe cycling infrastructure and selfish interests. It has long been time we seriously consider our impact on this earth, instead of conceding our role as keepers of the land for the sake of greedy and irresponsible desires. Strike this bill down, and invest into what Canadians really need. Modern convenient rail services, improved transit and motor alternatives, safe and thoughtfully constructed car infrastructure, a choice to cycle safely, and a sustainable future. We already have the busiest highways in the world. Why are we so desperate to continue forcing people to make a choice that places them into vulnerable debt, constant sedentary action, and dangerous circumstance? Using money on nonsense such as reversing essential progress for the future that will inevitably arrive?  I say this attempt is nonsense. Please consider my comment carefully. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\n### Conclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "Please be honest in your assessment of bike lanes. The statistics the government is using includes smaller municipalities that don\u2019t typically use bikes. The number of bikes on the stretches of road the Ontario government is threatening to remove, have usage between 8-12% not 1-2 as they claim, making it a very important commuting option.\nIf this was strictly about more space for cars than this bill would include removing street parking as these take up way more space than bike lanes and don\u2019t contribute to the moving of traffic. In fact it blocks traffic as cars try to parallel park in spaces that are tight.\nBike lanes cannot be moved to smaller streets as there are no side streets that give riders a direct route across the city. Don\u2019t treat bikes as a problem for traffic, a successful bike network will make traffic flow better as it gives people an option to get out of their car and take up less space leaving more space for cars down the road. There should be less cars in the city as the city grows because the current amount of cars is not sustainable as housing increases. Transit, bikes and walking are key to making it easier to make your way around the city.\nToronto should not be compared to smaller municipalities that do not have a largely centralized population where space is at a premium. For those of us that live in the city, biking is often the quickest way to get around providing there are safe spaces for bikes. While imperfect they are better than the alternative, which is forcing bikes to share the road with cars or even onto the sidewalk or worse by adding to the traffic and deciding to drive instead. A successful city requires a variety of options, including transit, cars, bikes and walking.\nThe government knows the real problem is the amount of construction, a lot of which are provincial projects (Ontario line, LRT lines etc) plus the Gardiner, condo developments and other street construction in the city.\nThe province can do their part and actually open these public transit projects which will have a positive impact and don\u2019t distract people by blaming bikes.\nBy putting the blame on bikes you are risking making things more dangerous for those who choose to ride.\nAnd this is a municipal matter not a provincial one. The government doesn\u2019t like it when the federal government intervenes in what the province deems provincial matters so don\u2019t do that to cities.\nThank you and please do the right thing.\n"

From the studies that I have read about, removing bike lanes will make a minimal difference to moving traffic faster.  If verifiable, transparent studies show something to the contrary then that can form a basis for a meaningful discussion.\nDecisions about local traffic on local roads must be made locally, not provincially or federally.  We must preserve the autonomy of locally elected officials to make decisions to meet the needs of their constituents, first and foremost.\nSafety must override other considerations such as speed.  Yes we all want to get places in a timely fashion but it must not be at the expense of people's safety.  For example, lowering speed limits has consistently been shown to significantly increase everyone's safety.  Bike lanes have also been shown to significantly increase safety, particularly for cyclists and pedestrians.\nI also strongly object to the arbitrary way this bill has been introduced.  If the Premier or members of his caucus feel that some of the bike lanes they encounter are under utilized I'm sure The Mayor Chow would take their call and have an honest and open discussion about it.  The province should absolutely not be making broad, general policy that is unsupported by science, reduces safety and usurps the appropriate authority of local government.\n"
