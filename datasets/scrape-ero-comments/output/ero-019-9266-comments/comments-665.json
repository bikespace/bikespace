        "comment": "It seems wildly counter productive to remove a piece of infrastructure that is working as intended and makes the city safer for non-vehicle commuters. This bill doesn't seem to consider the residents within the downtown core who naturally use the main streets to cycle between destinations. There's an innate amount of traffic that always exists on these main roads which these proposals won't change as intended.  Removing the Bloor bike lanes will only spill the cycling traffic onto the roads or sidewalks. The side street bike lanes will induce a bit of bike traffic onto those streets but it more than likely won't have the desired effect of freeing up the main roads.\nI hope enough local residents relay their thoughts about this as it seems only to benefit out of town commuters. I cycle every day and don't want what is already a relatively dangerous form of commuting to get even more dangerous. Please keep our city safe!\n"

        "comment": "As the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers and many others have agreed, getting rid of bike lanes will not reduce traffic/gridlock but will actively make it worse. If you get rid of Ontarian\u2019s ability to safely choose transportation methods other than biking, you increase the dependency on cars. This will increase the number of cars on the roads and negatively affect traffic times and our environmental impact on the world. Bike lanes are typically 1m wide, cars are 1.7m wide on average. As a result removing a bike lane won\u2019t even create the room required to make another lane for more cars to fit on the road. This bill goes against any form of common sense and exists only to make the world a worse place.\n"

        "comment": "I am a lifelong Toronto resident, and I typically travel through the city by car, on foot or transit. Bloor Street, where fully separated bike lanes were recently installed, is a street I drive on quite frequently. I am writing oppose Bill 212.\nI am in full support of keeping the existing bike lanes exactly where they are, and I am in vehement disagreement with expediting the construction of Highway 413, and the Bradford Bypass, and any other priority highway construction project.\nThe government's own experts have determined that none of these priority projects save any significant time, and their construction has been shown to be an environmental disaster. There is also the open question of whether or not the urgency of this construction is dictated by developers and donors to the PC party. If the government truly wanted to \"reduce gridlock and save time\", they could do so considerably faster and cheaper by paying for trucks to use Highway 407.\nWith respect to bike lanes, they save lives. The evidence on this is clear. Fully separated bike lanes also make life considerably easier for drivers, as it keeps cyclists safely away from vehicles. This in turn encourages more bike commuting, which is better for the environment, for local businesses (it's far easier to spontaneously stop on a bike to enter a business than to park a car), and in many cases is faster than driving.\nMore to the point, the Premier should remember that he is not Mayor of Toronto (he lost that election) and should allow municipalities to make such decisions for themselves. I am appalled that this government would waste time and money trying to dictate municipal decisions like bike lanes instead of tackling more significant provincial issues like health care, education, and the climate.\n"

Ford is still smarting from having lost Toronto's mayoral race in 2014 and, ten years later, is still sulking. For a man who claimed to be \"for the people\", this is small-minded, wasteful, and bad policy.\nOntario's planners, municipalities, BIA's and citizens oppose this interference by the provincial government into our local affairs, which we are well capable of managing ourselves.\n"

I cycle, I walk, and I drive through the city - all components that need to be managed in balance and with respect of one another. The bike lane infrastructure contribute to making this a livable city, and are absolutely a net gain for the city overall. When budgets are not balancing, what is the sense in taking on an unnecessary and uncalled for expense that we already cannot afford? Leave the investment in the infrastructure where it is so that we can gain from the full return on it, and keep the good will instead of stirring up unwarranted bad will.\n"

Bike lanes prevent accidents between cyclists and motorists and create safe avenues of travel through the city for those who do not own cars. Congestion in the city would be better helped if this money was put in to improving TTC service and completing transit construction. This would reduce a reliance on both driving, rideshares and bikes, improving traffic flow in the city for everyone.\n"

Construction on bay and Yonge streets and on the gardiner itself is causing the traffic. There are no bike lanes on bay and minimal on Yonge. The only street downtown with proper bike lanes is Simcoe, but that\u2019s already a two lane road. Bike lanes are not the problem. The problem is construction.\n"

Study after study has shown not only the POSITIVE economic effects of bike lanes on local neighborhoods but that it REDUCES overall traffic congestion, and improves emergency response times.\nBill 212 ignores all this evidence supporting bike lanes while touting it's goal of reducing traffic congestion. This is absurd.\nFurther, this is a vast over reach of municipal jurisdiction to govern their own affairs. Local planning decisions must be left to their elected officials at the municipality level, and not at the provincial level. I demand the withdrawal of this Bill. We will remember your actions and that of others come next provincial election.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal should not pass. Doug Ford is ignoring data, and ignoring the voices of those who do not share his view point, to the detriment of the cities.  People will not bike without biking infrastructure, and it takes time to build up the numbers and for people to change their habits and use the infrastructure.\nThe data does not support this bill in any way, and Doug Ford is not presenting any real alternate data related to how this will actually help anything. The construction will create further grid lock (as seen all across the city where there is construction) and it should not be the concern of any citizen of Ontario to pay for ripping out important infrastructure in cities they live no where near. This is rash, not thought out, and not based on real evidence. It is a backward proposal that will not help get people where they need to go in Toronto, and will literally cost lives.  Please look at the evidence and do not consider only the interests of your business contacts in Etobicoke - this is about the environment, accessibility, safety and the future of the city for many years to come.  This bill absolutely should not pass.\n"

        "comment": "There is much to be said about this proposal and how it will impact our future in Ontario.\nIt's obvious that we are suffering from gridlock. I absolutely HATE to be stuck in highway traffic when getting in our out of our city. And for sure we need to find a way out of this mess.\nBUT\nBuilding more highways NEVER solved the problem - reliable, cheap, efficient public transport does.\nThat has been proven again and again.\nWe need to be focussing our money and time building railways that can take more people around. Maybe big parking lots around stations so people only have to drive inside their towns and cities and not burn tons of fossil fuels to get to Toronto. Once they get here, they become the traffic that makes our streets a living hell.\nMoreover, if this legislation passes, it will cause a MAJOR impact in our green lands and farming lands that we need to preserve in order to have a future.\nLASTLY, THE BIKE LANES NEED TO STAY\nMy family depends on the bike lanes.\nWe don't own a car, so most of our commute is done by bike, walking and taking public transit.\nI COULD have a car, but I choose not to, and I believe this is my right.\nWe are a family of 3, with a 18mo boy who has to be taken to Day Care, Doctor's appointments, Play dates, parks and museums and we do that by bike and TTC. He LOVES the bike and it's the fastest and easier way to get around.\nWe live in Midtown and my partner bikes downtown to work during the week. She takes Bloor Street West and University Ave in her route and that cuts her travel time by 30 minutes. She also gets her exercise that way. The thing is she is not a confident cyclist and she NEEDS protected bike lanes. If you take them out, we will have 2,5 hours less of her every week. PLUS the cost of the TTC tickets.\nThis is my personal take - I need the bike lanes so my family can have a reliable, cheap, easy and SAFE way of locomotion around the city.\nMy more expensive take:\n- This Bill is an infringement on our city self government and sounds like a revenge against what the Conservatives see as \"the Left\".\n- There is no basis for the removal, it's all based on pretend numbers from 2012.\n- The bike lanes IMPROVE the time to respond to emergencies\n- Bike lanes are Good for business\n- Bike Lanes are good for the environment\n- Bike Lanes make our kids safe\n- It will be costly to take them out. It will also Create traffic.\n- There is no single reason to carry this madness.\nThat's it.\nPlease dont make our lives even more miserable than they are right now\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers as they negotiate public roads. The Bill also proposes the building of highway 413 through the Greenbelt to alleviate congestion, but the 407 is already an existing and underused highway that needs to be addressed first before spending billions to pave way for another highway that will likely be tolled with the proposal for broadband internet. We need another solution for density in our province.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing Bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, Halifax, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behavior. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why? These environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more.\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom it May Concern,\nRetroactively removing bike infrastructure is beyond a waste of $48 million in taxpayer money, it's a violent act that will inevitably lead to the preventable deaths of more cyclists and pedestrians. A much better use of this money would go into improving the criminally under funded TTC. This is surely more likely to reduce commute times than deconstructing our arterial roads into highways. The notion that fewer bike lanes will mitigate gridlock is based in pseudoscientific, biased research. As an urban planner, I can assure you that induced demand works - and it won't work in your favour to reduce commute times for motorists.\nBut regardless, cities are for people, not cars. If you care about your citizens, your priority should lie with making the city safer for people, not a more efficient thoroughfare for vehicular traffic. It should not be about saving drivers and businesses time and money, it should be about saving lives. 2024 is the deadliest year on record for cyclists in the GTA. This is not normal. Bill 212 will only further expedite this trend towards the death of more citizens, and thus the city.\nWe agree that time is precious, we all deserve more time to spend with our loved ones. However, Bill 212's insistence on removing poured-in and paid for infrastructure projects is senseless beyond economic measure and will undoubtedly lead to more death, and less time together.\n"
