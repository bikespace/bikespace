Putting aside the fact that bike lanes are a benefit to cities (and Ford is AGAIN wasting our money on unnecessary things by removing bike lanes he has no business interfering with) this bill is an abuse of power.\nRemoving environmental protections and bulldozing farmland with no consideration for the climate, safe food production or small business owners is another example of Doug Ford funneling money to his rich friends at the expense of the people of Ontario.\nI see no benefit to the people of the province from this bill.\n"

In fact,  make MORE designated places for people to ride their bicycles. As a driver I also appreciate it when cyclists have a designated lane. Let\u2019s remove the emphasis on driving within cities and towns and encourage safe cycling and walking.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock it will increase it. A prime example is to observe the number of people biking to work in the morning. On my own short commute i will easily see nearly 100 people biking to work. Often there are herds of 20-30 bikers on each block. Discouraging the use of bikes by removing bike lanes on long stretches of road downtown means more drivers on the road and more traffic. And yes many of these bikers will resort to driving if need be. For most of us our commute to work is too long to walk, and access to the ttc is incredibly poor due to the lack of stations, and the fact that streetcars are often slower than walking.\nAdditionally, even if all this was false, and removing bike lanes would not increase the number of drivers, it most certainly would not help with gridlock in the city. Adding an additional lane is not going to reduce traffic. The issue is not that there are not enough lanes, the issue is that getting on and off the highway is incredibly congested, if you want to reduce gridlock for cars, streamline getting onto the Gardner. You can add as many lanes as you want but your still going to end up with a massive line of cars waiting to get onto the highway at the same entrance. The reason for traffic and congestion is not a lack of bandwidth, it is a result of bottleneck points. More specifically these bottleneck points are the entrances and exits to high bandwidth roadways, in Toronto\u2019s case, the Gardner and DVP. I agree that traffic is a problem, but you\u2019re trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole here and its not going to have the outcome you want.\nLastly, think about the future of Toronto and what kind of city you want it to be. Do we want to be a city meant for cars, or do we want to be a city meant for people? I envision a future where cars are seldom needed downtown due to high quality and accessible public transit, bike lanes etc. Roads could be replaced by pedestrian walkways, stoplights replaced by trees and art. This may be a bit of a pipe dream, but I would rather work towards a maybe unachievable ideal, improving our city and its beauty along the way, rather than disregard those ideals entirely and let Toronto devolve into a city meant for machines rather than people.\n"

        "comment": "I don't like the way that bike lanes are being used in this bill as a wedge issue to distract from its main intention, which is to jam through another expensive highway, skipping environmental review. Further, I support bike lanes, and don't support the province making these decisions on the behalf of cities, down to the level of individual streets in one city being singled out in an ostensibly provincial bill. I hope this is voted down.\n"

        "comment": "My issue with Schedule 4 is the Ministry of Transportation, a provincial body, is requiring information from municipalities to prove the benefits of bicycle lanes to ensure drivers are not negatively impacted and it will approve what the municipalities can and cannot do. This is overstepping the ministries jurisdiction. The ministry had gone to the Supreme Court of Canada for a similar issue with regards Highway 413 not long ago as well. Highway 413 was designated for a federal impact assessment and the ministry argued that the federal government had overstepped their boundaries. This is the exact same thing that is happening, but not it is the provincial government overstepping boundaries into how municipalities choose to govern themselves.\nIt is hypocritical of the Ministry to require data and then decide if it will approve the implementation of bike lanes. The MOT is pushing for the construction of Highway 413,and do not publish the data on expected benefits, who will benefit, and the financial/environmental costs. Where was all the data and information with regards to Highway 413 that led to the decision that it must be built? The Highway 413 site (https://www.highway413.ca/2021/03/31/timesavings/) states that, \"not everyone will enjoy the direct benefit of time savings\" and then argues other examples such as building hospitals and how it benefits the local residents in the area. The same argument that they use to argue for Highway 413 applies to the bike lanes they want to limit and even remove along Bloor, University, and Yonge. There is a group of people who benefit from the bike lanes, but that is not enough to expand the bike lane networks anymore, yet it is enough to argue for more highways.\nThere have been multiple studies on the return on investment when investing in cycling networks in cities. Australia's Queensland government has a website (https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/travel-and-transport/cycling/cycling-strateg\u2026) speaking about the topic. They invested into their cycling networks and wanted to promote a more active lifestyle for their citizens. They found that for every dollar they invested into the cycling infrastructure, it led to approximately 5 dollars worth of benefits. This came in the form of improved health benefits and reduced traffic congestion to name a few.\nExpanding the cycling network also helps deal with the first/last mile issue, where people using multiple forms of transportation require more options for the first and last mile of a trip. Cars and walking are typical forms, but cycling also can be used to solve this issue as the individual can go wherever they need to and are not limited by the predetermined routes used by buses and trains.\nOverall, alternative methods, including cycling, should be explored and developed more to reduce traffic congestion, improve the health and quality of life of citizens, and reduce GHG emissions and pollution. Just like how induced demand applies to new highways and roads, it applies to cycling networks as well. The amount of people using Bike Share programs in Toronto has been dramatically increasing over the years. People want to cycle, but they want to be safe when doing so.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes or making it necessary for municipalities to get provincial approval is simply wrong-headed and blantantly political. The government seems intent on making cars the king in cities and towns everywhere under the guise of very questionable logic and research.\nAs a pedestrian and as a driver, I see a far greater safety issue with one lane of traffic in each direction plus a bike lane than with two lanes of traffic plus bikes trying to weave in and out around the cars. This is simple logic, Mr. Ford.\nThe science says that induced capacity is the result of more lanes for cars and that more lanes simply kicks the gridlock further down the road. Please listen to the science, and not to others with conflicts of interest or axes to grind, or political motives. Show leadership and innovation. It's why this government was elected.\n"

        "comment": "I urge you to reconsider the proposed \u201cBike Lane\u201d Bill. While it is presented as addressing multiple issues, its true impact is alarming and counterproductive.\nFirst, the proposal to remove bike lanes is misguided. It will be costly to dismantle existing infrastructure, wasting taxpayer dollars that could be invested in improving transportation for all users. Additionally, removing bike lanes will force cyclists back onto general traffic lanes, increasing congestion and creating dangerous conditions for everyone on the road. This move undermines efforts to create sustainable, multimodal transportation systems, making traffic worse instead of better.\nBeyond the bike lane issue, the bill contains provisions that severely compromise public trust and well-being:\n\t\u2022\tSection 1 allows the province to expropriate property without proper consultation, ignoring individual rights.\n\t\u2022\tSection 2 removes flexibility for landowners impacted by highway construction, creating undue hardship.\n\t\u2022\tSection 3 exempts Highway 413 from environmental impact assessments, setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked development.\n\t\u2022\tSection 5 reintroduces problematic towing practices, undoing progress made in protecting drivers.\nThis bill is not just about bike lanes; it is an alarming overreach with far-reaching consequences. I strongly encourage you to reject this legislation and focus on policies that respect property rights, protect the environment, and promote efficient, inclusive transportation solutions.\n"

Living near Hyde Park and having an accessible and safe bike lane has reduce my stress and anxiety of my safety on the road. Because before the bike lanes, it was not always a safe commute despite being an experienced cyclist and knowing the rules of the road, I cannot say the same for fellow drivers on the road. There were a number of times that I was an unsafe situation due to lack of bike lanes. I understand that congestion in the city is on the rise with all due respect taking out the bike lanes is not the solve all of the situation, it is a Band-Aid situation and reactionary. It hurts me to think that our premier thinks more about cars than the safety of everyone on the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely concerned about the amendment to Bill 212 that allows the Province to unilaterally remove cycling projects such as Bloor, Yonge and University. I am a 67 year old grandmother who uses those lanes almost every day to get to where I need to go - whether it is shopping, going to appointments, classes or visiting my son and his family, who live not far from Bloor. Take these lanes away and I will be back in my car - adding to congestion.\nThese projects all underwent rigorous consultations, pilot periods and extensive design modifications based on community feedback. There is no evidence that they are causing gridlock and the increased travel time is a modest tradeoff when compared to the benefits for those not in a car. There is evidence that more and more people are cycling and walking here and that businesses are not suffering as was predicted. In addition, the cost of removal plus the sunk costs of installation is an unreasonable waste of my tax dollars as a resident of Toronto and of Ontario. More importantly, removal of these important safety improvements for people walking and cycling will put more lives at risk.\nPlease reject this amendment.\n"
