        "comment": "I think it is concerning that you want to forcefully push people out from their property without due process in order to build more highways/more lanes for highways. Again, it would make much more sense to encourage other people to use alternative forms of transportation. Get the transit projects done so that people don't need to depend on highways, and you would not have to pass such a piece of legislation. Not only that, but there are also short term solutions that can be implemented to improve congestion wile transit is built. As well, this would allow for more housing to be built (due to the increased public transit). There seems to be a fixation on cars when it would be better for everyone (even drivers) if people were allowed and encouraged to use alternate forms of transit. Instead, this legislation is trying to skirt around the approval process for building new lanes/highways (and other infrastructure) rather than doing what makes more sense (getting more transit built instead of encouraging more car usage, which will make congestion worse, and encouraging people to use other forms of transportation outside of driving cars).\n"

It really seems like Doug Ford personally does not like certain bike lanes in Toronto. But this is not the problem of any of us but him. I bike commute in Kitchener and my city has done a great job of adding bike lanes to make my commute safe and enjoyable. I certainly would not vote Conservative if bike lanes were removed or proposed lanes were abandoned. Removing bike lanes is a waste of material and labor.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario taxpayer, I would like my taxes to support well thought out plans that improve the lives of all Ontarians.  I am dismayed that the proposed legislation will take the province back to a 1960's approach to transportation and the hard-earned tax dollars that I provide intend to be squandered on regressive ideas that should never have been introduced or considered in the first place.\nIf the purpose of the bill is truly to reduce gridlock, there are many international examples of innovative planning.  Where is the creative problem solving reflected in this proposed piece of legislation?\nFor example,  as has been suggested many times, why is either the buy-back or a lease-back option not sought out as a solution to divert truck traffic from the 401 to the 407?  The short-sighted 407 lease by the previous Harris conservative government could be reversed by a solutions-based government that recognizes more roads will only create induced demand, congesting new roads with more traffic, thereby negating the intended outcome and worsening climate impacts.\nI would like to see a provincial transportation strategy that focuses on creating solutions that encourage public transportation as the preferred mode of transportation.  In order to achieve this long-term goal, a multi-pronged approach must develop comprehensive networks,  encourage affordable/accessible transportation systems, and incorporate active transportation options that are safe and efficient.\nIn order to shift to a public transit focused province there are several issues the government could tackle.  For example,\nMake public transit faster\nSupport the development of dedicated transit lanes to keep private vehicles from obstructing buses and trams.\nBuy back the 407 lease\nThe highway wasn\u2019t sold, just leased (for 99 years). Buying back the lease will be less costly than building a new road and could happen very quickly.\nThere is no point buying it back and removing tolls completely. It\u2019s set up to collect tolls. Without tolls, the road would soon fill to capacity. The toll should be lower than the current charge. However, the 407 buy-back must be paid for, and asking residents of Barrie, Ottawa, Timmins, Windsor or Thunder Bay to pay for a road they may never use is unfair.\nCharge fees for all 400-series highways in the GTA\nThe other 400-series highways in the GTA, plus the QEW, should charge tolls. They may be modest, but multiplied by their huge traffic, they should bring in enough to pay for the 407 buy-back with money to spare for transit projects designed to reduce traffic congestion.\nThe tolls on the other 400-series roads should be collected as the 407 collects them now.\nToronto-to-Montreal high-speed, high-frequency rail\nOn Oct. 29, the federal government announced, on CBC Radio, that it would begin building a high-speed, high-frequency rail corridor linking Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City. The trains would achieve speeds of 300 km/h. This project may take a decade before even the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal section is ready, but promises many benefits.  The province should consider how it can support this project to reduce congestion on the corridor linking these cities.\nUrban transit should be 'free'\nPublic transit systems are subsidized to keep ticket prices low. The subsidy doesn\u2019t eliminate the costs of fare collection, accounting, policing, etc. However, \u201cfree transit\u201d eliminates them all.\nTransit vehicles could be redesigned. Buses would use both front and rear doors, perhaps adding another door to speed loading and unloading passengers. Shorter stops would allow the same size fleet to provide faster, more frequent service ... with the intention to shift drivers from their cars to public transit.  A surprisingly long list of cities provide \u201cfree\u201d public transit in order to encourage this change including some in this province.\nDevelop More Bike Lanes\nWalking and cycling are the cleanest ways to get around a city, and both can have enormous benefits for health, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, road safety and equity. Cities as diverse as Bogot\u00e1, Copenhagen, Montr\u00e9al and Barcelona are leading the way in encouraging walking and cycling.  Rather than eliminating bike lanes, they should be increased in all Ontario cities as a way of improving the health and safety of all residents - cyclists, pedestrians included.\nSpecifically,  I am appalled to hear that Transportation Minister Sarkaria said Toronto bike lanes used by \"only 1.2 percent of people\" to get to work \u2014 need to be removed as \"70 per cent of the population travels to work by car.\"  Not only does federal data show higher cycling rates within Toronto's boundaries, the city also has its own data on cycling.\nA 2019 city study found that 44 per cent of Torontonians bike in good weather to get to school, work, shop or visit friends. It also found 26 per cent of people bike for fun or fitness only, making 70 per cent of Torontonians cyclists in some capacity.   Why this attack on municipal cycling infrastructure by a provincial government?  Surely,  there are provincial issues that the Government of Ontario could address rather than meddling in municipal matters.  Local governments know their communities best and have the understanding to develop their municipalities to best support residents.\nReduce Proposed Highways\nProvincially, we need fewer highways, not more.   Projects such as the Bradford By-pass and Hwy 413 should be scrapped in favour of shifting the focus to transportation networks less dependent on the private automobile and more focus on sustainable modes of transportation, prioritizing high-quality, accessible and safe networks for pedestrians, cycling and surface transit.\nI live beyond the GTA boundary but frequently use the GO Train and then TTC to travel to Toronto.  Although these systems can be improved, I am exceedingly pleased with the overall experience and would hope that they continue to be a high priority for this government.  I see no reason to encourage more vehicular traffic at the expense of current and future active transportation networks.\n"

        "comment": "As an avid cyclist in the city of Toronto for close to 25 years now I can say that the current state of our bike lane system is the best and safest feeling its ever been since I started cycling. Removing them would only create more delays in traffic not only for the time it would take to remove them but then further congestion as cyclists would have to share a lane of traffic with motorized vehicles. I don\u2019t see how this would reduce the overall congestion of the city\u2019s traffic as it seems to me construction is the main purveyor of taking up lanes for motorized vehicles and creating pinch points for all forms of traffic. Overall as a tax payer in the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario I see this as a colossal waste of our collective money and strongly urge the provincial government to reconsider its stance and also to keep out of what in my opinion are municipal affairs. Thank you for your time.\n"

This plan, presented as a way to \u201cget drivers where they need to go faster,\u201d reflects a narrow view of urban transportation that disregards the needs of all Torontonians.\nA truly effective transportation policy must consider everyone\u2014not just drivers. Toronto is a city where residents depend on a balance of public transit, cycling, and walking, alongside driving. Removing bike lanes not only undermines this balance but also makes travel less safe, sustainable, and accessible for all. This proposal sacrifices long-term urban livability for a short-term boost to car traffic flow, which is ultimately detrimental to our city\u2019s growth and well-being.\n"

        "comment": "So, the provincial government wants to tear out bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University to give drivers a few extra inches of road. They\u2019re pitching it as a way to \u201cget drivers where they need to go faster\u201d\u2014because clearly, the one thing Toronto has been missing is cars moving slightly faster for slightly shorter stretches.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Toronto isn\u2019t just a city of cars. It\u2019s a city of people who walk, cycle, hop on transit, and yes, sometimes drive. Removing bike lanes doesn\u2019t make life easier for the city\u2014it just makes it tougher, riskier, and a whole lot less friendly for anyone not behind a steering wheel. The city needs a transportation plan that works for all Torontonians, not just drivers. Because let\u2019s face it: losing bike lanes isn\u2019t really progress. It\u2019s just doubling down on the traffic jams of yesteryear.\nSo how about we keep Toronto moving forward\u2014for everyone? If we\u2019re serious about speeding things up, there are plenty of ways to do it without sidelining cyclists and pedestrians. A city that values safety, sustainability, and accessibility doesn\u2019t just work better \u2014 it works smarter \u2014 for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This is clear provincial overreach that seems to be more about the premier's failed mayoral bid and his personal commute than doing what's best for all Ontarians. That the premier of Canada's largest province is fixated on three streets in Toronto is shameful and voters like myself will remember come election day.\nLet Toronto and other cities build their own bike lanes. In this era of accelerated climate change, we need to encourage more sustainable transportation, instead of prioritizing fossil fuel-burning cars. I'm surprised that a conservative government has taken this tack, as that political philosophy usually hates such heavy-handed government intervention.\nHighway 413 will carve up the Greenbelt, ploughing up prime farmland and disturbing important habitats like wetlands that we need to help contain flooding, which has worsened in the GTA recently. The accelerated environmental review process, fines for anyone who blocks construction and lack of recourse for landowners are totally unacceptable.\nThe government seems hell-bent on ramming this highway through before more Ontarians realize it won't help relieve congestion, though it will help some wealthy developers. The Minister of Transportation has said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a very clear message that we will do anything and everything to get this highway built,\u201d he said. This statement is supposed to make the government sound strong and committed, but it only reveals its desperation.\nThis legislation and the useless projects it supports are political stunts. I include the proposed 401 tunnel in this, as well. The government is busy trying to find shortcuts to re-election while Ontarians with good jobs are forced to visit foodbanks and live in their cars. The people of Ontario deserve better.\n"

By discouraging the creation of bike lanes, this bill will put me at greater risk AND will force me to drive out on car lanes where I actually WILL interfere with traffic. If you want cyclists like me out of the way of traffic, you should be creating MORE bike lanes not fewer!\nIf you want to address gridlock, you should be encouraging the full range of transportation options to that fewer people take their cars everywhere. Cars cause gridlock, not bikes or bike lanes.\nI also don't understand why a municipality should require Ministry permission to build bike lanes. I thought this government was against red tape!?\nIs this just some kind of cheap political stunt to get commuters in the 905 to vote PC? I hope it backfires!

        "comment": "I believe this proposed bill is against the best interests of Ontario & Toronto residents. There has been a large increase in bike riders in the city, and having dedicated bike lanes is better for these riders AND automobile drivers. There will be no significant drop in bikers in Toronto, so removing bike lanes will put these riders on regular lanes, further slowing down and frustrating automobile drivers. The amount of delivery bikers will not decrease, the number of delivery drivers on regular lanes will simply increase.\nThere has also been numerous tragic deaths of bikers this year, removing bike lanes puts more riders at risk of death and injury.\nThe province should instead focus on building better transit infrastructure to reduce the number of cars on the road, give the people better transit options and they will opt to use it, over driving and increasing gridlock.\nThe current government\u2019s priorities and proposals are misguided and should be refocused elsewhere, rather than wasting time and money removing valuable bike lanes.\n"

I don't want more cars on the road, when people who used to cycle start driving, because they don't feel safe cycling without bike lanes. I don't want to struggle to find parking, because of those same new drivers needing somewhere to park.\nThere's plenty of evidence that bicycle lanes speed up traffic. Removing bike lanes isn't the solution, Doug. Leave municipal issues like this to the municipalities.

Accordingly many jurisdictions are including bicycle lanes on existing roads to help reduce automotive trips. These lanes can also accommodate electric scooters which are being widely promoted by the private sector. If cyclists feel safe on the roads bicycle use will to increase and help offset the need for a second family vehicle, savings families many $thousands per year.\nThere are many  studies to support adding cycling lanes however Ontario hasn't justified its proposed bill with any rear study and should not take the people of Ontario backwards.\n"

Not only should the province not be interfering with city planning, The proposed Bill 212 is misleading. Study after study has shown that bike lanes do not cause gridlock, but rather more and more cars do. If the only option for people to get to work, or the grocery store or school (etc) is to drive then there will be more traffic and more gridlock. Being able to ride your bike instead, means that that is one less car on the road, making traffic move more smoothly for drivers. I know when I\u2019m driving I appreciate seeing people take other modes of transportation. Furthermore, prioritizing car traffic could undermine efforts to create safer, more accessible infrastructure for cyclists and all vulnerable street users. Designing streets primarily for cars can lead more dangerous conditions due to poor design, which increases risks for everyone on the road. Adopting a Complete Streets approach\u2014where infrastructure considers the safety and comfort of all users, including drivers\u2014can make streets safer and reduce stress for everyone. Finally, if municipalities have to get Ministry approval for bike lanes, this could limit local decision-making power in other aspects in the future.\n"
