If none of the common sense, good urban design arguments will change his mind, or that of his constituents, maybe the financial will. Your car insurance payments are going to skyrocket with this idiocy. As this infrastructure blunder leads to higher death tolls and accidents for cyclists, the insurers will be paying out millions more in settlements. Even if you never have a collision, the increased number of incidence in the GTA will affect all vehicles owners over the next few years. There is no good argument for this plan, is possibly saving 3 minutes on your commute worth it?\n"

This bill shows that this government has no respect for the citizens of Ontario and only does what is best for them and their 'buddies'. That is not to even mention the horrid part of this bill that allows skipping environmental impact studies. As a young adult this is the type of legislation which tells me the current government does not care about the future of this province and instead only cares about making those in power richer. They are willing to sell the health and wellness of our planet, our communities and our children to push their own selfish agendas.\n"

The province's proposal takes our city back 15+ years, in relation to the world-class cities around the world. Look at any world class city to see a downtown that provides safe infrastructure for multimodal transportation, improving quality of life for all. Many lives will be lost if these critical infrastructures are removed, and that will be squarely the fault of this provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I remain baffled by the Ontario Conservative government at every turn. This proposed bill is a surefire way to waste money and create more traffic congestion. I would argue that the motivation may be to spend taxpayer dollars on projects that will be completed by firms that certain Members of the Provincial Parliament have a standing interest in.\nIf that is not the case, however, I should also remind you that adding more lanes to highways and roads actually increases gridlock and makes it harder for all people and goods to get where they need to go. This phenomenon is called \"induced demand,\" and we have known about it for some decades now. There is nothing to be gained for Ontarians by expropriating homes and land from already struggling Ontario families or by removing bike lanes that safely carry entire busloads of traffic in the most sustainable manner possible. Rather, it would seem that the Ontario Conservatives are more interested in how much of the taxpayers' time and money can be wasted on pouring more concrete and getting more inefficient, pollutive cars on the road, than actually improving the quality of life for Ontarians.\nMy suggestion would be to scrap this bill entirely, and come up with a different one that would invest in more rail-based regional infrastructure. Railways have been proven, since their inception, to be the most efficient way to move people and goods across long distances.\nUse your common sense, and stop burning my tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who frequently commutes into downtown with a car and is aware of the traffic issues, removing bike lanes is the complete opposite of a 'fix' the bill claims to do. It's pretty clear allowing more space for cars to be on the road does not improve traffic and the 401 is the perfect example. At least anecdotally, more lanes gave more hypothetical car allowance, but it only further increased the problem as we now have more confusion when it comes to cars merging, needing to exit by crossing more lanes etc etc. It would honestly be a better investment to teach drivers how to properly drive since we're all coming from countries of different driving ideologies and the current transfer policies make it too simple for someone to own a license in Canada. This doesn't even speak to the fact that the transit systems in Ontario should just be better in general so that we can have better alternatives to driving, but that's an entirely different can of worms which I'm sure the provincial government is aware of.\nWe should be having options for ALL modes of transportation. The more evenly spread we are in moderation to accommodate the needs of the public the better.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 as proposed, as the removal of bike lanes in the city of Toronto and requiring municipalities to justify maintaining existing bike lanes will have the opposite effect the Ministry of Transportation (the Ministry) is trying to achieve. Not only will this create more congestion and gridlock in the city, but there is serious concern the repercussions of such actions will erode the well-being, safety and movability of the people that live in the city center. We the undersigned raise the following issues, and we strongly urge the Ministry to consider them before moving forward with any actions.\nI.\tBike Lanes Support An Affordable and Timely Mode of Transportation For More Than Just Commuting to Work.\nThe establishment of bike lanes across the city of Toronto over the past decade have provided Torontonians with an affordable and sustainable option to get around the city in a reasonable amount of time for all types of reasons. Toronto residents use bikes as a mode of transportation for number of reasons, not just to commute to work. The Ministry\u2019s proposal to remove bikes is based on information related only to commuting to work and does not account for all other purposes. City residents use bikes to get to school, for deliveries (food and services), run errands including buying groceries, volunteering, exercising, attending social outings and events, exploring the city, and a plethora of other activities. Access and use of bike lanes to get to and/or do these activities provide a viable level of convenience and safety, as well as contribute to the city\u2019s economy. None of these additional reasons are accounted for in the Ministry\u2019s proposal and its analysis. The ministry must undertake a more detailed analysis that goes beyond only measuring commuting to work to support its proposal to remove bike lanes.\nII.\tReference to Census Data That Bike Riders Only Comprise 1.2 percent of People Commuting To Work In Toronto Is Inaccurate and Out of Context.\nMinister Sakaria\u2019s reference that \u201conly 1.2 percent of people get to work using bikes\u201d  is not an inaccurate depiction of city resident\u2019s usage of bikes and bike lanes in the city of Toronto and specifically of the bikes lanes identified for removal in the proposal \u2013 Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. While the reference uses census data, it is taken out of context. Using the same census dataset, a closer look at the city core of Toronto shows the use of bikes and bike lanes to commute to work is 4.3 times higher on average than what the Minister references. An even closer look at the core census Ontario election riding districts, commutes to work using bicycles are even higher with the University \u2013 Rosedale district as high as 8 percent.\nArea / District\tPercentage of City Residents Using Bicycles to Commute to Work\nCity of Toronto Census Division\t1.2\nBeaches \u2013 East York\t3.1\nToronto -Danforth\t6.2\nToronto Centre\t5.8\nSpadina \u2013 Fort York\t4.9\nUniversity \u2013 Rosedale\t8.0\nToronto \u2013 St. Paul\u2019s\t3.1\nSource: Statistics Canada. 2023. (table). Census Profile. 2021 Census of Population. Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 98-316-X2021001. Ottawa. Released November 15, 2023.\nhttps://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/index.cf\u2026 (accessed November 7, 2024).\nAdditionally, the Ministry has not considered commuting distance and time, as it is reflective of bicycle commuting and use of bike lanes. Census data shows that on average 79.3 percent of residents commute to within their census subdivision for work, and 48.3 percent take under 30 minutes to commute under the Toronto census division. These figures dramatically increase when focusing on the core census Ontario election riding districts. With the overwhelming majority of residents in the city core districts commuting for work within their area and taking less than 30 minutes, commuting by bicycle and using bike lanes is practical and viable.\nArea / District\tPercentage of City Residents Commuting to Work Within their Census Subdivision\tPercentage of City Residents With A Commute to Work Time of Less than 30 minutes\nCity of Toronto Census Division\t79.3\t48.3\nBeaches \u2013 East York\t89.9\t45.1\nToronto -Danforth\t89.3\t51.7\nToronto Centre\t87.8\t54.8\nSpadina \u2013 Fort York\t85.9\t55.4\nUniversity \u2013 Rosedale\t90.1\t60.1\nToronto \u2013 St. Paul\u2019s\t89.1\t52.5\nSource: ibid\nThe Minister continues his statement and references that bike lanes are \u201ctaking away 50 percent of the infrastructure on those streets\u201d. There have been no studies cited or published under the Supporting Materials section of the proposal Bill to support this claim. We request the Ministry provide, via publication under the Supporting Materials section, this study and all studies and analysis used to support this claim and this proposal.\nIII.\tRoad Safety and Significant Repercussions for Drivers and Bike Riders\nThe Ministry must consider the potential repercussions of eliminating dedicated bike lanes in Toronto city center and transfer of bike riders now becoming drivers. Removing bike lanes will discourage residents from riding their bikes, choosing to drive themselves or using rideshare services instead. The Ministry must assess the tradeoff and if there is actual value in reducing gridlock here. For example, if 100 bike riders are discouraged from commuting using their bikes because there are no bike lanes, this could result in an additional 100 cars (and drivers) on the road at the same time. This will surely contribute to the gridlock and traffic congestion, the opposite of what the Ministry is proposing to achieve.\nAnother and scarier outcome could be the rise in violence in the form of road rage between drivers and bike riders. The elimination of dedicated bike lanes will only force bike riders onto the main roads with cars creating additional congestion and havoc. Impatience and intolerance from both drivers and bike riders could result in significantly higher incidences of road rage, which could end in police action or even worse, death.\nThe removal of bike lanes will also contribute to increased illegal parking that continues to be a growing problem in the city. Drivers continue to park whenever and wherever they want with no concern for the consequences. There are numerous incidences where cars are parked in no parking lanes, which creates huge traffic backlogs as drivers have to maneuver around these cars. There are no repercussions for these selfish drivers and it\u2019s usually the everyday driver and bike rider that suffers.  A more effective way to alleviate gridlock and traffic congestion would be to enforce parking rules, with immediate action for infractions including towing and fines.\nDedicated bike lanes create a high level of road safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. If cyclists have to share the road with cars, they are often putting themselves at risk. Protected bike lanes separate cyclists from traffic, reducing the likelihood of accidents and making cycling a safer choice for commuters. Dedicated bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, which could lead to fewer accidents and injuries, benefiting all road users in the long term.\nIV.\tSupporting Public Health And Wellbeing And Making Toronto Livable.\nInvesting in cycling infrastructure is not only about transportation\u2014it\u2019s also about improving public health. By making cycling a more attractive and safer option for commuters, it encourages active lifestyles, which have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Maintaining dedicated bike lanes will help encourage more Torontonians to get outside and cycle, leading to healthier communities. This move is an investment in the physical and mental wellbeing of residents, particularly in urban areas where exercise opportunities may be limited.\nBy reducing car dominance in city centers and increasing the space available for pedestrians and cyclists, the city center of Toronto will become more vibrant and livable. Bike lanes make urban spaces more welcoming, quieter, and pedestrian-friendly. With fewer cars on the road, there is less noise pollution and a more pleasant environment for residents and visitors. This kind of urban redesign has improved the overall quality of life, making cities more attractive places to live, work, and visit.\nMany major cities around the world, from Copenhagen to New York City, have already made significant investments in bike infrastructure and have seen positive outcomes in terms of reduced traffic, better air quality, and improved public health. Dedicated bike lanes aligns with these global best practices, positioning the province and city as a leader in sustainable urban planning. By adopting these approaches, Ontario and Toronto will be part of the global movement toward creating cities that are more livable, environmentally conscious, and efficient for all users.\n"

Bike lanes are an essential mode of safe travel for thousands of people. They were installed after years of municipal planning and flow analysis. To remove them will not significantly increase vehicle flow, it will cost millions of dollars in construction costs, and lead to deaths for bikers.\nThis is a false issue the government has concocted to divert attention from poor transit planning. Every urban area that I have visited in Europe and North America has invested significantly in bike lanes to reduce reliance on cars, and they are much better than Toronto's.\nDon't destroy these essential routes Doug Ford!!\n"

        "comment": "B212 is an abysmal proposition for many reasons.\nThe \"bike lane bill\" is a distraction for the many terrible things listed in this proposal that will take away people rights, property, and won't actually solve the problem of traffic.\n1. CARS cause TRAFFIC. Not bikes. You want to relieve traffic? Look at how the rest of the world has successfully done that. By investing in public transportation that everyone will want to use. Not just something that the poor are forced to use. Make public transportation accessible, reliable, and desirable for everyone. Make it a better alternative to driving into the city.\n2. Removing BIKE LANES won't remove the BIKES. The cyclists will just be forced to ride in traffic, making it more dangerous that it already is. Cycles are being killed on streets where there are no bike lanes.\n3. The suggestion that the province can expropriate your property to bring broadband to new areas and don't need to ask if it's OK is a complete breach of peoples property rights.\n4. If the province takes your land to build a highway, you CANNOT apply for an extension. Why are you so insistent on taking people's rights away?\n5.  Highway 413 is exempt from any environmental impact assessments. A terrible idea for many obvious reasons. We are in a CLIMATE CRISIS. And highway 413 will do nothing to relieve traffic.\nHere we go again with the Ford government trying to weasel items into a bill which will remove environmental protections, people's property rights, and cause cycles to DIE on the streets of Toronto. All so they can give more money and power to the developers you made deals with.\nI am furious at this government's wastefulness. 200 million spent to get alcohol into stores one year early? Another 3 BILLION to send $200 checks (bribes) to everyone regardless of need? Disgusting waste of money. Healthcare? Housing? Public transportation? No... instead your priority is \"traffic\", with solutions that will do NOTHING to relieve it.\nThis government should be ashamed.\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly against Bil 212 and here are my reasons.\nI am worried that this piece of legislation will slow down or completely prevent new bike lanes from being constructed on major roads. Every day I bike my 2-year-old daughter to her daycare and I worry about our safety given the several tragic accidents involving a car and a cyclist. A few weeks ago, a friend of ours lost her father to a tragic bicycle accident. He leaves behind his wife, his children and grandchildren who will now grow up without their grandfather. Meanwhile, the driver involved in the accident has not been found. I feel that with this legislation, our lives are not valued.\nBike lanes help people move around, provide an affordable way of transportation and provide safety. I am also concerned that this legislation will mean more bureaucracy and red tape. I find it strange that the Ford government wants to implement a bill that increases red tape when a crucial part of the government's mandate is to REDUCE bureaucray. Also, in light of the affordability crisis, I would hope that the government supports cheap transportation rather than hinder it. Furthermore, I would much rather my tax money go to helping people who cannot afford a car to get around safely, be it through cycling or using public transit.\n"

Removing bike lanes on streets like this will lead to many unnecessary, preventable deaths. I cannot fathom why the premier would go against all available studies and evidence to cause civilian deaths at such a staggering cost. This measure absolutely cannot pass, and rushing it though is highly undemocratic.\n"
