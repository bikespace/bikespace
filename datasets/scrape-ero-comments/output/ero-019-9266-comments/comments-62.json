        "comment": "More lanes for cars will not reduce congestion. It has been proven time and again that the solution lies in public and alternate transportation. If you remove bike lanes cyclists will be forced onto the road, meaning fewer cyclists (more cars and congestion) or increased unsafe cycling conditions for cyclists brave enough to ride with cars. This is more unsafe, and typically means cyclists taking the middle of the road or riding positionally like a motorcycle where cars can not pass until it is safe to do so, which also will not help congestion. The solution proposed is not a solution, it is a boneheaded notion that ignores the facts and seems like a feeble attempt to attract stupid voters and cause division.\n"

Anyone who has lived in their proximity can attest that, after a short adjustment period, traffic  returns to previous levels, is safer, and more predictable.

        "comment": "What is the purpose of this bill? Bad traffic has always existed in Toronto and will continue to do so as the population grows, and now we're entertaining eliminating a safe alternate mode of transport just to placate some of Ford's supporters?\nMeanwhile, three major public transportation lines are delayed indefinitely to the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, healthcare is crumbling, education continues to suffer from cuts and negligence from the province, etc.\nSpending money to eliminate already-built bike lanes in Toronto is the current government's equivalent to Mike Harris filling in already-dug subway tunnels (only for a future tunnel to be re-dug at considerable cost in that same corridor years later), albeit at a smaller scale. It's an egregious waste of taxpayer funds and equate to little more than a vanity project designed to allow Ford a (slightly) quicker commute to Queens Park. Maybe.\nAnd why the constant focus on Toronto municipal affairs from this government? Does the rest of Ontario approve of Ford's laser focus on all things Toronto \u2014 to the point of using taxpayer funds from everywhere in the province to complete these useless projects that only serve to further Ford's petty grudge against the city that rejected him as mayor? Meanwhile, the rest of the province is falling apart just like Toronto is, but Ford only has eyes for the city that spurned him.\n"

        "comment": "The province is overstepping. It is not the concern of a provincial government to police municipal infrastructure. Not to mention that bike lanes reduce traffic by taking people out of cars. It reduces carbon emissions from vehicles. It encourages people to move under their own power and get active rather than remain sedentary and depend on sometimes expensive and unreliable technology.\nThe city has just put all of the money into building the bike lanes. To take them out now is not only a waste of time but a gross misuse of taxpayer money. Doug Ford is not the mayor of Toronto. He wasn't elected by the people of Toronto.\nHe is also, not for nothing, never going to be caught dead on a bike. He should butt out of Torontonian affairs. And maybe get on a bike himself. It would be good for his health.\nI am an avid cyclist. I do not drive and I do not own a car. The TTC is a disaster and I started biking to work because of the Spadina streetcar shutdown. It turned my commute from 40 minutes to 13. They are an important part of city life and should not be removed. They should be expanded. You are living in the dark ages.\nLEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"

The most reliable way to reduce traffic is to incentivize other forms of transportation like transit and bikes.\nBike share Toronto's ridership data tells you all you need to know, this is a rapidly growing service that mirrors the explosive demand for bike infrastructure in Ontario.\nRealistically this isn't meant to legitimately accomplish anything, you have access to the same data as anyone that tells you empirically how fruitless road widening and tearing up bike lanes are. This may play well to your base but it's also a culture war issue that will drive more centrists to the left. Every costly virtue signalling piece of legistlation you introduce to buy off the suburban vote rallies more of the disinterested middle and left of the province. And folks?

I thought conservatives were about removing red tape, not adding more.

        "comment": "This proposal is the perfect example of a poorly thought out solution. Bike lanes are not the reason Toronto has terrible traffic. Toronto has terrible traffic because of the complete lack of infrastructure investment and support the city and province have provided for transportation. This has been slowly been getting worse since I was a child in the 90's You cant expect the population to rise so significantly and just keep the same infrastructure you had with a fraction of the people.\nWhat is going to happen when the bike lanes are torn out and traffic continues to get worse? I assume nothing will happen and our provincial government will start pointing fingers as they always do instead of taking accountability for a poor action plan that cost taxpayers needlessly.\nThis truly emphasizes one of the worst things about modern governments. When you cant solve a problem just pretend to solve it and tell all your constituents that any issues are only there because of the opposition.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation, and sincerely hope the government reconsiders it. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons:\n1. I live near Bloor Street West, outside Dundas West Station, and as a pedestrian I feel significantly safer on the street since the bike lanes were installed (all three phases). The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel. Things likes bike lanes and bulb outs help me and my family feel safe on the sidewalk and when cross the road.\n2. I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3. I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4. It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government pretends to care about, taxes. I am confident that when the government changes, whether that\u2019s in 1,2, or 6 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5. I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

If I was not able to bike on these lanes, I would be driving to work in a car, which I am sure would have the opposite effect of reducing traffic in these areas. Bike lanes REDUCE traffic by reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Why don\u2019t you consider a change that would actually improve car traffic like improving public transit rather than wasting public money ripping up perfectly good infrastructure.\n"

How is this efficient?\nWhy does the legislation pertaining to bike lanes appear to be a personal project by the Premier based on bike lanes near his home?\nProve your suppositions with data. Do bikes lanes make cyclists safer? Is traffic actually much worse because of bike lanes? How is parking affected?  Do cyclists deserve to feel safe?

Are drivers even going to notice that? Countless studies have shown that the Bloor bike lane, for example, has been good for businesses: https://streets.mn/2022/01/26/bikes-and-business-on-bloor/\nAlso, bike lanes save lives. There are so many parents who take their kids to school on bicycles. Removing bike lanes will put them in the mouth of danger.\nThere are other, better ways of addressing gridlock that don't attack all the different ways people chose to travel. Why not tackle parking to address gridlock? There are rows of stagnant cars that are occupying car lanes, causing traffic.\nLet's not take Toronto and Ontario backwards. It's a bit embarrassing that where other major cities around the world --Paris, Montreal, Berlin, Madrid -- are increasing bike lanes, we are going backwards.\nPlease don't put people's lives in danger for a culture war that will do absolutely very little to solve traffic.\n"

By disregarding community needs, it fails to recognize the nuanced, localized solutions that cities require for effective transportation planning.\nNow, more than ever, we must prioritize local decision-making to foster sustainable and safe urban environments. This Bill not only hampers our ability to create accessible bike lanes but also contradicts the urgent need to address climate change and promote green transportation alternatives. The Ontario government should be championing the expansion of bike lanes, not limiting them. We need to invest in sustainable solutions that enhance mobility and support a healthier future for our communities.\n"
