        "comment": "As a driver, a cyclist and a tax payer, I am deeply disappointed in this proposal. Municipalities have the right to decide what traffic management they see fit for their local needs. Bogging the province down in reviewing and approving bike lanes is not an efficient use of tax dollars, and reeks of overreach. Please abandon this idea and focus on fixing the massive gaps in health care and education, the province's 2 core responsibilities.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on Bloor are a major problem in that traffic to access the bedroom communities in eastern Mississauga (ie. Applewood Hille) will be significantly increased.\nProblems with snow clearance (into the bike lanes?) and reduced traffic lanes will result in more local pollution and idling. Buses will bring traffic to a halt with single lanes and no ability to pass. As a resident living close to Bloor Street in eastern Mississauga (near Dixie and Bloor) I have witnessed that the current bike lanes are seldom used during warmer weather and usage is almost nil during the winter months.\nLets not forget that taxes to our fuels in the past have helped pay for the roadways that motorists use. Bikes using such arterial roads need to have insurance and contribute to the upkeep of the infrastructure.\nI support Bill 212 and relocating bike lanes to secondary roads which do not impede the connectivity of traffic between workplaces and arterial roadways!\n"

        "comment": "Here here, it's about time the government came to it's senses. It was heading down the road to dictatorship and that should not be. We are a democratic country - aren't we? The people in Mississauga are fed up giving in to bike lanes either in T.O. or Mississauga when there are hardly any bikes using them. And why were they put on the major roadways instead of secondary roads??? Does not compute at all. We are NOT EUROPE! Not to mention that the majority of cyclists do not adhere to the rules of the road. They feel they are above the law and only slow down at stop signs and if no vehicles are coming they go right through the red light. There is enough congestion in both T.O. and Mississauga that bike lanes would only make this situation worse not to mention that the congestion is not good for the environment. Government - it's time you paid more attention to your constituents! You work for us remember?\n"

That means a lot of pollution and trafic. So called green bike lane is producing just traffic and pollution. No bike lane is a relief to car trafic. The Green activists are just eco-terorists again. Thanks again Ford.\nAdrian from Mississauga.\n"

Please stop the  councillor in ward 3 in mississauga from going through with her proposed bike lanes on bloor st.\nWe the residents do not want this model that will take away 2 car lanes  for the odd biker.\nOur councillor is the only one that wants it. Our boulevards are huge, and surely they could have a design that incorporated the bike lanes in the boulevard.  We the residents have fought this for well over 1 year, and have pages and pages of signatures of the local residents that are against it.\n"

        "comment": "This is completely counter to existing knowledge of developing robust transportation networks that let people travel conveniently and quickly to where they want to go. We should be supporting the use of all different modes of transportation so that people are encouraged to use vehicle-alternative means, which in turn reduces the amount of cars on the roads and contributes to improved traffic. This idea of making it more difficult to install bike lanes and develop a useful cycling network is just going to force people into using cars for trips of all distances and continue to exacerbate traffic issues. If you analyze this through an environmental, equity, safety, city planning, economic, and even a traffic management lens, its obvious that these policies are flawed. Yet instead, this government chooses to support baseless policies and pander to the nonsensical demonization of using a bike to get around for the sake of political posturing.\nFurther, this idea of removing already installed bicycle infrastructure to change into vehicle lanes is absolute lunacy and would be an utter waste of tax dollars. The idea of induced demand is not new and its obvious that the conversion of existing bike lanes into car lanes would only eventually create more traffic. If this government actually wants to do something about traffic issues then they need to make other means of transportation as convenient and accessible as possible by increasing investments into public transit and enabling municipalities to grow active transportation infrastructure, and not create additional barriers. We should be building our cities and streets for people, not for cars.\n"

While many if us sit in traffic for way longer than before this was done, there are barely any people using bike lanes, and this was during the summer months. Now that the canadian long winter starts there won't be any. Logical. You cannot play with city's main artery like Bloor St this way. I wish councilors would've listened to us.\n"

        "comment": "We need more bike lines, not less. Bike lanes should remain a municipal decision, not provincial. Honestly, I think it's none of the provincial governments' business what municipalities do with their local roads. This is a huge overreach. For a government that talks loud about removing red tape, this government has gone a bit wild and wrapped up in it here. Feeling a bit tangled lately?\nWhy is the focus of this proposal only on drivers? With this proposal you are saying that only drivers matter and not users of other methods of transportation. I thought this was the government for the people. I am a person who on different occasions will walk, use my bike, take a bus or drive to where I need to go. This proposal makes it clear to me that for all the times I don't drive, my time is not important to this government. Thanks for making me feel like I don't matter and that my tax dollars are not that important to you. You are just going to do whatever you want, even though it's stupid and not well thought out.\nBike lanes benefit business too - so why would you take away something that benefits businesses? Have you actually talked to any BIAs when drafting this policy? I highly doubt it. I thought the government wanted to support business too? I guess not, you say one thing and then do another. Typical flip-flopping liars all of you. It looks like you don't even know what you are doing.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding bike lanes, please continue with the proposal for requiring municipalities to obtain permission to remove active traffic lanes and install bike lanes, and review recent bike lane installations. Bloor Street in Mississauga is an excellent example of why this legislation is reuired, as the city council is pushing adding bike lanes while there is huge community push back against the bike lane installations. This is not a way to address traffic gridlock and safety. Need for bike lanes should be evidence based, not fulfiling political attempts to gain 'points'.\nRegarding Highway 413, the need for this needs to be evidence based, which appears to be lacking. Putting this 400 series highway through protected greenbelts is wrong on multiple levels.\nImproving public transit so that it is a viable option will go far to solving the ever growing traffic gridlock crisis.\n"

Micromanaging all the cities around the province is a waste of my tax dollars.  Let the local municipal governments deal with bike lanes.  Bike lanes are a good thing since they are environmentally friendly, even the e-bikes are better than the gas guzzling cars.\n"

        "comment": "Please remove bike lanes from major arterial roads in and out of the downtown core (i.e. Yonge St, Avenue Rd/University Ave).  They are just used by food delivery companies using dangerously fast paced ebikes and scooters.  They are also a dangerous blindspot when turning right off a street with one.  When the weather is unfavourable for half the year in Toronto, these do not make sense to be permanent fixtures.  The Yonge St bike lanes from Davisville through Summerhill are dangerous for emergency vehicles, especially for those needing emergency services in the landlocked residential areas only accessible from Yonge St.  Avenue Rd at Davenport has also become a dangerous area to pass through in car or bike.  The repainted lanes are not straight and many people, likely people unfamiliar with the area, do not stay in their lanes causing potential collisions.  The curb lanes that used to go straight are no forced right turn lanes that have become lanes from aggressive drivers to speed through the intersection to cut back into the through lane.  There are plenty of side streets cyclists can use.\n"

        "comment": "What happened to creating government policy based on data rather than vibes?\nGridlock is not solved by adding more single occupancy vehicle lanes, gridlock is solved by re-designing our cities so that the vehicles that NEED to be there can move smoothly, and the people who do not need to drive are enabled by bike lanes, public transit, and safe sidewalks to get to where they need to go. The purpose of our transportation infrastructure is to move PEOPLE, not just cars.\nPlease, could some policy makers look up Induced Demand and read about how adding lanes to roads makes congestion worse.\nRemember, every cyclist in a bike lane is one fewer car ahead of you blocking the lane while trying to turn left during rush hour.\n"
