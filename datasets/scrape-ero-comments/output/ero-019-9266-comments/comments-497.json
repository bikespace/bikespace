        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I don't want this bill to be passed for the following reasons:\n1. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape, slowing down and dictating what municipalities should be doing.\n2. Bike lanes make life more affordable for everyday Ontarians. I allows me to save money on gas, and wear and tear on my vehicle.\n3. I am able to personally help cut down on traffic on the roads, opting to take my bike.\n4. It saves the provincial government money. I get my exercise while getting around town by bike, making myself healthier, and saving the government money by not being a burden on the health care system.\n5. We get more bag for out buck for our transit investments such as the Ontario line. Bike infrastructure makes it easier for me to access transit.\n6. It gives safe options for transportation for the youth. If we have high quality, safe bike infrastructure, our children can get around safer. If we remove it, it becomes more dangerous for them.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous. A waste of tax money that ultimately puts more people in danger in favour of cars. People in the cities want a walkable city, one WITH bike lines. There are many people who rely on bike lanes to commute for work, including the food delivery services. Removing their safety infrastructure, AKA the bike lanes, will cause more pedestrians to experience harassment and danger on the sidewalks because of the bikes and scooters without a designated biking area (I should know because I've experienced that too many times, I've gotten threatened to get ran over by a bike because I didn't move!), not to mention the increased risk for bikes to be on the road with chaotic cars. Too many bicyclists die a year because of vehicular collisions, and bike lanes are important to keep riders safer. Plus, there is already WAY too much construction in Toronto that makes congestion even worse, removing bike lanes would NOT solve anything and most likely add to the problem by creating more traffic-inducing construction. All you would get is an angry public, just like what happened with the Science Centre. If you want to make the public happy and you really want to spend taxpayer money, create MORE bike lanes in cities. Help the environment and encourage people to bike and commute instead of drive. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Downtown Toronto who works and lives in the Downtown Core cycling and walking are the only viable ways to move around the City. The subway is often delayed or severely overcrowded, paying for parking and owning a car is too expensive, and car traffic is too severe.\nI am a resident of Ontario who has recently sold there car and cancelled their monthly metropass to help increase capacity on both of these transportation networks and move around more efficiently. Driving and cycling are often equivalent in the time it takes to get anywhere in the downtown core. Bike lanes were a huge reason why I was able to do this. I ride the Bloor and University Avenue bike lanes multiple times a week, wearing a helmet, and a bike bell. I finally feel safe enough to ride my bike and play my part in reducing congestion on these arterial streets.\nIf bike lanes are removed from these sections it will put cyclists either in the same lane of traffic with cars thereby slowing them down, OR it will require bikes to travel in lanes with parked cars thereby increasing the likelihood of getting doored which kills cyclists and leaves drivers with trauma and potentially charges. Cities know their transportation patterns best, our property taxes pay for our City streets, the Province has no jurisdiction nor any knowledge of travel patterns on this scale. My income taxes pay for highway regulation which is provincial jurisdiction.\nThis is an over reach, a clear bullying tactic and strawman argument and Premier Ford and the Minister of Transportation will have more than just blood on their hands, they will also have brain matter, broken bones, and death on their hands when cyclists are inevitably killed and crushed by 1 ton vehicles that could have been easily prevented by keeping our cycle system.\n"

If you remove bike lanes I will be riding in the middle of the lane at the same pace I do on the bike lanes and I will encourage everyone I know to do the same. If you think removing bike lanes will help with traffic, you are sorely mistaken.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes by Doug Ford is an absurd overstep by our provincial leader. His clear distaste and egregious hatred for the city of Toronto has reached a fever pitch. Vehicle congestion in downtown is not created by bike lanes, it\u2019s created by a lack of reliable sources of transportation that ARE NOT private vehicles. Cyclists in Toronto need safe and reliable ways to get around OUR city and the removal of these lanes will only create more injuries (and deaths) of cyclists and MORE traffic. Doug Ford needs to stay out of this cities business and stop his campaign of hate against us.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives near Yonge Street, this proposal would be directly harmful to me. I use the bicycle lane frequently, and I see it heavily used by others. Aside from making bicycling more dangerous, likely increasing cycling injuries and deaths, replacing the bicycle lane with a vehicle lane would increase traffic by discouraging cycling and inducing demand. This would increase traffic-related air pollution, which is already a problem in the area and causes lung cancer, asthma in children, and other severe health issues. This is an issue we need to take seriously - it's estimated to cause 1200 deaths yearly in Canada. I'm shocked and afraid that the Ontario government would consider a proposal that would make life more dangerous for myself and others in my community just for dubious reasons of convenience.\n"

Over the years, countless studies have shown that providing people with appropriate infrastructure (in this case bike lanes), helps get them out of their cars and on to bikes, thus reducing gridlock for everyone. We have the opportunity to be leaders when it comes to the environment and active transportation, and instead we are doing the opposite. Please listen to the experts and think about the long term positive implications that come from more people using bikes to get around the city safely.\n"

        "comment": "This piece of legislation makes absolutely no sense and would be hugely regretted if it is passed. Multiple studies have shown that bike lanes have no effect on traffic, and that adding lanes of traffic often worsen traffic instead of alleviating it. However, if you REALLY want to add lanes for car traffic, why not remove street parking on major streets? They take up just as much, if not more, space as bike lanes, yet this government has made absolutely no mention of them- why is that exactly? Is it because this is not actually about traffic, but about Premier Ford's odd agenda to rid the province of cyclists as a whole? Unfortunately for him, people will always cycle in this city and this province. With no bike lanes, this just means they'll have to ride in the same lanes as cars- so cars will just get stuck behind them anyways (on top of it being an obvious safety concern).\nAlso, how is this government reconciling the cost of removing these bike lanes? And the fact that while the construction is going on, it will worsen traffic even more?  Surely the money that will be spent on this would be far better off going towards our healthcare system, or perhaps repairing the Ontario Science Centre roof?? I don't understand how this government can say we don't have money to pay nurses and doctors and teachers, and then turn around and put this kind of legislature out. It is very obvious that the real solution to the traffic problem is to get fewer cars on the road- the province could help accomplish this by investing in better public transit and more bike lanes, not fewer. And not just in Toronto, or even the GTA, but all over the province. Cycling has many societal, health and environmental benefits, and this government would be wrong to not encourage it and non-car modes of transportation as much as possible.\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to express my extreme disapproval at the idea of bypassing the Environmental Assessment Act for this and for Highway 413. The idea that you would skip an assessment on a highway that is meant to run through the Greenbelt is absolutely absurd and dangerous. Climate change is real and it is here already, and the fact that this government is willing to contribute to a problem that will affect every single one of its citizens, instead of finding solutions to save our future, is completely baffling. I would urge this government to reassess its plans, and find a better solution that doesn't impede on a municipality's right to govern itself.\n"

        "comment": "Obviously my comment is going to be ignored because Doug Ford doesn't give care about the democratic process and my comment will be ignored because it isn't in favour of this act. This \"saving you time act\" is the most useless act I've seen in a long time (which isn't a very long time to be honest). Bike lanes take cars off the road and frees up lanes for people who actually need to drive. It's a simple geometry problem. Cars take up far more room than other modes of transportation and is a highly inefficient way of getting around. Is this going to also help with traffic on the 400 series highways? Not in the slightest.\nPreventing cities from making their own decisions about what transportation works best for them is going to increase gridlock. You're giving people less options to get around and forcing them to use cars. I can guarantee that this act will a) increase gridlock and b) increase commute times and c) increase pollution. It's also a massive waste of money. You're telling me that you're going to use my taxpayer money to rip up the bike lanes that were already paid for by taxpayer money? I don't want that. Quit wasting money! Quit wasting time with this garbage! Quit distracting from actual issues. Stop trying to be shadow mayor of Toronto. Stop trying to erode democracy.\nI do not support this act in the slightest. All the money wasted on this could be better spent funding transit (including bike lane construction), healthcare and education instead.\n"

        "comment": "The evidence is clear that bike lanes are extremely good public policy. They encourage cycling which benefits public health through physical activity, they reduce noise and the number of cars on the road significantly, and they also help prevent divers and cyclists from colliding, reducing the burden on emergency rooms, insurance, and first responders. If cyclists are forced out of bike lanes and take the full traffic lane as they are legally permitted to do, that will create more problems than keeping them in a dedicated lane. This bill should never see the light of day.\nAlso hiding plans for Highway 413 to expropriate valuable farm and greenbelt land in this bill is shameful. We do not need another highway when we should be investing more in public transit. As well, Highway 407 should be returned to the public.\n"

The bike lanes in Toronto have actively served to reduce car usage and provide a safe way to travel efficiently through the city by many. Everyone knows - and this is well documented by urban planning reserachers for years - that building more roads does not relieve congestion. It just creates more.  I am both a car driver and a bike rider, and these bike lanes are critical infrastructure for this city's transportation options. The Provincial government would be better served investing this money into improving public transportation options to reduce congestion, not to mention housing, which is a way more critical issue. Do not remove bike lines in downtown Toronto. Do not waste money undoing much-needed infrastructure. Do not override local, municipal government and democratic representation by the people. Enough.\n"

I was encouraged by the bike lane improvements along these streets and others over the past year. It is completely disheartening to see this bill, especially given the time, money and resources spent on bike lane improvements on Bloor. It is also discouraging to see that there is no plan to replace these existing bike lanes. A bill like this cannot be considered without a plan to replace these bike lanes and maintain the existing level of cycling infrastructure in the city.\n"
