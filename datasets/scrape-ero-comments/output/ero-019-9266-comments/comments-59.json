        "comment": "Regarding Highways:\nInduced demand has historically negated any benefits from highway expansions within 13-18 months in Ontario. The funds would be better spent on well-designed transit projects, preferably elevated and high-speed transit. Elevated transit, ideally consisting of inverted trains, would allow the area above the track to be used for wind and solar energy capture. This design also better protects the concrete from the elements, reducing issues like those seen with the Gardiner Expressway.\nMoreover, elevated trains can double up on roads without affecting traffic. High-speed rail can more easily navigate the lack of acceptable corridors for true 250 km/h+ rail. Both high-speed and local elevated transit should offer local, local express, and express modes with well-coordinated timetables to encourage people to leave their cars and enjoy their commute by reading a book or relaxing.\nRegarding Bike Lanes:\nProperly designed bike lanes are not just a transit concern; they are public safety infrastructure. For example, the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond in Toronto provide transport for an additional 400 people per rush hour, compared to only about 80 for an additional car lane due to exit ramps. Additionally, ambulances and other emergency services use the current infrastructure to bypass cars that cannot move out of the way during emergencies. Lives will be lost if these lanes are removed. Rescue equipment will be blocked, and fire engines will be unnecessarily deployed and stuck when a faster supervisor vehicle could access the site if an engine is not needed.\nMunicipalities should build infrastructure for their own citizens and know best where to place it without provincial bureaucratic overhead. Providing funds for public safety and transit infrastructure will allow people to travel without the stress and hardships of driving, improving the quality of life for everyone. Those who still drive will benefit from reduced traffic if the money is invested in public safety and transit infrastructure.\nOverall Impact of the Bill:\nThis bill, in its current form, only guarantees more gridlock, reduces mobility, and will create enclaves where people are locked into their neighbourhoods.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a gross governmental overreach into municipal affairs. Rather than spending money to fix our crumbling health care and education infrastructure, this government is hell-bent on throwing money to remove completed bike lanes and thwart the construction of proposed measures that can move more people at once. I am disappointed in this government\u2019s inability to spend responsibly and make decisions based on factual information and not emotion.\nI am vehemently opposed to this proposition as a resident of the City of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act - is an unwarranted intrusion into local government decision-making, and should be withdrawn. The stated purpose - to reduce traffic gridlock - will not be served by obstructing the use of bike lanes, and the removal of bike lanes will put cyclists at risk.\nI am a former Ottawa City Councillor (2000-2010) who has gone through Official Plan reviews and Transportation Master Plan approvals in the City of Ottawa, involving both expert and public input and review. City Council has the mandate to develop and maintain transportation networks within the city and is responsible to its taxpayers and electorate for this. The City promotes active transportation in its policies, which includes walking, cycling and public transit. The City has determined that the establishment of bike lanes meets its goals of encouraging bicycle use and enhancing safety. There is no need or justification for provincial interference here.\nThe cause of traffic gridlock is cars. The Province should be encouraging the use of other modes of travel such as walking, cycling and public transit to mitigate traffic gridlock. Removing bike lanes will increase car use, defeating the purpose of this bill.\nLastly, the requirement in Bill 212 to require a provincial environmental assessment for every application to establish bike lanes in every municipality in Ontario will create a bureaucratic nightmare. Local government uses a public process in creating safe bike lanes, permitting public input, and is held accountable for its actions by its electorate. This way local needs on local streets are met by local government. Provincial over-sight is not needed here. Provincial accountability for decisions affecting the varied circumstances found in every municipality is weak to non-existant.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal conflicts with both data and common sense.\nWe still see street parking on arterial roadways, sometimes on both sides of the road, often available in rush hour. Of course, a single lane of street parking is roughly twice as wide as a single bicycle line. In the interest of prioritizing the many over the few, why wouldn't the province impede municipality's ability to create/maintain street parking that blocks the flow of traffic? All other things equal, the problem is 2x worse than bike lanes - not to mention that bike lanes facilitate moving traffic whereas parking doesn't.\nAs the data show, the presence of reliable cycling infrastructure reduces automotive traffic and increases cycling traffic which reduces automotive congestion while  providing a lower-cost alternative to travelers.\nLastly, how could the province possibly be a better arbiter of suitability on municipal roadways?\nCyclists will still use the roads - the more travelled the road, the better everyone is served. Bikes are frustratingly slow to car drivers - cars are fatally dangerous to cyclists. The pattern holds for other mid-speed vehicles (which are increasing in prevalence) like e-bikes, electric assist bikes, scooters, etc.\nThis proposal is dangerous, counterproductive and narrow-sighted.\n"

        "comment": "A spectacular waste of taxpayer's money given the amount already spent on bike lanes to date and the complete lack of evidence that removal of the lane will improve gridlock. This will also create extra red tape - ironic from a goverment that claims to want to reduce it.\nTo solve the problem we need multi-modal alternatives to car travel, not increased car numbers. You'd swear that \"induced demand\" was a foreign concept to the ideologues behind this ill-considered political stunt. We are considering legal challenges to this insanity. They will be well planned and well-funded. And may we say, high profile challenges.\n"

        "comment": "My thoughts are regarding the portion of Bill 212 dealing with Bicycle Lanes.\nIt is my opinion that the provincial government should leave decisions regarding municipal infrastructure to the municipalities. I believe that the municipalities know their infrastructure and needs of their constituents best. Also, I believe that the Provincial government should focus on issues within their jurisdiction such as Health Care and Education.\nI am a resident of Kitchener-Waterloo. I travel within my city by car, by bicycle, and by foot.\nThank-you for considering my opinion.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal looks to be a waste of both time and money, as well as a massive overreach by the province. Local governments understand their own traffic needs and should be trusted to make these decisions without provincial interference. Adding an extra layer of approval will only delay projects and drive up costs. Forcing municipalities to gather and submit information about existing bike lanes will create more bureaucracy and financial strain, especially for smaller towns/cities with fewer resources. This will divert funds from actual infrastructure projects to unnecessary paperwork.\nFinally, I am distressed to have provincial leadership with seemingly no awareness of urban planning successes in other cities, states, and countries. There have been countless studies that suggest that bike lanes do not cause gridlock and may even improve overall traffic flow: the NYC DOT studies, SF's Valencia St, the Portland State University study, the Copenhagen studies ... the list is quite literally endless. Ontario's provincial leadership seems to be stuck in a 1970's mentality about urban planning, which is a disturbing realization.\nIn 2024, it should be more than obvious that we should be fast-tracking sustainable transportation like bike lanes, not slowing them down with red tape. This proposal feels like a step backward, wasting time and money instead of supporting local efforts to reduce car dependency and promote healthier communities.\n"

        "comment": "We don\u2019t need to reduce bike lanes to reduce gridlock. What we need instead is to invest in better public transportation. Move the buses into a separate lane, make more stops for the train and why the hell is the streetcar sharing the street with cars. Just look to cites in Europe.\nI actually took this summer the bike way more because of bike lanes. If you reduce them, you have one more car added to the street.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is overreaching and ineffective. Removing bike lanes is moving Ontario backwards, and the bill includes anti-labour action.\nFirst, bike lanes save lives. We have rigorous standards for how a car should be protected in the event of a collision, where are cyclists are less worthy of safety? In Toronto alone, 6 people died so far this year for choosing to take a convenient, healthy, carbon free method of transportation - because their safety was deemed unimportant by their government.\nSecond, bike lanes actually reduce traffic congestion (see link 1). Every person taking a bicycle is one person not taking their car. It has been proved countless times, in countless places. More people ride bicycles when there is safe infrastructure, and this reduces the number of car trips, reducing traffic.\nRemoving the bike lanes would increase traffic congestion. To improve traffic, instead consider removing/moving on-street parking, actually completing provincial transit projects, implementing congestion pricing, fining developers whose construction blocks streets for long periods, increasing budget for fining drivers stopping/blocking where they shouldn't.\nAdditionally, someone riding a bike past a business are more likely (and able) to see and stop in to that business. Bike lanes actually increase the number of incident customers at nearby businesses. When you see an appealing cafe on Bloor, quickly locking up the bike and going in for a coffee is faster than parking.\nAnd of course bicycles do not emit CO2 or require electricity to get people where they are going. A green, net zero Ontario (with better local air quality!) depends on more people safely taking their bicycle instead of their car.\nFinally, Bill 212 includes some anti-labour action designed to overstep concerns by involved engineers about the Highway 413 project. (Link 2).\nIn conclusion, the time and resources spent on this Bill could be much better spent. This is an overreach of municipal affairs, and will worsen safety, congestion and pollution on our city streets.\n"

        "comment": "This whole proposal is absurd.  There a many, more modern, cities than Toronto that have not only embraced bike lanes because they care more about valuing human lives than commute times--but also they value smart design over lazy management.  Ford created enough problems when he was a part of city council, I'm sorry that he feels personally put-upon that his commute times are lousy, but bike lanes aren't the problem, and the data won't back him up.\nI'd hate to turn to liberals to correct this, but Ford needs to get over himself if the Conservatives are going to be a force for good in this province.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill introduces significant financial risks to the province and local municipalities. Rejection of new cycling infrastructure, and the costly removal of existing infrastructure, does not resolve any of the geometric issues associated with congestion and road capacity that is primarily due to the space needed for motor vehicles.\nSingle-occupant, larger, passenger vehicles, and, perhaps more importantly, somewhat unregulated rideshare and delivery vehicles occupying curbside lanes are main culprits.\nRemoving dedicated facilities for alternative forms of transportation makes these options unavailable, requiring users to default to using their car or truck, adding more single-occupant vehicles to already congested corridors.\nLegislators are strongly encouraged to learn more about \"induced demand\" and the benefit of alternative transportation facilities. This proposed legislation has the potential to dramatically impact the fiscal resiliency and safety of communities, the transportation network, and province. Please do not proceed with this.\n"

We need LESS red tape preventing our city from improving cycling infrastructure, the opposite of what this bill will do. Enabling our citizens to get around safely by sustainable means of transportation like cycling should be a top priority for both the province and the city. More, better, and safer cycling infrastructure will result in more people choosing to cycle, which will mean less cars on the road and less traffic congestion in the long term. Please do not allow this bill to pass.\n"
