        "comment": "Spending money to get rid of bike lanes that were just constructed is an incredibly wasteful use of taxpayer money, will cause construction blockages for weeks making traffic much worse, and is a political stunt by Ford to win suburban voters who will never drive on Bloor, University, or Yonge.\nThis is a distraction from his political corruption involving Ontario Place, the Greenbelt, and Highway 413.\nThe data shows bike lanes do not increase commute times, and adding lanes to these downtown arterial roads will just induce more demand and traffic will quickly become the same or worse than it already is.\nBusinesses along these roads have seen increased transactions. Removing the bike lanes will cause more biking and pedestrian deaths and keep Toronto a second class city.\nIf you want to increase road efficiency get rid of free and subsidized parking on major roads such as Dundas, where on parked car reduces the road from tow lanes to one for all road users.\nBike lanes do not cause traffic. The Gardiner is the greatest example of induced demand, commuters are struck on the Gardiner all day and there is not on bike lane to be seen.\nIf these bike lanes are removed so Prabmeet Sarkaria can feel better driving from Brampton, through Toronto and all the residents and users of the bike lanes, people will die and get injured on our roads, and Ford and MP Sarakaria will be responsible.\n"

        "comment": "This is an Orwellian situation because you don't eliminate bike lanes to reduce gridlock - reducing bike lanes will INCREASE gridlock. It's not just obvious to the eye and basic logic it has been proven time and time again in studies throughout the globe. It has been proven with hard data that local businesses benefit from bike lanes. It has been proven that cyclists - and motorists - are safer when there are protected bike lanes.\nTake out bike lanes and what happens? Some cyclists continue to cycle but they are now in regular traffic lanes. That doesn't help traffic and is not safe for the cyclist and the cyclist is now travelling slower than they would have otherwise. Other cyclists use their car instead, adding to gridlock. What did you expect?\nYou have to be insane to think that removing bike lanes would reduce gridlock. I expect my government to make decisions based on facts and evidence and logic, not emotional outbursts that make no sense. This proposed act is both obscene and absurd.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is an evidence free direct assault on the health, welfare, and commuting convenience of cyclists throughout the province, although principally targeted at those in Toronto. The legislation is motivated by the elected government\u2019s desire to gin up its base rather than for a legitimate legislative purpose, and the government is prepared to kill and injure cyclists to do so, all while meddling in municipal affairs. Bike lanes, and in particular fully separated bike lanes, have been proven, statistically, time and time again, to:\n(1) improve safety of all road users;\n(2) not increase vehicle travel times materially, and sometime to reduce them a bit;\n(3) make vehicle traffic more regular and safer because vehicles (and bikes) are not changing lanes;\n(4) increase revenues for businesses located along bike lane routes; and\n(5) not interfere with emergency service vehicles or their time of response.\nThe elected government knows all of this. The bureaucracy knows all this. But the elected government, led by politicians who wouldn\u2019t ride a bike if their lives depended on it and who view life only through the windows of their SUVs and pickup trucks, is choosing to ignore this evidence so it can kill and injure cyclists and thereby gain applause from people who likewise ignore all evidence in favour of political messaging and spin.\nThis bill is an outrage and should be withdrawn immediately.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are under municipal jurisdiction because they are built to serve the people of the municipality. The Ontario Government's proposal to impose provincial interference in the construction of bike lanes comes as the latest in a long line of efforts to force municipal governments (especially those representing large cities) to make transportation decisions that cater not to the people of the municipality, but for people living outside of the municipality, who wish to be able to drive straight from their front doors in the suburbs to the hearts of our cities without being inconvenienced by those of us who live along the way.\nThere's a problem with this policy direction, though, which is that people DO live along the way. Furthermore, those people pay the property taxes that build and support the infrastructure that you wish to co-opt on behalf of suburbanites who contribute nothing to our city but smog and congestion. Strong-arming municipalities into spending our tax dollars to subsidize the convenience of non-residents at the expense of our quality of life is the paragon of authoritarianism.\nIt's also well-known that adding vehicle lanes does not improve congestion (I've linked studies). However, if you're interested in actual solutions, I have suggestions! Firstly, encourage those residing in satellite communities around major urban centres to try out our public transit systems. In my home city of Toronto, parking lots at TTC stations like Victoria Park and Kipling sit at half capacity all day, while the commuters for whom they were built blame cyclists for the congestion that they themselves produce. Additionally, you can encourage all those that lament the existence of the seemingly unused bike lanes while sitting in an endless line of traffic to do something unimaginably radical: get a bike! Those lanes seem empty because they allow the bikes within them to traverse our urban centres at speeds drivers can't even imagine. There is nothing stopping the vast majority of drivers from choosing to cycle instead. Even the aforementioned suburbanites could simply toss their bike into the back of their Ford F-250 Superduty Offroad 4x4 Military-Grade pickup truck that they somehow feel is suitable for daily use in an urban setting, drive to one of the vast commuter lots our tax dollars make available for them, and cycle from there.\nIn short: our cities are for the people that live in them. They are not for you to wrestle from us with heavy-handed policy designed to pander to the blue-voting regions that view urban centres like theme parks built for their entertainment. Diversity of transit options is the only way forward; taking away our freedom of choice helps no one.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill will not reduce gridlock. The only solution to congestion and gridlock is viable alternatives to car driving (of which bike lanes are one alternative).\nInduced demand is an already established fact in the transportation planning. When you build more lanes (or build more parking), more people are encouraged to drive.\nInduced demand is when the supply of a good is increased which reduces the cost of the good and encourages (induces) more people to use the good. When cities and provinces add more roads, highways, car lanes, and car interchanges, the costs to driving are initially reduced (Hymel 2019, Mann 2014). These costs to driving usually take the form of reduced time for getting around by car. However, people are encouraged to drive and roads are then returned to their previously congested state (but now with higher infrastructure maintenance costs). Induced demand also occurs when new roads encourage new housing and business development. These developments are usually centred around cars, further exacerbating congestion (Hymel 2019, Mann 2014).\nInduced demand also works for other transportation modes including bicycling. When bicycling becomes safe and easy (usually because protected bike lanes have been added), more people will choose to bicycle over driving.\nAnother key point is the geometry of cars versus bikes (Will, Cornet, & Munshi 2020). Cars are very large and usually carry one person. Bikes on the other hand are highly space efficient. Consequently, bike lanes can move many more people per square meter than car lanes (Will, Cornet, & Munshi 2020). That is how you reduce gridlock by moving more people per square meter.\nTo reiterate, this bill will make gridlock worse, not better. This bill should be retracted. Instead, we need to build more protected bike lanes and add bus rapid transit lanes (along with improving intercity and within city public transit).\nSources:\nHymel, K. 2019.

        "comment": "As a tax paying Ontarian who uses multiple methods of transportation throughout the city including driving, subway, and cycling, I vehemently oppose this bill as the evidence suggests that this in fact will not improve gridlock and may even increase it.\nWhen cyclists are forced out of bike lanes and into shared traffic lanes, it slows everyone down and increases the risk of accidents. I find this bill to be extremely irresponsible and believe it will result in risks to safety.\nFinally, I feel this bill is a gross overreach by the provincial government - as municipalities across Ontario have vastly different needs, cycling infrastructure and road use should be decided at the municipal level in order to attend to these demographic and structural differences.\n"

        "comment": "I wanted to lend my voice to the many others in opposition to this proposal.\nThere is no compelling evidence I am aware of that demonstrates, beyond a reasonable doubt, that bike lanes meaningfully add to traffic.\nMoreover, I think that whether bikes are or are not helpful to traffic in Toronto SHOULD be utterly irrelevant. The province should not be dictating the policy of individual municipalities - Toronto has their own elected officials who represent their respective constituents - the idea that the province should be able to intervene in Toronto affairs on behalf of people who are not residents SHOULD be criticized.\nNot only is the elimination of bike lanes expensive for tax payers, not only is it wrong on an evidentiary, not SHOULD it be considered an overstep of authority, its also something that distracts from more important matters and makes streets more dangerous for pedestrians and bikers and pollutes the environment.\nMore bikes on the road means fewer cars - which means less congestion. End of story.\nMoreover, it is extraordinarily regressive for urban planning. Present orthodoxy - seen in most higher municipalities and metro areas now internationally - is that INTENSIFICATION coupled with efficient metro systems and linkage is the best way to make use of land. There's only so much land, and encouraging sprawl with low density housing and highways instead of HIGH density uses + metro systems means more tax money drained towards maintaining infrastructure to support these less efficient land uses.\nDo not support this policy. Please.\n"

        "comment": "The very fact that provincial politicians and the Premiere of Ontario are even talking about bike lanes is a huge overstep of governance.  Our Premiere and his administration should instead focus on restoring funding to public healthcare, schools, regional transit and other Ontario-wide issues.  If he wants to get involved in local municipal politics he should resign from the Premiership and run for mayor or city councillor.\nIn the year 2024, where we are in the midst of a climate crisis, an affordability crisis and gridlock, in what planet does it make sense to remove bike lanes, one of the only options for people to commute quickly, affordably and efficiently taking up so much less valuable real estate in our cities that single occupant vehicles.  Single-occupant vehicles are the issue causing traffic, not bikes and bike lanes.  As our cities continue to grow, its only going to get worse unless better options like bike lanes and efficient transit options are available.  Relying on single-occupant vehicles is not a sustainable solution for the future.\nI also despise the rhetoric that Cyclists are second-class citizens compared to motorists.  Why does someone driving a car get priority for road use over someone on a bicycle? Cyclists are taxpayers, business owners, customers and most importantly citizens of Ontario and need to be treated with the same level of respect by our governments.  The adversarial nature of the way that this government speaks about cyclists continues to create divisions which may ultimately lead to fatalities when people are jostling for space on our roads.  The blood of future cyclist fatalities will be on the hands of this administration.\n"

We sold one prior to moving because the transit and cycling infrastructure we knew to be good. After being back, we\u2019re in the process of selling the second car because the bike lanes are so much better than we expected.\nThese bike lanes (specifically on Bloor, Shaw and Wellington for us) have directly led to us not adding traffic to the roads.\nIf the bike lanes are removed, we may wind up driving more which will add to the congestion.\n"
