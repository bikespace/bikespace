        "comment": "This proposal is a disgrace. I, and thousands of other cyclists, use these bike lanes daily to get in and from work. I make much better time cycling than using public transport or driving, which by definition  improves productivity and, in turn, the local economy (I get to work quicker, and can leave later). Surely we should be encouraging a diversification of transport in and around the city to reduce congestion?\nPlease reconsider this. What happens when bicycle related deaths increase in these areas? It will be very easy to point to this decision as the cause, which will clearly make for poor optics (which is clearly a concern you place above the health and safety of cyclists in the city).\n"

        "comment": "The proposal presupposes that adding more lanes for drivers is all it takes to solve the city's congestion issues. While this makes some intuitive sense to someone who doesn't know anything about traffic flow theory, it's shockingly simplistic as the basis for a government proposal, and it simply isn't true in general. I have seen no data from the provincial government to back up their assertion, and while Premier Ford claims that removal of the bike lanes is \"very popular\" with voters, I strongly believe that those of us who actually live in the affected areas think differently.\nI have no doubt that narrowing roads can make congestion marginally worse. The trap is in thinking that a marginal improvement is some kind of solution. It's not. You'll disrupt the commutes of many thousands of people, spend untold millions, and for what - a 10% improvement in commute times? Maybe 20%? How long will that last when folks who previous commuted by bike give up and start driving? Does the government have its next scapegoat lined up already?\nI grew up in Toronto's west end, live in downtown Toronto now (just a humble apartment renter, thanks), and I make use of the Bloor Street bike lanes virtually every day, whether it's to run errands, visit my parents, or head to work and classes. Ditto for the University lanes. They are a treasure and the city desperately needs more of them. Their use is growing year after year - people who actually live in Toronto want alternatives to driving.\nI also have many less-than-fond memories of being stuck in downtown gridlock on a Greyhound while heading down from Kitchener-Waterloo for the weekend. That was over ten years ago, and there weren't any bike lanes to blame then. Even today the transit options for getting between Toronto and KW are a sad joke - when is the province going to do something about that? Right now the best option by far is to drive. What a shame for all the students and tech workers who do so much to contribute to Ontario's economy, today and in the future. No wonder so many of us pack up and go to the US. This proposal makes me want to move back - I'd have to start driving again, but hey, what's the difference?\nI humbly suggest that the provincial government spend its resources more wisely and focus on infrastructure that will serve us for the next fifty years, not pander to the whims of drivers who live far outside the city, who think that their problems will be gone after some easy \"win.\" Cars cause traffic. When everyone drives downtown every day, there will be congestion, bike lanes or not. Please focus on serious solutions instead of pandering.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not ease grid lock, and it will only make it worse. Less bike lanes will mean more people on the road. Additionally cars do not get stuck behind cyclists. It will also make it less safe for cyclists and drivers.

        "comment": "The proposed legislation requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes that remove a lane of traffic will be detrimental to the functioning of cities. Increasing bike lanes increases the number of people who commute via bike instead of car. Cars take up significantly more space on the road and cause significantly more wear and tear. By increasing bike lanes, car traffic will decrease as more people choose to instead use safe and efficient active transit. The more people cycling instead of driving means people are more likely to frequent local businesses, improving local economies and making cities more livable.\nIn addition, the city should not be infringing on the rights of municipal governments to decide what is best for their constituents. Municipalities know best what is optimal for their residents. The province should instead focus on improving services under provincial legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes from Toronto is an absolutely horrendous idea that isn\u2019t supported by any data whatsoever. The number of lanes doesn\u2019t dictate traffic congestion and it\u2019s clear the Doug doesn\u2019t understand that. This is an abhorrent idea and needs to be shot down, it would most likely increase traffic since having multiple car lanes means more people changing lanes and losing dedicated turning lanes which slows everyone down! All while simultaneously putting cyclists at risk. It makes no logical sense at all and it\u2019s being brought up by someone with absolutely no knowledge of traffic systems. This is a terrible idea that will undoubtedly be fought against by Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Bike infrastructure has been demonstrated over and over again to be critical to the well being of increasingly dense cities like Toronto. The current administration has, throughout its history, made many policy decisions against the interests of the public and against reason, all because it feels like it's helping. If this bill passes, the Ford administration will once again demonstrates its inability to think and act critically.\nIt's not even about the blatant corruption this administration has already demonstrated. Passing this bill would be the same as passing a bill to dam a river because you want to cross it: senseless, devastating, and absurd: the Ford administration trademark.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about Bill 212\u2019s attempt to restrict bike lanes and the recent news that several bike lanes in Toronto will be removed at the taxpayer\u2019s expense.\nBike lanes save lives. Bike lanes improve traffic for everyone, including cars. Bike lanes are better for business. Studies from around the world prove it \u2014 and are readily available via reputable institutions.\nWhy is the provincial government concerned with something that benefits us all, and is already well-handled by individual municipalities who have more information and insight? Especially when education, healthcare, and other institutions under the province\u2019s purview are severely underfunded?\nBut even if all that doesn\u2019t matter to the government \u2014 the waste of MY money to remove bike lines which have been recently installed, and the idea that the provincial government would spend my money performing redundant work to approve or deny every municipality\u2019s proposed bike lanes is, quite frankly, ridiculous.\nAnd I don\u2019t even own a bike.\nI strongly oppose this bill.\nPS: I also couldn\u2019t help but notice that this bill also suggests waiving the requirement for an environmental study on the potential Highway 413. This highway would save commuters roughly two minutes of driving time, but the environmental impacts would affect many, many more Ontarians due to increased flooding\u2014 which would be readily apparent in an official environmental study.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern:\nI would like to express my immense concern with the proposed Bill 212.\nFor context, I am a female in my mid-30s. I have lived in the University-Rosedale district for the past 11 years and have previously lived in the Eglinton-Lawrence district, Montreal, Europe, and the Middle East. My preferred mode of transportation in recent years is walking when possible.\nI sincerely hope the government reconsiders the proposed legislation for the following (non-exhaustive) list of reasons:\n1) As a pedestrian living and working near many of the recently installed bike lanes, (Bloor Street, College Street, Yonge Street, University Avenue), I spend almost all of my commuting time along these corridors and feel much safer since the installation of the bike lanes, whether I am walking, driving, taking public transportation, or biking.\n2) I am concerned about bike rider safety. This year has been the deadliest year for bike riders in Toronto. I think it would behoove the government to encourage further safety measures rather than remove them.\n3) Real-world utilization of these bike lanes is evident. Also, I have met many people who have started to commute by bicycle because they finally feel safe enough to do so. Furthermore, a well-developed bike-lane network will ultimately relieve congestion and benefit motorists. There are countless studies that support this. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting them is not going to achieve the desired outcome.\n4) I am troubled by the idea that the provincial government would waste tax dollars on removing and discouraging progressive infrastructure. Any infrastructure that is removed will surely be reinstalled as the developed world moves towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate congestion, climate change, and to improve population health. I also believe that municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province.\nThis proposed legislation is not informed by data. It is regressive, dangerous to our most vulnerable users of the road, short-sighted, and will result in the unnecessary use of tax-payer dollars. If the intention behind Bill 212 is to \u201creduce gridlock and save time\u201d, perhaps the Ontario government can make data-driven decisions and take cues from cities and countries that have done so successfully, such as the Netherlands. Obviously fewer cars within the downtown core will alleviate congestion (thus embracing and investing in public transit and encouraging active transportation would be beneficial), but traffic movement can be cost-effectively be optimized by: (1) programming traffic signals that minimize conflict and reduce the number of times that any road user will cross the path of any other road user while optimizing the movement of as many people as possible, not just car users; (2) using traffic dependent detectors (which detect real time traffic and govern lights accordingly) as opposed to detection circuits currently used; (3) programming traffic signals to work independently (multi-phased lights) which safely allow for efficient movement of multi-direction traffic; and (4) transit signal prioritization.\nI am rationally struggling to understand the government\u2019s decision to introduce this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote. Thank you for considering my response to this proposed legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal ignores all city and traffic planning principles, shows the province has little to no expertise on municipal planning and further indicating this proposal is a inappropriate jurisdictional over reach. I will elaborate the issues below:\n1. This proposal ignores the traffic planning principle that remove bike lane or move them to less convenience location encourages more motor traffic onto the street, worsen gridlock by adding traffic.\n2. This proposal ignores the traffic planning principle that put safety first. Traffic throughput should always be secondary to safety. Remove protective infrastructure is inevitably going to lead to more injury and fatality.\n3. A study on Bloor street shows increasing in spending when bike lane is put in. Many new development advertising \"bike score\" and many business rely on bike lane for logistic. Neighborhood grown with bike lane now will face inevitable decline if bike lane are removed.\n4. Last, the sprite of this proposal seems to be prioritizing the need of through traffic of a city by sacrificing the need of local communities. Should this not be the other way around?\n"
