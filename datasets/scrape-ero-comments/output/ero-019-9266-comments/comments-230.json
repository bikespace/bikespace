        "comment": "This really is poorly thought out. Removing bike lanes is a temporary fix, if that. It will both encourage and force more people to use cars. There are only so many lanes of traffic you can squeeze into an urban environment. Traffic will soon grow beyond what can be accommodated, with or without bike lanes. We should begin making the decisions necessary to reduce future gridlock by creating alternative options to driving. These options include better public transit and encouraging remote work. It's time we brought services to were people live, not force people to drive downtown to support business. Businesses must adapt.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is discriminatory. It prioritizes the right of drivers over that of cyclists in use of public pathways. It claims to aim at fixing gridlocks, but intends to do so solely at expense of the safety of cyclists and at no cost to motorists which are treated as though were the owners of the roads. The justifications are entirely absurd, obviously political, and based on no proper studies. The province is overriding jurisdictions to revert a handful of recently constructed bike lanes in favour of motorists without even considering *any* restrictions on vehicles themselves. There are no thoughts on restricting the ever growing car sizes, limiting the number of vehicles entering the city during working hours, promoting car sharing by levying charges to single passenger cars. Any hillbilly has a god given right to drive a three ton tank into the core of downtown from anywhere in the conservative voting suburbs without feeling stupid when cyclist zoom by. It\u2019s pathetic. Toronto is turning into a 3rd world city rapidly in about every aspect and here comes an imbecilic idea which has identified the one tiny area where the progress hasn\u2019t been downright negative and try to revert it.\n"

I\u2019ve lived in downtown Toronto for more than 35 years and have had a bike lane on my street for most of that time.\nBike lanes don\u2019t cause traffic congestion, lone occupants driving cars create traffic.   Until we get better transit options it is silly to think traffic will get better with more cars and drivers vying for the same space.   Walking and cycling are far more efficient transportation modes and ought to be encouraged.  Particularly during a global climate crisis.\n"

        "comment": "A couple of huge issues front and centre with this proposal.\nWhile gridlock is a huge problem and we as Ontarians should be duly concerned, the proposal is rife with bad policy. Its quite honestly terrible. Anyone that both drives and cycles will agree.\nThe focus needs to not just be on improving existing infrastructure for cars by building much needed highways, but also really doubling down by focusing on transit. Thats the biggest denominator as to reducing traffic in our city.\nOne: Removing the bikelanes in those main arteries will not have any meaningful impact to reducing traffic. In fact it could induce more demand. Kindly refer to research online that has been supported ad nauseam by well researched sources.\nAlso, are cyclists really going to move off the roads without the bike lanes? I admire the trust this government has in our drivers and cyclists co-existing peacefully, but it would be prudent to not do so. 9x more accidents to cyclists happen without bike lanes.\nTwo: Instead of removing bikelanes, we should remove street parking in these main arteries. This will open up 2-3 extra, measurable lanes to speed up traffic. They can also co exist with bikelanes. We could always have more parking in the side streets, and Green P lots. Designated load/unload and accesibility zones can remain.\nThree: There needs to be a renewed focus on streetcar priority for improved commute times. Faster streetcars/improved times = lower reliance on cars which gets more drivers off the road.\nWe could do so via signal prioritization given we already have the systems in place for it. Transit lanes that are strict, melbourne style left turns. We should almost be like converting streetcar stops to LRTs. By speeding streetcars up, we will be able to encourage higher ridership.\nFinally, when is the crosstown going to open? This will really speed things up.\nLet's encourage transit and pedestrianisation of Toronto, and not a regression to the dreadful car centricism of the 70s.\nIf even Detroit, the Motor city is implementing policy to pedestrainising their city and making downtown super walkable, no excuses for why we cannot do so.\n"

        "comment": "I use the bike lanes in Toronto to get to work, school, parks, and places to shop (groceries, places of recreation, etc.). It is an important part of my commute, and this bill would fundamentally worsen congestion and harm the environment across this province, both now and in the future.\nThe increasing prevalence of Bike Share Toronto across this city at a reasonable price has made cycling an attractive alternative to transit or part of a multimodal transportation network. For example, it is sometimes faster (or comparable) to walk to my nearest Bike Share station, ride a bike to the nearest TTC station, and catch the Line 2 train to reach my destination. On Bloor Street, parts of the Junction, or even Harbord and College Streets, it is usually much quicker to commute by bike than by car. And residents generally agree. The ridership numbers have been trending positively towards bicycles as people are seeing an alternative to slower transit and slower cars.\nHowever, even if this government succeeded in removing the bike lanes, it would not fundamentally solve the problem. What would solve this problem is building more public transit and bike lanes, not less, and improving on the ones we already have.\nI recognize the current government\u2019s efforts to expand transit and address the congestion problem that Toronto will face for years to come. However, rather than wasting time on vanity projects like massive car tunnels parallel to the 401 or building a highway that the MTO says would only shave 16 minutes off commute times rather than 30 minutes as previously stated, further investments in public transit would improve commute times. Public transit is more efficient, faster, and has more capacity to carry people who do not need a private vehicle for city or intercity commuting. For Toronto to be more competitive with similarly sized cities, expanding our public transit network is essential.\nBy lowering the need for cars, public transit would no longer carry the stigma of being the \u201clower-class option for those who aren\u2019t well-off\u201d but would instead be seen as the sensible option for those who want to avoid skyrocketing insurance fees, parking fees, maintenance costs, etc., as it is in comparable regions in North America, Europe, and Asia.\nBike lanes also improve safety, and the Bloor and Eglinton bike lanes are proof of that. These two bike lanes, among many others, have prevented many accidents on the road and were installed for that purpose. As the Premier himself once said, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there are no bike lanes.\u201d Toronto\u2019s congestion issues were never caused by recently installed bike lanes but rather by our reliance on a flawed system that promotes building car lanes and widening highways and roads, even those without a single bike lane. This approach inevitably leads to more congestion as more people buy more cars. Induced demand dictates that if you build it, people will use it. Adding more car lanes will only encourage more car purchases, continuing the cycle. More roads will need to be built, and current and future neighborhoods will be paved over to sustain this lifestyle. This will reduce available land for housing, job creation, and community growth, ultimately discouraging people from moving to Ontario.\nAdditionally, emergency services have reported no noticeable negative impact and, in some cases, have seen decreased wait times.\nIncreased investments in public transportation and bike lanes, rather than expanding car lanes, will significantly reduce emissions for the city and province as a whole. This will lead to cleaner air and a healthier planet. For these reasons and more, I strongly recommend that the government reconsider this bill. Thank you for your consideration.\n"

Cars snd particularly single occupant cars are the cause of road congestion.\nResolving this requires making alternatives yo using cars work better for more people than driving.  Bike lanes and transit options are big parts of that.  Bike lanes are not there for existing cyclists, they are for the people currently driving for whom one barrier to using a bicycle instead is concern for their safety.\nThis change just reinforces to drivers that they should stick to their vehicles snd suggests to nervous cyclists that they should drive their cars instead.

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this significant change to tax-funded municipal streets. I am concerned for the safety of myself and others that rely on bike lanes as their main affordable option for transportation. I am a Toronto tax payer who cannot afford a car (estimated to be $1.3K/ month in Canada). I have also struggled to pay for public transit (monthly TTC adult pass is currently $156/ month) and instead have used BikeShare Toronto ($120/ year or $10/month) close to 365 days/ year since 2015. Bike lanes have been essential for being able to safely ride to work, doctor\u2019s appointments, and to visit businesses across the city. On August 31, 2024, I was struck by a driver in a hit-and-run while biking on a non-bike lane street, a decision that nearly cost me my life. I was in St. Michael\u2019s Hospital trauma ward for 4 days and heard consistently from the doctors and nurses that the many biking accidents they treated were significant and usually involved bikers being hit by cars. They shared that, even with a helmet, being hit by a car while biking led most patients to having serious head trauma. I am significantly concerned that Bill 121 is putting the safety of vulnerable road users like myself at risk, while penalizing tax payers that cannot afford a car despite that they pay equally into road construction and maintenance.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will send Ontario backwards 30 years. The science and data is clear, if you want to improve traffic flow for those in cars, the only way to do that is to encourage some people to take alternative modes of transportation. This includes active and public transit. Adding lanes will not reduce congestion, it will just induce greater single vehicle occupancy demand. We are in the middle of a climate crisis and one of the largest sources of emissions for cities is transportation. Adding bike lanes is one of the easiest and cheapest ways we can do our part. Taking away bike lanes will lead to more fatalities, more emissions, and more traffic. The damage this bill will cause is unimaginable.\n"

I know local cyclists complain about the difficulties of getting around on their bikes. The fact remains that there are far more people using vehicles and removing traffic lanes for a few cyclists will clog up the roads more.  There will not be hundreds or thousands of people flocking to use bikes instead of their cars with more bike lanes. It will be the same small group of people with a few extras using the lanes during nice weather. I have a bike. I also have three kids. Replacing vehicle lanes with bike lanes will drastically worsen traffic while making transporting my kids to and from appointments, extracurriculars, getting groceries, etc. more difficult. Even if I was able to get all three (all under age 7) on bikes, in a trailer, etc. I don\u2019t have the extra time it would take to do everything by bike. More bike infrastructure at the expense of vehicle infrastructure is a BIG mistake.\n"

How does ripping up bike lanes and preventing new ones save time for the many thousands who choose to bike round the city?

Or keep riding bikes in traffic and risk their lives.\nThis is a terrible, terrible idea from a provincial premier, whose job is to govern for ALL of us, not just himself and other car owners. It goes against all evidence of road usage and road safety.\nIt's been proven in cities all over the world that increasing safety and access for cyclists reduces car-based gridlock. If Toronto wants to reduce gridlock, it can:\n- Ban on-street parking, where one or two lanes are held hostage to giant lumps of metal,\n- Add more bike lanes,\n- Finish the Eglinton Crosstown and Finch LRT and put in a Lakeshore East LRT,\n- Stop building suburban housing sprawl.\n"
