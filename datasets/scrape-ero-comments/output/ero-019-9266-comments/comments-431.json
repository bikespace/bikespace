Cyclists and drivers are like oil and water. They do not mix. Separated bicycle lanes are necessary infrastructure, if for no other reason than to prevent road rage and accidents.\n3. There are viable \u201cside street\u201d alternatives for the lanes on University avenue (just extend the Simcoe lanes north and create pathways over to university between buildings, where they don\u2019t already exist). Where Simcoe ends, the lane should continue on Murray and then link up with trails in Queen\u2019s park, ideally with an underpass. A second option would be to move the lanes to the sidewalk on University, which is likely large enough to accommodate both bike lanes and a pedestrian sidewalk.\n4. On Bloor Street, by contrast, there is no viable side street alternative for the bike lanes. Cyclists will simply take Bloor because it\u2019s the only viable east-west route, just as they did before the lanes were installed.\n5. Whatever changes are made, because of point #2 above, the new cycling infrastructure *must* be in place before the current lanes are destroyed to prevent traffic mixing on arterial roads.\n"

        "comment": "My wife and I live right off Bloor Street near Jane St., so are directly impacted by the Bloor bike lanes. I cannnot believe that one would even cosider ripping up these lanes. They provide a vital safety element for bike users and also slow the traffic down at a very dangerous intersection for pedestrians at Bloor and the South Kingsway. My wife actually bought a bike this summer in order to ride to her gym. She would not have done that if she was going to have to ride in mixed traffic. Removing the Bloor bike lanes would make her purchase useless. We should be encouraging the option of safe modes of transit OTHER THAN CARS. There are subway lines under Bloor Street. If congestion is a problem for drivers, they have the option of using public transit (or the bike lane). This proposed bill is the exact oposite of what we should be doing. The solution to too many cars is not to make driving easier.\n"

        "comment": "I use the bike corridor on bloor and university nearly every day. Most of the people I know who live in the city also use these bike lanes regularly. Very few people I know who live downtown drive - and I say that as a driver myself! The reality is, if you live downtown, the most practical and efficient way to commute is biking. And those who think that biking isn\u2019t safe prefer to use the TTC - NOT drive. The solution is to continue to make the bike lanes safer, not rip them out. The statistics that only 2% of people in the city commute is disingenuous. You need only spend 10 minutes downtown to see that these corridors are highly utilized. Who are we trying to serve with this bill? Those who live in Toronto? Apparently not. This bill will actively harm downtown residents, for a goal that it is likely not going to achieve. Commuters to downtown should have better public transport. More cyclist deaths and more car gridlock (by disincentivizing alternative forms of transportation) will be on your hands.\n"

        "comment": "Very obvious to me that this Bill is pandering to one man specifically, since two of the major streets that are being proposed for bike lane abolishment represent his commute from Etobicoke to work. Ripping out these essential pieces of the cycling infrastructure in the city will NOT alleviate gridlock in any way. You know what will? More bike lanes. Safer bike lanes. Encouraging Ontario residents to adopt a healthier and more affordable alternative to driving, also alleviating congestion on the TTC. I say this as someone who drives, believe it or not, across Davenport  to work every single day. The cyclists I encounter there do not affect my commute in any way, and in fact, I have considered cycling to work a few times since the option is available to me. I hope the province will reconsider micro-managing the city of Toronto to pander to the elite and think instead about the regression we will face staunching the amazing progress we've made on urbanizing the city as of late.\n"

        "comment": "From every possible perspective, I am totally against the move to reduce bike lanes in Toronto and to allow the provincial government to dictate how municipalities govern their communities in this regard.  As a driver, I am very reassured knowing that cyclists have a designated area that is safe and protected from a possible collision with my car.  If it slows the flow of traffic, in many cases, this is a very good thing.  Environmentally, I appreciate all actions that enhance our air quality.\nThe Ford government has a terrible track record in terms of valuing our environment and have continually sent the clear message that they don't care about this issue.\nFor this and many other reasons (e.g. $200 cheques, focus on booze, pathetic state of healthcare and depleting resources in our education system, to name a few) I will never vote to have Mr. Ford lead our province again.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is absurd. The bike lanes allow other options for safe modes of transportation for commuters and actually remove people from being in cars, reducing congestion for those who absolutely need to be in vehicles. Removing cycling infrastructure is taking a huge step back in transit infrastructure. If you remove the cycling infrastructure already in place or cancel plans already in motion, cyclists will still be out riding on the same streets and they will take up the car lanes that this government is so eager to reinstate. No one wins and Toronto will still have traffic congestion.\n"

It is disrespectful to the electorate, especially those outside of the municipalities being affected by these changes.\nBike lanes are an extremely important part of Toronto for offering alternative transport options than just vehicular, which is in grid lock because of the lack of planning by the provincial and federal governments with regards to immigration and funding for the building up of communities outside of the GTA.\nThe conservative government under Doug ford has had many public scandals regarding cronyism and corporatism that alludes to widespread corruption and this appears to be another one of those times.\nThe people are demanding that the provincial government not remove or reduce bike lanes, but Doug ford and his cabinet are ignoring the will of the people yet again.\nIf anything we should be adding more bike lanes and safeties in the dense area of Toronto to reduce the need for automobile travel in such a dense area. Much like most first world countries do within their metropolitan cities.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto needs more bike lanes and safe cyclist passage. Rather than just getting rid of the bike lanes established on pavement, Toronto would do well to look to the netherlands as an example, and have separate raised pavement for cyclists only, besides the sidewalks, as well as traffic lights. Once those are in place, then the asphalt can go back to the drivers only.\nThe idea to create bike lanes by carving up the existing roads has frustrated many of us, but it is imperative that cyclists have a clear and safe path of transportation. By giving them their own raised path beside the sidewalk, this would make it so there is less road congestion and accidents.\nCyclists, motor vehicle drivers and pedestrians deserve equal access and safety. Our city development should reflect that and go forward with an improved system for cyclists, rather than backwards by getting rid of paths on the main streets.\n"

If you take the bike lanes out, it will encourage more people to take their car and cause more congestion on the road. Bike lanes are not yet to their full potential in taking people off the roads. There needs to be more good bike infrastructure to encourage more people to bike rather than drive. The only thing that the extra lanes for cars is going to do, is encourage more people to drive down those street and cause the same amount of traffic. This induced demand is already what we see on highways.\n"

        "comment": "Studies from around the world show bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses and help fight climate change by eliminating greenhouse gases. Having dedicated lanes creates a safe pathway for cyclists. Removing them will result in more serious collisions with cars and trucks. The bike lanes on Bloor are ideal because they are protected by parked cars.  In 2017 Doug Ford said \"You're nervous when there's no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" We have seen many cyclist deaths in 2024 due to bike lanes being blocked.   Many major cities like Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton are expanding bike lanes. It is very backward to remove them and there is no evidence that traffic flow will improve. It has been proven that the more you expand roadways the more cars will come. In recent years the 401 was widened in Mississauga and initially, people reported that congestion was reduced, but within a short time, the highway was completely clogged again. Many of cyclists choose to use their bikes if it is safe, so eliminating the dedicated space will force them to get back into their cars and further clog up the roads. Stores in the Annex say the Bloor bike lanes have been a big boost to business and the neighborhood's BIA wants the province to back off its new bill that could see the lanes removed. The bottom line is removing bike lanes from major streets in Toronto is completely irresponsible and shortsighted.\n"

There are places outside of Canada that manage traffic well, and if you want to spend >$100 billion whatevers on car infrastructure, you may as well divvy this price tag up and at least put it towards public transit or something like that!\nAs an Ottawa resident, this bill impedes progress needing to be made in the capital of Canada. Toronto is a decent transit hub, whereas Ottawa is lagging behind the GTA. Reversing bike lanes in Toronto is already a bad move for those needing alternate transportation. This limits transit options for the rich, the poor, the homeless, the active, the wanting-to-BE active individuals. This limits quick trips, leisurely trips, grocery trips, trips to home and work, etc.\nThe safety of bikers is not being taken into account either. Much infrastructure in Canada is built very large for the cars, and creates deserts of concrete that individuals on foot or bike have to trek across, often unsafely.\nGetting rid of bike paths, getting rid of sidewalks- whatever it is- will actually increase traffic due to MORE cars on the road. Then when roads expand, there will be no walking room and ONLY congestion.\nThere is no logic, please don't meddle in the business of cities where it is completely pointless. Many other systems in Canada require your attention. Not this one.\n"

Now the province wants to tear it up - imagine the added gridlock that will cause - who is going to pay for it?\nThe provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. I use bike lanes every day including the 3 aforementioned routes and consider them essential transportation infrastructure, much like sidewalks.  We need to think about increasing safety standards for vulnerable road users, instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road.  When I drive I would much rather have cyclists out of the way and in their own bike lanes.\n"
