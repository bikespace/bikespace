While we a ticket make the city more hostile to cyclists and encourage people to drive more, which will only increase gridlock???\nThis nonsensical proposal which should be mocked and promptly declined so it can be shoved in the trash where it belongs\n"

Toronto needs transportation alternatives to motor vehicles and cycling is one of the most accessible, efficient and effective options we have. Motorists are not the only people who have a right to safely commute within Toronto. Cyclists will be directly harmed by this plan. The removal of bike lanes on major thoroughfares is not a partisan issue, it is a public health and safety issue.\n"

No room for emergency vehicles to pass. Bikes do not pay for our roads and city maintenance. There is snow. Our city doesn't accommodate cars and bikes in the winter months- about 6months a year- biking weather is poor - compared to year use of a car. Shop owners are losing business because bike lanes are limiting the traffic and accessibility and it is more dangerous for pedestrians walk and crossing the street with this extra lane of traffic.\nOur city infrastructure can not support more bike lanes at the expense of grid lock and local business.\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely ridiculous idea. The province has no business getting involved in municipal affairs, when cities understand best what works for them at the local level.\nThat aside, this idea is terrible for cyclist safety. Bike riders are not going anywhere, all this will do is put them in danger of getting hit by cars because they're sharing the road with 2000-pound machines. All it will take is one distracted drivers who isn't looking where they're going and someone will get severely injured, or worse.\nMore cars on the road won't reduce traffic issues, because cars ARE traffic. Invest in transit that gets people into fast-moving, high capacity buses and trains and that's how you'll get people from one place to another faster.\n"

Lives will be lost, not to mention the $48M taxpayers will need to spend to undo the work that was just completed to improve transportation in our city. Speaking of gridlock, the construction that will be needed to remove the bike lanes is going to make it much, much worse.

        "comment": "The proposal of Bill 212 affects me directly as a commuter that uses protected bicycle infrastructure year around in Ottawa. Studies show that bike lanes tangibly increase the number of people cycling, is good for businesses, improves congestion, helps meet climate goals, and keeps both cyclists and pedestrians safer. My primary mode of transportation is biking, I do not own a car \u2013 I live near downtown and many of neighbours also do not own cars (see link below). I bike throughout the year in Ottawa and cycling lanes help me safely get to work, run errands and get to appointments like my doctor and dentist (even in winter when there is snow on the ground). Getting around the city by bike means that I am not adding to the car congestion on the street both with traffic and parking, and I have a minimal impact on road wear and tear. Being able to bike safely has made my more connected to my immediate community, and allows me to get to many destinations around the city safely. Without bike lanes I would not feel comfortable biking through downtown or to a large grocery store near my house. Protected bike lanes also encourage women to bike more, and removing and/or preventing new bike lanes from being built will disproportionally impact women as many will choose not to cycle as they will not feel safe. Active transportation infrastructure is also an equity and quality of life issue as it doesn\u2019t require individuals to shoulder the cost and maintenance of a personal vehicle. Being able to get around the city by bike has been tangibly beneficial for my mental health (a much better way to decompress after work than sitting in traffic) and was vital for me to get around the city during the first few years of the pandemic.\nI believe that the provincial government is overstepping their power getting involved in preventing cities from implementing road infrastructure that often takes years of planning, consultation and study. Being able to veto cities infrastructure decisions and remove existing infrastructure is a waste of time, money and resources. The title of this proposal is disingenuous and misrepresents what the outcome such regulations would be able to control. It also ignores other targets various Ontario cities are trying to hit such as vision zero (reducing traffic related fatalities and serious injuries) as well as climate targets.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t causing traffic, cars are causing traffic. Giving people safe, efficient, well connected, and affordable options outside of personal vehicles will reduce traffic.\nhttps://kitchissippiward.ca/2024/07/13/vehicle-ownership-in-kitchissipp\u2026\nhttps://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/\nhttps://tcat.ca/resources/bloor-street-economic-impact-studies/\nhttps://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Pub\u2026\nhttps://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation\u2026\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a Toronto driver, biker and pedestrian to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill that aims to limit municipal control over cycling infrastructure. Biking infrastructure is an essential component of urban transportation systems and should remain under the purview of local governments, which are best positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities.\nCycling infrastructure, such as designated bike lanes, improves road safety, REDUCES congestion, and supports sustainable transit solutions. Decisions about these networks must account for the unique challenges and priorities of individual municipalities. For example, Toronto's bike lanes are vital to the city's transportation ecosystem, providing safe, efficient routes for residents and encouraging environmentally friendly commuting. These priorities are different from those in smaller towns or rural areas, which is why a one-size-fits-all provincial approach is counterproductive.\nThe added red tape this bill introduces hinders municipalities\u2019 ability to respond to local demands and creates unnecessary bureaucratic barriers. Such policies not only slow progress but also risk dismantling existing infrastructure that residents rely on daily.\nTo be clear, this is not just about cyclists - it is about fostering safer roads for all users, including pedestrians and drivers. Studies repeatedly show that separating bike traffic reduces accidents and makes urban environments more livable. Additionally, bike lanes can and must complement other transportation investments by facilitating connections to public transit and reducing last-mile accessibility challenges. And finally, if biking is made a safe and accessible option for more road users, it will naturally REDUCE the number of cars on the road, lead to less traffic congestion for everyone.\nThe province should empower local governments, not undermine them. Please reconsider these provisions and prioritize supporting, rather than obstructing, municipalities' efforts to create safer, more sustainable cities. We should focus on moving forward with innovative, people-centered infrastructure, not regressing to outdated car-centric politics.\n---\nSupporting links:\nCity of Toronto Cycling Study (2019) > page 3 > \"Respondents were more likely to say they would like to travel by bike if the street felt safer and there was dedicated bike infrastructure to protect them from traffic\"\nThe Role of Walking and Cycling in Reducing Congestion > page 19-20 > A study in New York containing 3 years of data showed that after introducing separated bike lanes, crashes with injuries were reduced by 17% and the travel time by car through a common route was reduced from 4.5 minutes to just 3.\n"

My background is Dutch and I have been very happy with Toronto\u2019s expansion of the biking network, a good example of forward thinking( finally) given the environmental disaster our society tries to ignore. Instead of removing, we should be building more bike lanes if our grandchildren will have a future.\nSince this concerns our city, it would be better if Ford and his provincial team would trust Canada\u2019s largest city to make decisions like building or removing bike lanes without provincial interference. Hands off please!!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to this proposed legislation. The Ontario government tries to project a green image  but its actions reflect precisely the opposite. There is no evidence whatsoever to support the need for a reduction in bicycle lanes. If anything, cities like Toronto and Ottawa need to introduce fees for bringing cars into their downtown cores, increase the number of bicycle lanes, and promote and support more public transit. The province has no business interfering in a local matter - cities know best and have the best studies to know how to manage their traffic and transportation. The drivers of Etobicoke need to adjust to the changes introduced by bike lanes on Bloor Street and think of ways to reduce their own reliance on fossil-fuelled vehicles. The removal of bicycle lanes in any of our cities is completely regressive and counterintuitive to the reality of climate change and environmental destruction. If Vancouver and Montreal can do it then so can Ottawa and Toronto. Shame on the Ford government - this is not leadership, but pandering to votes. I completely reject the proposed legislation.\n"

For that we need safe roads, which needs to include lanes for bikes, scooters and e-bikes.

        "comment": "I am opposed to this legislation which overrides municipal decision making. I am also opposed to removing bike lanes in favour of cars. Cars add substantially to green house gas pollution, bikes do not. Bike riders can and have been killed in interactions with cars but people in cars are not endangered by bikes. Bike riders need to take these major routes just like car drivers to get to work and school. The roads need to be shared in a manner that is safe for all.\nPersonally I have stopped riding a bicycle myself due to my age and health issues. I take public transit and occasionally drive my car but I never take the car downtown.  However when I used to drive a car on Bloor Street, before there were bike lanes it was always very crowded and bikes would dart in and out around the cars. It was very unsafe for cyclists. I witnessed a person fall off a bike right in front of the car ahead of me but luckily the car stopped in time due to the congested traffic even back then, about 10 years ago.\nWhen there were no bike lanes on Bloor in the past there were parked cars there most of the time so it was still one lane of traffic as it is now.\nThe real cause of congestion for car traffic is that there are too many cars on the road and not enough people taking transit and/or biking. The future for us and our children and grandchildren is to stop using cars as much and turn to less polluting forms of transportation. It is one of the most important ways to reduce the very real threats of climate change.\nI hope that if this submission is being considered from an environmental point of view that you will recognize that encouraging and enabling more cars to travel our downtown roadways is not environmentally friendly and makes no sense when routes with subways underneath them like Bloor St. and University Ave. are available and in fact are underused currently.\nThanks very much for reading this submission.\n"
