        "comment": "Firstly, I'd like to open by saying that historically I've been a conservative voter. I now realize that the sociopathic conservative government no longer values human life. If bill 212 passes, I will never vote for this corrupt party again.\nRemoving existing bike lanes will inevitably increase the amount of motor traffic, increasing overall traffic volumes and slowing down commute times. As someone who cycles daily, if I no longer have a safe path to commute to work - which I hardly do as it stands - I will have to resort to polluting the planet with a car. Cyclists like myself will now be slowing down your valuable commute time by adding more barriers to traffic flow - cars. The additional environmental damage will be immense. Us cyclists are already disproportionately working to stem climate change while lazy and obese automobile users like yourselves actively work against us to destroy the planet.\nStop adding red tape to the construction of new infrastructure. You are actively making it more difficult to develop this country in a positive direction. I can clearly see a future under conservative administration of Ontario where the province technologically regresses because of the red tape added to infrastructure construction. We will be unable to compete with other successful green economies and will fall behind. Stop denying Ontarians the basics of developed economies - safe and essential infrastructure.\nLet residents of cities have control of our own infrastructure instead of being subject to the autocratic authority of the conservative provincial government. Why are residents of cities subject to the whims of the rural and suburban elite? This is undemocratic and undermines the freedom of Ontarians to the fundamental human right to self-determination and self-governance. Stop exerting dictatorial control over the residents of cities we DO NOT consent to having our streets molested by obese air polluting suburbanites.\n"

        "comment": "The Premier recently commented that a meager 1.2% of Torontonians use the bike lanes. I'd like to remind the Premier that is false and that correct number in 70%. This is 7 out of every 10 Torontonians. If the Premier truly believes in relieving congestion then the Premier will not move forward on this bill. Should the Premier and his government move forward on this bill not only will the streets of University, Yonge and Bloor will experience levels of congestion that haven't been seen in years. The results will not just be catestrophic for drivers but people living in and along these streets. With noise by-laws being broken due to the honking of horns the results will be catestrophic.\nAdditionally, the Bill also wishes to expedite the construction of Highway 413. I am also very much against as it will do nothing to combat traffic on the highway network. The reason for this is induced demand or generated traffic: The principle being that while over the short-term the new highway will result in shorter travel time. However, over the long-term the supply of cars will reach the demands of the highway resulting in travel time and congestion to increase yet again. You need only look at Los Angeles which has notriously terrible traffic, inspite of a 40 lane highway.\nBecause of these reasons and many others I strongly urge this government to put an end to this bill.\n"

        "comment": "While this bill claims to alleviate gridlock, the reduction of cycling infrastructure and emphasis on motor vehicle lanes will lead to increased car dependency, heightened traffic congestion, and environmental challenges, steering Toronto toward an unsustainable, car-dominant urban landscape.\nThe demography of Toronto is only increasing each year, this will lead highly populated areas. The city does not have the public transportation infrastructure to match its demography. Hence, this ever increasing population calls for increased alternatives in transportation means, by removing the bike infrastructure you remove said alternatives.\nBy prioritizing motor vehicle lanes over cycling infrastructure, this bill promotes a car-centric urban design, leading to increased traffic congestion, as more residents opt for driving due to limited alternative transportation options. This will result in induced demand and more car expansion and infrastructure will be required down the road.\nThis bill has also a classist component as not all residents of Toronto can afford a car and need alternatives in transportation. It is easy to commend bikes and bike lanes from the privileged of your car.\nLet it be known that working people of Toronto need to arrive on time without costing them their wages on car and car insurance, on top of the ever growing housing crisis. The working people of Toronto are entitled to have alternatives and options on how to get to their jobs on time.\nLastly, direct routes and main streets are the ONLY option for a feasible bike lane when the city is not even properly designed with direct routes such as the Bloor, University and Yonge street.\n"

What a dumpster fire of a legislation. It's like someone went on a bender and wrote this to in the aftermath in spite of an ex they were still in love with but who didn't live them back. You are not the Mayor of Toronto. No one here likes you in the least (yes, still). Stay in your lane Doug Ford & corrupt pals.\nYou already ruined Toronto/GTA/Ontario in numerous other ways, but sure let's now create legislation to purposely ensure more people die on roads & prevent a portion of the population from being able to safely travel and complete basic daily tasks without a car!\nMunicipalities like Toronto are trying to build better cycling infrastructure so that less people DIE & less people drive cars daily clogging up roads in the process. They are tackling gridlock!!! This legislation does not tackle gridlock, it WILL kill people while simultaneously making gridlock worse all around Ontario! Help municipalities build proper bike lane infrastructure that takes cyclists places they want to go. Create decent cycling networks that connect. Focus on public transportation so that people in Ontario have an easier time travelling without cars!\nNot only is this legislation about creating unsafe roads for drivers/cyclists it is also Doug Ford attempting to sneak in unrelated items such as: speeding up highway 413 construction without an environmental scan or other due process required AND taking peoples properties for the government use.\nLet me be clear: I do NOT support ANYTHING in Bill 212. Shut it down. Vote NO. If you vote this in you should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves as you are going against the wishes of the public and purposely creating legislation to ruin this province, the people and our environment. The fact that this legislation is even being proposed highlights how corrupt this government is.\n"

        "comment": "I think the removal of bicycle lanes is a bad idea. The existing bike lanes force cyclists to be in a contained area of the roadway. This makes it easier to keep track of cyclists as a driver. The dedicated bike\nLanes are SAFER for cyclists and drivers. The way to reduce gridlock in the city center is to 1) improve public transport 2) discourage drivers of private vehicles 3) perhaps institute a congestion fee (similar to that put into place in London UK)\nBicycle lanes have opened up a new mode of  transportation for many; their removal will force people back into their cars and further increase gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown Toronto resident this is truly the most absurd legislation in a long time, it's been a rough last few years with the pandemic, rising inflation, high housing costs; but the one visible civic improvement in my neighbourhood has been the bike lanes. To take one of the few visible positive things that is happening and rip it up without consulting with the people who live there is truly absurd.\nI have lived in Toronto more than 10 years and I never bike, I never bike because it is dangerous, there isn't a sufficient and safe bike network to ride on yet. I like many would love to bike and would bike if biking was safer and these bike lanes are doing just that, they are clear progress to a city where I can have the option of biking. They make it better to live here, they give me and other residents an alternative to driving. Our government should be consulting with the citizens and looking to the future so we can build the place we want to live in; a place where everyone has an option to use safe and reliable bike transportation.\n"

And there are already too many cars in this city. The bicycle lanes help keep the bikes out of my way. Have you ever encountered a bicycle as you are driving along Yonge between Eglinton and York Mills? It's really scary because you don't know where they're going to go. And where are they supposed to go? The sidewalk?\nGet the bikes out of our way. Install more bike lanes, not more car lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am a commuter from Whitby that comes into Toronto quite frequently for school at TMU. I'm not a frequent cyclist on city streets, but use them when it is more convenient to get to TMU rather than TTC from union. It is a faster way to get to school as well as a nice way to enjoy the weather on nice days.\nMy experience using roads with proper bike infrastructure have been friction-less with interactions with cars and pedestrians and quite enjoyable! I find it a shame because when I am forced to go onto the sidewalks on streets that don't have larger sidewalks, or are flooded with people because of rush hour, my experience takes a 180 turn for the worst. My bike becomes an obstacle and a nuisance to those around me, and its inconvenient to everyone, myself included. And it makes my commute time longer! Which goes against this government's promise to reduce commute times! Not just for cars here!\nI've also had the privilege to drive in and around the city as well, and areas with proper bike infrastructure have made cyclists and pedestrians more visible to drivers. Making it SAFER and faster on city roads ensuring people get to where they need to go safely! Roads without it have personally caused me undo stress and have made my commute time longer in order to ensure that my way through an intersection is clear and safe of pedestrians and cyclists, even the ones that jump into my way last-minute. It's even worse for larger vehicles driving in the city!\nI've found that the media tends to overly create a negative narrative when a cyclist or pedestrian dies due to a road vehicle, but we instantly think of regressing and making more room for cars as a solution to the problem. That isn't a solution. Regression is not a solution. It is continuing to put us through another round of this perpetual cycle of putting more cars into an already struggling infrastructure barely able to handle the capacity it already has.\nLowering commuting times by increasing the amount of roads in the city is definitely not the solution the city needs, neither is getting rid of already great or steadily improving bike infrastructure either. Especially during a time when the cost of living is so high, and more and more people are seeking out alternative ways of getting around to fit their means!\nI urge the provincial government to reinvest their interest, time, and tax-payer dollars into projects like improving bike, public transit, and road infrastructure, while also putting more into urban planning and repurposing our existing infrastructure to make it more safer for everyone! Delaying car traffic signals to allow pedestrians to walk first was a great move in the right direction! It was implementable on pre-existing intersections that did not have modern infrastructure around it, and had near-immediate impact without a learning curve for drivers! This is the kind of improvements that I want to support our local and provincial governments doing!\nThank you for your time reading this and hope you take what I am saying to heart!\n"

        "comment": "Hi there, I am from Toronto and was recently back there and made extensive use of Toronto's bike lanes including the Bloor Street Lanes to get around the city. I observed that they are very well used and help a large volume of users move across the City. While it is possible that they slow down vehicle traffic I suspect the net impact on mobility across all modes is positive due to the volume of cyclists. I also understand that bike lanes are also supported by local businesses. If legislation is advanced requiring transporation impact assessment to justify bike lanes, the assessment should evaluate impact on mobility and safety of all user groups (not just motor vehicles), and input from local residents and businesses in determing the net value of the facility.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out bike lanes for motor transportation only considers the motor vehiclist and not anybody else who commutes on these corridors. Protected bike infrastructure vastly improves cyclists' safety and gives people options for their commutes. Not everybody wants to drive, and removing these lanes makes driving the only option. We need more cars off the road. There is not enough space in the city for all these vehicles. We need to promote other forms of transportation in the city.\nRemoving the bike lane and adding another car lane will not improve traffic. It will simply just have more cars in traffic. The issue will be there. Give people options for their commutes and more people choose not to drive. Cycling in the city has been growing at a healthy rate and this will just destroy that progress.\nNot to mention how expensive it will be to rip out these lanes and replace them with car lanes. Car lanes are expensive to build and to maintain.\n"

Eliminating these lanes can increase the risk of collisions, making the streets less safe for cyclists and pedestrians.\nTraffic Congestion: Adding more lanes for vehicles often doesn't solve congestion problems. Studies show that increasing road capacity can lead to more cars on the road, as it encourages additional driving, ultimately worsening traffic.\nEnvironmental Impact: Promoting car use over cycling can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Prioritizing bike lanes supports sustainable transportation options that reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\nHealth Benefits: Cycling is a healthy mode of transportation that encourages physical activity. Removing bike lanes can discourage cycling, leading to decreased public health benefits associated with regular exercise.\nUrban Livability: Cities that prioritize bike lanes tend to be more livable, with less noise and air pollution, and more vibrant street life. Removing these lanes can detract from the overall quality of urban environments.\nThis bill doesn't make any sense, please don't make this mistake.\n"
