Second of all, they ensure the safety of all road users. Thirdly, this is a total overstep of municipal jurisdiction that the province has no business being involved in. Doug Ford and co should stop this nonsense immediately.\n"

What a waste of resources to go back and tear them all up. The money could be way better spent on education, healthcare, or working transit to name a few.\n"

I have only ever seen a few cyclists using them whereas there is a solid line up of cars as far as the eye can see.\nBike lanes are also exclusive to those who are mobile. Kids, many of the elderly, mobility challenged individuals do not feel comfortable riding bikes on busy streets.  Let's be green and inclusive and get our transit system running efficiently.\n"

And you want to take that away.  Dufferin Street, Keele Street - there are no bike lanes yet they are bumper to bumper.  It has nothing to do with bike lanes.  Shame on you.\n"

        "comment": "Dear policymakers of Ontario,\nI OPPOSE this bill.\nI commute downtown by bike everyday from High Park. This involves crossing the Kitchener/Union Pearson rail lines where there are limited underpasses. How will this bill ensure that cyclists are offered safe passage across this bottleneck? I say safe passage because a physical barrier is needed to protect vulnerable road users from heavy and fast moving vehicles that unfortunately claim the lives of very real people each and every year.\nI am a driver too. Yes, I drive a car when I see fit. But I don\u2019t need to drive all the time, nor do I want to. This is not about pitting cyclists against drivers in a \u00ab\u00a0war on cars\u00a0\u00bb. It is to underscore that many people, including myself, wear both hats and simply ask for the freedom to choose the most practical mode of travel for any given trip.\nThis policy is regressive and appeals to pathos. It is disappointing to see loss of transportation optionality. As density in our cities increases, we must collectively reconsider our common use cases for cars. Can a transportation option for a maximum of a handful of people (I\u2019m being generous here given the number of single occupancy vehicles on the road) get any more space inefficient than a studio apartment on wheels? Should we even enable more space inefficient vehicles to enter our downtown core where real estate is the most valuable resource?\nTorontonians voted for options in how they move around the city. Please allow them to maintain this autonomy over their built environment. The province has bigger priorities.\nI am 22 and this bill antagonizes my cohort. I urge this government to reverse course and to place itself on the right side of history. As Richard Florida used to tell us in class, \u00ab People vote with their feet\u00a0\u00bb\u2026 these decisions have repercussions for the day-to-day lives of everyday citizens.\nRegardless of my plea for consideration, at the very least please collect and analyze the data on cycling infrastructure utilization. I urge you to govern accordingly and to consider the effects of induced demand. I am an optimist at heart but my hope for the future governance of my city is at risk.\nThank you,\nA disillusioned young Ontarian\n"

        "comment": "As a driver I implore you to NOT remove bike lanes!  Although I do not get an opportunity to directly take part in biking I see the multiple benefits of bike lanes including but not limited to reducing conflicts with vehicles, forcing drivers to be safer, and improving the public realm for pedestrians.  I would love to see MORE bike lanes even in my area at Yonge and Steeles.  To remove existing bike lanes now is a big WASTE of money and a move towards archaic thinking that bikers be relegated to begging for space with cars or side streets.  In this time of global warming we need to do all we can to encourage alternative travel options such as biking.  Moreover, bike lanes will overall improve traffic and reduce vehicular congestion as people will have the option to use options other than private vehicle.  PLEASE KEEP AND EXPAND BIKE LANES!\n"

        "comment": "1. Adding more lanes doesn't reduce traffic. It encourages more people to drive, and streets remain just as congested as before. It's called \"induced demand.\"\n2. Cycling is good for people's health. Public transit is good for the environment. Stop moving backwards.\n3. Removing a project that we just spent millions of taxpayer dollars to build is an idiotic use of public funds, especially given the most pressing problems of healthcare and housing which the Ford government has failed to address.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Removing these essential lanes is a significant step backward that threatens road safety, worsens traffic congestion, and degrades air quality.\nBike lanes save lives by providing a safe space for cyclists, and removing them will put both cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk. Evidence from cities worldwide shows that protected bike lanes not only increase safety but also encourage more people to choose active transportation, which ultimately alleviates traffic congestion. Contrary to claims that bike lanes contribute to gridlock, prioritizing cycling infrastructure is a proven way to make urban transportation more efficient.\nAdditionally, the removal would be a wasteful use of taxpayer money. Investing in bike lanes has long-term benefits, including reduced emissions and healthier communities. Spending more to remove them is a counterproductive move that contradicts our need for sustainable, forward-thinking infrastructure.\nFord\u2019s overreach into municipal decisions undermines the expertise of urban planners and the best interests of local communities. We need to support solutions that promote safety, reduce congestion, and create a healthier, more accessible city for everyone. Please reconsider this detrimental proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes, like those on Bloor/Danforth, Yonge & University in Toronto, are vital for cities to thrive. They make things safer, result in less traffic congestion, improve health & wellbeing of citizens, help to sustain the environment, and are essential to address the transportation needs of Ontario citizens. None of the ideas in this legislation make any sense. Each idea here will make the situation for cities across Ontario worse! Stop making life worse and worse for Ontarians! We don't want this at all! We don't want you to remove bike lanes! In fact we want want MORE BUILT!!!\nYou will also be ruining the environment by not ensuring that the correct investigations are done before building a highway. Environmental scans are required for a reason. Don't purposely make Ontario worse for generations to come.\nYou MUST rescind this proposed legislation. Otherwise you would be PURPOSELY ruining the lives of Ontarians and their access to good modes of transportation. You will kill people. You will make it so people can't commute in their cities between their work and home. You will make it harder for cars to not accidentally kill cyclists!\nYour government is unapologetically corrupt... Under so many investigations... Basing decisions without considering the consequences... Or worse making them out of some type of child's spite for a city that didn't want you as Mayor.\nI know there is no reasoning with this type of governing/authority, but at the very least this comment can serve as a record that citizens did in fact try to express how wrong all of this is before being ignored once again. I know your government will simply approve this legislation without any consultations, data, community engagement, look into healthcare financial benefits (or lack thereof), or inquiry into what's actually right for Ontario.\nSigned,\nA very sad (but not surprised) Ontarian\n"

The way to reduce gridlock is to increase highly effective public transit and alternative transportation,  like bikes.\nI remember Bloor street before the bike lanes...it was bumper to bumper gridlock and was incredibly dangerous for bicyclists and for pedestrians.\nThe government has access to city planning experts. Please consult them.\nPlease stop blaming bicyclists for Toronto traffic issues. And please stop wasting tax payer dollars and time on useless projects that don't actually improve the lives of Ontarians.\nSincerely,\nA concerned citizen\n"

        "comment": "I am an Ottawa resident who lives in Kingston for the school year while I attend Queen's. I say this because I felt betrayed when I was informed about this proposed policy. This policy is regression at its finest, as bike lanes are vital to any community or city. Bike lanes are the reason why I've gone biking in Ottawa, except for some residential neighborhoods, they are necessary infrastructure for any major road for bikers to not feel like their lives are constantly threatened. This is not how we should incentivize healthy, low-emission, low cost, and a low congestion mode of transportation. There are already not nearly enough bike lanes in cities in Ontario to make biking accessible to most of the population. So it is insane to think that we should limit them? From any perspective you take (economic, urban planning, social, health, etc.), increasing the percentage of bikers in a city is a phenomenal policy. I hope you help people and do not follow selfish political interests.\n"

        "comment": "I am unsure how this legislation simultaneously claims that \"accidents ... can worsen traffic congestion\" while proposing the removal of infrastructure proven to reduce collisions.\nSection 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the \"right to life... and security of the person.\" Removing infrastructure that was implemented to uphold these rights is legally problematic.\nSection 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees \"equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.\" This legislation only mentions drivers, and fails to acknowledge those who are neither in motor vehicles, nor have the ability to travel in one.\nThis legislation claims to reduce congestion, yet it actively promotes the least spatially efficient mode of transportation above more efficient ways of moving people. I am not convinced that what is proposed is informed by the available research on the effect of installing safer, less car-centred infrastructure.\n"

The Bloor/Danforth, Yonge, and University bike lanes have probably saved lives, but heaven forbid a DRIVER should have to spend five minutes more on his morning commute. Please leave the bike lanes alone. The government's treatment of cyclists, pedestrians, and public transit users as second-class citizens has got to stop.\n"
