        "comment": "I believe the proposed ability for the province to be able to make or override municipal planning decisions regarding bike lanes is unsafe. It is poor policy and works against families who have limited options (ie only biking) to be able to get around the city in an efficient manner to drop off and pick up kids while contributing productively to the work force and economy. Biking to work can save me over a half an hour of commuting time, allowing more time at the office or with family. Tons of parents bike. Don\u2019t put families at further risk when they are doing their best to get around.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill should use actual facts and data before proposing to absolutely overreach and overstep the province's mandate. Municipalities are more than capable of doing their own transportation planning and the province should stay out of it and actually deliver on transit which is within it's mandate to do.\nThe full costs not being realized prior to this Bill's proposal speaks volumes at how little the Transportation Minister and Premier know about planning, consultation and leading a fair DEMOCRATIC process. This Bill is a massive overreach and absolutely will make congestion worse. First by encouraging only driving as the one method of getting around which some people cannot AFFORD to own a car. Second it will only open \"lanes\" for street parking, which is a massive waste of space and will keep Bloor and Yonge at one lane in each direction anyway. University Ave was underutilized prior to bike lane installation and is still underutilized now post bike lane installation.\nI like having multiple options to get around the City. Biking is very freeing and I have been a Bike Share member for over 2 years. Its kept me healthy, its social - I meet up with my friends more, I spend more at local businesses when I can bike and not worry about parking headaches and traffic. Maybe the Premier should try it sometime!\n"

        "comment": "I regularly drive throughout the city. I used to commute from Cityplace to Don Mills & York Mills in North York. I used to work with local teens in Midtown to help them with Math and Science and I would commute from downtown in my car during the after school/work rush hour. I also see the congestion from Spadina heading to and from the Gardiner every day. I am familiar with the issue of traffic in Toronto. And that's what it is \u2014\u00a0a Toronto issue. Not a provincial issue.\nOn top of regularly driving through the city, I also bike, and regularly use bike lanes. I use them to run errands, to visit friends, to commute to work, and to exercise. I also regularly walk and use sidewalks (another piece of the road that isn't a car lane).\nI wouldn't bike if the bike lanes weren't there. I would drive and make congestion worse by adding another car that could instead be someone on a bike. If you build it they will come. Build bike lanes and people will bike, removing cars from the road, easing traffic. Build more car lanes, and people will fill them with cars. Traffic won't move faster. It will be just as congested, just as slow, just now with more pollution and a less healthy population.\nThere is no good argument for the Province to 1. be interfering with municipal policy regarding bicycle lanes, and 2. to remove bike lanes from Toronto arteries (in this case Bloor, University, Yonge). Doug \u2014\u00a0stay in your lane. Let locals in Toronto decide on local issues, don't destroy bike lanes (it's a monumentally bad idea), and find another way to garner voter interest by addressing real issues.\nI drive, I bike, I walk, I sit in traffic, I bike responsibly and follow the rules of the road, and I implore you not to interfere with Toronto's bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I consider myself as part of a visible minority group, male, 37-year old. I write this as a concerned Toronto resident following the proposed Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act in the hopes that the Province will shelve this proposed legislation which represents a clear overreach and a step backwards to what most progressive cities around the world are doing to provide safe street for people of all ages and abilities.\nI want to clarify my positionality before I express my thoughts about this Bill.  I drive my car downtown to drop my 3-year-old daughter to daycare and then rent a public bike to ride to the office 3-4 times a week. So I am both a driver and cyclist almost on a weekday basis. I understand the pains of both: drivers stuck in traffic gridlock; as well as cyclists dodging trucks/cars in mixed traffic when there are no bike lanes.\nThe proposed Bill 212 is an uninformed and disingenuous attempt to exacerbate the transportation conditions for both drivers and cyclists. On one hand, there is no evidence that suggests removing bike lanes improves traffic congestion; and on the other, there is a lot of evidence that suggests that lack of dedicated and physically protected cycling facilities only increases safety risks to cyclists. The Bill will be far from \"Saving [People] Time\" and contrary to its goals, has the potential to induce more vehicular congestion all while putting cyclists lives at risk.\nWe have an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past. More 20th-century car-centric planning and bureaucratic red-tape is not going to help this city. In the end, when it comes to prioritizing how we plan and design streets: Saving lives trumps saving time.\nPeriod.\nSaving a few minutes a day for a privileged minority is not worth more than saving the lives of vulnerable users.\nThe argument that bike lanes don't deserve a space because they sit unused is also misguided. I do not see the Province proposing the removal of accessibility ramps because they are \"underutilized\" by most people who can walk and take the stairs. We build them to give a disabled minority safe and equal opportunities to access. I think the principle applies the same to bike lanes and it becomes a quasi-moral duty to ensure taxpayer dollars are being invested fairly and equitably.\nFinally, I genuinely believe that the Bill is detrimental to the progress of the city and other Municipalities in Ontario, and has the potential to amplify the negative externalities associated with the car-centric legacy our generation continues to grapple with.\nI have faith that our elected officials will stand against this Bill. The Province should have no business with City-owned streets. Please let local residents and taxpayers be the  judges of local cycling projects through the proper project-specific consultation processes. Toronto has made important strides in improving street conditions to offer visitors and residents more options to get around safely. Please repeal this proposal and focus on things that are under the Province's review purview such as getting more transit projects realized and keeping highways in a good state.\nWe do not need unnecessary culture wars to antagonize each other. Most of us are pedestrians, cyclists, transit users, drivers at some point in our lives.\nPlease help preserve everyone's right to the street.\n"

        "comment": "Total stupidity!\nBuilding more roads maybe necessary but it won't solve the transportation problem on its own.  What is needed is a reliable and cheap public transportation system complemented by a vast bike infrastructure to provide an alternative to cars. We should follow the example of Copenhagen and re-think inner city planning.\nOver the last ten years cycling has become much more dangerous and is a major reason why more people don't cycle. They are afraid.\nI believe that every road improvement/construction should include a dedicated cycle lane. How many times do we see improved road works and no consideration given to alternative means of transportation. People are driving faster and 90% exceed the max speed limits even around schools, parts etc.. Maybe we should stop school buses and have our children cycle to school.  When these children become adults they will behave differently around cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "I am sharing the contents of my letter I have written and shared with Premier Ford, Prabmeet Sarkaria (Ontario Minister of Transportation), my local MPP and Toronto City Councillor:\nI am writing to express my deep concern and heartfelt plea against the proposed removal of bike lanes in Toronto. As a proud Torontonian and recent first-time homeowner, I rely on biking as my primary mode of transportation. Like many in our city, I cannot afford a car, especially in the current housing crisis. The bike lanes are not just infrastructure; they are lifelines that allow me to navigate the city efficiently, safely, and sanely amidst the challenges of public transit construction and congestion.\nBy removing bike lanes, I fear we are incentivizing more cars on the road\u2014a move that many residents, including myself, cannot support due to financial, environmental, and logistical barriers. Bike lanes provide a safe space for active transportation, which is critical for both physical and mental well-being. Without them, cyclists like me are forced to ride alongside vehicles on major roads, an option that feels unsafe and impractical.\nDuring my recent work that involved being at the Paris 2024 Olympics, I experienced firsthand how thoughtfully implemented bike infrastructure transforms urban life. In Paris, cycling is embraced as an accessible, vibrant, and sustainable way to move through the city. E-bikes are abundant and convenient, allowing everyone, regardless of fitness level, to participate in active transportation. I can't help but wish for similar opportunities here in Toronto. Expanding options like e-bikes and modernizing our bike-sharing system could encourage more people to embrace cycling and reduce the reliance on cars.\nI understand there are figures that might downplay the impact of bike lanes, but I urge the provincial government to consider the full picture. Removing this essential infrastructure would not only discourage cycling but also undermine efforts to promote healthy, active lifestyles. Instead, I ask the provincial government to explore ways to further invest in cycling infrastructure and encourage its use through innovative solutions, like e-bike programs and expanded bike lanes.\nAs someone who has dedicated their life to community-building through sport and physical activity, this issue is deeply personal to me. I served as a Canadian Army reservist and contributed to projects such as the Toronto 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am Games, the Invictus Games Toronto 2017, and the Canadian Olympic Committee. My mission has always been to make our city, province, and country a better place. Removing bike lanes runs counter to this mission and risks making our city less inclusive, healthy, and livable.\nBiking is one of the few joys that provides me with relief from the stresses of life in Toronto. It allows me to connect with my community, get to work, run errands, and visit friends and family. I implore the provincial government to recognize the value of bike lanes for countless residents who depend on them.\nThank you for your time, understanding, and compassion. I hope the provincial government will consider this perspective and stand with us in protecting Toronto\u2019s bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver and a biker who lives in Toronto. I am also a parent of children who bike. The proposed elimination of bike lanes under Bill 212 is appalling for many reasons. The title of the bill, \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving Time,\" is a misnomer. If it becomes unsafe for me or my children to bike the streets of Toronto, I will drive more. I'm certain I am far from alone in that. Fewer bikes and more cars means more gridlock, not less. But even if a minute or two were shaved off my car commute each day, at what price? Bikers will be injured, bikers will die. It's impossible to believe that injuries and deaths are a reasonable trade-off for a slightly shorter commute. Finally, there is the matter of pollution and climate change. Bike lanes mean more bikes on the street, fewer cars on the street, and thus lower emissions. The calculus is simple and direct. This bill is a travesty and should not become law.\n"

I'm a senior citizen who owns a car and also cycles. It makes no sense to remove them when statistics have shown that traffic issues are not resolved by omitting bike paths.\n"

Removing the bike lanes will endanger many people including myself who use them. Over a decade ago, a friend died cycling in the city of Toronto before we had an extensive bike lane network. Since then, things have changed for the better with the adoption of divided bike lanes.

Now, we are going to pay millions more tax payer dollars to increase deaths? It seems to me like all your priorities are off. The problem is not, and has never been, bike lanes, stop with the BS and put tax payer dollars towards things that benefit everyone.\nHere are some ideas, Line 2 refurbishments, deteriorating schools, \u201ctiny home\u201d housing opportunities for homeless, community beautification projects, public parks, local doctors offices. The list goes on because anything is more important than destroying work that has already been done, to help a community that\u2019s not in danger.\n- A Flipped Voter\n"

It appears that the provincial transport Minister can approve or disapprove bike lanes without the need for any evidence of how they will impact traffic.  Allowing the province to override the decisions made by any municipal council at any time is frankly undemocratic.\nThe proposed Bill also seems to allow the province to build new highways without proper environmental assessment.\nThese regressive policies are at odds with federal and international goals to reduce CO2 emissions.  Sadly Ontario is becoming a laughing stock in the world Press.\n"
