        "comment": "Bike lanes are empirically a good thing. They can reduce congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road. They reduce the likelihood of serious injury or death for cyclists and drivers. And they lead to economic benefit for main street businesses. These are facts. Ontario's MPPs can choose to acknowledge these facts or be unthinking servants to their party and Premier. The choice is theirs.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a biased bill against cyclist. It's the type of bill that is too expensive to pass. By removing bike lanes it will cost the province to lose more money. It will raise the death toll of cyclists and pedestrian alike. Removing bike lanes to add more lane will not reduce gridlock but encourage it. Personally, I don't mind building highways but the only problem is there will always be a bottleneck. Intersections are usually congested since the speed getting off the highway will be lower. Roads in Ontario usually relies on traffic signals, there should be a roundabout. Living in the GTA I have seen the pedestrian get struck by  vehicles  on the intersections. By having roundabout, motorist can be more alert of their surroundings and will ease the flow of traffic. Another suggestion is more public transportation. There are too many cars causing a gridlock. If the people of Ontario can have different modes of transportation it will result in less cars going in and out of cities.  Trucks that import and export for the province will have more space to move around. Ontario has some infrastructure of public transportation but it is still a province reliant on cars. The provincial government should make a long term plan to increase public transportation. If the province is serious about easing the gridlock and meddling with municipalities across Ontario, they should pass a bill that will actually decrease traffic rather than just making another road.\n"

        "comment": "This bill, if passed, would put a halt on the development of safe alternative means of transportaion. As someone who has commuted by bicycle in the city for nearly a decade, I have seen this development as essential to my safety and the accessibilty of essentials like work and groceries.\nThe lack of safe bicycle infrastructure in parts of the city is known to be a major contributor to the lack of bicycle riders and commuters in those areas, as these numbers have increased in areas like Bloor since the new bike lanes were put in.\nI have also seen children and families use these bike lanes, often to commute to school or just for recreation. Are these uses seen as less important than teh convenience of car drivers?\nFinally, the idea that the cyclists or bike lanes themselves are causing driving congestion is laughable. The need for cycling as an alternative transportation will never go away and the space these bike lanes take up in most cases simply should not interfere with car traffic. With Ford's plans to develop car infrastructure like Hwy 413 and the potential of a tunnel as well, it is clear that this governement is willing to harm cyclists, commuters, families, and children at the behest of increasing car dependence. This is unacceptable.\n"

More cars on roads increases carbon emissions which does nothing to help climate action, we should be encouraging people to use active transportation.\nUltimately, the Province should not be meddling in municipal affairs, this is an over reach of power.\n"

Removal of bike lanes will put lives at risk, is an incredible waste of taxpayer money, have a negative impact on the environment via promoting car use and unnecessary demolition of infrastructure, and do little if anything to improve traffic. It also represents significant provincial government overreach into what is a municipal issue.\nThe provincial government should instead focus on improving transportation choice such as finishing long overdue transit projects, expanding public transportation, focusing on environmentally sustainable transit options, and making sure all Ontarians can safely travel through the cities in which they live. Bike lanes save lives and make streets safer for everyone. Saving a driver mere minutes on their commute is not worth the life of someone riding a bike.\n"

        "comment": "This makes so little sense to me that I can't fathom that this is a real proposal. I'm not a cyclist. I drive everywhere I need to go, and one of my least favorite things to encounter while driving are cyclists. At top speeds, they are much slower than cars, and it's very annoying to have to overtake them on busy streets, or let them merge with traffic as bike lanes end. But these grievances can easily be solved...\nBy building more bike lanes!\nSeparating bike traffic from vehicle traffic makes for a much nicer driving experience, as there are far less points of conflict between cyclists and drivers. Not to mention this makes travel much more safe and comfortable for cyclists.\nIt's clear from this proposal that the needs and safety of cyclists is not being considered whatsoever, which is shameful. So many more accidents will occur if cyclists are forced out of their protected lanes and directly in the path of high speed vehicle traffic.\nThe entire point of this proposal is to alleviate traffic congestion. But considering the projected population growth and increasing density of the city, having every person driving a car will increase congestion tenfold. By providing alternatives (such as protected and separated bike lanes), many people in dense metropolitan areas are more incentivised to leave the car at home and bike instead. This reduction in car trips is what will reduce grid lock. And this will only happen if the city continues to expand and improve the cycling network.\nIf this Bill gets passed, so many years of progress will get thrown out the window, and I pity the future generations that will be forced to clean up the mess that this Province will have created.\n"

This bill is absolutely shameful and shows a complete disregard for not only the necessary regulation that would take place for any other highway project, but the will and rights of the Ontario population.\n"

As a single mother, for the first 10 years of my son's life I did not own a car.  Even though I had a good job at Thomson Reuters and then the London Stock Exchange Group, I do not come from a wealthy family.  Both my parents are dead.  So I work full time, paid for daycare, and could not afford a car.  I would bike with my son to school.  I would bike with sports equipment bags, in the rain, snow etc,... because that is what a hard-working fiscally responsible family-first person sometime has to do.\nBefore the bike lanes were installed along Woodbine and the Danforth, this was a harrowing act to do on a daily basis.  Along Gerrard St E, then and now, there are no bike lanes and I was fearing the cars that have such little consideration for cyclists and speed along too closely.\nThe Ford brothers have for some strange illogical reason decided that cyclists are a problem.  Or there is something wrong with the people who choose to cycle.  That is an ignorant and irresponsible attitude.\nI do not appreciate the government putting full-time, tax paying, hard working families' lives at risk by removing safety measures like bike lanes from city streets where they were installed only after intense review and support.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will waste money and endanger lives. We can reduce gridlock by building infrastructure-- not destroying it. By investing in public transit, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, increase accessibility, and help the environment.\nBike lanes are a crucial part of that infrastructure. They're not only essential for keeping cyclists safe, but they also serve as major arteries throughout the city for locals.\nMany locals, myself included, rely on these bikelanes to get to work, to class, to the grocery store, and to community events. Removing them would take away the fastest and most cost efficient way for locals to get from place to place in the city.\nI find this bill to be a cynical play to divide Ontarians and pit them against each other in the hopes of currying votes. Toronto has different needs than more rural parts of Ontario. But caring for Ontarians is not a zero sum game where what is good for Toronto comes at the cost of what is good for suburbs or rural towns. Responsible governance means supporting ALL Ontarians and making sure they have the infrastructure support that is suited to their specific needs.\nI implore you to listen to city planners, listen to transit experts, and listen to cyclists. We do not want Bill 212.\n"

Imagine naming this bill \"saving you time\" when every cyclist who can no longer safely use these bike lanes will experience staggeringly large increases in travel time when no comparable direct route is available.

        "comment": "First of all, as we are encouraging bicycles on our street, we need to make a safe space.\nImportantly, there is no more place for cars. Cars get bigger and not smaller, making even less space for them. Congestion discourages cars from coming into the city, which is desirable as road will not support more. The city is denser, so we also need wider spaces for pedestrians, again resulting in less space for cars.\nWe need to look at European cities as good examples of how to prevent centre city congestion. Congestion, as it was 50 years ago, is gone in cities like Paris. Many street are open only to pedestrians, locals and service vehicles. Life for those who live in the city improves which only goes to encourage fewer cars, which should be the ultimate goal.\n"

        "comment": "Hi - I am not supportive of this legislation. It is inconsistent with public safety and sound measures to combat climate change. There's lots of evidence that streets and roads with a plurality of uses (i.e., cars and trucks, cyclists, and pedestrians) are better for local businesses, community development and climate change adaptation. In contrast, there is very little evidence, aside from a perception that things will improve, that there any net benefits. Changing human behaviour to benefit society as a whole takes leadership - bike lanes represent one thing - of many - that can make our cities and towns more livable and attractive. In the broader context, I am against greater provincial over-reach of what I think should be municipal responsibilities. There's the principle: municipalities are already over-governed by the province, and there's the unintended impact: removing an important measure by which cities create and maintain their own identities. Thanks for considering my input.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this proposal as it does not accomplish its intended goal of reducing traffic but rather creates more need to use a car instead of alternative forms of transport. It is a reductive policy which will only further increase congrestion in the future, while removing other transportation options such as cycling (which are better in every other way except for time).\nTo create a policy like this is also an overstep of provincial jurisdiction. It should be up to the municipalities and their citizens how they choose to plan their communities. If cycling is a popular form of transport and there is interest from the community to have more infrastructure to support it, they should be able to make those choices. And they should be able to make progressive infrastructure decisions such as creating divided bike lanes which have been proven to reduce cycling fatalities and increase interest in cycling as an alternative form of transport.\n"
