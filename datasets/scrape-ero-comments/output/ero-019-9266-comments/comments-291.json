        "comment": "I strongly oppose the new framework for requiring provincial approval for bike lanes that impact traffic lanes. I am both a motorist and a cyclist, and in both roles I prefer the presence of a bike lane even if it involves removal of a vehicle lane.\nAs a motorist, it makes me more comfortable knowing cyclists have their own lane. I don't feel comfortable sharing a lane with cyclists while driving because they add an element of unpredictability to driving not otherwise present with cars, and they can be harder to see especially at night. As a cyclist, sharing lanes with cars is very dangerous, for exactly the same reasons as above. An accident with a car is extremely likely to be fatal to a cyclist, and traffic lanes often move much slower during rush hour than bike lanes.\nI don't think this proposal benefits anybody who uses the road, so I strongly oppose it.\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the worst pieces of legislation I've ever seen proposed. It reeks of a personal vendetta by the Premier against the City of Toronto, to shape the city according to his personal grudges regardless of who it hurts in the process. Ford and his ministers are more concerned with saving motorists a few seconds in their commutes (with dubious evidence to prove that will even happen) than with cyclists' lives and safety. It is not backed up by credible data either - Minister Sarkaria's claims of \"1.2%\" cycling mode share are gross misrepresentations in neighbourhoods with good cycling infrastructure.\nThis legislation will lead to deaths and permanently disabling injuries. The bike lanes in Toronto explicitly named for removal (Yonge, Bloor, University) allow me and thousands of others to move around the city safely, and to remove them without so much as a traffic study is an insult to our intelligence. It goes against the positions of most affected local BIAs that bike lanes are a net benefit to our communities. It also goes against the position of emergency services, which report improved response times thanks to the named bike lanes.\nIt is incredibly micromanaging and condescending of this provincial government to meddle in municipal affairs at this level. We are facing mounting parallel crises in housing costs, education, healthcare (including mental health), and public transit infrastructure, all of which this government is fumbling monumentally. Meanwhile, the fact that this government would rather spend its time fiddling with lines on the pavement in the City of Toronto rather than addressing these serious emergencies is truly disgusting.\nIt's obvious that Doug Ford just can't stand that the residents of Toronto rejected his bid for mayor in 2014 (FOUR mayoral elections ago) and only engaged in provincial politics so that he could impose dominance over Toronto, while doing nothing for the province. He is so obsessed with local minutiae in this city while neglecting serious province-wide needs - I bet he couldn't even point to Timmins or Kenora on a map.\nEven if these bike lanes are removed by this legislation, eventually they will be reinstalled. We will prevail. Progress cannot be blocked forever. And Doug Ford's only enduring legacy will be one of wasted money, wasted time, and wasted lives of all the cyclists who will be killed or gravely injured by his petty politics.\n"

        "comment": "My mother is in her 70s and her main form of transportation is by bicycle; she does not own a car. I\u2019m concerned for her safety if bike lanes are removed as the more recent segregated paths offer so, so much more safety than simple paint on the road.\nFor myself, one of my favourite parts of Toronto is the variety of transit options available to me. Being able to choose between walking, cycling, transit or driving means I rarely choose to drive. If bike lanes are being removed and cycling is a less attractive option, I\u2019ll have to rely on driving more - becoming the traffic I\u2019m trying to avoid. Please don\u2019t force me to be part of the problem.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed addendum to this bill goes against any sensible urban planning or environmental review. This addendum will remove infrastructure without any analysis of the environmental and other impacts of the removal.\nFurther, the environmental impacts of the development of the infrastructure will not be amortized over the full lifespan of the project. In the case of University Avenue, we will be destroying infrastructure that is less than 2 years old.\nAny plans to modify infrastructure should be subject to environmental review, city approval, and other normal oversights. The ministry has not provided any evidence that these changes will have any positive impact on traffic or environmental factors.\n"

        "comment": "What keeps us all safe is staying in our own lanes.\nI drive, I walk, and I ride a bike, alone and with my kids.  I share a car with other drivers in my family, but I can always depend on having a bike.  Even when I have a car, there may be no place reasonable to park it.  We can all agree that driving in large cities is frustrating, and the reason why is that cars and car infrastructure don't fit -- they are not dense enough.  Walking and cycling allow movement without requiring parking spaces or many kilometres of road use.  When people drive, they usually drive a long way.  When they cycle or walk, they accomplish the same tasks -- eg, shopping -- with dramatically less infrastructure use.  They are able to do this by patronizing local businesses.  If cities can connect residents to local businesses through walkways and bike lanes rather than force them onto highways and to box stores, they dramatically save on infrastructure.  Removing local infrastructure decisions from local government will make it much more difficult to develop infrastructure that serves residents.  It will force a failed sprawl model on cities that have already run out of space.\nYes, we build a lot of cars in Ontario.  No, there is no room for more of them in our cities.  And it's not the sidewalks or bike lanes that are to blame for that.\nOntario's $200 rebate buys a bike.  It does not buy a parking space for a car.  When you see business after business with no parking lot beside a Bloor Street bike lane, don't try to count the drivers stuck in traffic against the cyclists whizzing by who they are jealously eyeing.  Instead appreciate how much of the city's vital business is getting done with a very modest infrastructure footprint.  A lot of good can happen when everyone has their space.  Let's leave the cities their space to make efficient decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the Toronto bike lanes (University, Bloor, Yonge) is completely absurd and not based on any facts whatsoever. This will do nothing to solve congestion and is a complete overreach by the provincial government. Let municipalities manage their own streets, Toronto residents were loud and clear in rejecting anti-bike candidates in the last mayoral election. The residents of Toronto will not allow this to happen, because if it does then cyclists will die and blood will be on the hands of the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford, minsters, and MPPs,\nI'm commenting on Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) to voice my strong opposition to the bill for reasons I'm outlining below.\n- My main concern with this bill involves the reduction of bike lanes on major downtown Toronto arteries, including Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St. To be clear: these are all busy streets, but they carry traffic of all sorts. All of them are shared between cars, buses, cyclists (including commuters and delivery workers), and pedestrians. Bike lanes were added to these arteries as not just a convenience feature, but as a critical part of safety infrastructure for all road users. While Ontario does allow cyclists to take the lane if they feel it's the safest option, this is usually an unsafe option since many drivers are unaware of this and will endanger cyclists out of spite. I've personally been run off the road this way, taking a protected left where there was (at the time) no bike lane in Ottawa, before I moved to Toronto. Giving cyclists a segregated right-of-way is safer for them, and keeps drivers intuitively informed of when they should be more careful \u2014 and it comes with the convenient upside of not getting stuck behind slower cyclists using a car lane, or risking a dangerous pass to get in front of cyclists.\n- Counterintuitively, there's a point at which adding car lanes reduces road throughput for any given road. One of the main causes of traffic slowdowns, bumper-to-bumper and sideswipe accidents, gridlock, and driver frustration is merging across multiple lanes in a short distance; speaking as someone who does have to drive through downtown Toronto traffic, with wide roads in a downtown core, this is certainly something drivers feel. Reducing lanes means less merging, clearer options for drivers, and likely less time spent stuck in traffic.\n- I'm concerned at the amount of due diligence done by the Province in the leadup to this decision. Rather than a study to determine whether the removal of segregated bike lanes will have the effect sought by this bill (motor vehicle traffic reduction, ostensibly), this bill feels like politicking; declaring an intent (bike lane removal), and then working backwards from it to justify a solution (claiming that removing bike lanes will reduce traffic). Because of this, the work which will be done as a result of this bill's passing is based on a much lower standard of evidence, so to speak, than the initial work to put the lanes in, which passed several stages of environmental and traffic review, with reports and public comment periods where commenters could give informed input because of those reports.\n- Many of these lanes are quite new, with all three either being completed or substantially extended in just the past 2-3 years, meaning that many road users have just spent months living with the inconvenience of construction on major arteries; on its face, it's not reasonable to subject drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists to more slowdowns and detours just so these bike lanes can be removed.\n- The removal of bike lanes, is, to my knowledge, not costed; in an economic climate where the current provincial Government is ostensibly trying to eke out any possible financial efficiency, any plan to remove bike lanes at the province's expense (as offered to the city of Toronto) should be transparently priced so that commenters can give input based on that figure, especially in the context of some of the other significant expenses the Province has chosen to take on (or not) lately.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will achieve exactly the opposite of what it says it will do. As someone who drives, bikes, and takes public transit, having a protected and separated bike lane is an essential piece of infrastructure that can only benefit a major thoroughfare like Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Ave. Keeping bikes in their own lane on the same street keeps me safe by avoiding conflicts. When driving, bike lanes have minimally impacted my commute. Conversely, the mentioned bike lanes (and all others) have only improved my commute when biking and taking public transit. They enable me to have more, safer options of commuting while taking cars off the road and reducing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I am really unhappy with this decision. I live in Eglinton-Lawrence, and spoke recently with my MPP Robin Martin who suggested that this type of infrastructure decision-making would be made on a case-by-case basis, and outside the downtown core. Clearly that was not the case.\nThis is nakedly a political decision made to garner votes from suburban ridings outside of the city, at the expense of Toronto's liveability. The government is gearing up for a Spring election, and has decided that this is a good red meat issue to run on rather than dealing with transportation issues that affect this city.\nThe Ontario government\u2019s decision to dismantle crucial bike lanes on Toronto's busiest arteries\u2014Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue\u2014represents a baffling and regressive shift, particularly as Toronto strives toward a more sustainable and accessible urban landscape. This choice not only disregards the mounting evidence on the benefits of cycling infrastructure but actively threatens public safety, environmental gains, and the city\u2019s economic growth.\nThe City of Toronto has witnessed a dramatic and consistent rise in cycling activity, evidenced by year-over-year increases in Bike Share Toronto usage, which recorded 5.7 million trips in 2023 alone\u2014up from just 665,000 in 2015. Cyclists are not an anomaly in Toronto\u2019s streets; they are integral to its daily flow and fabric. Removing essential bike lanes ignores this trend and disregards an increasingly popular, healthy, and sustainable choice for urban travel, pushing cyclists back into traffic and, consequently, back into danger.\nEconomic studies from the Centre for Active Transportation have highlighted the positive impact of bike lanes on local businesses, with evidence from the Bloor Street bike lane pilot demonstrating increased customer visits and local spending. Toronto\u2019s neighborhoods thrive on the foot traffic, including cyclists, who patronize shops, cafes, and services. Sacrificing these lanes jeopardizes this local economy, threatening small businesses whose very livelihoods depend on the accessibility and vibrancy brought by cycling infrastructure.\nThere is no practical reason to do this. It will almost certainly fail to produce any meaningful improvement to traffic conditions within the city. It will very likely result in preventable deaths, and fewer people commuting by bike without the safety of a protected lane. This government doesn't seem to give a hoot about anybody that doesn't commute to work by car.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is shameful. Before bike lanes were installed I have been hit by cars twice. I now exclusively ride in bike lanes as they are safer for me and drivers (and my kids who often ride in our trailer).\nAs someone who also drives, I appreciate the space and predictability of bike lanes so that I don\u2019t hit cyclists inadvertently. Eliminating bike lanes will slow traffic and get people killed.\nAlso, suspending of the needed assessments for highway 413 is terrible. Highway 413 wastes money - it is an expensive way to move people and goods and will not really improve traffic. On top of that it will be an environmental disaster, destroying natural habitat, farmland, and wetlands that prevent flooding.\nShame on you.\n"
