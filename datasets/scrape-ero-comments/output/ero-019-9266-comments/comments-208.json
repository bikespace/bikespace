        "comment": "As a concerned citizen of Ontario, I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d. Even though I regularly drive my car in Toronto \u2013 I am not able to ride a bike unfortunately \u2013 I am strongly against this Bill. This Bill, while seemingly aimed at reducing congestion, will have the opposite effect in Toronto, undermining our city's progress in creating safer, more sustainable streets. The mass availability of protected bike lanes are not an inconvenience; they are a vital piece of urban infrastructure that makes Toronto a better, safer, and more livable city for everyone.\nThis Bill relies on the debunked misconception that bike lanes contribute to traffic congestion. In reality, the opposite is true. Cities around the world, including Toronto, have seen that building well-planned, protected bike lanes reduces the number of cars on the road. More people opt for cycling, knowing they have a safe route to travel on, and fewer people drive as a result. In cities like New York and London, protected bike lanes have shown to significantly decrease traffic congestion, as each bike lane allows hundreds of people to travel through busy streets in a space that otherwise might accommodate only a few cars. A bill that makes it easier to remove existing bike lanes and slow the instillation of new bike lanes will result in forcing more people back into cars and public transit, both of which are already overburdened.\nToronto, for instance, has made real progress in improving road safety through Vision Zero initiatives, and protected bike lanes are a cornerstone of that effort. We know that bike lanes reduce accidents. Cyclists are among the most vulnerable road users, and without safe, dedicated lanes, they are forced to share space with fast-moving vehicles, which dramatically increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. The presence of protected bike lanes has been shown to reduce the likelihood of accidents by providing a clear separation between cyclists and cars. This Bill will put lives at risk by removing that protection. It will discourage cycling, a healthy, low-carbon form of transportation, in favour of more dangerous roads. My family, friends, and I are all deeply concerned about the erosion of infrastructure that saves lives.\nIn addition to their safety benefits, bike lanes improve the quality of life in urban spaces. Cities with robust cycling networks are more attractive places to live and work. By investing in cycling infrastructure, Toronto has become a more dynamic, forward-thinking city \u2013 which hopefully other cities and towns in Ontario will emulate. Bike lanes create communities where people feel comfortable cycling to work, school, or the grocery store\u2014freeing them from the burdens of long commutes and the costs of owning a car. Bike lanes make our neighbourhoods quieter, reduce air pollution, and open up our streets to more diverse modes of transportation.\nWe are living in a time of climate crisis, and we have a responsibility to lead by example in reducing carbon emissions. Protected bike lanes are one of the most effective ways to encourage cycling, which is a zero-emissions mode of transportation. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution, less traffic, and healthier communities. Bill 212 fails to adequately recognize the environmental costs of forcing more cars back onto already congested roads. Removing protected bike lanes will only increase car dependency, exacerbating the environmental challenges we face as a city and as a province. In this critical moment, we cannot afford to roll back the progress we\u2019ve made in building a more sustainable, resilient Ontario.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this Bill and instead focus on policies that truly reduce gridlock, save time, and improve safety\u2014not just for drivers, but for everyone who shares our streets. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill will only make congestion worse. To reduce congestion, we should be focusing on promoting other modes of transportation:\n- improving existing public transit routes (frequency and reliability) and expanding the networks (e.g. finishing Eglington LRP, Go Transit expansion);\n- upgrading existing bike lanes to fully protected ones and further expanding the network;\n- reducing the reliance on cars in cities by building more walkable neighbourhoods.\nRemoving existing infrastructure is a terrible way to spend taxpayers' money getting them what they didn't ask for.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, as its provisions would severely endanger the lives of cyclists and other vulnerable road users. By prioritizing motor vehicle flow at the expense of safety measures for cyclists, this bill risks causing serious injuries and deaths.\nBill 212\u2019s measures, such as reducing lane-sharing restrictions and encouraging faster road lane changes, will place cyclists directly in harm\u2019s way. Increased proximity and speed of vehicles in lanes shared with cyclists will result in unsafe conditions, exposing cyclists to higher risk of collision, severe injury, and death. Research from jurisdictions worldwide has demonstrated a clear link between such road policies and increased fatalities among cyclists. Cities that prioritize vehicle flow over protected cycling infrastructure often see sharp rises in cycling-related accidents and deaths.\nIf Ontario aims to be a leader in sustainable and safe transportation, it should focus on creating protected bike lanes, expanding Complete Streets initiatives, and implementing speed-calming measures rather than pushing through policies that heighten risk for non-motorized road users. Prioritizing gridlock reduction over human safety is a shortsighted approach that ultimately undermines efforts to create livable, accessible communities.\nI urge Ontario\u2019s policymakers to reject Bill 212 and work instead on solutions that make our roads safe for everyone. We cannot afford a policy that will cost lives.\n"

        "comment": "It is not the jurisdiction of the provincial government to be reviewing and approving every bike lane across all 444 municipalities. Decisions on bike lanes should be made by the local municipal government with data and input from local residents, not from the provincial government, which could be thousands of kms away from the municipality where the bike lanes may be installed.\nThe reason for the traffic congestion in our city is because of too many cars, not because of bike lanes. More people on bikes means less cars on our roads. The less safe bike infrastructure we have, the more people that will be driving in our cities.\nI am a driver, public transit user, and bicycle user. My family and I primarily use our bicycles to get around the city. The bicycle infrastructure in Toronto has started to become more connected and comfortable in recent years. If bike infrastructure is removed, we will need to use our car to get around the city, which will make traffic even worse.\nThis is not a good use of taxpayer money to spend money removing infrastructure that was just recently installed. University Avenue already has 4-6 lanes of car traffic on it in addition to parking and bike lanes. Removing a bike lane is not going to make a different other than putting more people back into cars and further clogging our streets.\nFor Bloor street, the studies have shown that 90% of people who shop at local businesses are pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users. Removing bike lanes on Bloor street would put families at risk and will negatively affect the businesses on this street.\nMore than 70% of people in the Greater Toronto area commute to work on foot, by bike or on transit. The provincial government needs to stay in its lane and focus on completing its long delayed transit projects rather than removing bike infrastructure that will only cause more congestion in our cities.\n"

        "comment": "Bikes move a significant volume of people more efficiently than cars do, in addition to promoting a more healthy lifestyle. Having learned a bit of transportation engineering during my undergrad studies at U of T, research has shown that \"if you build it, they will come\" and this has been proven to happen with vehicular infrastructure expansion projects. The false sense of improved traffic flow is short lived during the initial opening of say an extra lane, until the system reaches a new equilibrium where more people drive and you end up with the same grid lock. The same could be said with bike lanes being used more, except this has a positive outcome being that it takes cars off the roads, and due to the more efficient movement of people in bike lanes, should in theory alleviate traffic for Torontonians.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this legislation. Not only is it an overreach of the provincial government over decisions that should be made at the municipal level, but it attempts to solve a non-existent problem. Bike lanes do not increase congestion. Many studies in many different jurisdictions have demonstrated that they offer increased transportation options to those who choose them, and have little or not effect on the travel times to those who choose to drive cars. Local politicians and city planners are best equipped to make decisions about road infrastructure. Leave it in their hands.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes offer residents a viable mean of alternate transportation, and are vital along Bloor, Yonge, and University. Our streets are not highways, and the absurd mindset that more car lanes are the solution are utterly myopic from our provincial government - Even more so considering that this involves reversing already-completed, effective infrastructure.\nI am a resident of the Etobicoke-Lakeshore riding, and will be switching my vote to the Ontario Liberal Party next election, voting against the Progressive Conservative party for the first time in my life, based on the current government's biased representation of resident voices in my community on this issue. The cherry-picked \"data collection\" and amplification of only voices that agree with their established opinion is utterly disgusting, and an obvious play to overreach into municipal affairs to distract from provincial government failings.\nFocus your attention on getting the LRT extension and highway construction completed, and get out of meddling in successful projects within the city.\n"

Over 25% of those injuries are car-related .\nIt's time to invest in alternative transportation and to modernize. We deserve better.

        "comment": "Wouldn't removing street parking go further than stopping the flow of cyclists?\nAs someone who cycles I have never seen the bike lanes so utilized in my 50 years of biking. It has become a vital route for many commuters and gig workers.\nThe answer to getting people around is not more cars but a variety of modes of transportation, many are much cleaner and more efficient than cars. Also, when it comes to the bloor bike lanes, I see it as a poor use of time to drive a car overtop the underground transportation system. Instead of sinking the 401 underground take the subway.  Driving in Toronto should be for deliveries and emergency vehicles.\nAlso, the eglinton cross town should have already been on line and alleviating traffic years ago, so if more effort were put there this might not have been an issue.\n"

        "comment": "I bike daily and depend on good cycling infrastructure to feel safe getting around the city. With separated bike lines I'm able to keep that cycling up year round. I also own a car and much prefer having cyclists in their own lane so it's easier to navigate our interactions keep everyone safe. I also have two young children (3.5 and 7) who love biking. They constantly pester us to take them for bike rides on streets with bike lanes because they love being able to ride in the bike lanes instead of being forced to stay on the sidewalk.\nThis proposal is populist cynical nonsense - there's plenty of evidence that cyclists spend more at local businesses and encouraging more walking, transit and cycling creates a healthy and more enjoyable streetscape. There's no evidence that preventing or removing bike lanes in anyway helps motorists get around.\nIf you genuinely want to get cars moving faster the only long term solution is to heavily invest in alternative modes of transportation.\n"
