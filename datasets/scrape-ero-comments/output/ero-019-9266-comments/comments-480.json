        "comment": "I am concerned about the potential impact of Bill 212 on jurisdictions other than Toronto. While the bill aims to reduce gridlock in Toronto, this issue may not fully apply to other communities. Guidelines for bike lane implementation are essential, but Toronto\u2019s needs differ from much of the rest of the province. I worry that added bureaucracy could slow bike infrastructure development in areas that have already lagged behind other regions.\nAs a cyclist, business leader, and cycling advocate, I support thoughtful, locally tailored improvements to cycling infrastructure. If Bill 212\u2019s true goal is to improve bike infrastructure, it should clearly state this to gain support from cycling advocates across Ontario, which is a far better strategy than angering and alienating them!   Cyclists aren\u2019t to blame for gridlock, too many cars are.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed Ontario provincial legislation that aims to remove bicycle lanes from our city. As a dedicated bicycle commuter for the past 20 years, I rely on these lanes for safe travel to work and to contribute to reducing automobile traffic.\nFirstly, I believe the decision to remove bicycle lanes could inadvertently worsen traffic congestion, contrary to its intended goals. The current statistics cited to support this change seem to under-represent the growing number of cycling commuters and over-represent the number of drivers. It's important to consider that the trend of cycling is increasing, and supporting this mode of transport can be a valuable tool in reducing car volumes on the road.\nFurthermore, I've observed the increasing adoption of City Bikes among downtown commuters, particularly young professionals who live and work in the core. These individuals rely heavily on central downtown bike lanes, and removing them could force many back to an already crowded and costly public transportation system or into cars, further adding to congestion.\nAnother point of concern is the involvement of the Ontario government in municipal infrastructure decisions. It seems more appropriate for these decisions to be made at the municipal level, respecting local needs and preferences.\nLastly, I feel that this policy could unintentionally marginalize the contributions of cyclists like myself who help reduce traffic volumes by choosing bicycles over cars. Without safe cycling alternatives, many cyclists may have no choice but to switch to driving, counteracting efforts to alleviate traffic issues.\nI hope you will consider these points and the potential long-term impacts on our community. There are myriad reasons for Toronto's traffic challenges - including long-standing structural challenges, Uber and DoorDash drivers, and the increased density in the core - these are hard problems to deal with to be sure.  Vilifying cyclists however is not the way to improve the situation for the long term, and definitely not in the short term.\nThank you for taking the time to listen to the concerns of your constituents.\n"

        "comment": "Like the majority of other students I know, I use my bike as an affordable means of transportation to get to work and school. It\u2019s time efficient and I notice my health is exponentially better since starting to bike.  Bike lanes have been critical to ensuring I can get home safely each day. If bike lanes were removed in my area, the risk of getting hit by a car on my way to school would skyrocket. Before the a new bike lane was implemented on my commute route last year, the amount of stories I heard about students getting hit and seriously injured was terrifying. Since the new bike lane, I always see it packed full of students and neighbours on bikes and never feel afraid of getting hit and risking my life just to get to school. Cars should not take priority over cyclists and put them at risk - especially when cycling saves money, time, and our health.\nGridlock does not necessitate the removal of bike lanes and Ontarians tax dollars should not be put towards fixing a Toronto gridlock problem.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this hostile stance against safe cycling infrastructure for many reasons. Firstly, I am a cyclist, and this act is an effort to make me personally less safe, and many other citizens of Ontario less safe. I am also a driver, and instead of \"saving me time\", removing cycling infrastructure will make traffic congestion worse, because many road users who might have ridden a bicycle for short trips will instead take their car, and further clog the roads. When I need to drive, I want as many cyclists as possible to take their bike, and leave their cars at home, to reduce traffic congestion. This will reduce gridlock and save me time.\n"

There are no studies indicating that bike lanes are responsible for any increase in traffic times. Quite the opposite is true: studies show that bike lanes help to reduce gridlock.\nThere is no reason for the province to waste taxpayer money meddling in municipal affairs and doing additional roadwork to remove functional bike lanes that are actively helping to ease traffic and save lives.\n"

        "comment": "Do not remove the bike lanes.\nAs a diver I seen with more traffic on roads without bike lanes then roads with bike lanes. Traffic is cause by drivers changing or merging into other lanes as it causes the cars around them to slow down and in doing so causes all the cars behind to slow down aswell. This happens more as more lanes are added and I often see this when the right lane of the road is also being used for parking, meaning drivers have to merge to the left every time there is a parked car.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Young, and University are essential to the bike network of Toronto as much as they are to automobile network, and for the same reasons, being a long stretch road with little turns and detours making it faster to get places than having to link multiple smaller roads. Removing these bike lanes takes Toronto a step backwards in its image of a world class city.\nEvery time someone choses to take a bike to work, it takes a car off the road and along with it the space that vehicle takes up and replaces it with a much smaller footprint, (even when the vehicle is full, the occupants still take a lesser space if they were on bicycles) it eliminates the carbon emissions the vehicle would produce, it eliminates wear on the road surface the vehicle would produce, and it reduces strain on health care by contributing to a healthy lifestyle improving ones cardiovascular system instead of sitting in a confined space which reduces blood circulation leading to health issues over time.\nRemoving these bike lanes without replacing them with a better and improved system of bike paths along the same route is objectively the worst decision that can be made from this bill and I am surprised the bill has even gotten to the point that I have to write this comment.\n"

I feel that if this legislation is passed and enacted (Bill 212 and the ERO number 019-9266), the resulting chaos and gridlock in the city will force me to leave the city, along with many other professionals.\nThe bike lanes on these streets are supported by businesses and drivers in the areas. They REDUCE traffic congestion, even for cars, allowing faster and safer turning for cars. 5 years of construction on major roads, to REMOVE something desired by the city's inhabitants?!\nToronto will become Detroit within 10 years with these foolish & corrupt policies, and I plan to leave if this self-destruction process continues.

        "comment": "*Biking is a reliable way to commute to locations that are off the subway lines*\nThe university bike lane has a major positive impact on my weekday evening commutes from downtown to Sunnyside. The commuting options are as follows:\n\t- 30mins by bike,\n\t- 1-hour drive, or\n\t- 1-hour (or longer) TTC\nStudies have shown that people will take the option that is the fastest, safest, and most reliable.\nSince there is often poor bicycle and transit infrastructure in the GTA, many people choose to drive. Which results in more cars, that cause more gridlock.\nIf we remove protected bike lanes, biking can feel unsafe and unreliable for many. During rush hour, on roads without bike lanes, cyclists are also stuck in car traffic, which directly adds to gridlock and frustration for all users of the road. As such, more people that would cycle if they had safe infrastructure may instead choose to drive, which increases traffic and extends rush hour periods.\nIf we are instead able to focus our efforts towards improving public transit and bicycle infrastructure, this will certainly take some cars off the road. Which will directly reduce gridlock.\n*Biking reduces gridlock* [1]\nIf I were to drive during rush hour, I would be adding 1 more car to the road, which increases traffic and gridlock. If every cyclist were to think like this (i.e., drive instead of bike), that would exponentially increase city gridlock during rush hours.\nAs such, it is critical that bicycle infrastructure is held up so that people who are able to bike to their destination can safely do so.\nAdditionally, improved bicycle infrastructure incentivizes new cyclists who otherwise are afraid to bike in the city due to the very real risks of being hit by a driver in unprotected bike lanes, or in situations when the road must be shared with cars.\n*Car emissions are adding to global warming, decreased health, and a scary future for our children* [1, 2]\nIt has been studied that cities with fewer cars have cleaner air. With the concerns for our future air quality, health, and life outcomes, not only for us adults, but our future children, it is a MUST to prioritize creating a healthier environment. It is our responsibility to ensure the future world that our children will live in remains safe so they can lead long, healthy lives.\nAdditionally, when we will rely on these children being able to care for us when we are old, they must be strong, healthy, and capable to do so.\n*Improving personal health & fitness can improve the economy*\nBike lanes incentivize more people to bike. Biking can be for the purpose of commuting to work, to social activities, or even to get outdoors and have exercise.\nDoctors are beginning to prescribe \"getting outside\" and \"exercise\" as initial remedies to depression and anxiety [3]. As such, bike lanes are a great way to help your citizens get outside a bit more frequently to improve both their mental and physical health.\nA society with better health will thrive and ultimately improve the economy as citizens are more fit to work (both physically and mentally) and have less health complications that require complex medical treatment (i.e., that would otherwise cost more tax dollars).\n*Pedestrians and cyclists are slower than cars, and are more likely to see stores that interest them, stop, and shop!* [4]\nStudies have also shown that shopping areas improve their sales after the area increases bike and pedestrian traffic. This is also good for our economy and for ensuring that small businesses in Toronto thrive.\n*Increasing cyclists & pedestrians helps EMS workers and those who absolutely need to drive to get to their destinations faster* [4]\nMore people will take transit, bike, and walk when it is safe and reliable. This directly reduces the number of people driving downtown, and immediately reduces gridlock. An added benefit is that EMS workers will be able to get to the site of an emergency faster, which saves lives.\nFurther, anyone who absolutely needs to drive (i.e., plumbers, electricians, delivery vehicles, etc.) will also be able to get to their destination sooner [1]. Plus, with fewer vehicles, it will be easier for those workers to find parking so they can get to each of their sites with efficiency and ease.\n*Closing statement*\nThe Ontario citizens and economy can thrive by investing in our people and by creating more jobs related to creating and improving bicycle and transit infrastructure. Such measures will improve people's long term health by promoting exercise, getting outside, and by reducing car emissions across the GTA (where majority of Ontario's population resides).\nOverall, by investing in protected bicycle and public transit infrastructure, the Ontario government will directly reduce gridlock and will be able to efficiently achieve their goals for getting people where they need to go faster.\n[1] https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n[2] https://www.weforum.org/stories/2018/08/air-pollution-opportunity-not-j\u2026\n[3] https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/health/canada-doctors-prescribe-nature-w\u2026.\n[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlXNVnftaNs\n"

        "comment": "I entirely agree with this proposal!  Yes, many people are biking today, but the main type of transportation is and will continue to be a vehicle.  We need to ensure vehicular traffic moves smoothly and quickly; replacing traffic lanes with bike lanes is not conducive to this.  If there is room to add a bike lane by removing part of a boulevard or similar, that is fine but to reduce traffic lanes to add a bike lane is not reasonable or sensible.   A better option would be for bikes to be ridden on sidewalks.  For the most part, a pedestrian hit by a bicycle will suffer much less severe injuries than a biker hit by a vehicle.  In conclusion, please don't remove any more traffic lanes to add bike lanes!\n"

There have been natural disasters in the form of hurricanes and wildfires in the last few months that have wreaked havoc in North America.

Bikes have been an easy way for people to reduce their fossil fuel emissions while also being active and being able to easily navigate busy downtown areas without getting stuck in vehicular traffic.

        "comment": "To begin with the name of the Bill is incredibly parochial, suggesting that there's only one outcome and only one concern.  That's a very selfish approach and doesn't consider the many possibilities of traffic control and design, including for bikes.  I use bike lanes leisurely and occasionally to commute to work but also drive a significant amount in the city of Toronto.  I live on the Bloor-Danforth corridor and see no issue with the bike lanes on Danforth.   There is enough evidence to support the inclusion of bike lanes and the minimal impact they have on gridlock and transit times.  It's not even an issue worth discussing anymore - any discussion on that is purely political (read: not based in fact).\nThe bigger issue for me is the cost to remove bike lanes that are currently built - that is absolutely NOT worth the cost.  As a taxpayer this would be unacceptable.  I also feel that if the province of Ontario pursues removal that they should compensate municipalities (and by default the taxpayers of those municipalities) for all the upfront time and money that was put into installing the lanes - not just the installation but all the design and consultation.  Significant input is sought before implementing these projects and support was obviously given to the projects. I do not support my tax dollars going into removing bike lanes that already exist. So to remove them is not listening to the public - the taxpayers!\nWhat I think the province should focus on, is what's within it's actual mandate which transportation design and guidance - providing better guidance on how to integrate various users into the transportation system.  That can include guidance on how much support is required to proceed, better design criteria (some of the current bike lane designs are poor and take up much more space that is actually needed), and how to incorporate all current bike lane users (bikes, e-bikes, e-scooters, etc) into the transportation.  You know, something that actually adds value rather just being a political nuisance...\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern about the potential removal of bike lanes in the City of Toronto. Bike lanes are a vital component of our urban infrastructure, promoting safer streets, a healthier environment, and equitable access to transportation. Removing these lanes would disproportionately affect marginalized and lower-income communities, making it clear that this is not just a transportation issue, but a class issue.\nBike lanes provide an affordable and accessible means of transportation for many residents who cannot afford the rising costs of car ownership. For individuals who rely on cycling to get to work, school, or access essential services, bike lanes are crucial for their safety and mobility. When bike lanes are removed, people who are already economically disadvantaged are put at greater risk and left with fewer transportation options.\nI urge the province to consider the broader social and economic implications of removing bike lanes and to invest in infrastructure that supports all Torontonians, not just those with the privilege of car ownership. Creating a truly inclusive and accessible city requires a commitment to equitable and environmentally friendly transportation options.\n"
