        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the content of Bill 212. Scientific evidence suggests that bike lanes often reduce traffic, as does common sense (the square footage of a bike is significantly less than that of a motor vehicle, and is therefore a more efficient form of travel).\nInitially, many bikers will simply decide to continue to bike on these streets even if the bike lanes are removed. Therefore, this will create an even slower experience for drivers, as they'll be stuck behind cyclists.\nFinally, this is very clearly a huge health and safety issue. In my own experience, I've felt very safe biking on the streets that have been mentioned for bike lane removal, using the current infrastructure. However, removing these lanes would make me feel less safe while biking, and will increase bike-related fatalities significantly.\nThe government has not presented any data as to why this change would be beneficial to the city or province in any way, and I believe it is their duty to make data-driven decisions. I will certainly not vote to re-elect this current government if Bill 212 comes into effect.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212's proposal to remove existing bike lanes on key routes, and hamper the addition of new ones, is dismayingly regressive and myopic. Rather than re-imagining urban planning for the future, the proposal doubles down on the archaic car-centric way of life by setting up the wrong incentives and dooming the possibility of more inclusive, healthy, environmentally-friendly modes of movement. From personal experience as well as common sense, bike lanes in general, and protected bike lanes in particular, are critical in inviting more and more commuters to embrace bikes as a viable short-distance commuting option.\nWe need more and better biking infrastructure, not less. Please, please don't take this away from us.\n"

It\u2019s time for the government of Ontario to come up with solutions that actually contribute to alleviating traffic like transit that is affordable and accessible. It\u2019s embarrassing that we\u2019re regressing in this city/province by making cities more car friendly instead of looking for solutions that consider the environment and safely of ALL road users. Furthermore, why is the province looking to remove bike lanes in a specific municipality? This should be a local government decision. This proposal should be rejected in its entirety.\n"

As a car owner and car driver as well, bike lanes make me less worried about accidentally hitting a cyclist.

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford, Minister Sarkaria, and all involved in this Bill,\nAs a lifelong resident of Ontario, I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to this proposal and Bill 212 and urge you to ABANDON THIS PROPOSAL in its entirety for the following reasons:\n1. INCREASED RED TAPE: A government with a Ministry of Red Tape Reduction should not be introducing a process by which local governments need approvals by provincial authority for local planning decisions that have already been researched and consulted on. This will result in inefficiency, waste of the Ontario government's time, and waste of taxpayer money.\n2. WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO UNDO LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS: Regardless of the true cost of removing bike lanes, $27M has already been sunk into new bike lanes. If the estimates are right, and bike lanes begin to be removed, EVERY ONTARIAN (including my child) will have paid $5 for ZERO BENEFIT to the province. At best, we will be back where we started.\n3. NEGATIVE IMPACT TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN TORONTO: As you well know, both municipal and provincial planning has encouraged the development of thousands of residential units in Toronto on the main corridors of Bloor, Avenue, and Yonge that COUNT ON its residents to be car-less, and explicitly encourages bike ownership. By reducing the quality of available cycling infrastructure and jeopardizing the efficient construction of new lanes, the province is LOWERING THE VALUE OF THIS HOUSING STOCK for everyone and potentially delaying or stopping new housing being built.\n4. DISCRIMINATION AND INEQUALITY: Every person in Ontario has the same right to efficiency and safety, whether they drive a car or not. This proposal CLEARLY PRIORITIZES CAR-OWNING ONTARIANS over non-car driving Ontarians, thereby discriminating against equity-deserving groups (such as racialized people and households headed by women) who are less likely to own cars.\n5. PROPOSAL DOES NOTHING FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE OF REDUCING GRIDLOCK AND SAVING TIME: If this government \"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\", it EXPLICITLY WILL WORSEN CONGESTION by a) closing three main roads for construction for nine months AND b) raising the likelihood of collisions between motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians (since sidewalks will be impacted too).\n6. PERSONAL IMPACT: My whole life living in London and Toronto, I have commuted and gotten around by bike. I have found this to be the most efficient option for distances under 10km during rush hour and its especially efficient when bike lanes are available. In 2024, I have a 2 year old and take her around the City on my bike. Speaking for myself, I feel much safer biking with my child in a bike lane than I do in the centre of a car lane, since it gives cars more distance to pass. Regardless of whether this proposal goes through, I will CONTINUE to use arterial roads to bike on - This proposal only affects whether I will exercise MY RIGHT TO OCCUPY THE FULL LANE.\nIN SUMMARY, if this proposal and bill are passed in its current form, it will serve to WASTE MY MONEY AND LOWER MY QUALITY OF LIFE by making government less efficient, wasting municipal and provincial funds, worsening gridlock, and imperiling myself and my child.\nFinally, while I have focused my letter on the impacts of the proposal for bike lane red tape and removals, I ALSO STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL FOR ITS DISREGARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT with regards to expediting the construction of Highway 413. Environmental assessment is NOT OPTIONAL - we only have one chance to make the right decision, and our laws and rules exist to ensure we don't destroy habitats and worsen the climate crisis through our actions. I ask that you FOLLOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACT for Highway 413.\nThank you for your time and attention to my letter. Please show respect for all of Ontario's \"folks\" and abandon this proposal and Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a necessary part of any urban infrastructure. They help get people out of cars, which eases congestion and frees up parking. They're hardly \"the frontline in a war on cars\". They allow people who would otherwise depend on cars to get around the city, and are accessible to those who are unable to drive. Bike lanes are essential to a thriving city, and removing them is shortsighted at best.\n"

        "comment": "I have been cycling in the city for 30 years.  And over this period, the bike lanes that have been added to the city infrastructure have greatly improved safety for everyone - cyclists, pedestrians and cars.  I plan all my rides to maximize use of the bike lanes for commuting and errands from April through November.\nPrioritizing car traffic over all other road users is taking a step backwards, not forwards.  It contributes to continued gridlock and emissions.  Plus, it steals funding that could be put toward better transit infrastructure.  Adding lanes of traffic does not improve gridlock.  There are many studies that show it has no effect, or that it increases gridlock.  Here's an example from UC Davis in California  https://www.ucdavis.edu/magazine/does-widening-highways-ease-traffic-co\u2026.  A quick chat with your favourite AI will provide further data from London (UK), Germany and the Netherlands.  And from right here at home.  https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nThe best way to reduce congestion?  MORE bike lanes, and MORE transit.  Please don't waste my tax dollars to remove bike lanes that I already paid for, use regularly, and prefer.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, as it rests on the assumption that removing bike lanes will significantly ease traffic congestion. Driving in the city has become nearly impossible, underscoring the urgent need for robust alternative transportation options\u2014not more of the same. Expanding bike lanes would not only encourage more people to embrace cycling but also create a safer and more accessible environment for all riders. Personally, I have avoided biking north-south in the city due to safety concerns stemming from the lack of adequate bike infrastructure, and I assume many others feel the same.\nMoreover, the cost of removing the bike lanes is both impractical and wasteful. Taxpayer money should be allocated to addressing far more pressing issues that genuinely affect the public. I strongly oppose the Premier diverting resources and attention to a matter where he has no rightful place to intervene.\n"

If they are removed, cyclists will continue to use the routes (Bloor, Yonge, etc.), except they will join motor traffic, making travel much more dangerous.\nIt will be unnecessarily costly and time-consuming to remove bike lanes that were so recently built. This Bill will not save anyone money or time.\n"

        "comment": "Claiming that bike lanes significantly impede traffic is short-sighted and ignores the broader benefits they bring to cities. Removing them would be downright foolish, as bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use alternative, sustainable transportation. This shift actually alleviates congestion over time. Cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen are shining examples of how prioritizing bikes leads to smoother traffic flow and happier commuters. Eliminating bike lanes would only force more people back into cars, worsening the very traffic issues critics claim to be solving. Let\u2019s not pretend the problem is bike lanes when it\u2019s car-centric urban planning that\u2019s choked our cities. Punishing cyclists to maintain  status quo for drivers is counterproductive, environmentally reckless, and a step backward for urban mobility.\n"

        "comment": "I am a parent and commute through the downtown core to take my kid to school and myself to work.  The bike routes are the only ways I can ensure I can get to my kid safely to school across midtown to the west end. We don\u2019t have safe routes in some sections so we have to take sidewalks for safety as it is.  I have to bike across town because after a separation I had to move to where I could afford to live- and moved into a family members apartment.  In order to keep my kids\u2019 school stable, we commute across the city daily. We use the Richmond, Adelaide, Wellington protected bike lates regularly- we go out of our way to get to these because it\u2019s safer. The protected bike lanes ensure my kid who is in a bike trailer is much safer.  In addition it means I\u2019m not using gas or contributing to traffic for my 30 min commute- (two ways as I have to return to work downtown after drop off!\nI get to move my body (decreasing cost on the health care system because I\u2019m moving more !) and can actually stop in on several stores that I can\u2019t get to when I\u2019m driving because it\u2019s a hassle, parking is more expensive.  I also drive- removing bike lanes means more people will be driving- if people like me who can bike because there are safe routes.  I bike because I can get places faster-remove a bike lane and I\u2019ll be driving/ the time a more traffic. I\u2019m sure this is the case for many of us.\nAlso many of our kids bike to school- the middle schools and high schools are all over- safe bike routes protect our oldest ground to middle school along College street. We use the Bloor bike route to get to high park and other green spaces, and to visit family.  Again biking means we don\u2019t add to traffic. Bikers are also drivers. We live and work in the city. The bike lanes contribute to our families\u2019 safety and our businesses.\nFewer bike lanes means accidents & means parents who can\u2019t work, or kids with life long injured.  Kids who have long trips to middle school and highschool need safe bike lanes too. I\u2019m grateful for the protected lanes on Bloor and  and college street routes because they protect our kids daily.\nIn addition, more construction is an irresponsible waste of resources when we need money for the education system.  Our kids are in the education system, our parents are in the health care system: I\u2019m confident many of us are acutely  aware of were else the province could put its attention for the betterment of the businesses and families.\nAlternatives could be making more streets one way. Better timing for lights.  Finishing the repairs on the highway (the summer traffic has been because of highway traffic) increase transit frequency so people feel more comfortable that they will catch a street car or subway and get where they are going in a timely manner.  The east west downtown corridors (the spaces better the east west subway lines and the southern train lines  is not reliable to do a commute , make multiple stops.  More frequency along Dundas, college, king, queen, would be welcome!\nParking downtown - for many of us there isn\u2019t on street parking.\nThe pollution  in the city is already very difficult in the summer- fewer bike lanes will make for more drivers and less bikers. Visitors don\u2019t understand bikes and protected bike lanes make a huge difference.  Respectfully, this is a dangerous and irresponsible idea- removing bike lanes harms businesses (harder to stop and find parking, harder to bike to diverse local businesses)  increases pollution and decreases safety for kids, teens and adults that need to safely get to school and work. Removing established infrastructure that is working, takes  money from kids, families and hospitals. Please do not peruse this plan.\n"

The opposite is more often true:  bike lanes improve congestion by making people feel safe to use bicycles to get around.  This takes cars off the road.\nRemoving the bike lanes will:\n- cause more injuries and fatalities to cyclists\n- will increase congestion in the short term due to the unneeded construction to rip up our roads again\n- will increase congestion in the long term due to more people back in cars rather than on bicycles\n- will go backwards in terms of our commitments to sustainability and reduction in green house gases\n- will cost money that is much better spent elsewhere\n- will make all of the money that was already spent putting the bike lanes in place a complete waste\nI am also STRONGLY OPPOSED to the aspects of the bill that will make it harder for municipalities to put new bike lanes in place for all of the same reasons.
