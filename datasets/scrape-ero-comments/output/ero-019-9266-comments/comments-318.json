Every person stuck in traffic wishes the person in front of them wasn't on the road. The only way to do that is to increase alternate modes of transit, including bikes and busses.\nNot only does this feel ideological, it will achieve the opposite effect t of what it purportedly intends. Congestion will increase, businesses will suffer, and pedestrians will be at higher risk.\nI implore the government to reverse this decision.\n"

I see the real effect bike lanes have, and it's getting people off the road so that I, as a driver, have to compete with less cars on the roads. Forcing more and more people to use their car to get around as opposed to other modalities is going to create bumper to bumper gridlock for the foreseeable future. The demand induced by this change is going to make traffic even worse, and I truly hope the province comes to it's senses and sees the complete lack of respect for taxpayer time and money that the proposal to remove the bike lanes show.\n"

When I first heard about it I thought it was a just because it was so absurd.\nThis proposal is not being made based on fact based evidence but rather it seems rushed through as quickly as possible.\nThe provincial government took an extended summer break. Upon returning this bill was one of the first announced. With the province facing so, so many urgent issues including lack of housing and a health care system that feels like it gets worse every day why is removing bike lanes and putting road users at risk such a priority?\nA lot of thought and consultation has been done at a municipal level to get where we are now. This bill is a huge overreach by the province and should be dropped.\nI ask the province to please consider the data that is available. And to ask the following questions before moving forward:\n-Does removing bike lanes improve travel times for all commuters?\n-There is information available that indicates how many people use bike lanes. How do these numbers compare to drivers on the same stretch of road.\n-Is one cyclist equal to one driver?\n-Do Bike Lanes make people safer?\n-What data is available to prove that removing bike lanes will improve travel time for drivers?\n"

If current proposal of removing parts of Yonge, Bloor and University bike lanes comes through, that would mean:\n1. The return of construction along those streets contributing to further gridlock\n2. The undoing of all the work that was done to implement these bike lanes in the first place, which means that all the money spent on them thus far was wasted\n3. Economic consequences for all the small and large businesses along those roads\n4. NO reduction in gridlock, and arguably and increase (Gridlock was bad even before the bike lanes were implemented, but at least once bike lanes were introduced people had the possibility of moving around the city at a faster pace)\n5. Deterioration of quality of life and access to services for those of us who do not own cars. The Ontario government has made no meaningful improvements to public transportation, and our only way of getting around the city efficiently and safely has been through the use of these protected bike lanes.\n6. A reduction in the use of bikes means greater road maintenance costs for the government, more environmental consequences, worse health outcomes for Toronto's population (and consequently higher spending on healthcare), and a less vibrant and livable city.\nToronto is a city of *people*, not drivers, and any transportation changes should consider all residents, regardless of their mode of movement, and improve the options available to them. This includes significant improvement to public transit, expanding infrastructure for bike lanes, and instituting other modes to make getting around the city easier without needing a car.\n"

I've never seen or heard so much opposition to the PCs before. If you don't start actually behaving like a conservative, you WILL begin to lose votes.\nI have always been a PC voter, but I will have to change that if the provincial government decides to force it's way into municipal politics and waste tax money like this. This current government is even more corrupt and money wasting than the Wynne Liberals were.\nI am a construction delivery driver that spends 5 to 6 hours a day in Toronto traffic and from my exlerience I can tell you this is not just a bad idea, it's downright dangerous.\nIn order to reduce congestion we need to offer safe alternatives to driving. It's the single driver SUVs that are clogging the roads, not bikes. The solution should be along the lines of a driving permit for non essential car traffic for non residents of Toronto, while creating MORE bike lanes so people are encouraged to stop driving.\nAdding lanes does NOT reduce traffic and this is clear from all the studies done in Toronto and just about every other world class city. Removing bike lanes WILL lead to more deaths and this blood will be on the premiers hands. Please reconsider before causing needless deaths.\n"

        "comment": "Is there evidence that removing bike lanes will actually alleviate gridlock? If there is no designated lane, bikers will need to ride in a traffic lane, which would slow down traffic anyway. The streets with the proposed removal of bike lanes have high bicycle, electric scooter, and e-bike usage and oftentimes I see many people not wearing helmets. Requiring all of these individuals to ride in a traffic lane with cars will greatly endanger everyone.\nI strongly believe that the best way to improve gridlock would be to incentivize the use of public transit and disincentivize single commuter drivers. This would require more investments into improving and upgrading existing transit infrastructure.\n"

It is so much simpler to have bikes in the separated lane; I\u2019m never stuck behind one, unable to pass safely, like I am on Dundas. There is profoundly less congestion on Bloor now that these bike lanes are there and the turning rules have prevented the usual gridlock cause which is a left turning car waiting for the yellow light to go.\nThe idea that bike lanes can be put on side streets ignores the fact that many of these cyclists are commuting, and need to get where they\u2019re going in a direct way. They won\u2019t leave the main roads if we take the bike lanes off. They\u2019ll just get in front of cars or force cars to pass them too closely.\nTo say nothing of the years of construction tearing up these bike lanes. Why??! This will make things much, much worse.\nThe biggest complaint seems to be the bloor and Jane and Kingsway intersection. Why not tackle gridlock by looking at problem intersections and adjusting light timing? This is a huge pain point in the city - there are many intersections that are held up for no reason other than poor light timings and outdated turning restrictions. This is something you could get done quickly and would actually make a difference for people. Not some transparently ideological gripe that will waste our money and make everyone in the city\u2019s life worse for at least a decade.\n"

First, it will do the opposite of what it says - it will increase gridlock and congestion because it will force people who are now travelling by bike back into single-occupancy vehicles. The only solution to reducing gridlock is to reduce the number of vehicles travelling on our roads. Second, it will literally result in more deaths and serious injuries to vulnerable road users by removing bike lanes, that have been proven to be safer for all road users. Third, by building new highways outside dense urban development it will encourage sprawl, and with the lack of high order transit in those areas it will cause more people to drive, thus increasing traffic and gridlock.\n"

Bike lanes are an important part of transportation of the in cities and towns of Ontario. I live in Toronto and having a safe space to bike or scooter has helped me be more confident on the road. I was too afraid to do it before the introduction of lanes on Bloor, University, College, Yonge or other city streets.\nAdditionally, removing them will just put more cars on the road or people in public transit. More cars don\u2019t solve the problem. Most cars only have one person in them. People complain about bike lanes, but they don\u2019t notice how many more people are able to travel to their destination than cars (not only on bikes, but also on public transit).\nAlso, removing bike lanes puts bikes on the sidewalks which makes being a pedestrian even more dangerous.\nDo not give the Ontario government the right to remove or deny bike lanes.\n"

This proposal just tells Torontonians that the province isn\u2019t committed to a forward-thinking approach. It would make much more sense to focus on expanding and improving transit sustainably, not cutting back on options people depend on.\nThere's also the safety issue: today\u2019s bike lanes are packed not only with cyclists but also food couriers, e-bikes, and even motorized bikes. A conversation around this safety challenge is long overdue. Rather than pulling out existing lanes, why not look at how to make them safer for everyone?\n"
