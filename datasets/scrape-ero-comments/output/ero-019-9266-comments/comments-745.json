        "comment": "I am absolutely opposed to this proposal. As a lifelong Torontonian and cyclist, now with a new family, I am horrified to think of reducing safety for myself, my child and my fellow bike riders on this city\u2019s streets. I use the bike lanes in question daily, and rely on them to get to work and home safely. The power to remove them, at great cost by taxpayers, offers no benefit. Neither Vehicular traffic nor pedestrians will experience improvements and certainly cyclist deaths will increase.\nFurther, environmental impact assessments must be conducted following due process when considering any and all highway construction, most certainly 413. This highway will cut through important and rare old growth conservation lands and comes at great cost to our local ecosystem and regional value.\n"

They encourage more people to cycle, reducing the number of cars on the road, which is the real cause of traffic congestion. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t solve traffic problems; it will only discourage cycling and increase car dependence. Let\u2019s use common sense\u2014more bikes means fewer cars, which ultimately leads to smoother, less congested streets for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Transportation policy should not be based solely around commuting to and from work.  People travel for many more reasons than just work, and choose the mode that is appropriate to both the need and conditions.  People use bikes for more than just going to and from work.  They use them to shop, visit family and friends, going to school, doing errands, for recreation and exercise, and deserve to feel safe while engaging in those activities, just as drivers and pedestrians should also feel safe.  Your actions will not only endanger people in all of these groups, they effectively guarantee more injuries and fatalities.\n"

        "comment": "I'm very upset with the Ford government proposing to reduce bike lanes in favour of car lanes and force municipalities to apply for provincial approval before adding bikes lanes that would reduce car lanes!\nAre we not in the midst of a climate change crisis?  Climate change is wreaking havoc at an alarming rate and the government of Ontario is trying to take away the one thing that we as citizens can easily do to reduce our carbon emissions.\nThe government should be promoting bike lanes encouraging citizens to embrace active transportation as much as possible rather than discouraging it.\nI'm frustrated with the lack of bike lanes in my community!  I want to ride my bike to shop, get groceries, as well as for enjoyment and to build good health, but the lack of bike lanes is a deterrent.  I do ride my bike instead of driving sometimes, in spite of the fact that friends tell me it's dangerous to ride where there aren't bike lanes, because I feel very strongly about reducing carbon emissions.  I believe our governments should be supporting us in our individual efforts to make a difference, not discouraging us from doing our part!\nI've had conversations with people who would ride bikes regularly instead of driving cars, especially retirees, but they fear for their safety.  Cycling is good for your health and imagine the benefit of reduced health care costs due to healthier citizens!\nMore cyclists means less wear and tear on the roads.  Also, if more people cycled to work there would be less gridlock.  Due to our warmer climate, we have more days in the winter when we would be able to cycle instead of driving.  Also with the increased availability of quality electric bicycles, it's easier for people of all ages and fitness levels to choose this environmentally friendly mode of transportation.  In Europe many people cycle to work and are encouraged to do so.\nI urge you to reconsider this misguided proposal of yours and support your citizens by encouraging more bike lanes, not discouraging them!\n"

        "comment": "No modern civilization should be impeding efforts to support cycling as a method of commuting throughout urban spaces. Not only are there significant mental and physical health benefits to active means of travel, but also there are significant economic and environmental benefits as well. In the time of an urgent climate crisis and need to drastically reduce emissions to achieve targets, we should NOT be making it harder for people to reduce their use of cars. Travel by bike also puts civilians in closer contact to local businesses and encourages local spending. Healthier, more social and connected communities are far less of a burden on our healthcare system. Cycling (when supported by safe infrastructure) reduces stress and increases physical well being. This is also an equity and social rights issue, as lower income residents are unable to afford cars and don't have space to park them. Safe cycling gives everyone access to quick and low cost travel to the services they need and places they work and live.\nIt is unconscionable that millions of dollars could be spent UNDOING THE PROGRESS our communities have made toward bike friendly cities. I am a home owner on a side street along the Bloor St artery and these bike lanes are essential to our rights and abilities to be healthy and sustainable residents. We do not need more space for car use.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Government's proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge is a step backwards. These bike lanes are heavily used, improve Toronto's air quality and the overall health of those who use them, and are key to maintaining the safety of cyclists. It is also probable that their removal will result in increased traffic, as people will return to cars rather than risk their safety on busy streets.\nThe installation of these lanes has resulted in far more use of bicycles as a means of transportation, in large part because they make people feel safe cycling on the streets of Toronto. Furthermore, it is likely that those who don't cycle are more likely to make use of the TTC as a means of transportation in order to avoid traffic congestion. This, in turn, leads to further improvement of the city's air quality and boosts ridership and income for the TTC.\nCycling is also a form of exercise, which leads to improvement in overall health and reduces health care costs in the long run.\nOther world class cities such as Paris, New York and Amsterdam are adding cycling lanes to encourage people to get out of their cars. Let's keep our city a world class one. Please save Toronto's Bike Lanes!\n"

        "comment": "I do not support removing bike lanes nor creating additional provincial red tape for the implementation of new bike lanes. I live in Toronto. Year after year in this city, bike share ridership has been increasing quickly and at a steady rate. People are seeing the developments to bike infrastructure and making the choice to cycle more. For Toronto, this means fewer cars on the road, less air and noise pollution, less traffic, improved public health and greater freedom of transportation within the city. Every cyclist using a bike lane is one less car on the road and one more person out of your way as a driver.\nOne of the most common users of bike infrastructure that I see regularly are food delivery workers (eg. Uber Eats, etc.). Anyone who has ever been in downtown Toronto has seen them on their bikes with their big square cooler bags. Removing the bike lanes will not keep them from cycling within the city. They'll either use the roadways (slowing down car traffic and endangering themselves), or they'll use the sidewalks (illegal, slower, and endangers pedestrians). Bike lanes keep cyclists out of everyone's way and keeps traffic moving, which is better for everyone, including drivers.\nPremier Doug Ford himself said, during an episode of TVO's Political Blind Date in 2017, that he himself feels safer when the bike lanes are separate from the road lanes, and that \"1 [cyclist] death is way too many\". This year, 6 cyclists have died riding their bikes in the city, and now Ford wants to use his provincial powers to take away the infrastructure that makes cycling safer, despite the agreement of the local municipality and local voters that they want these lanes. The premier is overstepping his bounds with this legislation and I hope it fails.\n"

Stay away!\nBike lanes are an important part of safety in this community and these throughways are main arteries not only for drivers, transit riders and pedestrians, but also cyclists. What a waste of taxpayers dollars to remove infrastructure that is already in place. An extra traffic lane does not mean saving time, it means more congestion. More space, more people. Maybe the vehicle drivers can consider taking a different road rather than spending hundreds of millions to remove bike lanes. The riders are not going anywhere. You are just creating an unsafe environment for the residents of Toronto. Doug Ford - you are not Toronto's Mayor! Stop acting like it!\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m a conservative and I voted for this government. However, as a driver and a mother, I disapprove of Bill 212, and the recent urban planning decisions the government has been making since those decisions have not been rooted in research. Research shows that adding car capacity will make traffic worse. I\u2019m also upset because Bill 212 contradicts the conservative principles I was promised.\n1. It Will Make Traffic Worse\nAs a driver, I don\u2019t want everyone to be forced to drive. I want people to bike, walk, take the train, etc. so that there are less cars on the road and less gridlock. That would make it easier to drive my kids when we need to.\n2. It\u2019s Unsafe for my Kids\nAs a mother, I want my kids to be able to walk and bike home after school on their own since I\u2019m working and can\u2019t pick them up at 3. I want them to be able to do this safely and the more cars that are on the road, the more dangerous it is for my kids to walk on the sidewalk and cross the street. I shouldn\u2019t need to worry about them getting hit by a car while crossing the street!\n3. Adding Red Tape is Against Conservative Values\nAs a conservative, I oppose excessive government interference and support local decision-making. Bill 212 imposes centralized control over transportation planning, adding layers of bureaucracy and slowing down processes that should be handled efficiently at the municipal level. My local government understands my community\u2019s needs and develop infrastructure accordingly. Requiring provincial oversight for bike lanes runs counter to the conservative value of limiting government overreach and streamlining decision-making.\n4. More Fiscally Responsible\nFrom a fiscal conservative perspective, bike lanes are more cost-effective than car lanes and highways. They require far less maintenance than roads and reduce the demand for expensive car-centric infrastructure like wide roads and parking lots.\nI don\u2019t want to waste my taxpayer dollars on funding roads and highways. I want to divert people away from having to drive (trains, bike, walking) so I can have more space when I need to drive. I also want the choice to be able to bike and walk safely with my family when I want to.\nIn conclusion, as a conservative and mother, I am against Bill 212. Bike infrastructure isn\u2019t about ideology; it\u2019s about solving real-world problems like traffic congestion, safety, and fiscal responsibility. Centralized control only adds complications while making life harder for everyday Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes in the city of Toronto is a gross overreach by the province. The bike lanes were installed after decades of planning and study and their presence is supported by considerable evidence. Removing them will have no effect whatsoever on traffic. Induced demand has been an established fact in urban planning for over 50 years, yet the government of Ontario likes to pretend it does not exist. There is no force on Earth that will result in the traffic in Toronto moving significantly faster, other than reducing the number of cars on the road. For example, by getting more people to ride bikes. If you want to move bike lanes to other streets, then specify exactly what streets you're talking about and how they'll work. (You can't, of course, because the purpose of this isn't to solve any problems, it's to create hatred and fix nothing.)\n"

Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling.

There will still be cyclists on the roads without bike lanes, their lives will just be at a greater risk of being struck by a vehicle.\nRemoval of lanes will result in some cyclists no longer feeling safe, thus relying on other modes of transportation (buses, streetcars and cars) which will further stress traffic.\nWe live in a major city, it is important for people to have other means of transportation. A city is going to be congested even without the existace of bikes. It's ridiculous to expect everyone in the city to own a car and further cause gridlock. We know this, city planning studies have proved that more cars and more lanes is not the solution to vehicle made congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the Ontario government's proposal to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in Toronto, and to require provincial approval for new bike lanes that eliminate existing lanes of motor vehicle traffic. This proposal appears to be a regressive policy that is not grounded in empirical evidence and overlooks the extensive benefits of cycling infrastructure documented in numerous studies.\n1. Negative Impact on Road Safety\nRemoving bike lanes can compromise the safety of all road users:\nCyclist Safety: Dedicated bike lanes significantly reduce the risk of accidents involving cyclists. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that streets with separated bike lanes saw a 90% reduction in cycling injuries compared to streets without such infrastructure (Teschke et al., 2012).\nOverall Traffic Safety: Bike lanes enhance safety for motorists and pedestrians by clearly delineating spaces for different types of road users, reducing conflicts and accidents (Reynolds et al., 2009).\n2. Contrary to Environmental Sustainability Goals\nEliminating bike lanes undermines efforts to promote environmentally friendly transportation:\nReduction in Emissions: Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transport. The European Cyclists' Federation reported that cycling emits ten times less CO\u2082 per passenger-kilometer than cars (Blondel et al., 2011).\nClimate Commitments: Canada's federal and provincial governments have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Encouraging cycling through infrastructure is essential to meet these targets (Government of Canada, 2020).\n3. Ineffective Solution for Traffic Congestion\nThe assumption that removing bike lanes will alleviate traffic congestion is not supported by research:\nTraffic Flow: Studies have shown that bike lanes can improve traffic flow by reducing conflicts between cyclists and motorists. The New York City Department of Transportation found that streets with bike lanes saw improvements in traffic speeds and reliability (NYC DOT, 2014).\nModal Shift: Providing safe cycling infrastructure encourages people to shift from driving to cycling, which can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate congestion (Pucher & Buehler, 2012).\n4. Adverse Effects on Public Health\nReducing cycling infrastructure can have negative public health implications:\nPhysical Activity: Cycling promotes physical fitness and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of active transportation in combating sedentary lifestyles (WHO, 2018).\nHealthcare Costs: Increased physical activity from cycling can lead to significant savings in healthcare costs due to reduced incidence of diseases associated with inactivity (Mueller et al., 2015).\n5. Economic Disadvantages\nBike lanes can have positive economic impacts that may be lost if they are removed:\nLocal Businesses: Cyclists tend to make frequent visits to local businesses. A Toronto study found that cyclists and pedestrians spent more money per month than drivers in local shopping areas (Sztabinski, 2009).\nCost-Effectiveness: Investing in cycling infrastructure is cost-effective compared to road expansions for cars, offering high returns on investment through health benefits and reduced congestion (Fishman et al., 2015).\n6. Lack of Evidence-Based Justification\nThe proposal does not appear to be supported by studies demonstrating that bike lanes negatively impact traffic congestion or economic vitality:\nInsufficient Research: There is a lack of empirical evidence indicating that the removal of bike lanes will improve traffic conditions. In fact, research often shows the opposite effect.\nBest Practices Ignored: Urban planning best practices worldwide advocate for the expansion of cycling infrastructure to create sustainable and livable cities (Gehl, 2010).\nConclusion\nThe proposed policy to remove existing bike lanes and impose stricter approval processes for new ones is regressive and not supported by current research. It disregards the multifaceted benefits of cycling infrastructure, including safety, environmental sustainability, public health, and economic vitality.\nRecommendations\nReconsider the Proposal: Align transportation policies with evidence-based research that supports the expansion of cycling infrastructure.\nEngage Stakeholders: Consult with municipalities, urban planners, public health experts, and community members to develop a holistic approach to transportation planning.\nPromote Sustainable Transportation: Invest in multi-modal transportation networks that encourage cycling, walking, and public transit alongside motor vehicle use.\nConduct Impact Assessments: Undertake comprehensive studies to evaluate the long-term impacts of removing bike lanes on traffic congestion, safety, environment, and economy.\nBy considering the substantial evidence supporting the benefits of bike lanes, I urge the government to reassess this proposal in favour of policies that promote safe, sustainable, and efficient transportation for all residents of Ontario.\nReferences\nBlondel, B., Mispelon, C., & Ferguson, J.
