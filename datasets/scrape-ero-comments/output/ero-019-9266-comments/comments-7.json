        "comment": "This Bill is a gross overreach from the Province. Transit, outside of the highway system, is a municipal issue. Not every municipality shares the same priority of highway building, and cycling as an accessible and viable alternative mode of transportation is proven to be effective in reducing congestion.\nStop the nonsense. There are plenty of provincial responsibilities (healthcare, education, to name a few) that need attention. Abdicating your own responsibilities to try and strongarm responsibilities that are not yours is a terrible look.\nNobody elected this provincial government on the basis that they would meddle with municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "I cycle every single day to work and back in Toronto. I cycle with my kids and spouse to get around the city, North-South and East-West. I do this through the year, including winter.\nWhen I ask colleagues if they would consider doing the same, many say they would like to but simply don't feel safe. And I understand this. Even with our current set of bike lanes, some protected and some not, I have an incident at least once a week where I'm almost hit by a turning or a car entering and stopping in the bike lane.\nRemoving bike lanes or rerouting them off direct routes will not help this -- it will make it worse, push more people away from biking as their primary form of transportation, or even what they may choose with their kids on the weekends. I appreciate that traffic congestion is an issue, but most of the problems I see are related to construction, not bike lanes.\nMoreover, this proposal just adds red tape to city planning. For a government laudably committed to removing red tape, this seems bizarre. The city is much better placed to address these issues than the province.\n"

Instead of two lanes of gridlock, you have three; instead of three lanes of gridlock, you have four; instead of four lanes of gridlock, you have - well, you can take it from there.\nSafe cycling infrastructure is vital in a world that's increasingly suffering the deleterious effects of car culture. We should be doing more to expand and support that infrastructure, not less. Do not take away from municipalities the ability to make their cities and streets better and safer for all by adding the \"red tape\" (which I vaguely recall was supposed to be reduced, not compounded) by burdensome and unnecessary. provincial regulation.\n"

I enjoy the choices I have in Toronto. Biking is a healthy and quick way for me to get to work.\nIf this province does this, I will be leaving Ontario for good.\n"

        "comment": "City Council has failed its taxpaying constituents. The implementation of the bike lanes have been made solely for ideological reasons. They have caused gridlock across the city. A small minority of loud, childish, selfish people who only care about bike lanes and \u201csaving the environment\u201d have taken over city hall. All reason has been thrown out the window.\nIf Toronto was built such that it was able to forgo a driving lane across most of the major arteries in the city, bike lanes would make sense. If Toronto wasn\u2019t covered in snow 6 months of the year, bike lanes would make sense. Unfortunately, this is not anywhere close to reality.\nIt is time for the adults to step in. Thank you, Premier Ford, and specifically MPP Hogarth, for listening to Torontonians.\nCity Hall is an absolute disaster and an embarrassment. We are not a serious city. We are nowhere close to being a world class city.\n"

        "comment": "I take the bus to work along an arterial road but I wish I could cycle. The problem is, I don't feel safe cycling on the road and there isn't a way to stay in bike lanes for my whole commute. Yes, there is a lot of traffic on my commute to work but the vast majority of cars that pass me while I wait for the bus only have one person in it. Imagine if those cars had two people instead. You'd cut traffic in half. The province should encourage car pooling, better uptake of transit and alternative forms of transportation to ease traffic congestion. Coordinated traffic lights would also help keep traffic flowing instead of creating gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of car lanes to be replaced with bicycle lanes would improve cities in our province and hopefully reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. It would allow for better circulation within the city, cleaner air (and thus a healthier population), fitter people, and a more efficient use of space. The demand for large parking lots would be reduced. I would go even further and suggest, eventually, designating entire streets as *bicycles only*. This would save the cost of building new bicycle lanes and provide quieter, clean-air passages throughout the city.\n"

It runs counter to every single progressive jurisdiction on the planet, setting Ontario back decades. I implore the government to take 2 minutes to research the concept of imposed demand to understand that keeping / adding lanes of vehicular traffic will not ease congestion. Stay out of municipally voted on decisions!! This is egregious overreach.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is an important part of transportation mix. Any effort to reduce, remove or relocate safe cycling infrastructure (i.e. bike lanes) is a mistake. That infrastructure was installed because individual voters and tax payers chose to elect municipal officials who championed those policies. The idea that another level of government can overrule local decisions AND use taxpayer money to remove bike lanes is foolish. No empirical evidence has been presented to the public that supports this decision. There is lots of evidence, including things like increased spending at local businesses, quicker emergency response and fewer cyclist and pedestrian injuries all result from more safe cycling infrastructure.\nThere is no question that removing cycling infrastructure will lead to more conflict on roads and more cyclist death. All of those will be the direct responsibility of the current porvincial government.\n"

Removing safe access to bike lanes will only increase congestion, driver frustrations (they don't want to share) and most importantly the safety of pedestrians and people on bicycles. This along with actually following the housing task force recommendations will GREATLY impact traffic down the line.\nThis government has been in office for years now and we have yet to see positive change in terms of infrastructure and housing.\n"

Cyclists deserve safety.\nCities should be able to make local infrastructure decisions.\nAdditionally, the city's major East-West corridor, the Gardener, is under construction. Therefore considering traffic on Lakeshore and Bloor should factor that as the major influence, NOT bike lanes.\nEvidence also shows that bike lanes boost business. If the Ford government is truly Open for Business they should support bike lanes.\nI do not agree with this legislation.\n"

The province should focus on delivering the LRT and GO projects that are underway, but over budget and behind schedule.\nBike lanes are live lanes of traffic that help keep people moving.
