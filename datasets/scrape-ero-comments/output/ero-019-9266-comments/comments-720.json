        "comment": "If passed, Bill 212 will cost millions of tax dollars and result in no appreciably reduction in gridlock.\nThis government is willingly ignoring the principle of induced demand as \"adding\" more lanes has been proven to increase car traffic accordingly.\nBike lanes enable an additional method of transportation for those who can't drive, those who choose not to drive, and those who both drive and bike. Our cities and towns need more methods of transportation as alternatives for driving and providing these alternatives is what actually reduces traffic.\nThis bill is not based in data or facts. Removing safe infrastructure will lead to more road deaths. Passing this bill is unconscionable.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important feature of urban transportation. When you consider that almost all vehicles, except public transit, are carrying one person, like a bicycle, but that today\u2019s vehicles take up the space of 4-6 bicycles while spewing toxic gases, it is a no-brainer to encourage commuters to travel by bike and this to create safe lanes for them. Most civilized cities have these and they work very well\n"

        "comment": "I am very upset as an Ontarian at the provincial government\u2019s overreach to take away municipal jurisdiction and governance. As a tax paying citizen and voter I vehemently object to Bill 212\u2019s grab for power and decision making especially when it comes to bike lanes. Cities themselves, municipalities themselves know their own cities well and have knowledgeable rural planners who have way more knowledge on where to put bike lanes for the safety of all their citizens. It should not be up to the provincial government who cannot possibly know how all the cities travel on a daily basis, and be the ones to decide how people move and travel. It is inefficient and irresponsible to give that governance to the provincial government for decision making.\nI feel that this bill is a power grab and goes against reasonable research and ignores evidence that is presented to counter the notion that bike lanes cause traffic congestion, and that this willful ignorance demonstrates irresponsible provincial governance.\nDo not think that we the people are not aware the proposal also strips landowner rights to fair negotiation when their land is expropriated to build highways.\nDo not think that we the people are not aware at the bias towards motorists over cyclists.\nDo not think that we are not aware that people\u2019s safety and well being is being overrun in favour of convenience. It is completely illogical to think that allowing more cars on the road will actually ease congestions.\nThis is a distraction for the Ford government to build highways and projects that put money into the Ford coffers. It is reckless governance to favour a Conservative Provincial party and their agenda and is not a bill that will help the citizens of Ontario. Shame on this willful ignorance and abuse of governance.\nNo to Bill 212\n"

As a taxpayer I don\u2019t want my taxes to be wasted destroying important infrastructure. I urge you to respect municipale democracy and not overreach as a provincial body. You do not know what the people of Toronto want, instead you are bullying citizens trying to put car against bike, endangering our lives.\nToronto is a diverse city with diverse needs that extend to transit and travel. Invest in transit, bike lanes, pedestrian infrastructure to get people out of their cars to help solve gridlock and make the city a more enjoyable place for everyone.\n"

Or is this just based off the feeling it will help traffic? Will cars be able to park on the street? Will police have enough man power to tow cars parked illegally during rush hour?\nIt\u2019s not just commuters using bike lanes. Couriers are a constant and I imagine they will continue through into the winter months. They are very dangerous drivers and having them in a lane might help keep them from getting in accidents.\nIt\u2019s depressing to see our city go back and forth about bike lanes forever. Feels like every other year we are either taking them down or putting more in. Wish we would stop wasting time and money.\n"

The city during rush hour looks like Amsterdam with all the bikers commuting!! The space that is taken up by one bicycle is so small in comparison to the space of one car, to move (often) the same amount of people it is so much more efficient on a bicycle (by measures of climate impact, time saving of traffic and physical space) keep the bike lanes!!!\n"

Since Toronto's bike lanes were installed, our streets have felt safer for both pedestrians and cyclists, the most vulnerable road users. The province's proposal is a significant overreach into city planning's jurisdiction and a huge step backwards for the safety, liveability and accessibility of Toronto. The province should be doing all it can to promote cycling, other active forms of transit and public transit over cars, which pollute our air and impact our health. Research has shown that bike lanes on major streets are beneficial to small businesses. Let's build more bike lanes, not remove them.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I strongly disagree with the changes to Bike Lanes proposed in Bill 212. As both a cyclist and a driver in the city, bike lanes are essential to increasing safety for all road users. Providing cyclists with a protected, dedicated lane on busy Toronto streets is the safest way for them to travel and keeps cyclists from interfering with the flow of traffic in vehicle lanes.\nIf the provincial government is serious about reducing gridlock and saving time, then we should not be spending taxpayers' money to increase congestion by undertaking needless construction projects on our busiest streets.\nFurthermore, I object to the Ontario government's effort to override decisions made by local municipalities. The issue of Bike Lanes should be addressed by municipalities with community consultation and not by broad provincial legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The argument that bike lanes significantly impede traffic overlooks the broader benefits they provide to cities. Research and examples from cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen suggest that bike lanes encourage more people to choose alternative, sustainable transportation, ultimately reducing the number of cars on the road and alleviating congestion over time. Removing bike lanes could push more individuals back into cars, potentially exacerbating the traffic challenges they aim to address. Traffic issues are often rooted in car-centric urban planning, and addressing these challenges requires a balanced approach that considers the needs of all commuters. Reassessing urban mobility strategies with an emphasis on sustainability and efficiency can lead to improved outcomes for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned about the secondary effects of restricting and removing cycle lanes in Toronto. As we face a future of economic challenges, as we have an aging population with the attendant challenges of health care delivery, removing bike lanes from Toronto streets sends a strong message, both practical and symbolic, in favour of a high consumption, sedentary lifestyle. We see and feel the results in this province: high debt and low savings, an already stretched healthcare system burdened by preventable cases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart attack and stroke, and more.\nBike lanes, by themselves, barely move the needle on all these problems, but they do move it in the right direction. It should surprise nobody that facilities and policies that make cycling for transportation easier and safer lead to an increase in cycling. Forcing a reversal of these measures risks causing a reduction in cycling. This is particularly true of the proposed legislation, which makes absolutely no provision for the safety of cyclists or indeed any other road users. Not only that, it will promote the primacy of the single passenger automobile in Toronto\u2019s transportation mix. This will have significant harmful effects on our city, our economy, and on our health and healthcare system.\nI understand the feelings of many people in this province who take their use of the personal automobile as a right. I have no desire to restrict their choice of transport, except where necessary to permit others to make healthier and more economical choices without sacrificing their personal safety. I can easily imaging a different version of this bill, one focused on the efficient design of bike lanes so as to avoid removing lanes for moving vehicles, or measures to promote the safe integration of human powered vehicles into the traffic mix through effective enforcement of traffic laws affecting safety. This bill does none of those things.\nPossible measures to reduce urban gridlock without compromising safety for vulnerable road users include:\n1) Amending the Highway Traffic Act to permit any individual to lay an information under the act on the basis of testimony or attested video,\n2) Specifically prohibiting of the use of motor vehicles to harass or threaten other road users,\n3)  Enhancing security for driving licenses so as to effectively enforce license suspensions and revocations,\n4) Upgrading standards for licensing and examinations,\n5) Providing for the graduated reduction in driving privileges for those convicted of Highway Traffic Act offences, in a mirror image of similar to the current graduated licensing process.\nMeasures to prevent bike lanes from adding to gridlock could include design standards that make the provision of moving vehicle lanes a priority over on-street parking, and restrict the practice of using vehicle parking as a barrier to protect bike lanes.\nAll these measures aim at promoting road safety while reducing gridlock, either by promoting more efficient design for bike lanes or by making sharing the road safer for vulnerable road users. I strongly urge the government to change this bill to include the effective promotion of road safety.\n"

What a mismanagement of taxpayer money. If the problem is gridlock, perhaps consider not shutting down all the streets for construction and not taking a million years to build a new subway line.\nNew bike lanes are actively being built across the city but you\u2019re considering removing perfectly good existing ones at the same time. Make it make sense. Do better.\nStop sitting in your office and get on the streets to look at how many people are relying on these bike lanes to get to and from work every day.\n"

These are cities that suffer from worse congestion than Toronto, yet understand the benefits to all road users or shifting journeys to bikes from cars and taxis.\n"

It is a regressive measure that does nothing to combat traffic in the city of Toronto and is a blatant overreach from the province to the municipal level. Is the PC party not ostensibly the party of small government and fiscal responsibility? Why then, would the government want to concern itself with the municipal-level issue of bike lanes?\nIt has been proven time and time again that adding more lanes to a road does not ease up traffic, it worsens it. Bikes take up less space than cars, and moving large volumes of people on them will free up the road for automobiles that need to use it.\nAs a cyclist without driver's license, biking is my main mode of transportation around Toronto. While I am fortunate enough to be able to partially commute on a street like Bloor with a separated bike lane, there are many others in a similar position without this privilege, endangering their lives whenever they share a lane with cars. Six cyclists have died in the city of Toronto this year, which is six too many. If this bill passes, many more cyclists will die in accidents. Their loved ones will mourn, and cars will still be stuck in traffic. The blood will be on the Government of Ontario's hands.\nIs this really what we want as a province?\n"
