So, each have an equal claim to a share of the roads.  To have a 1.5+/- metre wide strip dedicated for bike use and the balance of the road width for cars seems reasonable.\nBike riders are the most vunerable road users and deserve a protected space.\n"

Making public transit faster, more reliable, and affordable will enable Ontario citizens to be less reliant of driving.\nRemoving bike lane is a dumb idea, which will potentially lead to more accidents due to bikers being forced to ride along with cars.\nPlease stop wasting tax payer money and properly fund public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against the removal of bike lanes from the City of Toronto. There is no data to suggest that the removal of bike lanes will reduce congestion.  If the goal is to reduce congestion, there are more effective options such as a congestion toll and better transit. Urban planning of the City of Toronto is not the Province's business and the City should not be forced to cater primarily to the needs of people that do not live in the City (i.e. commuters).\n"

        "comment": "Setting aside the evidence that dedicated bicycle lanes in and of themselves reduce congestion, and that bicycle use year-round is increasing, particularly as the climate changes, I, as a resident of the City of Toronto, do not support this as proposed because:\n1. It does not identify which sections of the bike lanes would be removed\n2. The evaluation of the environmental impact is not only not complete but clearly has not even started\n3. The Act hasn't fully passed - it has not even reached the Committee stage, so any amendments that might impact these regulations have not even been introduced yet. I recognize with a majority government that it is unlikely any amendments from the opposition would be accepted, but the government may realize that there are revisions needed to the legislation, so it is silly to start consultation on regulations you may not be able to actually implement.\n4. There is nothing in the proposed regulation that guarantees that the lane removed for bicycles would necessarily have to be replaced with a lane for cars - for instance, if parking or restaurant patios end up being permitted in its place, it may not have the desired impact on reducing congestion\n5. The legislation does nothing to offset the increased risk of injury or death when a cyclist takes the lane, such as increasing the punishment for dooring or increasing penalties for drivers who hit cyclists, or increase penalties for people who block lanes on these thoroughfares (ie delivery drivers, the construction company that blocked a cycling lane with a dumpster, which resulted in a cyclist being killed when they tried to navigate around it)\nIf only there were giant trains running underground these roads that some of these people in motor vehicles could use instead of being in their cars, then we could really get these streets moving. Maybe the government should consider using the funding it will be providing to reorient these roads to ensure those trains run reliably?\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is unsafe and will absolutely lead to more cycling deaths in the city of Toronto. The answer is not fewer bike lanes but more incentives for people to take alternative modes of transport (cycling, walking, public transit). Adding back a lane of traffic to Bloor, Yonge, or University Ave will not solve the gridlock problem in the city. Traffic was bad before the lanes were installed and really isn't any worse since they were installed. This is only going to force cyclists onto vehicle lanes where they are going to be at risk of being hit and killed. Furthermore the only way to cycle safely in Toronto will be to ride down the middle of a vehicle lane preventing cars from passing the cyclist, which will only slow traffic further.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in because I am incredibly against bill 212. I believe that the province is severely overstepping their jurisdiction by enforcing their will about bike lanes on municipalities. The province does not have the right or the knowledge to assess where bike lanes should be installed. In addition, requiring the removal of bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University when multiple groups and organizations (including the assessment done by the province itself) state that removing these lanes will actually make traffic worse makes me think that this is a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money to actively make the lives of citizens of Ontario worse.\nAs a someone who regularly walks, bikes, transits, and drives around Toronto and its surrounding areas, I view bike lanes as an improvement in all the ways that I commute.\nWhen I'm driving, separated bike lanes allow me to drive faster since I don't have to be worried about giving them the space they need on the road that they are legally allowed to share with the cars. I don't have to slow down behind the bike, check the other lane so I can cut over slightly to pass. I don't have to worry about the bikers randomly cutting into the middle as I'm trying to pass. The removal of bike lanes will not stop people who don't own cars (like the uber eats delivery people) from biking, it will just make the roads more chaotic and dangerous, and make me no longer want to drive in busy downtown areas because of the added stressors of having bikers sharing the same set of pavement with cars.\nWhen I'm biking, separated bike lanes allow me to stay safe and be out of the way of cars. This lets both me and the cars that I would have been blocking if I was on the road with them move faster. When I'm biking in the separated bike lane, I'm not driving to the place that I was going to go to, meaning one less car in the way for other drivers.\nIf bike lanes are removed, it's not going to stop people from wanting to go to the places they go to, it's just going to cause those same people who would have biked to those places to drive there instead. Adding more cars to the road is only going to increase traffic, and make gridlock worse. Every person in a bike lane is one person who's not in a car causing traffic for everyone else who is driving.\nI strongly encourage the Government of Ontario to reconsider removing bike lanes, and adding unnecessary red tape to the bike lane process. Conservatives are supposed to value small government, and a bill like this goes completely against conservative ideology. If the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario allows such a bill to pass, or attempts to propose similar legislation that oversteps their jurisdiction, I will assume that the party has completely abandoned their values and will do everything in my power to ensure that the government is no longer in power in the next election. If Bill 212 is not pulled by the time I receive my 200 dollar cheque, that money and more will be going directly to an opposition party.\n"

        "comment": "The experts on this topic overwhelmingly have found in their studies that bike lanes reduce traffic on streets they are implemented simply by taking cars off the road. Every bike, which is 1/10th the size of a car on the bike lane is one less car off the road. Gridlock is not solved by \"adding one more lane\" this is evident on the 401, gridlock is solved by providing people with alternative and more efficient transportation means along the same corridor!\nAdditionally, bike lanes have been shown to drive business for local businesses which is critical during our current economic climate. Not to mention, biking is way more environmentally friendly than cars and will help us fight climate change.\n"

If you want to help the city of Toronto with gridlock, educate yourselves on what is actually effective. It has been proven that ADDING bike lanes reduces congestion, just look at any European city. What we really need is less cars on the road. I want to see tolls on all existing highways. Add tolls to the Gardiner and 401 and suddenly people will actually start using the underutilized 407. Or use the Go train. Every other big city in the world has effective networks of commuter trains and transit that citizens from all tax brackets use. Why do you keep encouraging people to drive???? STOP TRYING TO BUILD NEW HIGHWAYS. PUT MONEY TOWARDS TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE and MORE BIKE LANES. I can't believe that in this day and age this is still a debate. We are facing climate catastrophe and this is what you're doing? Frankly, I'm embarrassed to live in Ontario.\n"

And yet, even with the protected bike lanes it's sometimes dangerous! I would no continue to bike if the bike lanes were removed. It's simply too dangerous. I would likely drive to work instead because the TTC cannot be relied on.\nAlso, because parking is such a nightmare on danforth and bloor, even PRE BIKE LANES, I much prefer to travel by bike and shop via bike because driving takes far too long. It's much easier to pop into a shop when i'm on my bike than by car.\n"

        "comment": "This is another example of a complete waste of taxpayer dollars from our current government.\nBike lanes keep bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers safer - if one death or serious injury is prevented then they have paid for themselves as far as I am concerned.\nI was born in Scarborough, have lived in Downtown Toronto since 2013, and have owned a vehicle since 2014.  Without a doubt, areas with bike lanes, as a driver, offer more certainty as to how other vehicles and bicycles are going to move, resulting in a better flow of traffic and reduced likelihood of other vehicles attempting to overtake a vehicle from a lane that might be blocked from a parked or turning vehicle, or a bicyclist that is legally moving along in the right hand lane but at a slower speed than the flow of vehicle traffic.\nI will actively go out of my way when driving throughout the city to take a street that has bike lanes, ESPECIALLY along bloor.  Just this morning, it was faster for me, according to Google maps, to get to my appointment in Scarborough from Parkdale by taking Bloor rather than the Gardiner.  40 minutes, as opposed to the 50+ it would have taken on the Garinder.\nThe City of Toronto has spent millions (if not billions?) improving infrastructure for the city, to include more green options for individuals to take to reduce vehicle traffic - as any modern global city has done.  So why send us backwards and make the City a laughing stock around the world? This proposed legislation will only serve to increase the amount of gridlock in the city by increasing construction and encouraging more individuals to drive into the city from the extremities of the GTA, rather than taking services such as the GO Train.\nThe province should stay in its own lane, and let the City govern over matters that are directly impacting its constituents.  If the Premier wants to be the mayor of Toronto so badly, he should try running again.\n"
