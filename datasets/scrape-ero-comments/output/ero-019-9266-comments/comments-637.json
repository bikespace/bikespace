        "comment": "Please keep bike lanes! Congestion will not be relieved by adding an extra lane, but bicycler safety will definitely be adversely affected. Cycling is the future of transportation if we invest in it as more people can be moved through bike lane than by car. This is especially important as Toronto becomes more populous over time. The data shows that bike lanes actually help improve congestion by taking more cars off the road! Without a bike lane, bikes would be slowing down traffic because we will be forced to bike on the streets with other traffic.\n"

In addition removal of bike lanes decreases safety for bikers, and forces people to use cars only furthering the problem of congestion. Bike lanes if anything reduce congestion by reducing the amount of drivers on the road. In short this bill should never see the light of day again.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver in Toronto, I believe that bike lanes are extremely important in keeping us all safe. Cyclists will use these roads whether there are bike lanes or not, and having a protected space to keep them safe and away from cars is critical. I can plan ahead for a bit of traffic, but I can\u2019t cope with the stress of avoiding cyclists when there is no safe space for them to use, and I certainly could not live with myself if I were to hit a cyclist. Bike lanes keep us *all* safe. And those who commute via bicycle are doing us all a favor in the long run, reducing emissions and making Toronto\u2019s air easier to breathe.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 27 year-old Toronto resident. I have been cycling in Toronto, both recreationally and as a commuter, for most of my life. I was also a recreational and commuter cyclist in Ottawa for three years between 2019 and 2022.\nI am also a driver. I have driven throughout Ontario, including in Toronto, Ottawa, and in between, in everything from small sedans to moving vans. I have spent hours stuck in traffic on the streets of Toronto and 400 series highways. I know how stressful traffic is. I hate it just as much as you do (I assume \"you,\" whoever you are, are a driver, or at least in favour of this bill).\nThis should not matter, but I work as a lawyer. I say this to make clear that I pay a substantial amount in taxes to the provincial and federal government. I am \"The Taxpayer\" whose interests your government says they want to protect. Despite this, given the astronomical and still-rising price of rental housing, I am unable to regularly afford a car, or a parking space to put it. Even though I can drive, biking is really the only affordable, reliable way to get around to places that are not along a subway or streetcar line.\nBiking in Toronto is dangerous. Drivers are uniquely  aggressive towards cyclists here. Main arteries usually have high speed limits that I cannot reach by pedaling. Parked cars line the side of the road in many areas, meaning that I am forced to risk getting doored or hit by a car pulling out if I want to stay out of a traffic lane. If I try to stay off main arteries and use side streets, I quickly find hat those are usually poorly maintained, forcing me to go slowly and swerve all over the road to avoid potholes. This both endangers me and (understandably) aggravates drivers.\nThe bike lanes along major arteries have been a gamechanger. I use them regularly. Getting from north in the city, where I live, to the downtown core has never been easier. As those bike lanes have evolved from narrow painted-line lanes to broader, protected, and sometimes even grade-separated lanes, my experience using them has only improved. I have never felt safer biking in this city.\nThis bill would destroy that for no reason and a high price tag. I am concerned, and find it telling, that the government has not pointed to any evidence suggesting that bike lanes impede car traffic. Leaving aside the concept of induced demand (explained in a document linked below), basic logic and observation would say the opposite: if I am biking in a bike lane, I am not compelled take up a lane of car traffic while moving at half of the road's speed limit.\nThe government has also not stated the cost of ripping out the bike lanes. Given that many are now grade-separated, I think it is a fair assumption to say this would be extremely expensive. I don't think it mattes whether the city or the province foots the bill - either way, I, as the taxpayer, will be left on the hook.\nWhat's more - and this is key - bike lanes save lives. Cars in Toronto are massive and drivers are aggressive. I do not want to get crushed by an Escalade. I do not want to crash into a turning delivery truck. Similarly, cars do not want me slowly crawling up University Avenue in their lane because I have nowhere else to bike. They do not want to wait as I struggle to get up to speed after stopping at a red light at the bottom of a hill. I do not want to be in a car lane any more than car drivers want me in the car lanes. Stick me in my own lane, let me get out of the way of car traffic, and everyone is safer, faster, and happier.\nAs a driver as well, I empathize with other drivers over how bad traffic is. It is really bad. But traffic would not improve if all of the city's bikers suddenly returned to the car lanes from their separated bike lanes. Clearly, it would worsen. Traffic in this city was bad before bike lanes were installed on a handful of the roads. Returning an extra lane of traffic to cars would not fix that. Giving more people the option to not drive is the only solution, and that requires investment in transit, densified and walkable urban areas, and yes, bike lanes.\nIf you are looking for a cheaper way to get a lane of traffic back, get rid of street-side parking. Spots are never available anyway so the negative impact would be minimal. At least cyclists move. Parked cars just sit there taking up an entire lane.\nPlease do not spend my taxpayer money to rip out expensive, established infrastructure that saves lives and makes the city more accessible. This bill will endanger lives and make this city, and other major cities, worse to live in. It is taking my money to endanger my life, and the lives of those around me.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern:\nI am a lifelong resident of Ontario and I strongly oppose the substance and intent of Bill 212. I will be brief in my comments regarding the substance of the bill; others more eloquent than I have commented at length on that.\nThere is ample research on the health benefits of increased cycling, and the importance of protected bicycle lanes on saving lives. Two of the best studies include:\nDe Hartog et al. 2010 and Milner et al. 2024.\nOn the reverse side, a recent meta-study on the harms of automobility paints just how harmful encouraging more car use is for people in so many ways, per Wegman and Schepers, 2024. I have included links to all three studies with my submission.\nInstead I will focus my comments on the regulations:\nDo not make the application process for installing bike lanes too onerous. We do not want to waste taxpayer dollars at multiple levels of government where previously this was unnecessary. If the MTO fails to respond to a Municipality's request, or attempts any untimely delay, let the default be considered approval of the cycling infrastructure. Regardless of the policy goals of this Bill, it should not unduly add red tape.\nSecondly, let the municipalities use external (including international sources) when proposing infrastructure. For something simple like bicycle lanes there does not always need to be extensive new research. Use what's out there already.\nThird, the local transportation network including the road network and sidewalks, affect the local environment: decisions should be locally made. In the regulations, I would strongly recommend wording for deference to local experts, including municipal planners, local BIAs, neighbourhood associations, residents, business owners, and local elected officials.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

If you get rid of those bike lanes it will cause me such a headache not only from the construction caused by the removal, but also from the incredibly unsafe driving conditions it will create. The bike lanes are not the issue, they are necessary to separate the cyclist and the drivers. As a driver I would be outraged if you got rid of them. Talk to people in the community, talk to the restaurants who benefit from the delivery bikers. The provincial government has no business messing with something that should be decided exclusively by the city and people it affects.

I feel safer every time I ride on bike lanes. The plan to remove bike lanes is a huge step backwards, it increases pollution, accidents, arguments between cyclists and drivers of vehicles increase by not having a designated lane for each one. Please, do not go backwards as a culture, do not make me feel like I am going back to South America.\nI have managed to influence several friends to use bicycles responsibly, and their lives have improved, even economically (even more so in these difficult times).\nI believe in Canada and its development, but removing bike lanes is a step backwards as a country.\n"

        "comment": "I was devastated to hear that the government wants to take out the bike lanes on Bloor and University. These are lanes that I use every week to go to work meetings, dance class, run errands, visit friends, go to the hospital or my doctor. I am writing to beg you to please reconsider.\nI cycle because it's cheap, and fast, and healthy. My life is busy and I don't have time to go to the gym--this is how I stay active as I am getting older. I don't earn a lot of money and parking and transit are expensive and a big factor in my decision on any given day to take my bike or Bike Share (I have an annual pass, so each trip doesn't cost me more). Gridlock and subway closures and delay mean it's often the most reliable way for me to get around too, if I have an important meeting or interview.\nBike lanes make me feel not only feel safer, but keep me safer. When I cycle in a car lane, I feel constant fear that someone is going to clip me as they pass within inches of my body. I'm a grown adult but my parents still worry so much about me when I cycle. Unfortunately people do die every year in Toronto while going about their lives on a bicycle. And we know that road infrastructure like bike lanes make a big difference in how frequently people are injured or killed when cycling.\nI'm also a driver and I understand that people driving in this city are incredibly frustrated. Traffic is slow and unpredictable and exhausting.  And if I thought taking out the lanes would really improve the lives of people driving, I would support this proposal! I would understand that tradeoff and support it because I know there are more people driving than cycling.\nBut I have not seen evidence that taking out bike lanes will help congestion in a meaningful way. The data I've seen says it might save 90 seconds from peoples' commute. That is not worth it. Not when you consider that more and more people are taking up cycling every year and that shift will help congestion in the medium-long term. Not when you consider that we are going to need way more significant changes to improve congestion (like massive investments in public transit). And not when you consider the increased risk to loss of life and injury that people like me will face without these separated lanes.\nWhen I heard the news that the government wanted to take out the Bloor bike lanes, I was just about to head downtown. As I was riding in the lanes during rush hour, with hundreds of other cyclists (students, parents, food couriers, other random people), I felt so sad thinking about how their lives will be tangibly worse if this goes forward. More dangerous, stressful, expensive, and less joyful (because endorphins are real and cycling makes us happier). I really hope that you don't go through with this.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford does not have a valid argument or even supportive data to buttress his theory that  traffic congestion in Toronto is the result bike lanes, or the 3 specific bike lanes he wants to remove (those on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue). There are many reasons for traffic congestion in the city - the sheer number of people and cars, the endless construction (both to repair and build more infrastructure and to build condos), and an underfunded transit system that still hasn\u2019t recovered from low ridership during the COVID pandemic or the impact of a workforce that has embraced a remote/hybrid work life. If he truly wants to ease traffic  in Toronto (and improve air quality as a bonus) he could start by providing more funding to the TTC, encourage and reward people who car pool, let Toronto implement tolls to deal with congestion (congestion pricing) , and support those who can and do choose to bike, freeing up the road for those who truly need to drive. Making the streets safer for both pedestrians and cyclists would ease traffic congestion and has done so in other cities around the world. It took time for cities such as Paris and Amsterdam to get there but they got there.\nInduced demand works for both roads and bike lanes, If you increase car lanes you will get more cars, so if you increase bike lanes you will get more cyclists - and probably ease car traffic and gridlock. It takes time to see the effects but we will see them and have done so already.\nAs for the money the Ford government wants to waste to remove bike lanes, that\u2019s even more egregious - and downloading the cost on to all Ontario taxpayers is equally unfair.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nThe recently proposed legislation to an offense to common sense Ontarions, an exorbitant expense to settle old political scores, and will not solve the very real problem of congestion in Toronto. The Province needs to be spending this time and money on proven techniques.\n1) It is a massive governmental overreach:\nMunicipalities own and control the roads within their jurisdiction. This comes with both rights and responsibilities, the responsibility to maintain infrastructure along the road and the right to set road design in line with the needs of local residents. Often cycling networks are the outcomes of long-range planning, multi-year undertakings by cities accompanied by extensive public outreach. The idea that some MTO staff sitting in an office suddenly knows better is insulting\nConsolidating this at the Provincial Government is a) inefficient, why duplicate the staff needed to do this job and bloat the provincial civil service, b) non-sensical, why should staff who have likely never been to the street they are now legislating the design of understand the needs better than local staff who are and c) sets a dangerous precedent of the province subsuming local powers and pushing aside municipalities.\n2) It won\u2019t impact congestion at all:\nThe most congested streets are not streets with bike lanes, shockingly the most congested streets are the streets with the most cars in the City. Taking away a safe pathway for cycling will push more people back into cars, increasing the numbers on the road and the degradation of Toronto streets faster (since cars weigh more than bikes). Also, it\u2019s important to remember that new cars don\u2019t just increase delay on a 1-1 ratio each new car is a longer queue that takes longer to queue for a traffic light cycle, backing up interconnected streets.\nWhen bike lanes are separated, these commuters form their own queue, reducing the strain on the vehicular queue.\nThe math doesn\u2019t make sense. The standard design for a bike lane in Ontario is 1.5 m wide +whatever buffer is used, whereas a standard vehicle lane is 3-3.5m wide. Therefore removing bike lanes means trading bi-directional travel for a single new direction of vehicular travel.This policy does not regain the space people think it will.\nThe cyclists that are not pushed back into cars are now sharing the lane with cars, since Ontario law allows for cyclists taking the lane cars will now be forced to share the same space (see point b about lack of space saving of this policy) with slower moving vehicles.\n3) Bike lanes have been proven to be better for small businesses\nThe Bloor Annex BIA has come out in defense of the bike lanes, citing the positive impact it has had on local businesses. Studies on the Bloor bike lane found the installation was correlated with higher total consumer spend.\nIt is counter to existing provincial policy around housing development,  which now sees Toronto developers building more bike parking than car parking.\nBuilding car free developments is substantially cheaper, more space efficient and is the only way Ontario will ever meet its housing goals. Residents of these housing developments deserve to get to work safely.\n4) It is extremely expensive\nThe City of Toronto estimated the cost to be $48 million dollars. For this cost there are a number of policy interventions which would have a greater impact on congestion relief. The number one suggested tactic for improving urban travel times is signal timing. For this cost the Province could install 196 new traffic signals with the latest technology to improve signal timing around the City. It could work with the existing infrastructure and instead pay for engineers to retime over 9600 signals (based on average North America costs). It could pay for more inspectors to enforce Traffic Managment Plans around construction sites to ensure minimal traffic disruptions. It could expand access to transit, expand park and ride options, literally anything else beyond removing the lanes which cause MORE congestion\nDoing construction on roads causes lane closures and congestion. It is a fact of life, especially city life. But doing unnecessary construction to rip out recently constructed infrastructure causing extra congestion in a city already filled with construction is offensive to Ontarions.\n5) Bike lanes don\u2019t emergency response.\nWhen it comes to our roads, some trips are more important in terms of travel time than others, and the most important stakeholders, Emergency service providers, have confirmed that the expansion of bike lanes in Toronto have not impacted response times. In fact, downtown Wards of the city, home to higher number of bike lanes, have better emergency response times than the inner-suburbs. Plus, bike lanes, like those on Bloor, are often designed to allow for emergency vehicles to mount the protection devices providing more space for emergency vehicles to get by. You know what is harder to move around than a flex post, a two-ton, 12 ft long car (average car size).\nPlease consider spending time and money on proven techniques to battle congestion and not waste tax payers dollars fighting a political battle over a couple blocks in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to Bill 212, as it would add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy hindering local governments from advancing important transportation initiatives. Instead of creating more barriers, we should be focusing on improving infrastructure that supports sustainable and safe transportation for all road users.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, they are an essential part of transportation infrastructure. It's crucial that we prioritize the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and give them reliable, protected spaces to travel. The safety concerns of cyclists and pedestrians are very real. As a driver in Scarborough, I am often concerned about the lack of bike infrastructure. It's frightening to share the road with cyclists who have no dedicated lane, and it makes me nervous every time I have to pass them. I would feel much safer knowing that cyclists are separated from motor vehicles, with proper safety measures in place to protect them.\nBike lanes also support public transit by making it easier for people to reach transit stations. They\u2019re not the cause of traffic congestion\u2014cars are. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need to encourage alternatives to driving, and investing in bike lanes is one of the most effective ways to do that. With more bike lanes, people would have a safe, reliable mode of transport, and more would opt for biking instead of driving, especially for short trips like going to work, school, or running errands.\nThe reality is that many people drive simply because it\u2019s the fastest and most reliable option available. If we had a network of well-designed, protected bike lanes across the city, people would be more inclined to choose biking over driving for daily activities. We need to make these investments now, not delay them with more red tape.\nI urge lawmakers to reconsider this bill and prioritize the creation of safe, efficient bike infrastructure that benefits everyone in our communities.\n"

        "comment": "Good Evening,\nAs a Torontonian who lives in the Etobicoke-Lakeshore area who both drives a car and also has had to bike, take the TTC, take a GO train, and walk to get to my destination, I find the proposal to remove bike lanes to be a baffling decision. While certain sections of these bike paths see only a few hundred riders on average in a given day, some sections of the routes that are proposed to be removed have traffic of over 5000 riders daily. Having to take side streets and alternative routes may work for some of these people, however many of the cyclists who use these lanes will have no viable alternative and thus will be forced to ride on the sidewalk, putting pedestrians at risk, or ride on the road with the rest of traffic, putting themselves at greater risk. This also means that many people who now have a greater opportunity to take an alternative form of transportation around the various cities in the province will be forced back into cars as their main source of transportation. Removing upwards of 5000 cars on the road will have a bigger impact on traffic issues than having an extra lane of traffic, as we see around the world with induced demand.\nOften one of the key arguments for removing bike lanes is that they are always empty and not being used. If we look only at constant traffic we could use the same argument for other methods of transportation or services. Many parts of the network of bike paths are not fully connected yet, and it would be like saying we should remove Highway 401 because it is not being fully utilized across the entire province. If we continue to improve the network it will allow more people to use the network which will continue to reduce car traffic on the roads. For example, as I live near The Queensway, and while there are streets like Royal York and Lakeshore that can be utilized as part of the bike network, cycling downtown for work would take me well out of my way and add a lot of extra time compared to if I had a direct route down The Queensway that would lead to existing networks on Queen street or King, it would make my trip comparable to the amount of time it would take to travel via GO, or even driving when there is traffic. This would also allow me to experience the shops and locations along my route to and from work, with it being a lot easier to stop and park my bike than it would be if I were in my car, which is good for local businesses and neighborhoods instead of people using roads as nothing more than thoroughfares.\nWe talk about government overreach in Canadian politics often, yet how can we on one hand be unhappy when the Federal Government wishes to step around the Province's wishes, but be okay with the Province deciding what should be done at the Municipal level? Removing the bike lanes not only will cause more traffic in the short term as all the previous infrastructure has to be ripped up and redone to re-create a new lane for cars, but it will be a financial burden on cities in a time when citizens are already having a tough time and our tax dollars are not going as far as we need in more important aspects. We would also be removing accessible transportation options for those who cannot or do not want to drive, such as teenagers, and making our cities only in favour of those who decide to be in a car.\nThank you,\nTy\n"
