        "comment": "Please look into the research on this first. Increasing road capacity for cars INCREASES traffic. It seems counterintuitive, so please listen to experts on this, like from this paper:\nhttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3q21f88p\nRemoving bike lanes is only a very temporary short-term gain. After a while, traffic is back to being as bad as it was before, but now there are MORE cars on the road.\nIn addition, removing bike lanes endangers bikers. They need safe places to bike.\nFurthermore, with the recent increase in food delivery services (many of which rely on workers on bikes), reducing bike lanes harms the economy.\nIf you truly want to reduce traffic, (1) keep the bike lanes, and (2) boost public transportation. By giving people better access to alternatives to cars, alternatives that can carry a greater density of people, those who have the option will shift away from cars, freeing up space for those who can only commute by car.\nI don't even own a bike, but I am a scientist who understands research. Please listen to the experts on this.\n"

How is possible in 2024, to decide of removing existing bike lanes ?\nYou need to take example of Montreal, who is the perfect example of good cohabitation between cars and bikes cause many bike lanes.\nIf many bike lanes, less people on cars\nIf many bike lanes, more safe streets for vulnerable people as cyclists and pedestrians.\nIf many bike lanes, less cyclists dead on the street cause already 6 cyclists was killed since the beginning of the year in Toronto.\nIt's a shame to announce a project like that and I hope this project will never happen.\nIf this project is realized, you will not be a model example of a safe and sustainable transport city in the world.\nRemoving existing bike lanes is a shame! I want safe streets, I want less cars, less pollution, I want children on a cargo bike on bike lanes, I want happy students, families, elderly people safely on cycle paths not on the road with many SUV dangerous cars.\nPlease Toronto, become a model for other Canadian cities and Europe and please stop this project!\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on Bloor St and University would not save time or prevent traffic. What it would do is risk the lives of the hu deeds of bikers who use these bike lanes every day. Since the lanes were out I , biking in Toronto has become safer, more bike friendly and easier to access for this not driving. Especially for younger kids learning to navigate the streets of Toronto on their bikes (my 13 year old is one of those kids). The construction and amount of cars on the road are causing the traffic and bake ups in the city. The bike lanes promote going car free in a city that desperately needs more options for transportation. Why the province feels it can make these decisions is mind blowing. People who actually live and work in the city should have a say. The Mayor and city councillors should have a day. Removing bike lanes in Toronto will not save time, it will cause deaths.\n"

        "comment": "Comments regarding Bill 212 \u2013 the so-called \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\u201d\nThis bill deserves to be killed as soon as possible.  It represents an outdated transportation policy, is a massive unwarranted intrusion by the province into municipal affairs, and, most important, would not solve the problem it claims to address.\nAdditionally, the part of the legislation that allows for the ripping up of existing bike lanes along Yonge Street, Bloor Street and University Avenue runs contrary to other sections of the very same act.  The proposed bill says that the regulatory framework for its review of bike lanes is still \u201cbeing developed\u201d and will include analysis of \u201cdata, studies and other information.\u201d  The legislation, however, would require the ripping up of existing bike lanes without any such data, studies, or further information.  That doesn\u2019t make sense.\nEven if the legislation is amended or altered to exclude the ripping up of existing bike lanes, this represents an extreme intrusion into municipal affairs.  I am a Toronto resident and taxpayer.  The city council that represents me developed a transportation strategy that includes bicycles as an integral part.  It is outrageous that the Ontario government has, in effect, vetoed the actions of my local government, and now wishes to step in and impose its own outdated views on urban transportation.\nRestricting, removing, or discouraging bike lanes is bad policy.  It is well-known that the current Premier of Ontario does not like bicycles, nor does he understand the increasing use of bicycles for urban transportation in practically every major urban centre around the world.  These cities have sophisticated planning departments, and have done extensive analysis on transportation systems.  They have all concluded that bike lanes are a valuable addition to transportation infrastructure.  And that sometimes, they are a valuable replacement \u2013 for a lane of traffic, for instance.  This Ontario legislation pretends that all of those other jurisdictions are wrong.  I don\u2019t buy it.\nFinally, the focus on bike lanes as the cause of Toronto traffic congestion is just wrong.  In addition to being a cyclist, I am a motorist, and often need to drive across the downtown core.  I have noted that over the last year, practically every major east-west route through downtown Toronto has been either closed or severely restricted due to construction \u2013 building construction that intrudes into roads, or roads dug up for infrastructure repair.  There\u2019s the real cause of congestion, and this legislation does nothing to address it.\n"

        "comment": "Provincial approval of bike lanes is a serious overreach of provincial decision making. Municipalities should be able to plan their own road infrastructure for biking. It will be impossible for them to get anything accomplished if all planning needs to be approved by the province - this is the opposite of efficiency. Removing existing bike lanes would also be a big waste of public funds.\nThis is not an evidence based proposal, as there's no evidence that bike lanes increase traffic congestion in cities. Biking is an important mode of transit in densely populated areas; it's also cost effective. Bike lanes keep people who choose biking safe. The specific streets targeted by this proposal have many transit options, meaning that driving does not need to be the prioritized form of transportation on those streets. This part of the bill should be removed entirely, and the government should focus on provincial issues.\n"

More car lanes do not improve traffic, nor the local economy, nor reduce travel times. It is a failed policy. Your anti-bike bias is foolish. Instead, provide more bike lanes, promote more use of transit. Both of those reduce congestion for the cars that remain. Stop pushing through failed policies driven (pun intended) by your anti-bike bias. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly in opposition to this act allowing the removal of existing bike lanes on Bloor st., Yonge st., and University Avenue, as will as its goal of limiting the addition of future bike lanes in Toronto. Biking through the city is an efficient, and if via bike lanes, safe method of travel. Since the addition of the current infrastructure I have noticed a huge increase in bike traffic through my neighborhood near Spadina and bloor. This allows people without cars a rapid means of transportation through the city. If bike lanes are removed riding bikes along these streets will become much more dangerous, but it will not reduce bike traffic. Sharing a lane with cars is not safe. This act will lead to an increase in accidents; life altering experiences for all involved.\nHowever, I am also against this act for an additional reason. I am a frequent cyclist and rely on the network of bike lanes to travel across the city to commute to work. If bike lanes are removed I will be putting my life in danger everyday to make a living.\nHow can the leaders of our province think that what the people of Toronto want is for our tax dollars to be spent ripping up and reconstructing a road that has just barely been completed which will result in years of construction further aggravating the issue of slow travel times for drivers in the city.\n"

Researchers who have studied the addition of bike lanes in other urban areas have shown that it does not worsen traffic congestion over time but instead relieves it as it encourages more bikers. Toronto does not need oversight by the province here. Instead, why not come up with an overall transportation strategy that includes cars, public transit, bikes and walkers?\n"

        "comment": "I work as a bike courier in Downtown Toronto. I have for 3 years. I started working this job after the bloor street bike lanes were built. I could not imagine the city without them. Often, I will switch over to bloor to go long distances as it is a safer, much lower stress ride. I am riding around the downtown core for 8, 10, 12 hours a day, so I use these lanes more than most. Removing these bike lanes would have a huge impact on my safety and thousands of other couriers. It also makes bike delivery as a whole easier, and a more viable option. Removing cycling infrastructure WILL cause some deliveries to shift to cars, actually increasing traffic. I think this policy needs to be abandoned.\n"

        "comment": "Please keep the bike lanes and make more!\n1. less cyclists in the car lane will ease congestion, give them their own lane to make sure they don't slow down car traffic. It is only good for cars to have dedicated bike lanes.\n2. please connect the city's bike paths. Imagine car lanes not being connected, that will make you less likely to consider driving wouldn't it? Bad, unsafe, non-connected bike lanes force people into car lanes increasing problems for drivers.\n3. more people cycling will reduce your costs for road repairs. Cars destroy the pavement over time, bikes don't.\n4. get fresh accurate data on the number of cycling. Your numbers are so outdated.\n5. cycling is good for downtown business. Making the area accessible brings more people there. Reducing the options to car/buss reduces the number of people willing to go there. There is real data to back up this claim, just look up a city Bamberg and how it's downtown died after they made roads focused on cars.\n6. replacing the transportation by bike with transportation by car increases the cost tremendously for citizens of middle and low income.\n7. replacing the transportation by bike with transportation by bus increases time it takes to get to the destination by 30-60min.\n8. personally I bike and take a buss, rarely drive. Removing bike lanes will force me to move out of this city because buses take too long and don't go everywhere. I can't buy a second car for my family. One car per family isn't enough for everyone to get where they need to go.\n"

        "comment": "It is evident that this bill is being pushed through on the basis cruelty. Cyclists are being sacrificed, politically and physically, in order to appeal to drivers. Facts show that removing bike lanes, especially along the busiest bike corridors in Toronto, will objectively make traffic worse by (1) enticing some cyclists to switch to driving, putting more cars on the road, and (2) cause cyclists like myself to occupy the entire live lane of traffic at the 10-30 km/hour speed to the detriment of the drivers behind.\nBill 212 will pit drivers against cyclists and cause an uptick in violence and death. For example, a majority of Toronto hospital workers live nearby and use the University Avenue bike lane to get to work - they could be killed at any point by a distracted driver or an enraged driver.\nBusiness Improvement Areas on Bloor, Yonge, and University all say that the instillation of bike lanes resulted in an uptick in revenue for businesses. Toronto Fire says that emergency times have not increased (in fact, cycle tracks can be used by emergency vehicles to bypass traffic as cyclists can more easily clear the way for them). The City of Toronto has also reported that the removal of bike lanes will only result in a marginal increase in traffic speeds.\nBike lanes objectively improve traffic by removing cars from the road - it is simple geometry. If reducing congestion was actually a priority, the TTC and GO could be greatly funded to remove slow zones, improve frequency, and fast track expansion.\nI invite the premier across the street to the University of Toronto to actually talk to experts and explore the great amount of research that exists on bike lanes, their benefits, and how to actually \"reduce gridlock and save you time\".\n"

        "comment": "Please do not approve this bill due to part 7 of schedule 4. The government does not need to add more red tape and bureaucracy when there is so much to begin with. These bicycle lanes help commuters that only travel small to medium distances, and remove the need to ride a car in order to get around anywhere. They are as essential to the city infrastructure as the roads themselves. Removing them would cause bicycle users to ride on the road themselves, putting them in harms way, and also causing stressful situations for drivers. We need to improve our transportation infrastructure on all fronts, whether that's car infrastructure, buses, subways, trains, or bicycles. Removing them will not only be costly, but also be damaging.\n"
