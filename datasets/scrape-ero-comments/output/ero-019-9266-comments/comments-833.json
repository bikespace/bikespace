They will also destroy and bisect precious and important natural habitats, recreation areas and agricultural land.  Full environmental assessments are necessary.\nWe must instead focus on transit and active transport community building, where the billions of taxpayer dollars proposed for these highways would benefit all of Ontario much more.\nPlease cancel these proposals and most others in Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, including the ill-considered restrictions and removals of bike lanes, which I find a gross overreach into municipal governance.\n"

        "comment": "Rename this the \"Ontario Needs More Dead Cyclists and Traffic Causing Accidents Act\"\nOntarians aren't stupid. Bike lanes aren't an issue. Stay in your (provincial) lane.\nIllegally stopped cars, construction, poorly timed traffic lights and badly designed intersections are contributing more to traffic than bike lanes (which keep people out of traffic, freeing up roads for those who don't bike). Stop playing political games and wasting money. If you trust Ontarians and want to support our communities,  put these funds towards municipal infrastructure and public transit spending.\nBike lanes ensure the safety of our community as people commute in a healthy and environmentally friendly way. Removing bike lanes won't remove cyclists, it will make the roads more dangerous, increasing the incidence of accidents and harming the health and safety of Ontario.\nAdditionally, I don't feel this would be an effective measure at stopping traffic. there anyways often disrupted with construction or have cars parked or stopped illegally. Currently at least these cars are stopping in bike lanes, which is not ideal,  but it at least not obstructing traffic as much.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, I request the Ontario government work on better maintaining the flow of traffic in the existing lanes first.\nFinally, this is out of the jurisdiction of the provincial government. The provincial government should not be telling cities what works best for their downtown core. If the province would like to be involved in transit and infrastructure, please provide funding so we can have safe, separated bike lanes and measures put in place to keep traffic flowing.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed framework is a backwards approach to transportation. We need diverse modes of transportation if we\u2019re going to address our greenhouse gas emissions. Many people don\u2019t feel safe without bike lanes (for good reason), so preventing new lanes will stop those people from cycling. Other people will continue to cycle, and they will slow down traffic in the left most lane in the absence of a bike lane! I feel much safer on roads with bike lanes both as a cyclist and a driver.\nIn addition to the environmental aspect, cycling is a good way for people to be more physically active and connected to their communities. When I commute by car it\u2019s an isolating experience and I have very little interactions - I leave my house and stay in my car until I\u2019m at work. I don\u2019t see much of interest because I need to focus on driving. When I commute by bike, I see my community in greater depth and often interact with people along the way. I also arrive at work feeling energized and happy. More people should have the opportunity to experience this, but most will not if they don\u2019t feel safe on the road.\nRemoving the existing Toronto bike lanes is a massive waste of our money. The construction would also have a big impact on traffic, which is counterproductive.\nOn top of all this, the decision to install bike lanes (or not) is a municipal matter. The provincial government overriding municipalities decisions is totally inappropriate. The municipality knows its local transportation needs far better than the province. It\u2019s unprofessional behaviour from our Premier to be interfering. If he would like to work in municipal politics he is welcome to run for office. It\u2019s embarrassing.\n"

When 60% of workers at sick kids use bike lanes to get to work imagine how much worse traffic will be if all of those employees drive to work. It's bad for all of the condos built and underconstruction with little to no parking. With no bike lanes those residents won't have access to the reliable and safe transportation they expected when they moved in or purchased their home. It's bad for the businesses along bloor who rely on customers who arrive by bike. This bill adds government red tape and makes transportation around toronto more dangerous without improving travel times\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident if the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are public infrastructure that get people in the city moving. Having them on major roads makes our commercial strips vibrant, accessible to all commuters, and safer for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike. As someone who primarily walks or drives in the city, what gives drivers the rights to dominate main streets meant for all?\nI would drive less if the TTC were more frequent and reliable. If you want to get people moving in the city, get them out of cars and onto public transit. Seeing the space that ten cars take up on Bloor, Yonge, or Avenue is humbling when you compare it to how many more people could fit into a bus or subway.\nToronto deserves to be a city built for the future, I don't want us to be stuck in the past. We have to innovate on how we move people around and not be stuck in the past trying things that we've done before that don't work. Let's build a vibrant thriving city that can be a leader and inspiration to cities globally on how we get ourselves moving.\n"

It\u2019s a waste of time and taxpayer money to review and remove existing bike lanes, and a further waste of time and money to require provincial approval to make new bike lanes. Prioritizing car lanes only induces more car traffic while infrastructure for alternative forms of transportation (bikes/public transit) remain deprioritized and underfunded.\nThe time and funding to remove bike lanes and build a new highway would be better spent connecting protected bike networks and building reliable high-speed, high-frequency rail. The only way to reduce traffic and emissions is to reduce the need for car trips. The only way to reduce the need for car trips is to provide reliable and safe alternatives.\nWe must prioritize bike and public transit for our health, environment, and sanity.\n"

This year, an extremely warm fall and a summer of flooding served as stark reminders of climate change. These conditions will continue to worsen, with transportation being a major contributing factor in increased carbon dioxide emissions. We need less cars on the road, and more alternative methods of transportation. Cycling is one of the most eco friendly methods of transportation available. We should do everything in our capability to increase cycling infrastructure. The rewards are three-fold; zero carbon transportation, encouraging a healthy lifestyle for the citizens, and reducing traffic by offering a safe method of alternative transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to the proposal being advanced by the government.\nI am a Toronto resident, and have been since 2011. I was a student in the city from 2011 until 2018, in both my undergraduate and in law school. I practice as a lawyer.\nDespite owning a car, I regularly cycle in the city for both health and the convenience it offers. It allows me ready and flexible access to various points in the city, whether for work (which I sometimes commute to by bike), attending doctor's appointments, errands, or family and social engagements.\nI can personally attest to the real sense of safety bike lanes offer me, particularly the separated bike lanes of the type provided by the Bloor St. and University Ave bike lanes. When I bike on the road, either through a \"chevron\" shared route or otherwise, I regularly have a sense of potential danger from vehicles that do not adequately respect my legitimate space on the road. I have almost been hit by cars in \"near misses\" on several occasions. I have personally witnessed others nearly be struck by vehicles. I regularly see \"ghost bike\" monuments to deceased cyclists in our city. Bike lanes of any variety add a much needed sense of safety to this essential form of transit.\nIf bike lane construction is halted, I sincerely fear that the Province will be committing to a model of urban transportation that simply accepts that cyclists will be forced to share the road with cars. This will result in deaths and injuries that could have been avoided. It may also stem the increased uptake of this low cost form of transportation, which will itself likely increase congestion and the environmental impacts of driving.\nIn addition to the above, the proposal to tear up the nearly finished Bloor St. and University Ave. bike lanes is simply incomprehensible to me. Significant resources have been invested in adding this vital infrastructure. In the past, I have genuinely thought this government was committed to transit investment with its large infrastructure projects in roads and rail. However, the move to now \"tear up\" functional infrastructure for what may be purely political purposes is very disappointing, given the safety and environmental benefits of those costs.\nFinally (and in a real sense, most importantly), there is something truly wrong about this proposals plan to fetter the ability of local governments, representing local communities, to determine for themselves what form of local infrastructure their communities need. Why is it that the Provincial Government believes the people of Toronto, Kingston, Windsor, London, or otherwise are incapable of deciding, through their elected municipal representatives, whether bike lanes work for them or not? The lack of faith this government has in the ability of such communities to make such decisions is very disheartening, and I believe out of line with the important democratic values that I worry this government may not value as fully. This is not the first time such a proposal interfering with such local democracy has been put forward by this government. I point specifically to the previous changes limiting the number of representatives in Toronto city council, and the prohibition of ranked choice voting for municipal elections.\nIf this proposal goes through, despite the many clear reasons it should not, it seems very unlikely to me as a member of the impacted community that I will be able to support this government in the next provincial election (despite real gains that the government has made elsewhere). I do sorely hope that they take notice of voices such as mine and not spurn them.\n"

It just makes sense; Removing bike lanes and building highways is a short term band-aid solution, and doesn't solve what creates traffic in the first place. In 5-10 years, those streets will become congested again.\nNot to mention that this all creates extra infrastructure costs that will come due later on down the line; These are Infrastructure costs that future administrations may not be able to handle. We're making the assumption that we can pay for the maintenance 50-60 years down the line. This bill is just passing the buck down.\nVehicles will always be important in cities, but they really shouldn't be the best option for travel in metropolitan areas unless you're an emergency vehicle, a business, or are making specialized trips where you actually need one. I think that the current administration has done a lot to strengthen local/intercity transit, and I'd love to see that continue, but I feel that this bill isn't the right direction and may become bit of costly government overreach over something that municipalities can already do themselves.\nRemember, every person who feels that driving is their best option, is another person on the road in front of you.\n"

        "comment": "/As a Toronto resident who travels by car, bike, and transit, this proposal makes me worried for all road users in the city and for taxpayers. I don't want my tax money wasted on removing bike lanes that were recently installed with no plan to provide alternate safe and separated bike routes off these key routes. We need complete streets that facilitate safe travel through the city for everyone, not just for those who choose to commute by car. Second, I'm appalled by the lack of transparency involved here. The government has not cited any data to confirm its perception that traffic is supposedly worsened or caused by these bike lanes. The proposal itself fails to specify the lanes on which certain segments will be removed - that detail is only available in news reports, so it remains unknown how this legislation would be applied. It is also deeply concerning how this same proposal change dover the past month to move from requiring review of new proposals with the option for the government to reconsider already installed lanes, and then, to specifically naming three streets in Toronto where lanes will be set for removal (without naming those segments). This is a gross waste of time and money and the provincial government should respect its citizens enough to make decisions based on evidence rather than superficial perceptions. These changes to our streets which have the potential to result in injuries and deaths on our streets due to a lack of sufficient infrastructure. Is that worth a few votes?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing regarding Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. Despite the name of the bill, the bill would accomplish the complete opposite: It will end up increasing the congestion of cars on the road, and will end up costing Ontarians time stuck in traffic.\nSchedule 2 of the Bill would allow the government to \"[prohibit] registered owners from applying under the Expropriations Act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land that was expropriated by the Minister for the purposes of a priority highway project\". This would allow the government from force expropriate land from their rightful owners at a time of the government's choosing, without the right to appeal the time of expropriation. This would be a gross overreach of the government's powers to push through a project of their choosing, without a method of appeal.\nSchedule 3 of the Bill would allow the government to bypass the Environmental Assessments process *specifically* for Highway 413. Again, this is a shortsighted decision, and an overreach of government powers. Not only is the Environmental Assessment process serve an important purpose - to make sure any projects we build does not negatively impact the environment we live in, but the fact that this Bill *specifically* gives this exemption to Highway 413 and not any transit project shows that this government's priority is more highways. Adding additional highways have shown to not decrease congestion in the long run, and may increase it once induced demand causes more people to drive and clog up the roads. The government should focus on advancing public transit projects that have shown to take demand off of the road, and make transit faster for both riders and drivers.\nIn addition, the bike lane provisions of the Bill is perhaps the most overreaching part of the entire Bill. This would allow the government to override the decision of municipality governments, which are elected by its resident citizens, and impose their agenda against the people's will. As a Torontonian who does not ride a bike, the bike lanes in the city have been a great addition as both a pedestrian *and* a motorist. Giving bikes their own lane makes the sidewalks safer for pedestrians as they no longer need to fight for sidewalk space with bikes. In addition, this also makes motorists safer as it makes bikes more prominent and harder to hit with the separation. By using this act to remove the bike lanes, this will make everyone less safe. It will also increase gridlock as some bicyclists would drive instead, increasing the load on the roads\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 is shortsighted, overreaching, and extends the power of the provincial government to an unacceptable level. I would not vote for this government if this Bill passes. If the government has a shred of integrity and wants the trust and votes of Ontarians, it would do the right thing and withdraw the Bill from consideration.\n"
