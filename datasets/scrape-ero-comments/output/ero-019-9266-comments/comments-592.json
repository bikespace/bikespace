        "comment": "Bike lanes do not increase congestion. Please see global studies for evidence. The Annex BIA supports bike lanes as a way to increase the local economy. Biking is sustainable, healthy and a safe alternative mode of transportation when separated bike lanes are present.\nAs a bicyclist, I use all sorts of bike lanes. There are no better alternatives to Bloor, Yonge etc to travel long distances in the city of Toronto. I commute on these lanes for almost 9 months of the year. I would not do this if not for the bike lanes.\nBill 212 must be stopped.\nI support safe and healthy transit for everyone. There simply isn't enough space for parking, let alone for everyone to drive cars in our growing city. We are growing up as a province, and need bike lanes to make this happen.\n"

        "comment": "The primary way to reduce traffic in the city is to have fewer cars on the road. If removing bike lanes did reduce traffic, it would only encourage more people to drive, since there is no traffic. This will ultimately lead to more traffic, and there will be no more lanes to remove. This bill will not reduce traffic, but it will discourage people from biking to get around the city, which leads to more cars on the roads.\nSafe bike lanes will make more people bike. That is a fact. People biking means they are not driving. This means less traffic. If I could not bike around the city safely, I would consider buying a car.\nBiking as a means of transport through the city allows you to stop at multiple businesses on your ride home. This is not possible on the subway or in a car (downtown where easy, fast parking is scarce). This kind of behaviour should absolutely be encouraged. Any business should hope that they have a well-used bike lane right outside their door.\nAnyone who says that bike lanes should only be on side streets has clearly never ridden a bike to get from point A to point B. There is so rarely a route within Toronto that involves avoiding all major streets, and if there is, it's substantially longer. Maybe drivers forget that cyclists are actually physically exert themselves to move around the city. Suggesting that a 20 minute bike across Bloor should now become a 50 minute bike getting lost in side streets is demeaning and ridiculous. Cyclists and drivers can coexist on a main road seamlessly. When cyclists have their own lane, everyone feels safer, including drivers.\nThis bill should definitely consider adapting what we currently have instead of wasting money ripping out perfectly good and frequently used bike lanes. Some alternative, much lower cost ways to improve traffic in the city include:\n- More intersections that don't allow a right turn on a red light, and do have advance right turn signals.\n- More advance left turn signals.\n- Adaptive streetlights for streetcars so they do not have to sit waiting at a red light (this would encourage more people to take a streetcar, if it moves faster).\n- Any other traffic light changes that allow for traffic to run more smoothly.\n- Enforcement and tickets for those who block the box.\nAll of this energy towards ripping out bike lanes would be much better for everyone involved if it was directed at proven ways to fight gridlock. There is no proof anywhere that removing bike lanes reduces traffic. There are a lot of lies being thrown around and I am really unimpressed that the province would consider a bill that affects so many Torontonians' lives without considering that it is based on vibes and not facts.\nAlso, the province should not be spending so much time thinking about our city's bike lanes. We have a municipal government for that. They are overstepping and should focus on building more housing, combatting homelessness, and the huge amount of debt it is in. It's ridiculous that this bill is being suggested. What a waste of everyone's time and energy.\n"

Making it easier for people to cycle rather than drive is a far more sustainable (both environmentally and temporally) solution than slashing bike lanes to prioritize car lanes. Bike lanes are also crucial for cyclist safety. There should be FEWER barriers to putting in bike lanes, NOT more!!\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI strongly urge this government to reconsider restricting bike lanes to only roads where it would not result in the removal of vehicle lanes. For many municipalities, like Toronto where I live, there is limited ability to build bike lanes without removing vehicle lanes because the width of the right-of-way is fixed. Municipalities like Toronto have long grappled with vehicle congestion (well before bicycle lanes became an integral part of  the transportation system) and with only so much room to move people and goods we need to use our right-of-way as efficiently as possible. That means encouraging people to use space efficient modes of transportation like bicycles. It has been long known that bike lanes are the best way to encourage people to bike to work and run errands. Without them many people might otherwise drive because they don't feel safe bike on roads with cars and large trucks. This government often says that they respect the autonomy of local governments to make decisions that's best for their residents. Where to put bike lanes should be left up to municipalities not the province.\n"

        "comment": "My comment is that it is a ridiculous waste of tax payer money to install bike lanes, to just rip them out. Perhaps it would be prudent to do a referendum of people who actually live in Toronto proper regarding our opinion on bike lanes, over a government official that does not even live in the city?  Last time I checked, this was a democracy. I think the protests that have already occurred should show that the people of Toronto want bike lanes. There is video evidence of Doug Ford saying how afraid he would be to bike in the city without bike lanes, so please tell us what has changed.\nRespectfully,\nMadeline\n"

        "comment": "I believe this Bill is exceptionally short sighted and will be a massive generational mistake. I understand if the province wants to give less funding for public transit and bike infrastructure (even if I disagree with that strategy and think it is part of what has led to this congestion hellscape in the first place), but I cannot fathom why the Ford government believes that it's a good idea to dictate how individual cities design their streets.\nStudy after study has shown that if you want to improve congestion in and through our cities the most effective way to do that is by giving people reasonable alternatives to driving. That is what the city of Toronto and other cities around the province have been doing, and now this government wants to take away all of that progress in a clear bid to get more motorist support for the coming election. My news flash to Doug Ford is that the short term support he may gain will drain away pretty quickly when absolutely nothing is improved from these changes.\nI cannot say that I am always a fan of conservative policy, but I voted for Ford because I believed he would improve the lives of the average Ontario resident. If this change goes through that trust will be broken, and I can promise that I will never consider voting for a conservative government again so long as I live. I have many friends who feel the same way. This is not a small issue to us, it is a matter of road safety, of city autonomy and of climate consciousness all wrapped into one.\nI humbly and sincerely ask that this proposal be reconsidered before we send cycling infrastructure back 30 years.\nYours truly,\nA hopeful yet concerned voter\n"

        "comment": "help me write a convincing argument to why the removal of bike lanes in Toronto will only increase traffic congestion as cyclists will be forever to use transit and car instead of cycling. this is what i have so far:\nThe removal of bike lanes in Toronto is counterproductive and will make roads more dangerous for cyclists and more congested for drivers. The act of removing bicycle lanes favours \u201cdrivers\u201d over people in a misguided attempt to garner votes. Commuters currently using bike lanes are also trying to get across the city in a safe, environmentally conscious and frankly quicker manner than motorists. It makes more sense to focus on metropolitan areas as thus and not merely arteries\n"

How can you justify killing 44% more Ontarians?\n- they contribute to cities becoming less car centric which is a good thing.\n- it is a MASSIVE waste of public funding to remove existing infrastructure that is fully working as intended.\n- bike lanes generally contribute to pedestrian road safety by slowing down cars in shared road areas. Cars can still move at the same pace on dedicated car roads (i.e. highways).\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against Bill 212, which should not be named \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\", as removing bike lanes does not actually reduce traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes from Toronto and inhibiting the expansion of them would be extremely detrimental to the city. I personally use the Bloor bike lane for my commute to work, and would not feel safe biking along Bloor street without it. I also know many other people who use the bike lanes regularly and would be disadvantaged by their removal.\nAdditionally, removing bike lanes and inhibiting the expansion of bike lanes would not actually help drivers. Adding back car lanes to Bloor, University, and Yonge would simply induce demand. The article  \"Induced Demand and the Highway Interchange\", linked below, explains induced demand very well, but to sum it up, if more car lanes are introduced, more people will drive on them until gridlock is back. The only real solution to gridlock is having viable alternatives, like good bike lanes and strong public transit systems.\nAs the article \"Why Drivers Should Support Bike Lanes\", linked below, explains, having bike lanes is beneficial to drivers as well as cyclists. They separate cyclists out from drivers, so drivers don't have to worry about hitting them. They also provide economic benefits, including increasing retail sales and property values, and provide a cheap transportation alternative for people who cannot afford to drive, as outlined in the article \"Protected Bike Lanes Statistics\" linked below.\nBike lanes benefit everyone. They provide better transportation options, save people money, increase health through the exercise of cycling, and are environmentally friendly. It is, quite frankly, disgraceful of Doug Ford to try to not only remove Toronto's bike lanes, but pretend that it will actually benefit Torontonians. Perhaps he should spend more time trying to help the entire province instead of obsessing over Toronto.\n"

As a society, we've decided that things like the environment, and the right to protect our own land from being taken are important, yet this bill wants to make a massive and expensive project happen without regard for either of these.\nProtecting the environment now is more important than ever, since decades of neglect before now have caused an astronomical 73% global wild life population decline. Our green belt is crucial in protecting native Ontario species, including plants, and is one of the most productive areas in the country for farming; yet this bill proposes that is less important than a highway. If the province truly cared about moving vehicles now, they'd buy back the 407 which is barely being used, instead of breaking ground on a new highway that won't see use for years, will destroy a significant portion of the greenbelt, and perpetuate urban sprawl.\nAdditionally, this bill makes it nearly impossible for any affected land owners of this newly proposed highway to resist their land being taken.\nThis bill is a terrible idea and should be withdrawn in whole.\n"

The best ways are investing in world-class public transit and alternative modes of transportation (i.e. biking).\nAdding back road lanes of traffic on core roadways like Yonge and Bloor may have some short-term benefits, but it won't take long for traffic to deteriorate back to its current state of gridlock. Passing bill 212 will actually prevent real long-term solutions from being implemented as it will block the very vital tool of creating a full coverage bike lane network which will help convert car traffic to bike riders\n"
