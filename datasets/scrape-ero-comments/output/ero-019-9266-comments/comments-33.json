        "comment": "I am commenting on the proposed legislation to stop new bike lanes and potentially remove existing lanes in Toronto and other cities. Data does not support the arguments being made by the government about gridlock, emergency vehicle delays or drops in consumer spending along bike corridors. The government would do well to embrace bikes as part of a holistic strategy to encourage more alternative transit options. Additionally this is not provincial jurisdiction and I do not think it is appropriate to interfere with the democratic process in order to push the agenda of a vocal anti-bike citizens.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are more important than having additional lanes for cars. The road network in Toronto and other cities in Ontario is dense and complete, but the bike network is sparse and disconnected. It's important to build out this bike network, especially running along major streets which have important destinations and which offer direct paths through the city.\nAlthough a lack of bike lanes deters most cyclists, there will always remain some who will ride anywhere, whether or not there is a bike lane. Having these cyclists in the middle of regular traffic is dangerous and will effectively negate the assumed benefits of having more lanes for cars. It is better to create the dedicated bike lane and keep bikes separated from regular traffic.\nAs an alternative, I would suggest scrutinizing street parking on major roads. Many major roads have street parking, but this creates accidents and huge slowdowns when someone decides to parallel park. Removing street parking in strategic places could greatly improve road capacity and traffic flow.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" and specifically the provision that requires the removal of a traffic lane to install bike lanes. While I appreciate the need for more cycling infrastructure, this approach raises significant safety concerns for cyclists.\nBy removing a traffic lane, the remaining lanes will inevitably become more congested, putting cyclists at greater risk from impatient or frustrated drivers. The close proximity between vehicles and cyclists increases the likelihood of collisions, and without adequate barriers or protective measures, this setup can create dangerous conditions for those on bikes.\nA better solution would be to explore alternative ways of creating bike lanes that do not require reducing traffic lanes, such as repurposing parking lanes or enhancing off-road cycling routes. It's crucial that we prioritize the safety of cyclists while also addressing traffic flow.\nI urge the government to reconsider this aspect of the legislation and focus on designs that ensure the safety of all road users.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly disagree with the implementation of this bill. Adding the need for provincial approval is a clear roadblock to building very needed bike infrastructure. This bill will clearly lead to a massive delay in building needed projects, and add unnecessary red tape to something that, quite frankly, does not need provincial intervention. The province clearly will not understand the needs of a city better than the city itself.\nResearch had proven time and time again that focusing on building bike infrastructure (and other accessible modes of public transportation) actually decreases traffic and vehicle accidents. Dedicated bike lanes also make the roads and sidewalks safer for both drivers and pedestrians.\nThe research is clear, increasing car traffic lanes leads to higher independence on cars, filling up those new lanes, and creating a never ending cycle of traffic. No amount of lanes will ever stop traffic, only worsen it. Better solutions must be made, for public safety, accessibility, the environment, and so much more. This can only be done by investing in and encouraging infrastructure for foot traffic, bike traffic, and public transportation.\nI would like to kindly ask that Doug Ford and his supporters stop putting forward road blocks to actual improvement with bills such as this, which are based on zero research, zero professional opinions, and zero evidence.\n"

        "comment": "This seems like a policy that is much more about politicking than actually improving congestion. Induced demand (and concrete studies from many major cities) show that adding more vehicle lanes and/or more highways does nothing to improve congestion in the long-term. What does help is getting people out of vehicles by providing frequent and reliable transit options as well as safe ways to travel by bicycle or walking. Your plan is the exact opposite of that. You have provided no evidence to support your plan and instead rely on a few anecdotes. In addition to not improving congestion, this plan increases the risks for those travelling outside of a vehicle. This is misguided, poor policy in an attempt to garner a few votes in suburban ridings. Shame.\n"

Apart from this jurisdictional concern, the governments priorities in getting drivers home faster appears not to consider the safety of others who choose to cycle or walk or must cycle or walk. Studies have shown that lower speeds reduce incidents of serious injuries and deaths and separated bike lanes help to protect vulnerable road users, both pedestrians and cyclists. I am not a supporter of this legislation which   Prioritizes the speed of travel by car.\n"

The Province should not be involved in such local issues.\n"

        "comment": "I commute to and from my finance job at a big bank on Bay Street by bike because the TTC is unreliable and takes twice as long. I commute to and from work by bike throughout the winter as well. My time is valuable. Removing safe bike lanes will negatively impact my commute. I often stop at local shops on my way home from work. It is convenient.\nAdding more car lanes will only induce demand and therefore car traffic.\nIf I can't safely commute by bike, I will be sure to take up the entire right lane as is allowed by the Highway Traffic Act, thus slowing car traffic and keeping me safer than being passed by cars in my lane.\nThe culture war being created by the current government, and the Premier in particular, is ridiculous. Why not get rid of sidewalks too? Sometimes I see sidewalks without pedestrians. Might as well add a lane of car traffic there.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Durham Region and I do not support this bill. All evidence points to one solution to gridlock: viable alternative transportation methods. A mix of good public transit and cycling options will mean fewer people will drive. This will make life easier for both drivers, who will see less traffic, and non-drivers, who will now have easier ways to get across town.\nAnd let's remember, removing bike lanes does not get rid of cyclists. Cyclists will still be taking Bloor if the bike lanes are gone, except they would be much more likely to get killed. When I drive, I much prefer it when there are bike lanes because I don't have to worry about a cyclist in my blind spot. Bike lanes make me feel more secure whether I'm on four wheels or two.\nFor my final point, I think Doug Ford said it best on his episode of Political Blind Date:\n\"You're nervous when there's no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\"\n"

Every day.\nBut when you watch traffic, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re not causing congestion. There are very real issues causing congestion and I just don\u2019t think the bike lanes are them.\nWhy are traffic lights being put so close together for instance? It\u2019s clear that this leads to congestion.\nThere\u2019s evidence that bike lanes actually might reduce congestion and that rings true. When cars are stopped, hundreds of people on bikes fly by them. Obviously not every biker is replacing a car, but more car lanes exist on plenty of routes and they\u2019re just more fill up with cars.\nBut the thing that makes me most angry is that I think that this idea is a huge waste of money. The bike lanes are in, and they\u2019re working. There\u2019s a debate about whether they\u2019re working, sure, but even if it\u2019s 50/50, you want to waste a ton of money undoing the work that other people did before you? What a waste of money. Ford has lost the plot. All this talk of traffic with the worst ideas for fixes, he\u2019s completely lost my vote. It was supposed to be fiscal smarts, not waste waste waste.

        "comment": "It is abundantly clear when looking at actual data that reducing the number of cars is the only solution to traffic. Adding additional bike lanes, finishing the Provincial public transit projects on time, and removing on-street parking are the easiest ways to incentivize people out of their vehicles and into less congestion causing methods of transportation. Completing the Eglinton LRT and/or adding bike lanes for the full length of Gerrard St E are the main ways to get me out of a car and onto better commute options. Removing bike lanes or not adding them where they may reduce a lane of travel is a step backwards for this province.\n"
