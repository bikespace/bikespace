        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

Do not remove and reduce bike lanes, you may not use it by many are\nrespect the demand of public even if you are liking it. that's how democracy works\n"

        "comment": "I want to Thank the current provincial government in making the decision to remove the bike lanes on yonge, bloor, and university.\nFacts:\nResidents who live in the near these bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University were never asked about the choice to have  bike lanes. John Tory listened to 2 percent of the population and put these bike lanes in without any notice.\nI live have lived near the Yonge and Summerhill for over 50 years.\nTraffic was bad enough before the bike lanes, not it is totally ridiculous.  What used to take me 5 minutes, takes me NOW over 25 minutes.\nPollution, gridlock are all a result of these bike lanes.\nI never see any bikes between Nov to April. Yet the city waste's it's resoures to salt and clear these bike lanes all winter long, which no one uses.\nEmergency vehicles.  How do they navigate in total gridlock?  I am sure a life has been lost becuse an emergency vehicle is Stuck in traffic.\nYonge st, bloor, University are used by the TTC.  When the subway goes down.  Nothing moves on  yonge st, Bloor st, or university.    It is total chaos.  These bike lanes should be on side streets that the TTC buses do not use.\nYonge St  has been 2 lanes North and 2 lane's south for over 200 years. This is precedent.  It is not fair to put in bike lanes without any consulatation to nearby residents.   The Traffic is 100x worse then it was.\nTry and use either bloor st, yonge st, or University during rush hour.  Count how many cars vs bikes in the area.  Right now it is 2 percent of bikes.\nWheel Trans, TTC, vehicles are unable to drop off any of its passenger's on Yonge, Bloor, Or University because of these bike lanes.  Operators MUST drop off passengers on a side street.  Usually these side streets are filled with snow. People with disabilities now suffer as they are further away from their destination/ Pick up.  Is this fair to those people with disabilites. No!!!!\nYonge St, Bloor St and University ave.  Business's have suffered, as customers don't dare go shopping because of the grid lock and now the lack of parking.  Look at Avenue Road and Davenport.  Floral shop's will be out of business soon as the city has removed the parking in front of their stores.\nMore Condo's are being built with more cars and traffic expected.  Does this makes sense to put in a bike lane and remove a whole lane of Traffic.   Ridiculous.\nLook at the traffic anytime at bloor and sherbourne.  The traffic is so backed up on bloor st.  You have to add 20 minutes travel time to your trip.\nPut the bikes lanes on other streets.  Sherbourne has bike lanes, Dupont has bike lanes. Bloor St, Yonge St and University are major arteries of the city.\nThank you to the conservative government for stepping in and making the much needed decision to get rid of the bike lanes.  If people and tax paying residents of the city had a vote right now on the bike lanes.  98 percent would VOTE to remove them.  FACT!\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly support and look forward to the enactment of Bill 212.  The installed bikelanes have negatively impacted access to the city which should be freely accessible to ALL citizens whether they chose to drive a vehicle, take public transportation, walk or bike. The increased gridlock due to the bikelane installations has numerous negative impacts which have been blantantly disregarded: the gridlock restricts the delivery of goods and services driving up costs, critical emergency vehicle access is impacted, the environment is impacted due to the increased idylling of vehicles, and the daily commute, to work or to locations in your community (i.e. to the doctor's office, to school, to pharmacies, grocery stores etc) is longer and more treacherous. These are only a few of the numerous negative impacts the poorly designed, poorly consulted on bikelanes have caused.\n"

I believe this needs significant revision.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, and the attached schedules and acts are an extreme over-reach by the provincial government. The provincial government should not be getting involved in the minutiae of lane construction, or municipal traffic management. That is what we elect our municipal councilors and mayors for. Bicycle lanes are an important component of ensuring all citizens can safely enjoy our province. We need more pedestrian and bicycle safety, not less.\nWe need more public transportation and more ways of reducing our environmental impacts. If commute times are increasing then the provincial government should mandate work-from-home requirements when further than x km from the office, or provide incentives for companies to operate satellite offices.\nSchedule 1 is another over-reach as the expropriations act should not be bypassed. These laws exist for a reason, and bypassing sections is a slippery slope to bypassing it altogether.\nSchedule 2 is overreaching in the same manner as Schedule 1. Additionally, we don't need more highways we need more public transit. Trains can carry for more people, faster, and more efficiently than cars so that should be our answer to gridlock and traffic.\nSchedule 3 is yet another over-reach. The environmental assessments of capital projects is a critical aspect, and no part of it should be skipped, expedited, or ignored. The land and environment of this province belongs to all of us and the government is responsible for safe-keeping it for future generations, and undertaking projects for the betterment of all.\nThis entire Bill should be tossed from the floor. It does not provide enough benefits for the people of Ontario, and provides too much power to an individual.\n"

        "comment": "I fully support the Provincial government\u2019s requirement that municipalities obtain permission before installing bike lanes and its authority to remove them at its discretion. This measure ensures accountability and oversight in urban planning decisions that affect the broader population.\nI strongly oppose the continued implementation of bike lanes in Toronto. While the concept of bike lanes may seem like a step toward sustainable urban planning, in practice, they have proven to be counterproductive for our city. Toronto\u2019s infrastructure is already strained, and bike lanes exacerbate traffic congestion, reduce available parking, and hinder the movement of goods and services essential to our economy. Additionally, the weather conditions in Toronto make year-round bike commuting impractical for many residents, leading to underutilization of these lanes for a significant portion of the year.\nRather than catering to a small percentage of the population, I urge city planners to focus on solutions that benefit the majority, such as improving public transit, maintaining existing roadways, and implementing traffic flow measures that support the diverse needs of our city\u2019s residents and businesses.\n"

        "comment": "The stated objective of this Act is to reduce gridlock, but the proposed measures are demonstrably harmful to public health and safety, accessibility, mobility, environmental protection, and will exacerbate the ongoing climate crisis. Requiring provincial approval for the construction of new bike lanes that replace vehicle lanes\u2014despite municipalities having this authority under the Municipal Act\u2014is a significant overreach. It undermines local decision-making, disregards municipal autonomy, and signals a lack of trust in local governments to manage their own affairs. This approach also disregards the rigorous planning processes that precede the installation of bike lanes, which involve extensive research and community input.\nIt is a well-established fact that adding car lanes does not alleviate congestion due to the phenomenon of induced demand, whereby more lanes attract more traffic. Evidence from around the world supports this. If the government were serious about reducing gridlock, it would allocate significant funding to expand public transit systems and develop comprehensive cycling networks across Ontario. Cycling infrastructure reduces congestion by removing cars from the road; bicycles occupy far less space than single-occupancy vehicles, creating more capacity for essential drivers.\nThe proposed removal of three Toronto bike lanes\u2014used by thousands daily\u2014further highlights the misguided approach. These lanes have reduced car traffic, supported local businesses (as shown in reports like the Bloor Bike Lane studies), and received support from Toronto BIAs. Eliminating them will harm both local businesses and commuters. Cycling also promotes better public health outcomes, reducing healthcare costs, and enhances street safety for all users, including pedestrians and drivers. Each year, cycling infrastructure prevents accidents and saves lives. The six cyclist deaths on Toronto streets this year are a tragic reminder of the risks faced by those navigating car-centric infrastructure.\nBike lanes also improve accessibility for residents without the financial means to own a car, enabling them to travel for work, recreation, and economic participation. A car-dependent community excludes a significant portion of its population.\nExempting Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments is equally short-sighted. The proposed route crosses environmentally sensitive land, which functions as a vital carbon sink, wildlife habitat, and flood control system. Paving over this area would cause irreversible environmental damage while failing to address congestion. Induced demand will lead to more traffic, greenhouse gas emissions, and gridlock. If the government were serious about addressing these issues, it would prioritize sustainable transportation investments instead of highway expansion.\nIt is unclear whether planners, environmentalists, engineers, or other experts were consulted in drafting this legislation. Bill 212 ultimately contradicts its stated purpose: it will worsen gridlock, endanger public safety, harm local economies, irreversibly damage the environment, and lead to poorer health outcomes for Ontarians. This bill should not proceed.\n"

They are following their own set agenda while completely ignoring the concerns of the majority of people in this city. These are commuters, business owners and emergency services. Not sure how the councillors and their staff fit in as public servants when they don\u2019t serve the public at large, but instead a small special interest minority group that seeks to stagnate the flow of traffic in the city. Please remove the bike lanes you mention, and stop future imposition and present occupation of bike lanes on city streets, particularly the major arterial roads.\n"

As a tax-payer of this city, I do NOT want my tax dollars going towards spending more money to remove essential bike lanes that are used by cyclists every single day. I am both a cyclist and a driver in this city and I understand the absolute importance of bike lanes in our city, especially the ones along Bloor and University which this framework is trying to remove. Myself, along with thousands of other cyclists in this city, use those bike lanes to get to our jobs, our families, our social outings, SAFELY and efficiently. And I implore this city to reject this framework at all costs.\nRemoving these bike lanes, and reducing new bike lanes from being made, is NOT going to just simply improve traffic in our city. Will you also remove and limit street parking? Or forbid construction on any major arterial road? Or improve the TTC? Why is it that the bike lanes are being targeted and other areas of improvement are not? The city needs to take a more holistic approach to reducing traffic congestion in our city and I don't believe that starting with bike lanes is the answer.\nBike lanes offer a safer, faster, and environmentally friendly alternative to hundreds of thousands of people in this city and we should be encouraging MORE people to cycle by improving that infrastructure, NOT removing it.\n"

It is such a relief for me to reach these streets where the protected bike lanes are in place after cycling along other streets such as Dufferin and King, where I do not feel as safe. And seeing the number of other cyclists also using these bike lanes brings me a sense of pride and community. We should be increasing the number of bike lanes in Toronto, not removing them. The Ontario Government has no business making decisions about bike lanes, especially if the decision makers live outside of Toronto, only to drive in and out of the city core to the suburbs or beyond, and have never had the pleasure of biking around in the downtown core. And what an incredibly wasteful way to spend Ontario taxpayers money.\n"
