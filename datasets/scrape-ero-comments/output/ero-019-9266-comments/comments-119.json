        "comment": "This is a bad idea. Bike lanes typically don't take away a car lane that isn't already being primarily used as parking spots. Saying a bike lane is taking away a car lane is disingenuous when most of those car lanes are being used primarily for parking. Forcing bikes to ride between parked cars and moving cars is dangerous and adding bike lanes like they have on Bloor is a better way to do it with no impact on traffic because there was only one lane for moving cars anyway. The other lane for parked cars just causes collisions due to the crazy merging it forces vehicles to do.\n"

        "comment": "I find this proposed legislation to be backward, misinformed and harmful for the sustainable growth of cities. Ontarians require many ways to get around - and this requires safe, and complete cycling networks to enhance safety and encourage more people to commute in more sustainable methods. Car dependency has been proven to be less sustainable, harder on our roads, and awful for local businesses and communities. We need to encourage other ways to get around and reduce our car dependency - especially in denser urban centers. Simply put, more car lanes will lead to induced demand, further clogging our roadways. This is not what Ontario needs. Stop micromanaging our cities and focus on larger systemic issues. If this government was serious about reducing gridlock, it would harness the potential of multiple modalities, and discourage individual car use and encourage people to get around in a number of ways - which needs to include transit, cycling and walking. I am incredibly opposed to this malicious political pandering which will only make traffic worse and our cities stagnate by the stranglehold of auto dependency. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "I live in midtown Toronto and the cycle tracks have changed my life for the better. I can ride to work, run errands, visit friends and family, all on my bike. It keeps me fit, healthy, and the cycle tracks themselves give me a safe passage.\nTaking the cycle tracks/bike lanes out will diminish my quality of life. My route to visit my sister on the Danforth will be much more dangerous. It will be harder to run errands because I will have to plan my routes more carefully and take circuitous, indirect routes if they offer a slightly safer passage.\nI work in education and have students who also use the bike lanes to get around. They love the freedom, independence and exercise of using their bikes. Taking this away from them would be cruel and dangerous.\nWe need to make calmer, safer streets. Bike lanes are one piece of that puzzle and we know this thanks to data we\u2019ve seen at the local level but also from cities around the world. It is straightforwardly good to install bike lanes on streets. It is good for business (just ask the Annex BIA who have announced this publicly based on their own data), and it is good for all road users \u2014 including drivers.\n"

Increasing bike lanes and improving public transport will. This is a HUGE waste of tax payer money in an already tightly budgeted city that is struggling (just look at the shelter system!). The next government will just put it back in because the people who actually live in Toronto want options to get places. And the more cyclists there are the more people who aren\u2019t on the roads- you\u2019re not forcing all these cyclists who would have NOT gotten into a car to work/entertainment to now get into a car.\n"

Firstly, this bill does not serve ontarians as the transportation needs vary greatly at the municipal level, and as such this issue of bike lanes should be handled by municipalities. Ontario is great because of its diverse communities, stop trying to lump everyone into the same pile. Second, there is no evidence that in urban settings removing bike lanes for car lanes will improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. In fact the opposite is true. Finally, putting Ontarions who use bike lanes at greater risk in traffic is arguably unethical. Ontario is a province that can be an example worldwide if we choose. Its embarrassing to see the government show its lack of intelligence by proposing poor legislation and by not focussing its efforts on more important issues like health care and education.\n"

        "comment": "There will be many comments supporting bike lanes and probably many who don't. When the pandemic came along I applauded this government for listening to the experts and taking action based on facts. Now I see the opposite when it comes to traffic congestion. The facts and studies show the benefits of bike lanes. (I am agnostic, I only follow the evidence). The evidence in this case is quite clear bikes lanes do not cause the congestion, they may in FACT reduce it. So  if the black and white evidence is there and you talk about the key facts of moving people not cars, bike lanes are effective and to make them more popular you need and effective connected network, again proven FACT. I would not support any government that doesn't listen to expert analysis of issues and in this case they are ignoring the truth to promote what?, removing bike lanes will not change the fact congestion is caused by too many cars. That is ultimately the issue, but that is a lot harder to solve when no attempt to add fast convenient train service to the suburbs has been attempted. If you have a Transport Minister who has to drive from Brampton downtown because there is no decent public transport option and then blames bike lanes for his delay in Traffic you know the issue isn't bike lanes. Follow fact not agenda.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea: bike lanes make travel for so many people easier, cheaper and faster. The reason bike lanes don't look like they're being used is because they're not congested - people get where they're going very quickly because they don't clog up. Of course they're going to look \"unused\" if you take a snapshot of a moment, especially when the adjacent car lane is packed with cars.\nThis is a cynical idea: It pits Ontarians who don't live in the Toronto against those who do, distracting from actual issues that affect those people outside of Toronto.  While not explicitly stated, its implied that Toronto's bike lanes are somehow paid for by \"tax dollars\" from outside of the city.\nThis is a backwards idea: All of the most livable cities, those where the citizens are happiest, have the highest percentage of their time to themselves - all of these cities have extensive bike networks. Vancouver comes to mind - the city has people EVERYWHERE on their bikes, with very generous bike lane networks. Toronto is a blob of roads and construction. The gridlock is probably greatest around the parts of the city where we've been under construction for seemingly forever.\nI'm decidedly against this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to strongly condemn the proposed plan to remove bike lanes from Toronto. There is, regretably, no basis for the proposed requirement for provincial approval of new bike lanes and the removal of existing ones. Decades of research has shown that bike lanes across the world improve the economy, hasten driving time, improve our health and wellbeing, and save lives.\nMoreover, bike lanes in Toronto have already shown tangible evidence of improving the lives of locals. Toronto Fire deputy chief Jim Jessop recently stated that since bike lanes were installed on Bloor Street, emergency response times have in fact improved. The proposed removal of bike lanes will harm emergency services and undoubtedly negatively impact people in moments of crisis.\nBike lanes also improve the flow of traffic. Although Bill 212 suggests that bike lanes cause congestion, the opposite is in fact true. Approximately half of all trips that people take are less than 2 kilometres meaning that by getting cars off the road for short trips, we can improve the flow of traffic considerably. The cause of congestion is not the amount of lanes we have for cars, but rather simply the number of cars on the road.\nI strongly urge you all to cancel this plan as it will cause more traffic, harm emergency services, and negatively impact local businesses who depend on foot traffic rather than car traffic to thrive. Other provinces, states, and jurisdictions are heading towards more bike and people-friendly cities, this plan will leave Toronto and indeed all of Ontario behind the rest of North America. Please reconsider before causing irreversible damage to the province.\n"

I take public transit on nights out and love to walk in our neighborhood.\nI look at European cities and think about harmoniously people move in traffic regardless of their vehicle of choice. That is really something to envy, and it works. They have winter, they have less space, and are still a benchmark for us.\nTrue freedom is choosing to drive, take public transit, walk, or bike to my destination.\nIf you hate traffic, you have to encourage people to do something other than drive. Proper, connected bike lanes do that. If there is any exposure, people are much less likely to use those unconnected lanes. Every new bike lane in Toronto I see is always busy throughout the day and all year round.\nOur children can even use protected lanes like the ones on University, which means less of us in cars doing the daily pick up / drop off at school.\nWith the adoption of electric bikes and electric cargo bikes, even more people need a safe place to get where they are going.\nAnd if you remove a bike lane, cyclists will still use the lane and just cause further aggression from motorists.\nPlease don\u2019t remove any lanes and only keep adding them for our future!\n"

It is essential that the actions this government takes are evidence-based, responsible, and forward-looking for the benefit of today's citizens and those of the next generations. One important piece of this complex strategy is bicycle infrastructure such as dedicated bike lanes. What follows is a sampling of the literature, policies, frameworks, and projects that  support the implementation bicycle infrastructure for increased safety, economic outcomes, environmental measures, health, and equity.\n\u2022\tThis October, the Transportation Association of Canada released On the move: Active transportation initiatives across Canada. This report highlights the positive impact that active transportation initiatives \u2013 inclusive of bike lanes \u2013 have on public health, safety, equity, congestion (i.e., grid lock), affordability, and climate change. Notably, Ontario has been showcased in this report for seven initiatives:\no\tOntario Traffic Manual Book 18 \u2013 Cycling Facilities\no\tProvince-wide cycling network based on #CycleON: Ontario\u2019s Cycling Strategy of 2013\no\tCity of Hamilton\u2019s Complete Streets Design Manual\no\tActiveTO Midtown Complete Street Pilot\no\tCity of Ottawa\u2019s Booth Street Complete Street, Flora Footbridge, and Protected Intersection Design Guide.\n\u2022\tFrameworks, policies, and guidelines are changing internationally, with European countries leading the way, on integrating active travel options onto roadways to increase safety, economic outcomes of local businesses, and equity. Some such changes include those outlined by the Transportation Association of Canada (2024), National Academy of Sciences (2023), and the Complete Street Design Guidelines from the City of Hamilton (2022).\n\u2022\tIn a US national study of roadway narrowing (i.e., road diet), there was no increased risk of accidents involving at least one vehicle, and at slower speeds (such as in urban areas) there was a decrease in non-intersection accidents (Johns Hopkins, 2023).\n\u2022\t2.26x increased likelihood of cycling when cycling facilities are provided on the roadway (Mitra et al., 2021)\n\u2022\tStuckless Consulting Inc. has a public-facing resource called The Active Transportation Benefits Tracker (2024a). This tracker breaks down the benefits of active transportation into safety, economy, environment, equity, and health. Additionally, they have a public-facing National AT Fund tracker (Stuckless Consulting Inc., 2024b).\n\u2022\tAccording to the Improving Health by Design report (authored by Medical Officers of Health in the GTHA; Gardner et al., 2015), the annual costs of physical inactivity and obesity in the GTHA is $4 billion, including $1.4 billion in direct medical costs.

        "comment": "Getting rid of bike lanes would mean taking a large step back in terms of sustainable transportation and climate goals. In order to imagine a future for Canada, we need to start imagining the ways we can change our cities to help them support a wide variety of people with different needs. The most simple step is keeping bike lanes, allowing people of all ages to use a safe alternative to driving that promotes their health and wellbeing and reduces the amount of cars on the roads. It would also be a great neglect not to mention that in removing bike lanes you are putting the vulnerable people in our community at risk yet again. Cyclists are not all commuters. For some Hamiltonians this is the only efficient transportation system they have, and I would wager that many of the people using bike lanes are the houseless individuals in our communities. Please choose not to put more people at risk. Bike lanes will not get rid of bikes, you will instead increase the amount of accidents and deaths in collisions between cyclists and cars. This is personal to me. My dad and my partner are cyclists, using bike lanes multiple times a day, and both have been hit before. No matter how much extra time you save for motorists, remember that you will be choosing to put real people\u2019s lives at risk. These are people that I love who will now be vulnerable to yet another life altering crash. I beg that you think about the bigger picture: what do you want Hamilton to look like? to feel like? I want it to look welcoming, open to explore in different and active ways. I want it to feel safe for vulnerable road users. I don\u2019t want to feel afraid that at any point I may lose my dad and partner.\n"

The cyclists don't just stay at home, you'll either force cyclists to take the existing lane or make them take the car. It makes driving downtown more uncomfortable and makes me as a cyclist feel at constant danger. Expediting the highway 413 and Bradford bypass will only further more urban sprawl and strain on our highway network and create induced demand. Spending money to remove bike lane might one of the most stupid fiscal decisions ever, when the money could be used to improve our transit system and more bike infrastructure, which is the only way to solve congestion. BIAs are against this, citing increasing business profits. Emergency services said that they've improved response times!\nI know this from personal evidence and data from bike share Toronto that cyclists are far from a \"fringe minority\", almost all of my friends either bring their own bike or use bike share to get around the city, and I always see dozens of bikes riding out in Bloor Yonge and University. Cycling in the winter is also more and more popular, and is achievable with proper salting and plowing, contrary to the myth of \"6 months bike lanes can't be used\". I've cycled myself for the entire year, only stopping during heavy snowstorms or extreme cold.\nSide streets don't work here; the exceptions like Shaw and Palmerston have bike lanes already! I'm not riding for fun, I'm writing to get places which are located on the main arterials, and side streets require circuitous routing, navigating parked cars, and are dangerous when crossing a busy intersection since they don't have traffic signals.\nDoug has said himself back in 2017 that I cyclist death is too much and how he only feels safe with protected infrastructure and I do believe he was a honest good man. Catering to populism for election purposes only serves to divide Ontario and waste money pointlessly. Please, leave the bill and let the cities decide if they should add bike infrastructure.
