        "comment": "It is crucial to recognize the profound benefits that these lanes bring to our city.\nAs Premier Doug Ford emphasized in 2017,\n\u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d\nThis sentiment underscores the critical role that bike lanes play in enhancing safety for all road users.\nBike lanes are not just a safety measure; they are also good for business. Studies show that cities with well-designed bike infrastructure see increased foot traffic, which translates to higher sales for local businesses. Moreover, bike lanes contribute positively to the environment by encouraging sustainable transportation options, thereby reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality. This aligns with our commitment to fighting climate change and promoting a healthier urban ecosystem.\nBeyond economic and environmental benefits, bike lanes promote public and personal health. By providing safe routes for cycling, we encourage physical activity, which is vital for overall well-being. They offer freedom and mobility to residents, allowing them to navigate the city without relying solely on cars, thus alleviating congestion on our roads. Most importantly, bike lanes save lives. By prioritizing cyclist safety, we create a more inclusive and safer urban environment for everyone.\nIn light of these compelling reasons, I urge decision-makers to reconsider the plan to demolish these vital bike lanes. Let\u2019s stay in our lane and prioritize the health, safety, and prosperity of our community.\n"

Not everyone who can drive a car, can ride a bike.\nDriving on University now to access hospitals is most frustrating. Traffic is chaotic and bike lanes are empty most of the time.\nBike lanes should be limited to side roads with less traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am a longtime resident of Toronto. I get around the city by many means: bike, public transit, foot and car. I do not think the proposed legislation is sound for many reasons.\n1. Municipalities know their needs best so decisions regarding bike lanes should remain a municipal government responsibility not a provincial one.\n2.  Bike lanes provide a safer way for residents to get around the city by bike/e-bike/e-scooter/hover board and roller blade resulting in fewer cars on the road. Thereby bike lanes reduce rather than contribute to gridlock.\n3. Bike lanes save lives and minimize accidents. Their removal would result in more serious injuries and deaths.\n4. Studies show that bike lanes do not contribute to gridlock even when a car lane has had to be removed to allow for the creation of a bike lane. This is evidence-based.\n5. Bike lanes allow residents to travel without getting in a car thereby reducing carbon emissions from cars. Bike lanes contribute to better air quality. This is evidence-based.\n6.  Bike lanes are a boon to business as they encourage people to stop and shop. This is evidence-based.\n6. Bike lanes provide a healthy alternative and improve users\u2019 health and the city\u2019s livability.\nIf the intent is to reduce gridlock then the answer lies in investing in public transit and more bike lanes. I oppose the proposed legislation. Thank you for the opportunity to submit my comments which I hope have an impact.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes made my life better, easier and safer. I use them almost every day to commute, including most of winter, and they are a essential part of my everyday. I also visit more shops as I have more money - not owning a car - and easy access. I can tell you that I would have never spent thousands of dollar on local shops if it wasn't for the bike lanes. Every year more people will use them more and more and less cars will be on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Re Bill 212:  We do not need provincial oversight of the city's bike lanes.  Can Premier Ford please stop micromanaging Toronto with his pet projects and petty gripes.  We'd rather he and his cabinet just help the cities with what they ask for, and focus on broader issues facing citizens of Ontario.\nIf his concern is city traffic - we all agree - he could support a more strategic approach to building and infrastructure construction, and orderly road repair and transit, instead of approving development carte blanche wherever anyone asks. The city is full of construction sites spilling into the streets with more and more condos no one wants to live in, contributing to more gridlock and dangerous conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. (Then we have the giant private spa and giant proposed parking concrete parking he's forced on us, causing environmental devastation at Ontario Place, a project I hope is not too late to stop and relocate, and refocus on some kind of inclusive vision and climate leadership there.)\nMore people would cycle if it was better supported, which has traffic, environment and health benefits.  I actually agree some bike lanes seem poorly designed, but that's up to the city and citizens to work out.  Doesn't our provincial government have better things to do than get in the city's business on this?\n"

        "comment": "Don't remove the bike lanes. The effect of mass immigration and an over reliance on Toronto as the sole place to find jobs/entertainment/resources is what's causing the majority of the traffic in this city. The bike lanes and some pavement on the ground is not the main contributor. The province shouldn't get involved in such a municipal issue.\n"

        "comment": "There\u2019s no need to remove the bike lanes. They help make Toronto a more livrable, greener city. Why are we promoting car-centric culture when the earth is dying from global warming caused by GHG emissions? Most vehicles are single occupants. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much vehicular in the city. Bike lanes help keep cyclists safe and drivers unstressed about manoeuvering around bikers. Why are we wasting Ontario taxpayers\u2019 dollars to put in bike lanes only to have them removed weeks later?? How about putting the tax dollars towards improving the city like affordable housing, healthcare and education?\n"

I oppose the plan to remove bike lanes in Toronto. Numerous reports (not to mention simply looking at other, better run cities that offer higher quality of life) highlight the importance of safe bike lane infrastructure. Candidly, we\u2019re close to last straw with this province and city. If this proceeds you can expect us to move away for good. Do the right thing.\nAlso, Doug Ford. Stay in your lane, and actually, consider retirement.\nWe support bike lanes. We want more. Take them away and you\u2019ll lose quality of life. Toronto cannot risk squeezing it citizens any further. You\u2019re going to break us.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal stinks of ideological bias.  There does not appear to be any serious attempt to conduct a review of expert advice on the impacts these decisions could have.  Not to mention what it says about the independence (or lack thereof) that municipalities have on making decisions within their jurisdictions.\nI can also tell you why there is nothing to back up the effectiveness of this proposal in attaining its goal: all experts agree that this type of move will only induce more motor vehicle traffic, negating any gains achieved.  If you\u2019re going to force something down municipalities throats, why not focus on something that actually has a tangible impact like congestion pricing?\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on University have been a core part of my commute. There is no other safe, efficient bike route to get from Harbourfront north to College. Try it. Bike that route yourselves. There's no \"side street\" that crosses the GO train tracks. Even north of those tracks, all the streets from Union to College all have tight, heavy traffic. And they none of them run the full length of University, forcing you to do some strange labyrinth across many dangerous street to reach College. Emergency services have testified that the bike lanes have made no difference to their response times, and they are backed up by data gathered by the City of Toronto. The same is true for all car commuting on University.\nWhen you rip up University and force me back into the car every time I go to work, you will ruin both my commute and my finances with all the added gas and parking.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a terrible idea and a serious infringement on city planning's authority! There is no evidence that bike lanes are causing the traffic issues. Congestion is far more a result of the insane level of development and public works taking up ROW space and the lack of infrastructure coordination, as well as the increased population density and respective increase in cars due to lacking transit infrastructure.\nHaving wider roads for more cars on the road just makes the problem bigger by inviting more cars. Every bike lane that has been added in recent years has taken cars off the road because those riders feel safe riding, and would otherwise be taking up much more space as drivers in a cars on those same road. Having more cyclists moving safely in a protected bike lane is best for everyone, keeping both drivers and cyclists safe. The cyclists are actually doing the remaining drivers a favor by making space for them, even if it means getting a little sweaty and exposed to the weather. The massive take-up of bike lanes since the pandemic has been one of the City of Toronto's biggest success stories. Our bike lanes are starting to look like Copenhagen or Rotterdam with lots of people relying on them daily to get around. It goes without saying that the shift from cars to bikes also helps mitigate climate change, both the daily extreme heat we have been increasingly feeling and extreme weather events.\nLast but not least, access to safe bike lanes is also an essential equity issue, since not everyone can afford a car these days when budgets are tight. If you approve this bill it will be a dark age in the City's history blamed on your government. You will have shown no regard for the families and individuals who can't afford a car, simply to enhance your convenience as drivers.\nDo the right thing and leave our bike lanes alone, and get those transit lines done ASAP!\n"

        "comment": "I submit this comment as an occasional driver, consistent public transit user and someone who never uses a bike.\nThe province has no right to interfere with city or town business in such a manner. I have faith in the politicians in these regions to make the decisions that are best for their community. Removing bike lanes that already exist - and in some cases are just recently completed - is an insane waste of resources and the premier should be ashamed of using the Ontario budget for such an endeavor when many systems, including health care, are desperate for funding.\nIn Toronto, removing bike lanes will be a detriment to the city. Cyclists will be injured or die, drivers will make more mistakes than they already do which has a terrible impact on their mental well-being. Removing bike lanes will also not help congestion - cyclists will have to take the lane which will just make things worse.\nFinally, we should be encouraging green transportation as much as is possible. Why are we so dedicated to catering to cars when we are having 22 degree days on October 31?\nThis is embarassing for the provincial government and they must reconsider.\n"

Are there any competent ministers anywhere?\nWhy pull out bike lanes when you could (a) send us pointless cheques, (b) stop building a spa that\u2019s going to spike traffic on the QEW - where it\u2019s already backed up (what are you going to do, tear down these bike lanes too?), and (c) ever finish or expand transit systems (even buses - doesn\u2019t need to be expensive transit systems) so that we can actually tackls decongestion? Where are the common sense policies?\n"
