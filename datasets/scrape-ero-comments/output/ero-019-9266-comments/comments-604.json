I appreciate the feeling of safety that the bike lanes provide me as a cyclist and I do not believe that removing them will alleviate traffic, it will just make cycling more dangerous and will no doubt increase the frequency of cyclist injuries and deaths. It boggles my mind that the provincial government has any say on the status of our city's bike lanes in the first place, and the money that will be spent on removing them will no doubt line the pockets of Doug Ford and his rich friends, most of which do not even live in the city that will be affected by this irresponsible bill. Shame on the conservative government and Doug Ford.\n"

Removing them would mean we have to intermingle with motor traffic, making it more difficult for both cyclists and motorists to commute\u2014at different speeds, we will simply be in the way of one another. It is also extremely dangerous for cyclists to be sharing lanes with motor traffic, as accidents that could lead to nothing but a scratch on a car could mean life or death for a cyclist who need it to get around.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly believe the provincial government should leave the decision-making power for where to place bike lanes in a city to the municipal governments. The municipal governments have a much more in-depth and detailed understanding of their cities than the province and this understanding is critical to designing an effective transit system within a city. The provincial government should not be impeding municipalities progress on improving transit access and options for residents.\nI am a 27 year old female who lives in Etobicoke Center and commutes to downtown Toronto for work 3-4 times per week. My main forms of transportation for this commute are biking and transit. Specifically, I either bike the entire commute or I bike to a subway station where I connect to Line 2. I also bike for exercise and for both activities, commuting and exercise, I seek out the bike lanes that are currently present in the city as they are safer to bike in by creating a barrier (even if it is just a painted line) from cars. In particular, the new west extension of the Bloor St bike lane has made me feel much safer while biking and greatly reduced my communing time by providing a direct connection to downtown from Etobicoke. Notably, I also own a car and drive when necessary and, as a driver, I greatly prefer to have designated bike lanes for cyclists as it separates them from the car traffic and greatly reduces unsafe behaviours (e.g., cyclists weaving between cars).\nAside from safety, bike lanes also greatly benefit me by making my commute more efficient and less expensive. Driving from Etobicoke Center to my work in downtown (17 km total) takes >1 hour and is very expensive once you consider gas and parking (at least ~$15/day to park). As a young professional who already struggles with a high cost of living in Toronto, it is not reasonable or possible to drive. Additionally, if everyone were to resort to driving (as seems to be a preferred transportation method for the provincial government based on a policy focus on removing bike lanes and building new highways), whether there is an additional lane for traffic or not, traffic will remain a problem. I have driven on Bloor St West between Kipling and Bay St many times, both before and after the bike lane was added and the difference in the commute is negligible (traffic was not good before and remains similarly bad today). This is my personal experience but data from the city supports it, showing only a 1.5-4.4 min increase in transit time (for my commute that would be >1 hour if driving already, that is a very minimal). However, now I have the option to commute safely by bike and remove a car from the road. Biking my commute takes about 50 minutes and is free (fantastic!). Or if I bike to a TTC station and get on the subway, it takes about 50 min and costs $7.70/day (also a better option both financially and for time-saving than driving).\nMy situation is very specific to Toronto, where I live. I believe the municipal government is best positioned and most knowledgeable on Toronto transit to decide where to place bike lanes that meet the needs of its residents. For me, it did so when the Bloor St west bike lanes were added and they have greatly improved my experience both commuting and biking.\nFurthermore, the Bloor St west bike lane extension was only completed in June 2024. As a long-time biker, I was an early adopter of the extension. I strongly believe that over time, more and more people will start to use the bike lanes (as is true with many new things) and also benefit from them in regards to safety, cost, time, exercise and easier connections to subway stations.\nFinally, I acknowledge that some people need to drive in certain situations (e.g.,  in emergencies, people who are less mobile, transporting large items) but the bike lanes and other forms of public transit help reduce the number of vehicles on the road so those that need to drive can do so. Improving public transit and increasing commuting options can improve traffic by reducing the number of cars. Increasing the number of driving lanes will, at best, delay dealing with the problem (e.g., increasing population in a confined space), and, at worst, only cause more congestion due to construction and then do nothing to improve traffic once the construction is completed due to encouraging more cars on the roads.\n"

The province has no business butting into municipal jurisdiction to try and win votes from their voter base located in the suburbs of Toronto. The Bloor St bike lane serves local residents, and well - don't punish bike users for making the right choice - active transportation that reduces emissions and reduces gridlock, just to buy political points from suburban commuters.\n"

        "comment": "Unlike the namesake of this bill, I do not think removing bike lanes will reduce gridlock and save us time.\nSafe bike infrastructure will encourage more people to choose a bike over a car for their day to day trips.  This will remove cars from the road, allowing people who have no other choice than a car to move around better and faster.\nThe current congestion facing major urban centres like Toronto is not due to bike lanes.  It is due to chronic underfunding of mass transit that has not kept up with the population growth.\nThe key is to somehow get as many people as possible to choose other modes of transit other than cars.\nThat is the key to reducing gridlock and saving everyone time.\n"

        "comment": "I am disappointed to hear about this proposed bill with it adding additional red tape and bureaucracy to already glacial municipal processes. This is not in keeping with the principle of small government conservatism.\nI personally find bike lanes simpler for drivers as I can avoid having to interact with bikes on the road at all. Its safer for them and for me to have their own infrastructure away from cars.\nFinally, I think it would be a huge waste of money to tear these out while at the same time spending billions to build a new subway line that people can't get to after its built.\nThe attached article demonstrates that all adding one more lane would do is increase traffic and congestion. Besides, getting rid of the bike lane won't get rid of the bikes, they would probably ride in the street and cause even more congestion.\n"

        "comment": "For the purpose of this comment I am going to focus on the bike lane aspect of Bill 212. For this focus I do not support what is being proposed by the bill as it greatly misrepresents the holistic picture of what is going on in our communities and attempts to solve movement issues in isolation.\nAs it is laid out in the bill, there is a focus on making it harder to add new bike lanes as well as scrutinizing the existence of the current infrastructure. As someone who has lived in the Bloor West Village community before and after the addition of the bike lines through this section, I want to make a passionatepleato let communities make the decisions that are right for them without this added scrutiny. \u2028\u2028I had my first child a few months before the installation of these lanes and have witnessed a drastic change to how people engage with our neighbourhood. Before the bike lanes I had several cases where cars travelling at speed or without concern for pedestrians nearly ran into me pushing my child in a stroller. Since they have been added, they have not only boosted bike traffic through our area, but also introduced traffic calming measures that have decreased the speeds at which drivers engage with our community. Because they are now travelling slower, they have been more likely to notice the other humans that are walking and taking part in our public spaces and stores. With it feeling safer to be a pedestrian in this neighbourhood, there has also been a noticeable upturn in the number of people out and about, even now as we are heading into the colder months. The area is feeling more vibrant, communities and connections are flourishing, and this aspect of the benefits of bike likes, the human aspect, is being overlooked by this bill.\nIf we focus on gridlock, we loose the human engagement of flourishing communities in favour of just one of the myriad of ways that we can get people to and from their destinations. Instead focusing on seeing our community as a highway to put in the rear view mirror with no regard for the people truly living within it.\nA lot of the discourse around this bill has been about drivers vs cyclists, but there are so many more ways that we can improve our city, reduce the traffic, and encourage connectedness than prioritizing separating us into metal boxes going faster and faster.\nReading this I am reminded of the musing of Rex Weyler, the founding Director of Greenpeace about how cars were the worst social engineering experiment that humanity has conducted. Instead of atomizing the limited connection we have left, let's focus our efforts on looking each other in the eye.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic has long been an issue in Ontario, especially in the GTA.  There is a finite amount of space available to roads and the available space is already in use.  Personal automobiles which make up a significant portion of traffic are horribly space inefficient; the space the car takes for what is oftentimes a single occupant is very large.\nThe space efficiency of public transit, cycling and walking is significantly better, not to mention greener and more economical.  Cycling and walking have the added benefit of being healthier.\nAt times such as these when traffic is more of an issue then ever and when we have an affordability crisis and climate change, we should be encouraging and embracing cycling as part of a strategy to reduce congestion by means of getting people out of their cars and onto public transit, bikes or their feet.\nCycling is cheap, healthy, and quick to get around for short of long distances with the aid of public transit. Cycling is significantly more space efficient than private cars.\nUnfortunately cyclists are vulnerable when sharing the road with vehicles weighing 2 tonnes or more.  Having cycling infrastructure, especially protected cycling lanes, is paramount to getting more people out of cars for all or part of their journey.  Expanding and improving cycling infrastructure is a significant step towards increasing comfort levels for cyclists which in turn facilitates more people to choose a bike over a car, or possibly use a bike in conjunction with public transit.\nThe City of Toronto has made significant steps towards keeping people moving by expanding cycling infrastructure.  Bikes are everywhere in the city, all throughout the year.  The infrastructure is well used and usage improves as the cycling network is expanded and upgraded.\nTo rip out critical cycling infrastructure, hitting tax payers with the installation AND removal, is crazy.  To give preferential treatment to cars which are expensive both privately (purchase, insurance, fuel, maintenance, etc) and publicly (roads, emissions, etc), take up huge amounts of space per occupant and create significant emissions is kind mind boggling.\nThere's no evidence ripping out bike lanes or limiting future installations will help ease congestion.  In contrast, there is much reason to believe cycling infrastructure will help give people options AND ease congestion.\nThe Ontario government should not limit municipalities in planning cycling infrastructure, nor should the Ontario government force cycling infrastructure to be removed.\n"

The cyclists, especially the food delivery e-bikes, will continue to use main streets because that it where businesses and restaurants are. So, by removing the bike lanes, it does not mean a lane will be returned to cars. It means cars will have to travel behind bikes or attempt to pass cyclists. Either way, cyclists' commutes will be more unsafe. The Ontario government will be responsible for the injuries and deaths of cyclists on main arteries where bike lanes once existed.\n"
