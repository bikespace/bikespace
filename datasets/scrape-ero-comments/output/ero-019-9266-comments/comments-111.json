It seems the priority of the current government is to grandstand for their base, but there are severe implications for these vulnerable road users Intermingled with car traffic.\nI fall into both categories. I drive a car and I ride a bike. I can see the balance needed but removing critical bike lanes on major roads that actually present realistic route options for leaving cars behind is backwards thinking. I for one am one of those people who no longer uses their car because bikes present a viable alternative that also impacts my health positively.\nIt seems as though this solution both affects transportation and healthcare. I have trouble seeing the value of removing bike lanes that can\u2019t truly be replaced by car lanes for the use of political finger-pointing, base inflammation, or dead-cat swinging.\n"

This wastes the original tax funds to create them, and more money to have them removed. Stop it already with the waste!\nWe have plenty of highway room. More public transportation that is both reliable and frequent will naturally reduce the cars on the road. The municipalities know what their areas need, and they should be encouraged to continue to lead in these initiatives with support from the Ontario gov.\nThere are electric bikes now for those who require less effort.\nStop wasting our hard earned money on reversals, and anti-climate projects to reward Ford\u2019s developer friends.\n"

Removing these will add bikes to the already chaotic situation to the e-bikes, motorcycles, and pedestrians all trying to get around my car. Why is Toronto moving backwards? Why is our mayor not being able to make these decisions? I trust her over Doug ford any day of the week, at least we know she has our back.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes will only shift cyclists into the traffic lanes and cause more traffic.\nThe most congested streets in Toronto have no bike lanes on or near them and they're generally congested because of parking on main corridors, drivers blocking the box, drivers ignoring \"no left turn\" signs during rush hour, entitled drivers using active lanes as loading zones, and the Gardiner acting as a bottleneck causing traffic to back up far into the city.\nAs a driver, and transit rider, I have to say that removing bike lanes is the biggest overreach and worst idea this government has had so far - and there have been a lot of bad ideas.\n"

Cars are scary.\nCan we have Doug use the bike lanes before he decides to block all of them across Ontario?\nCan we send Doug on a European vacation so he can see how nice it can be?\nThe average cost of a car in Ontario is $1,300/month. That\u2019s money that could be spent on something that could last, or at least something enjoyable. The value of a car is burnt up, shipped to oil producing countries and we\u2019re left with scrap 15 years later.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a benefit to reducing traffic. As bike lanes take up less space then a car lane, and provide a separate flow for slower moving bikes, they reduce congestion and increase traffic flow.\nThe alternative of bikes taking an entire lane will only increase Gridlock and cost me more time, as for their safety and mine, they would be taking up an entire lane.\nThis bill is counter to its goal and we should be aiming to reduce cars on roads to reduce gridlock, instead of disincentivizing bikes. This could look like increased bike lanes, increased frequency and availability of public transit and reduced fares to incentivize it's use and promoting walkable cities, to reduce the need for cars, which will reduce traffic and gridlock and save me more time.\nHaving affordable and more frequent public transit would save me the most time, as I could be doing something else (emails, bill payments, organizational tasks) during my commute instead of it being spent paying attention to the road.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding this proposal ERO #019-9266\nI am an avid cyclist. I work in the bike industry as a technician. I have seen so many bikes that have come into our shop because some driver ran over the bike. Now this government is planning to take away bike lanes and add more driving lanes? This is not going to reduce gridlock, as it has been historically proven in so many other countries over the years. Holland once tried to build their way out of gridlock this way, and their experiment failed miserably. More gridlock, more pollution, less money into the local economy (aka mom n pop shops) and a decline in the health of the population which put a strain on their health care system until it could no longer stand the strain and broke down. Much like our health care system is on the verge of failure, and yet this government wants to add more strain onto it with even more unhealthy people who don't exercise? Ludicrous! We need to get more people moving on safe streets, complete streets, where everyone's needs are met in a safe way. Painted lines on the road are not an answer either as they have been proven ineffective over time. Curb extensions that force cyclists out into main flow of traffic are just using human beings as traffic calming measures. What is needed, is to build more complete streets, to build communities that can have safe infrastructure for all users, not just the select ones in metal cages.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not have a hand in how Toronto's streets are managed. Most notably, a government that does not understand that more car lanes and highways does not equate less congestion. The addition of bike lanes in major cities, like Toronto, provides a safe, affordable and necessary alternate to driving or the limited TTC. Congestion is inevitable given the rampant construction in the GTA and having bike lanes allows people to actually get where they need to go; you have only to look at the huge spike in use of Toronto Bike Share over the last few years to recognize the importance of keeping bike lanes. Closing down major intersections and through-roads within the city for years (Example: Queen and Yonge, previously Adelaide), has significant consequences on traffic. But as ever, the provincial government and supporters like to see the bikes that can move freely as the problem. The proposal to just keep adding car lanes is once again missing the forest for the trees.\n"

I commute to clients using GO Transit and a bicycle.\nHome is in Streetsville/Mississauga.\nMy clients are scattered throughout the GTA - from downtown Toronto, Don Mills, downtown Hamilton, Thornhill, Beaches, South Kingsway and others over the years.\nCrossing the 401 any time during the week is generally trying on my patience and sanity due to volume and watching out for other drivers who have little regard for respect for space.  The 407 is insanely expensive.  Compared to other toll highways on the continent, its goal would seem to be lining the pockets of its owners more than giving a viable bypass to the 401.\nCity cycling infrastructure along with regional transit is a godsend.\nFor my health and mental health.   Toronto, Hamilton  and Mississauga have been proactively putting it where it's needed and uptake has be steadily increasing.\nI have very little desire to return to driving and adding my own vehicle to the jam-up of cars and trucks vying for what little space there was before bike lanes were built.\n"
