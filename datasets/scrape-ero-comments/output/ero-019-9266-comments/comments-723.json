        "comment": "I would like to publicly oppose this bill as it is absolutely a step in the wrong direction. It is misguided at best and deceitful at worst. There are many reasons why bike lanes in a city is a good thing but in this comment I am going to focus on the three major reasons I oppose this bill as a resident of Toronto.\nFirstly, it is a lie. Ripping apart the bike lanes will not, in the long term, better the lives of Ontarians. It will promote driving on these now four-lane roads. This isn't just a prediction. There are countless studies done that show that simply adding lanes to a road or even building more roads does not solve traffic congestion. It promotes more people to drive which brings us to the same problem that we were trying to solve. Additionally, it harms local businesses on the street that benefit from foot and bike traffic (think food delivery). It will bring more cars to these streets subjecting the residents of the streets to more air and noise pollution. And obviously, the biggest consequence of promoting more cars on the road - it will cause more deaths. More cars on streets statistically increase more fatal accidents on the impacted streets. Overall, this bill will make the lives of Ontarians only worse.\nSecondly, it goes against any sane climate change measure. We as Ontarians need to be focused on implementing policies that combat climate change, not ones that enable them. A city that promotes less driving not only makes for more beautiful spaces for people to live in but also reduces carbon emissions immensely. Green spaces and walkable cities with a focus on public transit should be the goal when developing Toronto. This bill takes a huge step backwards in this aspect.\nFinally, it fiscally makes no sense. We, Ontarians, have spent about a decade and millions of dollar of taxpayer money trying to get decent bike infrastructure in this city so that people are not forced to rely on expensive, carbon-emitting, space hogging cars. It allowed a freedom of choice to move the way we want to. It makes no sense that a conservative government is recklessly spending another $48 million to not just do something that has absolutely no benefit to Ontarians but also completely take away our freedom to choose by eliminating an entire mode of transport. This is an overreach in every aspect.\nI hope my comment was able to shed some light on how this bill harms us Ontarians in many ways. I did not even begin to go into the public health benefits of biking and how spaces built around bikes and pedestrians actually promote more of a community feeling than car-centric spaces, which can combat social science issues such as rising hate and xenophobia. I also did not go into how much I oppose the Highway 413 act which skips extremely important environmental checks before callously mowing down land to build another highway. I believe the Ontario government should instead focus on delivering projects that actually will solve the problem of traffic and congestion - Finch LRT, Eglinton Crosstown, GO Expansion and the Ontario Line.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and a cyclist I can understand the situation from both sides. As a cyclist I find the bike lanes improve safety and efficiency while biking around the city. As a driver I don't totally mind them because it keeps the cyclists separated from the traffic lanes, however as a driver I would prefer having another lane of traffic to use as roads are often congested.\nAll that being said, as a tax paying Torontonian I find it quite frustrating to have our tax dollars used to implement bike lanes, and then pay even more money to have them ripped up.\nThere isn't a perfect solution, but I don't think tearing up the bike lanes at this point is the best use of tax payer dollars. Especially with the state of infrastructure and social programs in the city.\nAdding another lane of traffic really won't help congestion a whole lot, and it makes it less appealing for cyclists to use their bikes which arguably keeps them out of cars.\nPlease reconsider using more money to reverse and already expensive inactive installing bike lanes in the first place. Let's spend those dollars on something more needed.\n"

        "comment": "This is going to be terrible for the traffic. Is it well known that adding road lanes doesn\u00b4t increase efficiency. This is known as the Braess's paradox. The cycle lanes were only installed after carefully being analyzed the impacts of their inclusion as a way to diversify the means of transportation. The removal of bike lanes will increase the congestion at best and cause deaths at worst.\nAlso, this bill removes the need to do the environmental assessment to build the 417. This is terrible and a step back towards good policies.\nFinally, it will be a waste of tax payer dollars to remove the lanes. This money could be used in the healthcare system or the education since currently it is were it is most needed\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of multiple years in the region of Old Toronto, I oppose Bill 212 in it's current form as an obtuse overreach of provincial powers in municipal matters.\nThe policy concerning bike lanes not only flies in the face of evidence-based infrastructure for transport in dense communities (such as downtown Toronto), but is also fiscally irresponsible in the long-term, as it will directly increase the amount of car traffic, decrease pedestrian and cyclist safety in the downtown core, and reduce traffic to local businesses (the frequency of business visits for pedestrians and cyclists are both greater than that of motor vehicle users, as seen in ref. 1).\nThe cost to provincial taxpayers for the removal of current cycling infrastructure in downtown Toronto would be better used towards the building of promised and much-stalled public transport infrastructure instead.\nThe removal of environmental oversight for construction projects is another reason why any Ontario resident should be opposed to this bill, as well as how incredibly opaque the current administration is in providing recent, evidence-based sources for why anything proposed in this bill is a good idea (financially or otherwise).\n"

        "comment": "I'm a cyclist. I use the bike lanes in my city. But I didn't always bike to work or to the shops downtown or to meet my friends for coffee. I only started biking to these places after I had access to safe bike lanes.\nI'm also a driver, I own my car and use it regularly. I know what it's like to sit in traffic, I know it sucks. But I don't blame the bike lanes for that. In fact I prefer having the bike lanes as a driver, I like knowing the cyclist are going to be in the bike lane and I don't have to worry about passing them.\nBike lanes are safer for everyone, not just cyclist but drivers and pedestrian as well. Please reconsider bill 212, keep adding bike lanes and please do not remove what little progress we have made.\n"

        "comment": "This entire bill is an abuse of power and democratic procedures. There should be no exemptions to environmental reviews or policies for construction of any infrastructure. Expropriations are should not just be at the random decision of a government minister but subject to all existing unaltered regulations.\nChanges to biking and any infrastructure vulnerable users should be enhanced or expanded, not removed at a uninformed and/or random decision of any provincial government official or minister. This infrastructure is and should remain the responsibility of municipal and local authorities and be based on a variety and comprehensive inputs from concerned and affected parties. This not be an over-reach by the provincial government. Local groups and elected local councils are the best decision makers in this regard.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic, driven by car use in Toronto is horrific. Cycling is often the most efficient way to traverse the city. In order to be a world class city we should be investing in making Toronto a safer, more connected place for cyclists. Not only does it take cars off of roads, it\u2019s good for people\u2019s health and the environment at large too. Removing infrastructure that supports cyclists is damaging on a number of levels when we should be investing more to expand the cycling network for a safer, greener and less congested city.\n"

It\u2019s appalling that it\u2019s cheaper for one person to drive from Toronto to Montreal than it is to take a train!  It\u2019s appalling that people lose their lives cycling in Toronto!

        "comment": "This proposal is completely misguided. If you're trying to reduce the number of cars on the road, and hence reduce gridlock and pollution, bicycle lanes are a great way to do it. The more safe and convenient you make it for people to take bicycles as an alternate means of transportation, the more people WILL take their bikes. The reverse is true as well. If it's not safe to ride your bicycle, you're going to get back in your car. PLEASE don't take away the bike lanes!!! Wouldn't those millions be better spent on a crisis like health care?\n"

According to witnesses and  police the bike and I went flying into a concrete post face first.  I  then hit the ground and witnesses told the police that they thought that I was dead.  But I stood back up and the witnesses declared Oh, she's not dead!\nI sustained several injuries the most serious of which was facial trauma requiring 12 laser procedures  over a period of about 3 years,  to remove concrete that had become imbedded into my face.  These lasers were not covered by OHIP.  My accident was a hit and run but I sued the Gov't Superintendent and won.   They paid for all expenses including a facial protection helmut to protect my face (I was wearing a regular helmut at the time of the accident), as well as financial compensation for pain and suffering.  I had home care for almost a year.\nOne way or another gov't will end up paying for bike road safety , or lack of it.\n"
