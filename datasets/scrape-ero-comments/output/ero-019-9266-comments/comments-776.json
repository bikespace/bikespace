Let's keep them as is.\nAdvice for Mayor Chow and anyone who thinks replacing a whole traffic lane with a bike lane is good idea\n- try driving your car on Bloor street during peak traffic hours to experience with what we face everyday\n- pull some stats on bike lanes installed on Bloor street in the last year\n- seek public input the next time you make a rash decision like this and end up wasting a lot of tax payers money and time\n"

Bloor St used to have a bit of a rush hour in the morning and again in the afternoon.  NOW, it\u2019s almost all day long with traffic stopped and fumes emitted while waiting to creep along due to the HUGELY underused bike lanes!  And people are having trouble finding parking for their medical, dental, and other services. Lord help the seniors who are trying to get to Kingsway Fish and Chips, All Saints Church and all the other retailers and services in Bloor Kingsway and Bloor West. The Old Mill Bridge configuration is one of the stupidest things to observe. The bike lanes are HUGELY UNDER USED.\nOur street, Prince Edward N has become busier than ever, as drivers look for an expedited way to get westerly to Royal York, Islington, or beyond.  Ditto those heading easterly.\nI would be happy to donate the $200 I am to receive as rebate in the new year, and put towards the bike lane removal cost!\n"

        "comment": "To Whom it May Concern,\nWe are writing to express our concerns regarding Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, particularly in relation to its implications for active transportation initiatives in the Town of Halton Hills. The core concept of this legislation raises concerns about the balance between vehicular traffic flow and the promotion of active transportation and sustainable commuting options. While the intent may be to address gridlock, there is a risk that this approach could inadvertently impact efforts to create a more integrated and accessible transportation network that encourages cycling and walking. The potential limitations on developing bike lanes, particularly where they might require the removal of traffic lanes, could present challenges to municipalities striving to enhance their active transportation infrastructure. The Town of Halton Hills has the following comments:\n1-\tPotential Conflict with National and Provincial Strategies\nThe bill contradicts the Federal National Active Transportation Strategy 2021-2026 and the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, as outlined in the OPPI statement. These frameworks emphasize the importance of promoting active transportation rather than discouraging it.\n2-\tTailored Approach for Different Jurisdictions\nThe one-size-fits-all approach proposed in Bill 212 lacks efficiency for jurisdictions with varying populations and traffic congestion levels. For instance, removing a traffic lane on lower volume roads in smaller cities or towns like Halton Hills may not significantly impact vehicular Level of Service. Instead of implementing general rules, it would be more effective to establish specific criteria, such as AADT or road LOS thresholds, to determine when lane removal for bike lanes is appropriate. This approach would better accommodate the diverse needs of different municipalities while still promoting active transportation.\n3-\tPotential Counterproductive Effects on Congestion Management\nProper congestion management necessitates a modal shift towards alternative sustainable transportation options. By imposing additional provincial approval layers for adding bike lanes, we risk increasing congestion by not promoting safe and dedicated cycling facilities. This approach undermines the objectives outlined in our ATMP.\n4-\tClarification on Key Terms and Criteria\nSeveral aspects of Bill 212 require further clarification to ensure proper understanding and implementation, such as:\n\u2022\tWhat constitutes \"Prescribed Municipalities\" under this bill?\n\u2022\tHow is an \"Existing Lane of traffic\" defined? Does this include center turn lanes (TWLTL) and/or parking lanes?\n\u2022\tWhat are the specific \"criteria for approval\" for bike lane installations?\nClear definitions and guidelines are crucial for municipalities to effectively navigate the proposed approval process and understand the bill's implications for their transportation planning efforts.\n\u2022\tThe criteria established must prioritize safety, connectivity, and accessibility rather than vehicle flow at the expense of cyclist safety.\n5-\tLong-Term Impacts of Not properly Implementing Bike Lanes\nAvoiding the removal of traffic lanes to implement bike lanes or getting provincial approval that seems a long process may seem to preserve road capacity for vehicles in the short term. However, this approach fails to recognize that extra capacity on roads tends to be quickly filled by single-occupancy vehicles over time, a phenomenon known as induced demand. Meanwhile, the opportunity to provide safe and connected active transportation facilities is lost.\n6-\tConflict with Current Plans for Bike Lanes\nCurrently, the Town has planned a potential removal of a traffic lane along Argyll Road to accommodate buffered bike lanes as per the Council-approved Active Transportation Master Plan (ATMP). However, further analysis and feasibility reviews should be conducted to explore the possibility of implementing separate facilities.\n7-\tBurden of Data Collection Requirements\nThe proposed mandatory data collection requirements are resource-intensive and costly for smaller municipalities, which could hinder their ability to implement active transportation initiatives effectively.\n"

I hope for an expedited process on the removal of the bike lanes as I'm tired of sitting in unnecessary traffic.\nOn Parkside Drive, Toronto, a major vehicle artery, there is a plan to put in bike lanes. I don't understand their purpose as cyclists may use High Park or a side street, Indian Road, to travel north and south. Again, no common sense but very outspoken, vocal, organized, bike lobbyists.\nThank you Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is terrible and a giant step backwards for Ontario.\nBike lanes are a municipal matter, not a provincial matter. The province should not be involved in municipal matters as it has no expertise or experience in municipal affairs. Case-in-point, the province led a survey that indicated higher numbers of people biking to work that the Premier and Minister of Transportation are quoting (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/province-led-survey-suggests-higher-cy\u2026). Presuming the higher number wasn\u2019t suppressed intentionally to fit an agenda, how is the province to dictate municipal affairs, if it doesn\u2019t even know its own survey numbers on the topic?\nBased on my understanding, the province will create criteria regarding where bike lanes can go, and where they will be removed, but regardless of this criteria, which hasn\u2019t been created yet, certain bike lanes are already slated to be removed. The decision to remove bike lanes in Toronto has not been based on science or studies, but personal animosity by Premier Doug Ford.\nThe permanent bike lanes around the Annex in Toronto have been under construction for years and are now complete or near complete. This bill to remove the bike lanes would mean years more construction to remove and create more gridlock with the added construction. The construction started during the Covid pandemic, which means that to remove them, it will take us to almost the 2030s for completion? This bill will create gridlock.\nConstruction contributes significantly to gridlock, however as the premier has \u2018connections\u2019 to developers (see Auditor General\u2019s report regarding Greenbelt), construction related gridlock is not being considered as one of the main issues of gridlock, not bike lanes.\nIf bike lanes are removed, where will the cyclists go? There are no secondary roads that make any sense to travel on, as there are no continuous routes. This was why through thorough planning, the City of Toronto selected the streets where bike lanes should go. Is there any secondary roads that a bike lane can be added instead of the streets this bill will remove them from that won\u2019t result in a lane of traffic being removed? That answer appears to be no. Cyclists will still use the same roads, just without protection. This will mean cars will need to change lanes to pass cyclists which in heavy traffic creates more opportunity for collisions, between cars, cyclists and pedestrians.\nAs a pedestrian bike lanes make me feel safer as it provides a buffer between the sidewalk and the road.\nIs bike lane removal just a distraction for the removal of the requirement for an Environmental Assessment for highway 413? I will sneak this into the end, just as the bill is sneaking this Environmental Assessment removal through.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Bloor West Village area, and I'm a serious recreational cyclist as well as a driver. The bike lanes that have been installed along Bloor Street West have led to a big increase in traffic gridlock in my area, and particularly around the intersection of Bloor and Jane, and Bloor and South Kingsway. As a passionate cyclist, I'm not against bike lanes at all, but they don't belong on every street in the city. As well, the Bloor West bike lanes are practically a 'ghost town' for at least 6 months of the year (November to April) because of the weather. The City of Toronto needs to have more common sense when deciding where to install these lanes, and I find myself supporting Bill 212 to have them removed from Bloor Street West because of that.\n"

        "comment": "As a Professional Planner practicing in Ontario, with more than 40 years of experience,including seven years as Toronto's Chief Planner,  I'd like to register my opposition to Bill 212.   I fully subscribe to the submission from the Ontario Professional Planners Institute and will not repeat their comments specifically.\nIn my experience, North American cities are trending toward smarter choices around urban planning which is building back choice in how we live and work -- learning lessons from immediate post war planning which separated land uses, was more primarily designed around the car and had less regard for climate impacts and socially inclusivity.   Smarter choices today are about building cities for the 21st century which blend land uses, design mobility around all modes of travel and make sustainable and inclusive choices about design.  It plays out sometimes differently in dense urban, suburban and regional contexts and of course, people live, work and move around in all contexts.  Bike lanes, as just one example of change in our city, are going to be easier to accommodate where there is more space and choices can be made without compromising safety and the  vitality of streets.  As Toronto evolves, these choices about where and how to best locate bike lanes in different contexts is best left to local decision making to mediate interests and navigate choices.   The ballot box at the local level is the best place to determine whether these interests have been appropriately considered.\nIndeed, political choice often intertwines with how we plan cities -- planning is inherently political.  Famously, Premier Davis in 1971 chose a direction for the Spadina Expressway -- stating that \"the streets belong to the people\" after saying \"we are building a transportation system to serve people\".   The current government has already earned high praise for finally advancing a much more sophisticated public transit network for the 21st century.   It would be consistent and a great contribution to that legacy if the government continued Premier Davis's now 50 year old belief, especially where space is so finite.  Our streets were always about so much more than just cars passing through.\nThank you for considering this submission.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the High Park neighbourhood.  I walk or run Bloor Street between Jane St and Dundas on a regular basis as part of my exercise routine and I count the bicycles in the bike lanes each time.  On average during the last six weeks, there have not been more than 7 actual bikes in the lanes, in either direction, on any given day. This does not jibe with the data that the city provides at the meetings I have attended on the subject nor what they provide the media so that information is distorted or a purposeful lie.  There may be uber electric bikes in the lanes a certain times of the day-mornings and evenings-but we do not pay our taxes to support private enterprises delivering goods.  I also believe electric bikes in these lanes are dangerous.  Electric scooters and other similar devices are illegal and should not be allowed on the roads, bike lanes and sidewalks.  I submit that the reasons the city wasted our money to install bike lanes without valid consultation or referendum, constitutes a violation of the mandate we have provided and that the mayor and the councilor representing Parkdale-High Park must be held responsible and removed from office for supporting this fraudulent use of city resources.  Now we must spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove the bike lanes in order to get the traffic moving again.\n"

It does not make any sense to remove already built infrastructure for no good reason and that it will cost so much to remove perfectly good infrastructure.

I appreciate when cyclists have a protected bike lane when I drive so I don\u2019t have to second guess how much room to leave them when I pass and I don\u2019t have to go into an oncoming traffic lane. It\u2019s an efficient use of space for the roads to have to accommodate so many modalities.\nThis is truly appalling and makes absolutely no sense.

Paying money to take out bike infrastructure that saves lives and provides alternatives to driving (something that the provincial government should be doing and has done to an extent with transit investments) does not make much sense to me at all. Further, adding in bureaucracy that municipalities will have to deal with when looking at increasing mobility options for cities across Ontario will result in inefficiencies at both the municipal and provincial level, something this provincial government does not typically agree with. All this being said, I very much hope this framework does not get passed, bike lanes are kept, and we can continue to build safe streets across the province.\n"
