        "comment": "The proposed legislation restricting municipalities to make decisions within their domain is regressive, political overreach and idealogically driven with no basis in fact.\nNumerous studies and evidentiary findings have show time and again the bike lanes (and the removal of lanes of traffic) are not major contributors to congestion globally, and within the context of toronto. Conversely, it has also been shown that the addition of lanes for vehicles does not have a substantive impact on congestion reduction.\nSpeaking specifically to the bike lanes mentioned by the Premier (Yonge, Bloor, and University) removal of those lanes would be a significant detriment to the businesses and safety to all road users. In my neighborhood (M4T postal code), Mt. Pleasant and Avenue Rd are dangerous to cross as a pedestrian, ride on as a cyclist, and for driving given limited to no adherance to speed limits, and little enforcement. Moreover, I and others purposefully avoid these streets to recreate on or go to businesses because of the speed and volume of traffic. Should the bike lane on bloor be removed, many patrons would cease to walk into these businesses. This is, again, data driven.\nI recommend that the government focus on pressing concerns instead of flagrant overreach and identity politics.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about the proposed legislation from the Ontario government that would deny municipalities the ability to install new bike lanes on major streets without provincial approval. If passed, the new rules would severely limit municipalities\u2019 ability to protect all road users, fight climate change, and ease congestion. I strongly encourage the Province to work collaboratively with municipalities on solutions instead of undermining them.\nAll of our municipalities are struggling to address road safety, congestion and its negative impacts on local economies, public health, and the environment. Limiting their options - and forcing them to seek provincial approval for local decisions - will only make the situation worse and create more time-consuming government red tape, and worse, will lead to an increase in traffic fatalities. Bike lanes allow more people to travel in less road space, in addition to improving safety for all road users. Municipalities in Ontario need the power to implement the Transportation Master Plans they have developed for their context.\nI call on the provincial government to respect local decision-making and walk back this poorly considered proposal, which could lock Ontario into years of unsafe roads, heavy traffic, and worsening air pollution.\n"

Kudos for recognizing that our city has become a laughing stock to comedians and celebrities when they visit our great city not to mention the tourists and the residents.  Emergency vehicle response times are beyond reason. With all the proposed developments, Cafe TO and under use of the bike lines in addition to their entire lack of use in the winters, there has to be COMMON SENSE.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill put forward with the intention to remove protected bike lanes and prevent bike lanes from being implemented by local communities if they do not meet the requirements of the Provincial Ministry of Transportation is a huge step in the wrong direction. Protected bike lanes make our developed urban environments better by promoting a more efficient and safer method of transportation, that is compatible with successful and pleasant human environments. While for the more suburban environments, protected bike lanes provide residents an opportunity to access ammenities, with close to zero transportation costs, that might otherwise be out of their walking reach but still close enough to be easily doable by bike ( 2km to 5km are distances that can be biked under 15 minutes at a relaxed pace). Providing better alternatives to driving is the only sustainable way of freeing up congestion from our roads while making our streets safer places to be in.\nCongestion in our developed urban areas (such as Downtown Toronto) is a sign of success as it tells us that the built environment has succeeded in creating destinations that lots of people want to frequent, this by necessity means that the streets will have to naturally carry slower vehicular traffic as otherwise it would be impossible for a destination to be pleasant to the people in it. It is fundamentally incompatible and impossible for a street to be both a place where private vehicles can go through really fast while also being a platform for building wealth and developing human life.\nA productive solution for this kind of congestion is to create more powerful destinations throughout the province that people want to visit and live in so that excess demand can be relieved from Downtown Toronto, the provincial government can achieve this by changing land use regulations to legalize missing middle housing forms and mixed-use zoning for every lot in every urban area in the province.\nCongestion in our through roads network and suburban areas are a symptom of the built environment not being dense and mixed-use enough to mitigate the need for every resident to drive in order to meet their every day needs and live close to work. In addition to the last solution, a productive solution to reduce this kind of congestion is to improve the alternatives to driving so that travel times can be anchored thanks to the alternatives and Ontarians can have true freedom of choice for their transportation needs.\nSome practical measures and projects the provincial government can implement are: completing existing transit expansion projects as fast as possible (particularly with GO Service expansion so that all existing lines can have all-day two-day 15 minute service); build a cross GTA GO Line possibly along the existing CNR alignment south of the 407 that starts at Bramalea GO and ends in Pickering GO; expand the Sheppard Line Subway Eastward to the Rouge National Park and Westward to Pearson Airport; and fully fund the TTC's State-of-Good-Repair capital program so that existing subways and streetcars can run to their maximum capacity.\nI urge the government and our representatives to bring down this bill, if it is passed then it will only result in more traffic congestion and cyclists dying in our streets from lack of safe protected biking infrastructure\n"

        "comment": "I believe the restriction and possibly the reduction of bike lanes in busy areas is opposing the target to reduce grid lock. I for one, use my bike and shared bikes for mostly all my trips around downtown Toronto and find the current situation very dangerous as most roads do not have a protected bike lane, and every time I have the chance to chose which method of transportation to use I always have to consider if the route there is safe enough and most of the time the answer is no. Which forces me to revert to driving or using a car service.\nIn conclusion removing the option and not working on improving the current bike lane infrastructure will just result in more people resorting to driving including myself.\nAnd as its common knowledge most of the major cities in Europe and even North Americas that are not having comparable congestion issues do have a much better transit system and bike lane infrastructure.\nI believe this is a counter productive measure that will just make things worse for drivers and everyone else on the road as we can not create demand for other means of transportation by removing their infrastructure.\n"

But I guess that's why they want to make cycling less safe...\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a resident of Ontario to express my strong opposition to any proposal that may lead to the elimination of bike lanes in our communities. Instead, I urge the province to increase its investment in expanding and improving bike lane infrastructure as a sustainable, healthy, and economically beneficial alternative to driving.\n1. Environmental and Health Benefits\nBike lanes reduce reliance on cars, directly lowering greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to cleaner air in our communities. They promote active transportation, which improves public health by encouraging regular physical activity, ultimately reducing healthcare costs.\n2. Traffic Reduction and Safety\nDeveloping safe, well-maintained bike lanes helps alleviate traffic congestion and enhances road safety for all users, including drivers. By providing clear, designated spaces for cyclists, we can reduce conflicts on the road and create a safer environment for pedestrians and motorists alike.\n3. Economic and Community Advantages\nInvesting in bike lanes fosters local business growth. Studies have shown that cyclists are more likely to stop and shop locally, boosting economic activity. Additionally, developing a connected bike network helps attract talent and tourism to Ontario, strengthening our communities and economy.\nIn summary, eliminating bike lanes would be a step backward for Ontario. Instead, I urge the government to prioritize the expansion of bike-friendly infrastructure as a means of building a healthier, more sustainable, and economically vibrant province.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes may be good on some streets, but not on the too narrow and steeply-sloping Yonge St.\nWe have witnessed excessive gridlock on the stretchn of Yonge St between St. Clair and Bloor Sts. The steeply-sloping grade is dangerous and cyclists, scooters, and electric bikes go *far* too fast and endanger pedestrians crossing at the lights. The cyclists often wear no helmets and seem to obey no traffic signals. This problem is worse in the dark, winter and ice conditions.\nLast week I saw two near tragic accidents due to cyclists going so fast on the downslope near Yonge and St Clair that they could not stop. One hit a young pregnant woman who was crossing on a green light, and knocked her to the ground with such force she screamed and was crying with pain. This is putting innocent residents at risk.\nThe previous week I saw a cyclist not able to stop for a turning vehicle and he crashed to the ground at Yonge and Farnham Avenie and needed Emergency crews.\nExcessive speed of cyclists and scooter operators is a risk to pedestrians, and has made our communities less safe. Cyclists appear to follow no traffic rules.\nBike lanes should not be built on some streets, like this section of Yonge St. in midtown.\n"

        "comment": "I am a frequent user of bike lanes. They allow me to navigate my neighborhood and the larger downtown core with ease of mind, knowing that I'm less likely to be run over by a vehicle. I am completely opposed to this additional level of bureaucracy that would greatly hinder the installment of bike lanes across this city. This over step is particularly egregious given that this year alone 6 bicyclists have died.\nI do not believe a single life is worth shaving a few minutes off of people's commutes. The only way to reduce gridlock is by improving transit since study after study has shown more lanes do NOT reduce gridlock in the longer term. The only scalable way to move 5+ million people in and around the downtown core is through transit, bike and walking as a primary mode of transportation while cars are used as a secondary mode.\n"

        "comment": "Requiring bicyle lanes to be approved by the Ministry is overstepping from the Province. Bicycle lanes in a City is a municipal jurisdiction and not a provincial one.\nRemoving bike lanes will NOT fight gridlock. There is traffic jams in areas where there are no bike lanes. If you remove bike lanes, cyclists will still use it and it will create confusion on the roads and won't address gridlock.\nTo address gridlock, it needs to consider the number of CARS on the roads and construction jobs that take away street space. In order to reduce the amount of cars on the roads, the Province, in collaboration with municipalities, should diversify ways to move in the City, by funding public transit (for instance) and enourage biking. Every cyclist on the lanes could represent a car less on the road, so removing lanes may be counterproductive. By removing lanes, you can create more gridlock, do not create equitable streets, ignore diverse ways of moving, and prevent people their freedom and safety for biking, which is a sustainable means to move and can help fight climate change.\nBill 212 will do more harm than it will do good.\n"

Having the separated bike lanes with physical barriers makes everyone feel so much safer. The painted white lines are a great step but don\u2019t make it safe. So many people feel so much more comfortable riding with a separated bike lane compared to the painted line where drivers can\u2019t leave there lane and run into you which happens almost daily.

        "comment": "I believe that in Toronto a full assessment should be made of the bike lane system on principal throughfares such as Yonge Street, Bloor/Danforth and University Avenue . Yonge Street from Bloor St to north of St Clair is a particularly egregious example . Most seriously,  the lanes reductions have made it virtually impossible for emergency vehicles to get up the street . The bike lobby argues that bike lanes will encourage people to leave their cars at home and ride thereby reducing pollution. But bike lanes on major through streets like Yonge and Bloor preversely have the opposite effect. Gridlock is created and vehicles run and idle for much longer producing much greater emissions for the same distance travelled.\nWhile bike lanes are a signficant issue,  not to be forgotten in Toronto is so called CafeTO, a holdover from Covid which allows restaurants to block a lane of traffice to expand their seating for the summer . This has the same effect as bike lanes when on a major thoroughfare\n"

        "comment": "This is the opposite of the solution required to provent congestion. Bikes reduce so much traffic by the volume that 1 person takes up on a bike versus in a car. People will be biking with cars if this chance goes through slowing down the lane and creating danger that only exist for the biker, as the driver of a car is safe. This is so far from a movement meant to take our country into the future and would be laughed at by countries who have a healthy biking and walking culture.\n"

The biggest change is every day I see people doing their shopping, taking their kids to school and back, older people, new Canadians etc etc riding alongside the Lycra clad peloton types. These bike lanes have increase the sense of local community and empowered many folks to get out of their cars to engage in a healthier mode of transportation.  Look how successful the city bike program is.\nI know you are pandering for votes but you will literally be buying votes from people who\u2019d already vote for your party at the cost of the safety and even the lives of people who live in the affected communities all while not doing a single thing to improve traffic because the cause of traffic is cars. Cars with only one person on them, by and large, who are often speeding, drinking, on drugs, distracted on their phones. These are the people you should be targeting.

Bike lanes have been proven to be a great way to improve congestion problems, to add income to businesses, to raise property values, to make our streets safer, and so much more. This goes completely against your policies of reducing red-tape and you are completely over-stepping your powers over cities. This will not reduce congestion one bit. If you want to reduce congestion you'll invest into more efficient modes of transportation like bikes, public transportation, better pedestrian infrastructure, etc...\nAnd then to add on to this you are trying to bypass environmental studies to jam through your highway proposal that will not solve any of the problems. Environmental studies are there for a reason, not for you to completely ignore them because your plans are terrible. Again, invest into public transportation if you want to solve congestion problems in that corridor, not more highways which have literally never once solved congestion.\n"
