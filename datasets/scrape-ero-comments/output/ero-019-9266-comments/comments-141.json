This is especially true in areas adjacent to major roads which this bill is targetting.\nIncreasing the traffic on these roads will increase the air-pollution.\nBill 212 will increase the risk of premature mortality from heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.   An assessment of these risks must be taken to protect the health of the impacted Ontarians.\nNegligence in this on the part of the Government of Ontario opens us up to potential litigation.\n"

Why doesn\u2019t my provincial government care about my safety as a cyclist? Further, city councils are best placed to make decisions about bike lanes and traffic flow, rather than a remote provincial government in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This policy has been created in opposition to all of the data showing how bike lanes improve overall transit within a city. Beyond this issue though, bike lanes without a doubt create a safer environment for all road users. Canada saw an average of 74 cyclists deaths per year between 2006 and 2017, 73% of which were the result of a collision with a motor vehicle. Having designated infrastructure for cyclists reduces the amount of interaction they will have with cars, trucks, busses, etc. Cyclist casualties will be on the hands of the Government of Ontario due to this policy.\n"

The city has finally started to feel safe to bike around.\nRemoving the bike lanes is focusing on the wrong issue. We should be concerned about attacking the root of the problem and that is traffic which is caused by too many CARS on the roads. We need a focus on public transit, walkability & bike lanes.\n1. Making neighborhoods walkable by promoting grocery retail and small business throughout the city.\n2. Investing in Public Transit.  We all know people are not impressed by the cities current transit system, if the government would invest the money into Transit maybe they would have the ability to work towards a better system. It's not just about more subway lines and busses but making the ones we have feel safer. In order to have people monitoring these public spaces it costs money. INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSIT\n3. Bike Lanes: These are so important - they keep cars off the road and reduce transit. INVEST IN BIKE SHARE make it more affordable for residence or at least more affordable for low income people. Like the GO Train create a free transfer system from bike share to TTC services.\nThe money that would go towards removing the bike lanes should go toward public services. Millions have been spent building them and to just spend millions to tear them down is nonsense. This has become a purely political move by the conservative government and gross overstepping of the provincial government on municipal government.\n"

        "comment": "I disapprove of this legislation. Bike lanes help reduce gridlock and should be expanded, not reduced. Ripping out existing ones is a waste of money. The idea of having the minister of transportation personally approved municipal bike lanes seems to me to be provincial overreaching and also incredibly inefficient when there are other transportation related issues like the delays and issues with various LRT systems across the province to deal with. Highway 413 should not be expedited at the expense of checks and necessary regulations.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThis is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirst, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nb) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nKind regards.\n"

Why should anyone agree to a contract or law where the terms are not defined and seemingly arbitrary.\nThe provincial government has talked about too much over reach and wanting a small government. Yet this bill is the very same government overreaching & meddling in municipal affairs. Doug Ford opposes the federal government meddling in Ontario's healthcare strategy, this is no different.\nOntario government says they will pay for all this, but claim there is no money for teachers or healthcare workers.\n"

        "comment": "Closing bike lanes will make gridlock worse. You can fit far more people into bike lanes than into cars on roads.\nClosing lanes also doesn\u2019t stop people biking, but it will make it far less safe to do so. With rising costs of living in this city many bike because to own a car and to park is not a bearable expense.\nLastly, I would recommend the minister to reconsider his comments that biking is not accessible to everyone. First, accessibility has many definitions including having the socioeconomic resources to access a service. In this regard there are far higher barriers to entry into a car market that make cycling far more accessible. Second, how many people for whom there is an accessibility challenge in cycling would there be any less of a challenge in driving a car? I can\u2019t imagine many - and for those whom it is easier to drive a car, we should be encouraging more cycling and public transit from those who can such that they have a benefit or reduced traffic on the roads.\nThis bill is awful. Leave control of cities to the municipalities that only have to consider their interests and can tailor policy and rule to best fit the needs of the city, not take this one size fits all parts of the province approach that a provincial bill would create.\n"

These bike lanes have significantly improved traffic flow and safety by providing dedicated space for cyclists, keeping them out of fast-moving car lanes. Eliminating them not only endangers cyclists but also risks increasing congestion as bikes and cars are forced to share the same space again. I urge provincial officials to reconsider this short-sighted move and recognize the long-term benefits that proper bike infrastructure brings to our city.\n"

Bike commuters often don't own cars and may not have other options to get to work/school. They frequently fear for their safety every day when infrastructure is not appropriate.\nI'm sure the department officials know all this, but I hope they can convince the political staffers that this issue is not a vote winner and Ontarians can see through these cynical policies.\n"

Please reconsider your position!\n"
