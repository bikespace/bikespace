MANY studies have shown that adding bike lanes decreases gridlock and I think Doug Ford actually knows this. Do some very basic research into it (try \"induced demand\" for starters) before you even get to this phase of the process please! Myopic would be the least offensive way to frame this idea.\n"

Cycling is an important activity for reducing traffic, improving health, and reducing our carbon use and combatting climate change. We need more bikelanes, not less. We need downtown cores where CARS are banned. Cars kill people. Bicycles don't.\n"

Removing already installed bike infrastructure makes no sense and it certainly doesn\u2019t make common sense. It is a waste. The environmental protections that will be removed as a result of passing this legislation will further deteriorate Ontarios environment and will lead to greater environmental harm. Another 400 series highway is not needed in this province. More accessible transit like trains and busses are needed. In urban areas like Toronto more bike infrastructure is needed. This legislation is a waste of tax dollars and is shameful.\n"

        "comment": "There are obvious points to be made -- bike lanes are shown to reduce congestion, weird overreach into what should be municipal jurisdiction, etc.\nBut beyond those points, the premier's office has made it clear that this legislation will be invoked to remove certain existing bike lanes in at least one big city. In my view, it is inevitable that with the course of time, as provincial and municipal governments turn over, bike lanes will be either reinstated where they once were, or added to other roads to effectively fulfil the same purpose as the old bike lanes. This is the natural course of things in large cities with a certain minimum level of cycling culture.\nIt might take a decade or so, sure. But ultimately, this legislation will result in things getting built twice at significant cost for no reason. Strange.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and this act will cost Torontonians time, money, gas, and it will end up literally killing people. It is not based in science, data, or reason, and instead in feelings and emotion. The data are clear: bike lanes are saving Torontonians time on their commute by removing cars from traffic. Adding bikes back to car lanes will just make car lanes more congested. It is really that simply. Many, many studies by the School of Cities at the University of Toronto have confirmed this. I urge every member of this assembly to please do the research themselves because clearly this government is not doing it. No study was conducted and no science is being used in this act's creation. Every member of this assembly should vote to end this backwards, costly act.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver who commutes from the Uxbridge area to Toronto twice a week for the past 4 years. This proposal seems like it is going to put barriers up to creating safe roads for both cyclists and drivers. It says that it \"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion\", and yet, it seems to be discouraging creating more bike lanes. Is hitting a cyclist not considered an accident? Does it not result in lane closures? I fully support more bike lanes, not fewer. I have even changed my commute route from a 2 lane road to 1 lane with a bike lane (was taking Carlton across from Parliment, now taking Gerrard). It is not noticeably longer for me to take this new route. What I do notice is a peace of mind I have knowing that cyclists have their own lane, and I have mine. Cyclists aren't simply going to disappear if bike lanes are prevented or removed. They will continue to use roads, and I will have to continue to keep my head on a swivel, because I know that the onus is on me, the driver, if there is an accident with a cyclist. Additionally, cyclists are helping to reduce pollution from driving, and they are taking steps to work healthy activity into their day, which will save our healthcare system money in the future.\nI wholeheartedly disagree with this proposal. Please do not put up barriers to municipalities creating more bike lanes. This seems like needless extra tax payer money in administrative/bureaucratic processes, when I believe the municipalities themselves would have superior knowledge of their needs, not the provincial government.\n"

It is, in-fact, quite foolish of a decision and a huge waste of taxpayers money. These bike lanes on Bloor and University were just recently completed and now you're just going to tear them out? This is insane. Buy back to 407, ditch the 413 and focus on healthcare and education, this government is an absolute joke.\n"

        "comment": "As a motorist, I can empathize with the desire and need to find a solution to the gridlock in big cities like Toronto, but removing existing bike lanes and discouraging the installation of new ones is nearsighted and ignorant at best. One of the best comments against using one's vehicle to get around Toronto is expressed in signs above the Allen, thanks to the TTC: \"You're not stuck in traffic: you *are* traffic.\"\nAs a cyclist, I am so dismayed by the entertainment of the idea to remove existing bike lines and discouraging the installation of new ones. I work at a university where the parking fees are exorbitant\u2014as fees are around the city\u2014and despite it being faster to drive than to cycle and take the subway, I opt for the latter options, as it provides a meaningful opportunity to move my body, to control my departure and arrival time, and to reduce pollution in our city.\nRemoving bike lanes needlessly puts cyclists, who may or may not have the option to drive, in danger, as this will force us to once again share the road with motorists. More important than removing bike lanes is educating all Ontarians about the different options available to us all to get around, and making bike lanes usable and safe year-round is a fantastic option, in addition to improving access to transit and increasing availability of bus routes.\nAs motorist, cyclist, pedestrian, human, I STRONGLY oppose the removal of bike lanes and any plan that discourages the installation of bike lanes. Cycling makes for a healthier community; cars are not the best way to get around! Let's work together for better solutions.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely absurd. Of all the things the government can be doing to help citizens, how are you spending time and money on this? How about healthcare? Or public transit? Solve the real, and hard problems. We elected you to lead, not just pull off short-sited short-term populist BS. Act like the leaders we elected.\nThe evidence is clear that bike lanes do not contribute to congestion. This has been well studied globally.  Now, I know you will discount those studies and discard them as flawed or misleading, or whatever.\nSo, let me ask this instead:\nShow me one example, from any place in the world, from any time you choose where building more roads, or more lanes of traffic on existing roads had a lasting impact on congestion. Hint: it's never happened. Anywhere. Ever. Stop trying to tell us that you can build more roads to reduce traffic congestion. It's a BS idea, plain and simple.\nBuilding more roads to reduce traffic is like putting on bigger pants to fix weight gain. It might feel like it works for a short while, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem at all.\n"

        "comment": "It is an absolutely ridiculous and just plain stupid thought process to remove bike lanes in order to make traffic flow better. Quite literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth, Ford.\nIts always not enough money for things that actually matter and will help our communities like healthcare or increasing the budget for schools, but you have no problem wasting tax payer money to detroy things that are already built and are helping ease traffic. Want less traffic? Invest the money into better public transit so that its quicker to get to work by bus, train, or trolley. You'll see vehicle traffic plummet. All without touching a single bike lane.\nSeriously. I really hope you reconsider. You could be doing so much good for Ontario and instead you choose to waste money and blame others for your greedy shortcomings. I seriously can't believe that we are even dealing with something like this. To go from Ontario being such a well regarded province worldwide to us being a laughing stock for the whole world is depressing.\n"

What's with the name of the bill too? Nothing about this bill is going to save me time. If this goes through, my vote's going somewhere else, I want less red tape for good policy like increased bike lanes, public transport, and housing density, not more.\nAlso with the sneaky highway stuff at the end there, get that out of there, make it it's own bill for god's sake. I don't want more highways, and I don't want environmental protections removed either! Make some electric trains or something instead, that'll help reduce some congestion, and take up way less space than a new 4 lane highway.\nThe province should start looking towards less car infrastructure, and more people focused stuff, like bikes, green buses and trains. Cars are expensive to own, and aren't helping with the cost of living crisis going on at the moment.\n"
