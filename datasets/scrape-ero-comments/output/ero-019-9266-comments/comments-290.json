        "comment": "I have a concern of the entirety of this proposal, but especially the environmental implications. The implications to the environment will be considered for the criteria for evaluating proposed new and existing lanes, but does not specify that the removal of bike lanes specifically will undergo an environmental impact assessment. What devastating impact will the removal of these high volume bike lanes have on health, safety, carbon emissions, air pollution, etc?  This bill is procedurally flawed and reckless.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is provincial government overreach. The provincial government shouldn't waste money on this initiative when they should be focused on bigger items that affect the whole province. Taking this item out of local jurisdiction is ridiculous and wastes time and money. Bike lanes have heavy impact on the local community and subjecting decision-making to another layer of bureaucracy is ludicrous. What's the point of a local government if the provincial government just wants to control it?\n"

Safe, affordable transportation for all is something that this city and province should be advocating for and supporting through increased, smart infrastructure. In addition, the city needs to be thinking of ways to support the city's environmental health, as well as population health through increased opportunity for physical activity.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the passing of this bill by the Ontario government. This represents serious interference with the operation of cities and towns by the elected officials who intimately work with and in the cities and towns. The Ontario government was elected to oversee the province, not the minute decisions of the cities and towns, such as whether or not a city or town can install bike lanes.\nCongestion in Ontario's cities and towns will only worsen with this bill, not improve. Data and science show how bike lanes help ease traffic. Why is the Ontario government looking to worsen traffic?\nI am a Torontonian who walks, bikes, takes public transit, and drives. I feel unsafe in Toronto as a pedestrian and bicyclist because of the poor road design and drivers who treat others with callousness and impunity. The removal of bike lanes and the blocking of installation of bike lanes will only discourage people from choosing to bike instead of drive. Every car taken off the road by a person who decides to bike represents an improvement in congestion.\nCongestion is a serious problem for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and impacts the productivity of its many citizens. I used to commute for school and work via car and lost many hours due to traffic. Because of the poor alternative transit options, I had to drive.\nNow that I live and work in Toronto, I have plenty of options to get around Toronto. After I picked up biking in order to get from point A to point B, my quality of life improved.\nIt is incredibly shortsighted for the Ontario government to pass this bill. I am outraged that the Ontario government is ignoring science and data in a misguided effort that ultimately will worsen the lives of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not the solution to reducing congestion in Toronto. The best way to increase people movement is through public transit and discouraging the use of personal cars. Public transit reduces congestion, carbon footprint, noise and pollution. Removing bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University will only encourage more cars, making the problem worse. Clearly adding more lanes to highways is not working. If you look at other metropolitan, high density cities across the world - they all have a better transit system and personal vehicle use is discouraged or minimised. Bike lanes encourages healthy transportation, and bikes are not polluting.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed legislation to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto, and the broader framework for provincial oversight of municipal bike lanes.\nLocal transportation infrastructure decisions, including the placement and management of bike lanes, have traditionally fallen under municipal jurisdiction for good reason. Municipal governments and their planning departments have the detailed understanding of local traffic patterns, community needs, and neighborhood characteristics necessary to make informed decisions about street-level infrastructure.\nThe proposed framework would override Toronto's carefully developed cycling network plan, which was created through extensive community consultation and expert analysis. This represents an unprecedented intrusion into municipal affairs that could undermine the city's ability to implement its council-approved transportation and climate action strategies.\nWhile provincial involvement in major highways and regional transportation corridors is appropriate, micromanaging street-level infrastructure in Toronto sets a concerning precedent for provincial overreach into municipal decision-making. I urge the province to reconsider this proposal and respect the City of Toronto's authority to manage its own street infrastructure.\n"

It also allows the province to control programs that are not part of their purview. The provincial government has already done enough damage increasing the speed on highways which increases climate change producing greenhouse gases and leads to more highway fatalities. Stay away from municipal bike lanes.\n"

This will add to the car traffic of our cities.\nLet our cities govern our cities, including the decision to add bike lanes instead of adding red tape requiring cities to get provincial approval for bike lanes.\nTo fight gridlock, you need to give Ontarians the opportunity to use alternative modes of transportation that are not cars. Cars are inefficient. Our roads and highways are wide enough.\nI don't believe and I disagree that this act will save Ontarians time.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes in Toronto will increase cyclist and pedestrian injuries and deaths due to the lack of safe infrastructure for them to move through their city and be protected by increasingly large private vehicles. Bike lanes are proven to not be factors that increase traffic- every person on a bike is one less car on the road. More lanes do not decrease traffic in the long term. This has been proven in academic literature. More lanes mean more people will start to drive and traffic will start again. More people using alternative means of transit (bikes, subway, buses) is better for the environment than several large and fuel inefficient vehicles idling throughout the city. Funding should be directed at increasing bike infrastructure and improving public transit.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out bike lanes is not the answer to Toronto\u2019s traffic issues. Bike lanes help reduce cars on the road, cut emissions, promote health and make Toronto a better city in which to live.\nConstruction, lack of investment in transit, and more people using their cars after Covid have caused gridlock, not bike lanes. Giving more space over to cars will only result in more traffic.\nCyclists need to have safe passage on main roads and many other world-class cities provide this. Bike lanes make it so that cars and bikes are not pitted against each other.\nCities should have the power to decide on issues such as bike lanes - Ford should not be interfering in Toronto\u2019s bike lanes to try secure votes from suburbanites. He should stay in his own lane.\n"

What about your mantra of reducing red tape?\nYou are ignoring almost all the studies when you claim that bike lanes are the cause of gridlock.  At least do your own studies to try to prove your point. But you jump in hamfisted and just say IT WILL BE SO BECAUSE WE ARE THE BOSS OF YOU.  And because Doug Ford is still angry that he lost the mayor of Toronto race.\nYou should be embarrassed that Toronto is so behind already in what most of the world's great cities  know : that bike lanes are a good idea.\nWhen you hear someone has died or someone you love gets killed because they did not have a bike lane to ride in, I hope you realize you have had a hand in it.\nAnd besides, when I drive a car, I much prefer to drive alongside  bike lanes. It actually slows me down when I have to be careful and slow to pass bikes in an unprotected curb lane.\n"

I will just be in more danger, which means I will have to ride in the middle of the lane, slowing traffic more. I have instructed my partner of 18 years that if I die riding to work on streets that had bike lanes ripped out, he is to issue a wrongful death suit against the province.\n"
