        "comment": "I cycle and drive to work and this idea that bikes lanes are costing driver 4-5 minutes is ridiculous. Stop distracting the public with lies, construction in this city by developers who take over lanes cost more time. Having people go thru yellow then red lights take more time because if the grid lock. Cyclists riding on a designated lane safely on the roads has helped the city because less cars and Ubers on the road! There are way to many Ube, Lyft and more driving on our road which is why we have so much congestion. Bad driving and cars trying to get ahead and cheating the system makes for more accidents and congestion. Do not let this happen to our bike lanes that we have already paid for. Where do you think cyclists will ride? The road and slow down cars again and probably die trying to get to work or drop off the kids or go to Bay Street office. Everyone cycles who actually care about the environment and making this city livable. Quebec embraces bikes and builds designated lanes, they encourage people to use the safe lanes and it works! Stop and listen\n"

It\u2019s a blatant attempt to use ignorant culture war nonsense to distract voters from the fraud and irresponsible planning being forced through with new freeway development. Shame on our government for pushing this nonsense while bumbling 4 LRT projects with no end in sight for any of them.\n"

        "comment": "The province has no business interfering in municipal urban planning. Regardless of how anyone feels about bike lanes, this bill is a gross overstepping of jurisdiction that sets a dangerous precedent.\nBike lanes are basic urban infrastructure for the 21st century that are proven to increase safety, reduce accidents, have minimal impact on traffic, and a positive impact on businesses. Complete streets need to include space for all, including sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit routes, and roadways. Cyclists have exactly the same rights to safe passage that drivers and pedestrians do.\nAgain, none of this really matters because the Premier and the province should stay in their lane and deal with provincial issues, not meddle in municipal politics for no apparent reason.\n"

When I drive I\u2019m part of the problem and when I ride a m part of the solution. If we are serious about dealing with congestion, we should be doing everything we can to give people practical, safe alternatives to choosing to drive. This legislation does the opposite and will inevitably result in even worse congestion we are experiencing today.\n"

        "comment": "I firmly oppose removing bike lanes and reducing future bike lanes. You are taking Ontario backwards into an era that no longer exists. Cars are not a practical solution for the amount of people in the GTA, and we MUST encourage other modes of transportation. People who ride bikes deserve space in our cities, and they deserve to be safe. Municipalities deserve to make their own decisions without provincial overreaching. If side streets were practical solutions, they would already be in place.\nI also understand that this bill allows the government to skip the proper environmental assessments to build Highway 413. The corruption here is blatant. There will be nothing left of value in Ontario as Doug Ford paves over paradise.\nI hope Doug Ford will listen to the experts here. This bill is flat-out wrong on almost all proposals, time will not be saved amd injuries and deaths will increasd. Let's move Ontario forward, not create a war on bikes. How many deaths are worth 2 minutes of saved time in traffic? The correct answer is zero.\n"

Our city politicians are so vested in bike lanes on major roads they have lost all sense of reason on this topic. Request for information from the city are met with repeated silence as they don't want to answer difficult questions as they are only interested in giving the same  word salad answers over and over again.\nPlease get this bill passed and force the city to take action to remove bike lanes on major roads.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has some of the worst traffic congestion in North America. The solution is not to encourage more cars. The answer is providing another means of transit - in this case bikes. City planners, by their nature, should be concerned with creating an environment, where automobile congestion in the future will be reduced. Sometimes city planners must be patient. It takes time for citizens to move to a new life style. The bike lanes in downtown Toronto are well used and it has taken time for that to happen. The same patient attitude should be exercised here. You will not solve Toronto\u2019s traffic woes by encouraging more cars and discouraging other forms of transit. Period. Be patient. You\u2019ve built it; now wait for them to come.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill.\nTransportation by various modes is good for communities, the more people and goods that can get places in a timely manner is better for the operation of a community - that includes walking, biking, public transit and motor vehicles.\nI accept that not all bike lanes have been properly planned and executed, but to introduce another layer of \"oversight\" to the process of making transportation more accessible is anti-conservative. Shouldn't we let the locals in their communities be making the decisions around bike lanes? They are the best judge of what is right.\nThe issue of traffic is a multi-faceted problem, slapping another lane into any area is putting lipstick on a pig, when the real issue is that people are commuting ever further distances to reach their destinations, either because they've been priced out of housing or there isn't appropriate work nearby -> that is the issue that need solving.\n"

        "comment": "I feel strongly that municipalities should be able to decide and manage their own bike lanes, and I feel strongly about the positive benefit that bike lanes have. Bike lanes promote personal and public health by encouraging more users to take an active mode of transportation safely, and reducing carbon emissions (also a promoter of environmental and public health). I am a family physician and I personally use the bike lanes in Toronto along Yonge and Bloor regularly, and at times have used them daily. These bike lanes connect areas like Midtown to so many places downtown, and have allowed me to commute as far as St Joseph\u2019s Hospital safely. These bike lanes allow me to stay physically active and improve my mental health, while also reducing my need to drive (so there is one less car on our already busy streets). I love to encourage my patients to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives, and cycling can be a great option when there is the infrastructure that supports it.\n"

The demographics of Etobicoke consists of families - the logistics of biking with young children to school, grocery shopping, sports is impossible. How will I get my three children to hockey on bike? How will i get my 4yo to gymnastics when she doesn\u2019t bike? How can I bring my groceries from Costco home by bike?\nBike lanes in downtown make sense. The demographic is vastly different.\n"

And conservatives swear that they are against overreaching government push  a law that will cause injury to cyclists and move environmental progress backward. But very briefly favour currently elected officials. Sahel on you.  It\u2019s disappointing on our behalf and on behalf of our children. biking builds community It is environmentally appropriate, and it is good for the city. You move us backward and cost us money to do so. I am ashamed of this hypocrisy. You know better. .\n"

These areas are so dense already that they should be made more bike and pedestrian friendly, connected to public transit as well. Not cars. The hospitals have also made it clear that bike lanes are essential to them. Don\u2019t remove the bike lanes on University, Yonge, and Bloor\n"
