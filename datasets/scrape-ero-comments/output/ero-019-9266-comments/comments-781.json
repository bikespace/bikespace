Before making these changes, the Province must articulate justification for this provincial intervention, how do the identified downtown Toronto bike routes impact provincial interest?\n"

How amazing to get to one's destination while getting fit and enjoying nature at the same time!\nIn these challenging times, it is imperative that we respect everyone's right to public space. Our public spaces need to be shared. Cyclists require protected bike lanes to ensure their safety. Biking infrastructure needs to be maintained.\nCity Council staff have researched and planned our cycling network and provided bikes throughout the city. I see them being used and enjoyed in my  Scarborough area.\nIt is abhorrent to  consider removing bike lanes because this is not an evidence-based decision.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am writing to support keeping bike lanes.  I commute everyday to work on bike except when there is snow and ice.  The bike lanes are an important mode of transportation that other cities have learned are central to keeping bicyclists safe while reducing car traffic.  At the same time, it teaches new generations of children learning to bike, which also keeps them healthy and safe.  There are many parents who bike with children and use these lanes, I know I did when my daughter was young.  I am not sure if anyone reading this comment bikes in Toronto, and if so, you would see how well-used the bike lanes are, and this is important because not everyone's voice will make it to this comment section.  If the bike lanes are removed, then the only way I know how to stay safe will be to take up a car spot in a car lane, which I can assure you will slow down traffic to the speed that I bike.  It seems obvious to me that bike lanes help lessen car congestion rather than causing it.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disapprove of this proposal. Municipalities should be able to continue building bike lanes and infrastructure without additional provincial approval as they can now. It makes no sense to introduce additional red tape to a process that already typically takes years.\nFurthermore I absolutely oppose the removal of the Bloor, University and Yonge bike lanes. These lanes are actually crucial to maintaining a functional city. I don't live in the area so only use them occasionally, but co-workers and friends of mine use the Bloor bike lanes on a daily basis. A co-worker recently praised the University bike lanes as \"life changing\". These lanes run alongside our subway lines, thus acting as key last-mile connectors, as well as significant cycling corridors linking up parts of the city into a wider network. They should not be removed, undoing years of construction work, planning, efforts and progress at great expense.\nBuilding more bike lanes and a comprehensive cycling network is one of the key tools government should be leveraging to reduce gridlock. We won't be able to reduce congestion by adding a couple of lanes of roadway here and there. We need to provide reasonable alternatives to driving, like cycling. And people are much more likely to switch when a strong network of protected lanes exists. Removing them would be extremely detrimental to the Province's own stated goals.\n"

Is a supposedly shorter commute worth someone\u2019s life? Do they want more road rage towards cyclists, that will surely end in violence?), they should care about the waste of money AND the construction that will be added to three major arterial streets while these bike lanes are ripped out.\nAnd if the people in this government followed science and data, they would know that bike lanes are not the cause of congestion. They would know that a modern, future-facing city is one where there is less pollution and more people taking low-carbon transit. The premier should try taking the TTC to work, since he\u2019s directly on the transit line. His commute would be faster!\nWhat boggles the mind more than anything, is Doug Ford\u2019s apparent obsession with taking jurisdiction from the City of Toronto. Although when we think about who this will delight - his 905 conservative voters - it all makes sense. Do not let this pass. This entire bill is an abomination.\n"

        "comment": "An egregious result of bike lane implementation was the reconfiguring of lights at Bloor and Jane.\nTraffic going north on the South Kingsway turning eastbound on Bloor runs unimpeded. This then results in Traffic running eastbound on Bloor through the South Kingsway intersection no place to go when their light turns green because it's been filled by northbound South Kingsway traffic turning eastbound onto Bloor.  The line of eastbound Bloor traffic comes to a standstill sometimes as far back as Prince Edward.\nDrivers are frustrated as every other direction is moving except for eastbound Bloor from Prince Edward towards Jane.\nThis MUST BE ADDRESSED!!\nI have written to Mayor Chow and Premier Ford about this.  No wonder Ford wants to dismantle this whole debacle as the fallout is egregious and frustrating and disrespects peoples' state of mind while ignoring their building sense of frustration.\nExample:  the advanced green ar Old Mill limits this turn to 2 or 3 cars....cars that rightly want to avoid the long not moving line of traffic on Bloor eastbound. This builds further frustration and can lead to accidents. I've already witnessed drivers ignoring the left turn signal and plowing through it on red. Who decides this is a good way to treat people by limiting their mobility and accessibility to movement???\nTo add to the disastrous Bloor eastbound traffic, the lights at Jane and Armadale turn red constantly further impeding traffic moving on eastbound Bloor.\nWe need some smart visionaries and planning to foresee these issues instead of shoehorning it in and then maybe dealing with the inevitable consequences.\n"

The bike lanes in the city of Toronto have been implemented without proper community consultation -- meetings were held however no meaningful listening took place. The bike lane on Bloor has been absolutely devastating for businesses, for our elderly residents with mobility challenges, for families who rely on Bloor st to get their children to and from activities, for anyone that needs to drive in the area at literally any time of day. It is fundamentally ableist to assume that everyone is able to transition to biking as a primary means of transport. Let's find better solutions that balance the needs of all Ontarians. Absolutely let's create bike paths and lanes, but not when it means sacrificing full lanes of traffic that currently serve far more residents than a bike lane ever will.\n"

The only proven solution to traffic congestion is introducing viable alternatives to driving. Solutions like building and delivering public transit and active transit infrastructure (like bike lanes) get unnecessary car trips off the roads, leaving them clear for those who need to or choose to drive.\nThe bike lanes built in Toronto in the last 5 years, especially those being proposed for removal, are extremely well-used and benefit businesses, residents, and commuters alike.\nMore importantly, the bike lanes improve the safety of the most vulnerable road users - pedestrians and cyclists. Lives have undoubtedly been saved through infrastructure improvements.\nThis proposal is overreaching into municipal matters. Let municipalities build cities for people, not cars. Cars are merely one method of transportation that work in conjunction with other methods, not despite them.\nPlease consider a logical approach to solving the traffic congestion problems in our province, and you will improve road safety in the process.

There is no data suggesting that bike lanes increase car congestion. Cars cause the congestion. We need better bike infrastructure and better transit infrastructure to combat this issue. Many people who cycle to work would be driving a car, adding to the car congestion, if it weren\u2019t for the protection of bike lanes. This bill is also ignoring the fact that hundreds of biking delivery people rely heavily on the use of bike lanes to complete their days work. Removing said bike lanes puts them and all cyclists in direct danger and more lives will be lost.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to share my opposition to Bill 212 that, if passed, would require municipalities to secure provincial approval for any new bike lanes that would take space away from motor vehicles. The bill would also require the removal of sections of existing bicycle lanes on University Avenue, Bloor Street, and Yonge Street, and possibly other existing bicycle lanes across the province.\nThe rationale for this proposal is the province\u2019s desire to fight gridlock and make life easier for drivers, however, decades of transportation research and experience show that this move won\u2019t reduce gridlock or save people time (research attached).\nSimply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with other proposals in this bill to build the new 413 highway, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place (also known as induced demand). Bicycle lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and can move many more people per hour than a lane focused primarily on moving motor vehicles.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer to drive, but many people don\u2019t and in any community at least, 30% of people can\u2019t drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too. Ontarians are multimodal and want to have choice in how they get around. A recent poll by the Share the Road Cycling Coalition found that 65% of Ontarians wanted to cycle more if there were improved cycling infrastructure available. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips as well.\nImportantly, bicycle lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles. As the government heard from more than 120 physicians and researchers, the delay or removal of bike lanes will have devastating consequences.\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. As outlined by the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), requiring provincial approval of bicycle lanes would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation and include the need for re-design and re-configuration of roadways and intersections. As calculated by the City of Toronto, the bicycle lanes identified in this bill for removal would cost the taxpayers approximately $48 million to remove and come with a sunk cost of the $27 million the City of Toronto invested to build them in the first place. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\nIt should also be noted that the road closures and delays caused by the reconstruction of roadways during bicycle lane removal with further cause congestion and delays to the flow of traffic.\nAs highlighted by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI), this move is out of line with other provincial priorities such as the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes. It also doesn\u2019t support the province\u2019s e-scooter micromobility pilot program, which was recently extended.\nOrganizations representing municipalities and thousands of mobility and road safety professionals across Ontario have voiced their opposition to the transportation planning measures in this bill, including:\n\u2022\tAssociation of Municipalities of Ontario\n\u2022\tOntario Good Roads Association\n\u2022\tOntario Professional Planning Institute\n\u2022\tWomen in Urbanism Canada\n\u2022\t120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto\n\u2022\tOntario Society of Professional Engineers\n\u2022\tOntario Public Health Association\nI urge the government to respect and leverage the expertise and experience of these organizations and work with them instead on meaningful solutions to the very real problem of congestion. Removing bicycle lanes and adding red tape to the municipal planning process isn\u2019t the solution.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential to traversing Toronto safely and efficiently for all kinds of residents. Many cyclists cannot afford cars and/or do not feel safe or supported within the current public transit infrastructures. The City of Toronto should be encouraging and developing paths for safe biking (including keeping and maintaining existing Bloor and University cycling paths).\nAs climate change and congestion become more severe, it is critical that Toronto support -- rather than reverse and remove -- transport alternatives to driving. People, regardless of age and income, can access affordable bicycle ownership or rentals, and removing cycling lanes is a waste of taxpayer money and sets us back as a city. There is a strong lack of forward-thinking vision in Toronto's governance and maintaining bike paths is crucial to supporting working class residents, reducing pollution, and making the city accessible.\nLastly, bike lanes enable people to exercise -- to get out and traverse the city -- safely in the public domain. Many people cannot afford gym memberships etc., but you can cycle for free at any time.\nIn conclusion, the city should be supporting bike lanes for the purpose of:\n- environmental concerns\n- public health and exercise\n- accessibility/transport alternatives\nAs seen in Letter Opposing Bill 212 from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE) linked below, many experts also dispute Bill 212's efficacy at reducing car congestion. Instead of removing bike lanes, Ontario and Toronto governments should be supporting alternatives to car transit. The vast majority of Toronto drivers are single-driver vehicles; bikes help alleviate pressure on already busy roadways. As OSPE says: \"The key to solving Ontario\u2019s traffic woes is not about maintaining the status quo of car-dominated roadways.\"\nRemoving bike lanes will note aid with congestion, but only impede Toronto's progress towards less congestion, healthier commuting, recreation, and environment.\n"
