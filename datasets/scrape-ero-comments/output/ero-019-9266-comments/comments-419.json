        "comment": "I'm asking for the goverment to reconsider their position. Removing bike lanes can have several negative consequences, including increased safety risks for cyclists, as these lanes provide dedicated spaces that reduce the likelihood of accidents with vehicles. Without bike lanes, fewer people may choose cycling as a transportation option, undermining efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and reduce traffic congestion. Additionally, increased cycling contributes to lower carbon emissions, supporting environmental goals. Economically, cyclists often enhance local businesses by increasing foot traffic and accessibility. Furthermore, bike lanes improve overall urban mobility, making cities easier to navigate, and they promote public health by encouraging physical activity and reducing air pollution. In summary, eliminating bike lanes can lead to less safe, less accessible, and less environmentally friendly urban environments.\n"

        "comment": "I'm very disappointed I need to express my concerns regarding the proposed introduction of additional bike lane challenges. Removing bike lanes and making new lanes even more difficult to build is insane.\nBike lane networks in most North American cities are poorly connected and patchy, and ours in Ontario are no exception. Arguing \"lack of use\" as justification for removing bike lanes when the reason for their lack of use is due to them having poor coverage and questionable utility. How are we supposed to increase cycling in our cities if we are actively fighting safe and accessible infrastructure? Why is it okay to force cyclists off of the most direct and efficient routes? Why have we dedicated an obscene amount space to cars?\nFunneling more cars into our urban centres is an awful idea that we've tried it before and it didn't go well. Active transportation and public transit need to be encouraged and invested in. These forms of transportation are far more efficient at moving people, and if our cities continue to grow and densify efficient transportation is mandatory.\nThere is a saying \u201cWhen you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.\" Automobile drivers have been catered to and a privileged class for over 70 years, and losing a few feet of roadway feel like a declaration of war. We have made car ownership compulsory in this country, which makes it extremely difficult to live life without a car. Instead of continuing to prioritize the car \"because everyone drives\" we need to prioritize other more efficient forms of transportation BECAUSE EVERYONE DRIVES!\nBill 212 is foolish. It is wrong. It's making bike lanes political. It's prioritizing the most expensive and inefficient form of transportation. It's government overreach. It makes our roads less safe. This is just abhorrent. I can't believe I even had to sit down to write this comment. Please, consider how many people are going to be negatively affected by these decisions. If we are ever going to move towards healthier more efficient cities, prioritizing the car is definitely not the path forward. Cars are subsidized enough.\nI could literally go on and on like this. I'll end it here by reiterating my disappointment.\nSincerely,\n-Disappointed Ontario Cycling Guy\n"

        "comment": "As someone who drives the vast majority of the time, I strongly oppose ripping out these bike lanes, especially Bloor and University. Just last month, I biked over 40km (again, I drive most of the time), predominantly using the three routes proposed to be removed. Bloor and University in particular are safely separated from vehicle traffic, which is something I greatly appreciate both as a driver and a cyclist. That is how it should be done.\nFurthermore, I do not want to be forced to drive to destinations downtown, i.e. forced to go out of my way and spend time finding a parking garage, and then paying the very high parking rates, because cycling is no longer an option. Hopping on a bikeshare in those cases makes an immense amount more sense, is way more practical, healthier, quicker, and much cheaper.\nI would say forcing drivers into expensive parking lots is a bigger detriment to using a car than these particular bike lanes are. If we can\u2019t widen the roads more than they are (which we can\u2019t), the only other option is adding good alternatives to the mix. If the Premier really cared about reducing the time we all spend in gridlock, he would instead mandate that no employer can force you into the office when your job can be done working from home.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock is a great goal. With a growing population, when everyone drives, one more lane, on any street, is useless. Leave the existing bike lanes (make them better even) and many more people will opt to cycle instead of drive, which eases congestion on the road and reduces gridlock for drivers. Once you remove bike lanes from major roads, then biking will take too long and people will drive instead. That puts more cars back on the road. Good bike lanes can support 1000s of bikes (the lanes need to be good, continuous, and SAFE though!) and this removes 1000s of cars from the road. Bad, discontinuous, or no bike lanes, puts everyone back into their cars. So this proposal is actually doing the opposite of what you want it to do. This proposal is INCREASING gridlock and not saving anyone time. Bloor and Yonge are major business streets on which there is a lot of foot traffic and movement of all kinds. Allowing for more foot traffic and bikes means less people choose to drive, and those who drive can move freely without congestion or gridlock. This is not my opinion, it is proven (see linked 2024 findings). Ontario has a chance to solve the problem of congestion and also be the lead on this in North America, since we already have some of the infrastructure in place. Just keep going. Chuck this bill, it does not do what you want it to do.\n"

The removal of bike lanes will then take years to complete, wasting time while not helping the gridlock at all as once it is complete, the streets will be back to bumper-to-bumper traffic.\nThere is no room for more redtaping and the province should really stop working against the people living and commuting in Toronto for short term political gains. Mike Harris was more than 20 years ago let\u2019s not repeat that\nagain\n"

        "comment": "Although I am not a bike commuter and use my car to drive around the city - removing the bike lanes from the proposed streets will turn Toronto into a faceless and an even more polluted city. Unlike most North American cities, Toronto has been on a right path to create a safe and extended infrastructure for bikes akin to what world class cities like Amsterdam or Copenhagen have. In my opinion, the heavy focus put on increasing the car ridership through the downtown is wrong, especially by removing bike lanes. A wider road is just a band-aid to a bigger issue with the traffic in the city. As the city expands and as more and more residences are being built, the number of cars grows exponentially . If more public transportation and bike infrastructure were in place - perhaps less people would resort to cars and would instead opt for alternatives. The city of Toronto could become a clean, sustainable, easy-to-breathe city but this bill undermines that path and will bring our city\u2019s growth back to the 2000s. We need less cars to have cleaner, safer, and quieter roads, not more lanes for the cars. Walking down the Bloor and Younge street is easy and enjoyable, and in part it is thanks to the bike lanes that keep the cars further from the sidewalks and slow down the traffic. Lastly, it is personally frustrating to see how the premier I voted for uses bike lanes as a means to improve their polls. This bill is outright populist and more information should be made available to the public on how the bike lanes removal will affect the air quality in the city core, how will it decrease the congestion, and what the long-term prospects for the city will be when the car ridership increases. Without all this - removing bike lanes in a madman hurry is unacceptable!\n"

        "comment": "In a growing diverse city as Toronto where new condos are being bult with less and less parking spaces. There needs to be accommodation for multiple modes of travel. In Toronto nothing is a one size fits all. Driving is not for everyone and public transit might not be plan 'B' for these persons either. Think about this, if you take away key bike lanes it won't reduce the number of bikes in the city because people will still need to get where they need to go. But it will increase the chances of someone being killed as a result. Let's have a balanced approach where bike lanes can exist when and where feasible. By the way I am not a cyclist. I love driving, I prefer to drive it's the safest way to travel in Toronto.\n"

I rely on the bloor, college, and university cycling lanes all year long to commute to work and have significantly noticed an improvement in safety in both cyclists and car drivers since the retrofits of those lanes. As cities across Ontario are growing and densifying, research have demonstrated that alternative modes of transport like active mobility and public transit are essential. In fact, it is primordial to give less space for the acts as world class cities like Paris and London have and are working on to combat Greenhouse Gas emissions and reach our climate change goals. Ontario needs to do better and we collectively need to stop acting like we\u2019re still in the 1920s. Future generations will look back at current governments and lament our lack of action.

Not only are bike lanes already not respected and often neglected by the city but this is openly hostile to those who actively attempt to reduce traffic and 'gridlock' by opting for a less space intensive form of travel... Not only are bike lanes a green initiative, they are cheaper for the average citizen; requiring little upkeep and a small initial investment, they take up less space, are a healthier alternative, their infrastructure require less maintenance and are safer for the public and riders. I enjoy skateboarding and the lanes I require to keep myself safe should not be in jeopardy, imagine if in the middle of the road we parked metallic slabs that must be avoided by the riders, this is what i experience every time i wish to use this public infrastructure and now it is under threat.\nPlease reconsider actual solutions to recuperate lost time felt by the average citizen. I recommend promotion of remote work and a change of zoning regulations that allow for walk-able cities. Additionally we could re-evaluate the standard threshold for what the government recognize as full time work. These solutions would help keep fewer people on the road for shorter periods of time without reducing their quality of life.\n"

I can say that from a quality of life standpoint it is much easier and safer to travel on all of these modes with these bike lanes installed. When I am walking it pushes the cars away from the side walk and slows them down making it safer and nicer to walk. When biking I don\u2019t have to constantly look over my shoulder to make sure a car isn\u2019t right behind me or about to hit me, and when taking transit it is amazing to have the option to cycle as a last mile connection. When driving it is a-lot safer not to have to weave around cyclists to pass them. Additionally in no world should a provincial premier have any say over the street design in Toronto or any other city. Doug Ford is putting red tape and creating unnecessary bureaucracy for cities that are trying to move away from car centric street design.\n"

Bike lanes help reduce congestion by getting people off cars and moving people far more effectively since they don't require as much space. Bikes are also considered a far more environmentally friendly method of travel and if done properly, can result in wonders like you see in Copenhagen or Amsterdam where cars move more efficiently due to only those needing to drive ending up driving.\n"

In contrast, evidence shows that roads lacking bike infrastructure have worse traffic, worse travel times, and increase the likelihood of injury and death to cyclists and pedestrians alike.\nTo go forward with any of these plans would be an unequivocally egregious display of gross malpractice in governance, and this community will not tolerate it.\n"

It will increase bureaucracy, needlessly overstep into municipal jurisdiction, and cost tax payers immediately and in the future. Not to mention the clear negative perception of our Premier removing sections of bike lanes he likely see's on his work commute, and feeding into the perception (rightfully in my opinion) that he'd rather be the mayor of Toronto.\n1) cities have limited space to move people. if there are no bike lanes and limited designated transit lanes it incentivizes people to drive. Driving by far takes up the most space to move people + the space used to store the vehicles. It makes more sense to funnel that money to transit + active transportation and create a viable reliable network. this will allow other forms of transportation to be used and more free space for businesses, housing and their tax income for municipalities. this \"if you build it they will come\" model is called induced demand. wonder why more people bike on Bloor W than in suburban Etobicoke? There is infrastructure for biking on Bloor.\n2) based on point 1 more people will end up driving. that 1 bike is now a car taking up much more space and becoming part of traffic. this doesn't solve your congestion issue. Now you've spent our money to provide people less (and much cheaper) transit options, that cost more to maintain in the long run.\n3) the indirect cost of having to review every municipalities proposed bike lanes is wasting money. The province shouldn't be involved in this decision but now that the are it's 1 extra step, making the process take more time. The opportunity cost of that is important\n4) This doesn't help businesses like Ford has claimed. The logic of it doesn't make sense and the studies back it up. It's much easier to hop of your bike, lock it up then enter a store than it is to find parking and walk to the shop. even if this did fix traffic, it's harder to just pop in quickly with a car than it is a bike. This study on Bloor came to this conclusion as well. Other studies show bike lanes are better for business. was this not considered in our Transportation Ministers common sense and evidence based approach? Not to mention if less people need a car more money can be used on local business rather than auto costs.\n5) for obvious reasons this will have a negative impact on cyclist safety and the environment\nI WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR YOU IF THIS GOES THROUGH. Stay in your lane and use this money effectively. For a party that allegedly stands for common sense, fiscal responsibility, and less bureaucracy you sure like to make illogical choices that burn our cash and increase red tape.\n"

Infrastructure that incurs very little wear and tear like all bike infrastructure. To then put in more car infrastructure that we will have to repair in a fraction of the time.

Convince people to take other methods of getting, or not drive if possible, try congestion pricing.

I\u2019ve always enjoyed riding my bike and any chance to save some money and be a bit healthier was good for me. What was a 15 minute drive became an 1 hour nightmare. The lack of cycle infrastructure mixed with the aggressive drivers made for an exceptionally hostile environment. I was almost hit by cars twice while acting as I was supposed to in traffic, and it was a terrible experience and very disappointing. I of course always have the \u201cchoice\u201d to cycle, but in this moment I felt like I truly had no freedom, no options - that I would always have to drive. Making everyone drive doesn\u2019t fix traffic, in fact it tends to make it worse. For Toronto this bill will mean the death of more cyclists, and for other cities it will kill their hopes of building communities with options. A fiscally conservative and \u201csmall-government\u201d minded leadership also shouldn\u2019t be wasting tax dollars ripping up infrastructure and introducing more red tape to prevent good progress at the municipal level - it\u2019s completely at odds with the conservative mindset. Let the cities deal with it how they choose. The congestion in Toronto is not caused by bike lanes (as I\u2019m sure all studies would show), in fact I much prefer to drive in environments where they operate separately. In downtown Toronto there are tons of cyclists and having to watch them and make space and pass them slows everything down. It all moves faster and safer with bike lanes. Above all, this is about safety, if you pass this bill, people will die. good innocent people will die, all so drivers can feel like they\u2019re going faster.\n"

Furthermore, the focus on expanding road infrastructure may not address the root causes of gridlock, such as inadequate public transit options and urban sprawl. Instead of investing in long-term solutions that foster a more interconnected and efficient transportation network, this bill risks perpetuating a cycle of congestion.\nSafe and accessible bike lanes are essential components of our transportation network, providing a viable alternative to car travel and improving overall safety for all road users. Enhancing this basic infrastructure not only encourages cycling but also reduces congestion and promotes healthier lifestyles.\nAdditionally, this legislation creates unnecessary red tape that hampers local governments' efforts to implement effective transportation solutions. By imposing rigid regulations, the bill undermines the flexibility that municipalities need to address their unique transportation challenges. Local governments are often best positioned to understand their communities' needs, and this legislation could stifle innovative approaches that could alleviate congestion and enhance mobility.\n"
