Unfortunately along the section of Bloor by my house, we got bike lanes very few people use, competition with the publicly subsidized TTC that runs under the bike lanes, and a series of white posts and painted lines that distract drivers\u2019 attention. Thank god these ideologically inspired initiatives are being thwarted!\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike lanes on main streets is a ridiculous waste of taxpayer dollars. Doug Ford purports to \"respect taxpayers\", but this is not it. If the government really wants to reduce gridlock that does NOT mean putting more cars on the road. It is to provide people with multiple options for travel and better infrastructure that supports that. Please focus on completing projects like the Eglinton Crosstown instead. Construction delays are costing the government more money.\n"

Adding another layer of oversight is highly unnecessary, costly and time consuming without providing any tangible benefits. The province should focus on broader things such as public healthcare.

The Province is not well positioned to make these decisions as they lack important local knowledge on roads, traffic patterns, planning design, etc. For the Province to step-in and make ad hoc decisions on bike lanes undermines municipal officials and the will of the local affected community.\nI am opposed to the Province removing bike lanes and the requirement for Provincial approval to add bike lanes. It is both an overreach of power and not within the mandate of the Province.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who rides my bike in Toronto, I regularly encounter blocked bike lanes. Whether by parked cars or from construction chaos, too often I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s no big deal and to \u201cjust go around\u201d. My own safety often seems like an inconvenience.\nLast week, a 24-year-old woman was killed by the driver of a large truck while she was trying to maneuver around a blocked bike lane. Her death is a tragic reminder that even along one of our busiest bikeways that sees thousands of cyclists a day, and in which one can travel almost exclusively on protected bike lanes, one unsafe segment can quickly turn one cyclist\u2019s commute into a tragedy.\nI am urging you to act now or else tragedies like the one on Thursday will continue to take place. Our cycling network is only as safe as its weakest link. Bikeways must be safe and passable by design for all ages and abilities (including women, children, and the elderly) or else only a small number of people will take up active transportation to help ease our worsening congestion woes.\nFive people have been killed on our streets riding a bike in 2024. And none of those lives are less important than a construction project wrapping up a few days earlier than expected, or a delivery being made a few minutes faster. The convenience of a few does not outweigh the safety of everyone.\nThe status quo isn\u2019t good enough. I am urging you to:\n1. Ensure bikes lanes are not obstructed as a matter of ongoing public safety, not just periodic blitzes, and accelerate implementing automated enforcement parking programs and explore other reporting processes with an equity focused lens\n2. Prioritize construction zone safety, including maintaining dedicated cycling facilities, eliminating road hazards, tougher penalties for failing to comply, and a creating a \u201cmobility squad\u201d to ensure obstacle-free travel on the city\u2019s streets\n3. Accelerate and expand our cycling network of connected bikeways to enable more people to feel safe to choose to ride a bike\nMy safety depends on it.\n"

        "comment": "Keep your hands off our bike lanes. Children ride bikes too. My kids used the Bloor bike lanes to get to and from their school. How do you imagine they would ride with traffic? This whole bill is illogical. If there are no bike lanes, bikes travel in the car lanes with the traffic. That is what I will be doing. And, I tend to ride slower than most cars go. The only time I won't take the lane is when there is a bike lane, or if it feels safe to ride next to parked cars - but this also will not help traffic. If I'm riding next to parked cars, I'm NOT slowing down any car traffic. What you are doing is creating MORE congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill aimed at dismantling our existing bike lanes. This legislation could exacerbate traffic congestion, endanger vulnerable road users, and further contribute to our ongoing climate emergency.\nResearch has consistently shown that well-designed bike lanes not only promote safer cycling but also enhance overall urban mobility. For instance, a study by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy found that cities with extensive bike infrastructure experience an average reduction in traffic fatalities by up to 44%. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Transportation reports that investments in bike lanes can reduce congestion by encouraging more people to cycle rather than drive, thereby decreasing the number of vehicles on the road.\nAs a resident of Toronto and someone who has experienced the freedom of cycling as my primary mode of transportation, I can attest to the value these lanes provide. Growing up in the Prairies, I never imagined I would have the privilege of living car-free. Upon moving to Toronto five years ago, I sold my car and have since relied on bike lanes for commuting year-round. This lifestyle not only supports my health and well-being but also contributes to a more sustainable urban environment.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and recognize the critical role that bike lanes play in fostering safe, efficient, and environmentally-friendly transportation options in our cities.\n"

I beg of the provincial government to please leave Toronto\u2019s established bike lanes alone. It is such a waste of money for something that will NOT REDUCE traffic.

Toronto IS the economic powerhouse of this province. It's a fact. You NEED them for Ontario to be sustained and even thrive. Why are you forcing removal of current bike lanes that will destroy local businesses, and potential future bike lane infrastructure that would help other communities flourish? Do you not appreciate the contributions businesses in Toronto and workers in the city have made? Why are you hellbent on making lives of workers commuting and running errands in cities dangerous, slower, WORSE? Why do you want to limit transportation access to businesses in these areas?\nGet off your high horse and do something useful for once. Stop wasting money on useless shit no one wants.\nStop trying to distract everyone by arguing against basic transportation needs cities have and municipalities understand. We need MORE bike lanes!\nStop trying to build a highway without a proper environmental scan and sneak that into an unrelated legislation! Stop being so corrupt about everything! Stop aiming to make Ontario such a horrible place to live and work!\nSay NO to this legislation! Don't pass it.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock requires reducing the number of motor vehicles on the road.  Motor vehicles carrying one person comprise the majority of traffic on the roads.  Bike lanes help people make the transition that more and more people will have to make -- transitioning from motor vehicles to other modes of transportation.  Many more bicycles can travel down a street in a bike lane than motor vehicles can travel down two lanes of road set aside for vehicles.\nMany other major cities in the world took advantage of COVID to change their transportation priorities.  New York is now covered in bike lanes.  The Transportation Minister and others should go there and take a look around.  And the weather in New York isn't much better than here.  Plus, it is getting warmer here every year.  Too bad Toronto was so slow at making these changes, but some changes were made, and now is not the time to back up.  Even Montreal, colder by far than Toronto, has better bike lanes.\nThe lanes that have earned the ire of the PC government are on the only direct routes through those parts of town.  My wife and I chose not not buy a house in Summerhill.  Had the Yonge Street bike lanes existed when we bought our house we very well might have moved there.  We both work in downtown Toronto.\nThe University Avenue bike lanes are well used and don't slow up motor vehicles at all.  On University traffic is caused by drivers sending text messages not moving when the lights change.\nI haven't ridden much on Bloor West because I'm on the other side of town, but Bloor on the east side of Bathurst is very well used.\nThe proposal to limit bike lane construction is catering to people driving motor vehicles from outside a city to points within a city -- exactly the kinds of trips that need to be limited.  The Minister of Transportation thinks his commute by motor vehicle from Brampton to Queen's Park should be easy.  It should not be easy to make that drive.  Sound transportation policy would be discouraging motor vehicle traffic from Brampton to Queen's Park.  He should be taking the train or GO bus.  And tearing up a few bike lanes isn't going to make the Transportation Minister's drive to Queen's Park any easier.  He'll just have one less thing to blame as more cyclists die from inattentive drivers or hostile drivers empowered by this legislation to believe bicycles are merely a hinderance to their all important motor vehicle.\nThe proposal to limit and eliminate bike lanes is very depressing.  It shows Ontario is not serious about the future.\n"

        "comment": "This is an incredibly harmful piece of legislation that will do THE EXACT OPPOSITE of its stated intention to reduce gridlock.  It would move us in the opposite direction of other large cities around the planet.\nBike lanes improve traffic flow, and help move Ontario citizens much more efficiently than if they were in motor vehicles.\nI have to drive around the GTHA for work, but can move faster and easier when I am able to use transit and bike lanes where they are available.\nPlease focus on installing more transit and bike lanes so we can move PEOPLE around or cities, rather than plugging our streets with mostly empty, polluting cars - particularly on the streets that already have subways under them!\nPutting cars in the bike lanes will only impede the progress of both of those types of vehicles!\nA congestion tax is the only solution that has been proven to reduce congestion, beyond banning cars.\nWe want walkable neighbourhoods, as those are the most desirable areas in urban cities.\nThe only proposal less helpful than this legislation is the ludicrous idea of wrecking the 401 highway for a decade by wasting our time and money to tunnel underneath it. That project would never happen. No government would survive, were they to attempt it.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes contribute to safer neighborhoods by providing designated spaces for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents between bikes and vehicles. This separation enhances overall road safety and encourages more people to bike, promoting a healthier lifestyle.\nIn terms of reducing gridlock, bike lanes facilitate smoother traffic flow by encouraging people to choose biking over driving. Fewer cars on the road can decrease congestion, making commutes quicker for everyone.\nEnvironmentally, bike lanes support sustainable transportation by lowering carbon emissions. Increased biking reduces reliance on cars, leading to cleaner air and less urban pollution. Overall, bike lanes foster healthier communities, improve traffic conditions, and contribute positively to the environment.\nTo improve public transit quickly in Ontario, the Conservative government could focus on several key strategies:\nIncrease Funding: Allocate more resources to public transit projects to expedite development and upgrades.\nStreamline Approval Processes: Simplify regulatory and approval processes for transit projects to reduce delays.\nEnhance Infrastructure: Invest in expanding and maintaining existing transit infrastructure, such as buses, subways, and light rail.\nIntegrate Services: Improve coordination between different transit systems to create seamless connections and schedules.\nPromote Active Transportation: Support bike lanes and pedestrian pathways that connect to transit hubs, encouraging multimodal transport options.\nLeverage Technology: Implement real-time tracking and mobile apps for better rider information and convenience.\nEngage Communities: Involve local communities in planning processes to ensure transit solutions meet their needs.\nBy focusing on these areas, the government can enhance public transit efficiency, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction.\n"

        "comment": "To MTO,\nAs a lifelong cyclist who uses bike lanes daily to commute from my home in west end Toronto to my office downtown, take my son to school, run errands, and to visit family members in Bloor West Village and Etobicoke, I am deeply concerned about this proposed provincial legislation that would limit building new bike lanes, and remove existing lanes in targeted Toronto locations.\nThis represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nIn researching this issue I came across Cycle Toronto\u2019s website which points to a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI am also a car owner and I occasionally drive, and my observations align with the 68% of respondents who identify construction as a main cause for congestion in Toronto. Toronto has been undergoing a construction boom for years, and road work and condominium construction inevitably block our roadways and are much MUCH more disruptive to traffic flow than bike lanes.\nPublic safety should not be compromised for the sake of swaying voters in key ridings in west Toronto. Instead, we should use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\nThank you,\nLH\nToronto\n"
