They must not reduce the number of lanes. Theh belong on some lighter traffic roads, but not every road! That creates a network that doesn\u2019t strangle the city.\n"

There are specific bottlenecks in the city that lead to the traffic issues such as the on-ramps to the DVP and 401. Cyclists will continue to cycle on the roads and take up lanes and deaths will arise.\nAs a cyclist and someone who has voted conservative in the past it is incredibly disappointing to find the current administration is so obsessed with Toronto municipal politics when there are major macro provincial issues to be addressed. Leave it alone.\n"

Making cycling a safer option should be a top priority for all politicians, as it is incredibly environmentally friendly, not to mention the societal health benefits. The fact that we're even considering removing bike lanes astounds me. We have taken so many steps backward in healthcare, education, and now transportation under this government.\n"

We need to move forward in our city design, acknowledge our car-codependency and its unfortunate planning design and environmental impacts (though you have demonstrated you care very little on the latter - the disastrous highway through the greenbelt is yet another example of your utter disregard for our climate resiliency and conservation of agriculture and biodiversity).\nAn additional vehicular lane does not ease gridlock - it encourages more cars, hence more traffic. To think otherwise is worrisome and disappointing of our elected politicians. Stop skewing statistics to deliver your preferred narrative, that\u2019s not how data works.\nPlease focus on ensuring Metrolinx projects are delivered, so that public transportation options exist to, you guessed it!, reduce car influx into the downtown core from commuters like yourselves writing this bill. Stop the culture war against bikes in order to gain a few votes, your antics are obvious and dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "Solving traffic problems isn\u2019t going to come from reducing bike lanes. Cycling to get around the city is something that should be encouraged as a part of this solution. Bike lanes provide safe and efficient means of getting around the city without a car or transit. This functionally reduces the number of commuters who rely on cars to get where they need to go.\nThe new bike lane infrastructure in Toronto has massively increased the safety of this mode of transportation and helped to provide a more comprehensive network of safe cycling paths. Doing this will encourage more people, who otherwise would have felt unsafe on the road to see cycling as a real option. Removing bike lanes will make cycling less safe. It will increase the chances of someone being killed on their way to work or school. If a cyclist dies on a road that previously had a bike lane, it will be both devastating and infuriating as it was entirely preventable. Their blood will be on the hands of those who chose to pass this bill.\nThe hypocrisy of claiming to be fiscally conservative, while planning to waste money to rip out brand new infrastructure that the city has just invested in is wild. There are so many things we can and should be spending public dollars on - addressing out housing crisis, our climate crisis, improving our transit system, supporting our most vulnerable, improving our public parks and open space, fixing roads and other infrastructure that are in need of repair. Demolishing infrastructure that is brand new and supports healthy, climate friendly, affordable and efficient means of getting around the city to go back to a condition where traffic will still suck and cyclists will now be risking their lives while trying to get where they need to go without spending money on transit or cars is unconscionable.\nIf there is one thing that has a real impact on traffic flow in the city it\u2019s construction. We just went through months of construction putting these bike lanes which have radically improved how safe I feel biking to and from work, school, and anywhere else I need to go. The idea of spending the next few months ripping them out disrupting traffic for the everyone all over again is infuriating.\nIf you actually want to solve the traffic problem you need to find a way to get less cars on the street. Provide better transit options, more safe cycling infrastructure not less.\n"

A truck hit me on my bike and I think my collarbone is broken.\"  That was the call I received from my fianc\u00e9 as I stood waiting outside one of our wedding venue site visits.  We'd both biked - he from work and I from home.  Unfortunately that day, a truck veered into him on his bike.\nThe injuries did indeed include his collarbone being broken in two places.  His bike helmet was smashed from where he'd fallen.  Thank goodness he was wearing one.\nThe shortsighted and selfish view to remove bike lanes in Toronto is insulting to our intelligence, detrimental to the environment we are trying to protect and will not achieve its aims of reducing congestion but in fact increase it.\nThis is gross overreach from the province into decisions of each city - and frankly decisions that have been made, taxpayer money that has been spent.  Contemplating spending countless millions of our taxpayer money to rip up bike lanes is beyond comprehension.  There are so many real issues that need addressing in our province that would behoove expenditures of this magnitude and Bill 212 is political childishness at best.\nWe have no need or want to undo good, hard work that has been done to make Toronto safer for bikers, better for the environment and encourage physical fitness and not mental and bodily lethargy.\n"

Interference in the working of our city democracy is offensive.\nRemoving bike lanes will come at a great cost to the people of Toronto. The cost of removing them is significant and wasteful.\nThe resulting construction creating still more traffic delay on Bloor is painful to contemplate.\nI feel for families who have purchased bicycles to transport young children, only to no longer have safe routes to travel. A wasted investment.\nSo many companies, large and small, as well as individuals have invested in bikes to transport their goods - Sephora, FedEx, local coffee distributors. They will suffer, as will the companies who are selling these vehicles.\nWith pressure to return to moving by car and truck I shudder to think how much congestion Bill 212 will create. And potentially how much frustration condo owners will experience when they find cycling less viable and car parking unavailable in their condo.\nBill 212 is taking transportation backwards and defies progressive trends. Ontario transportation is already an embarrassment with the unfinished Eglinton line. Bill 212 does not distract us; it simply reinforces that the Conservative government has no progressive vision for transportation and only wants to return to the past.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will only make traffic worse, waste tax dollars and most importantly, make streets dangerous for everyone. Taking away a bike lane won't magically remove its users; bikers will just share the road with drivers which places bikers at risk and does not improve traffic flow for drivers. It is by having these bike lanes that helps seperate bikers from the flow of car traffic. The only viable solution to car traffic is viable, alternative means of transportation. This takes more people out of cars and ultimately improves congestion. Additionally, by removing bike lanes, you are reversing the money and time spent to implement them and taking even more of our money to remove them.  It makes no sense that PROVINCIAL tax dollars is so focused on one MUNICIPAL matter, just so that Doug Ford can feel better about himself for his commute.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024,\u201d particularly concerning its provisions to remove existing bike lanes on major Toronto streets such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. This legislation poses significant risks to public safety, undermines local governance, and disregards the proven benefits of cycling infrastructure.\nImpact on Public Safety:\nThe removal of established bike lanes endangers cyclists by forcing them to share lanes with motor vehicles, increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries. Studies have consistently shown that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collisions and enhances safety for all road users. For instance, research indicates that bike lanes delineated with bollards or traffic cones are most likely to slow drivers and reduce crashes between cars and bikes.\nEconomic and Environmental Considerations:\nEliminating bike lanes may lead to increased traffic congestion and higher emissions, as more individuals might resort to car travel due to perceived safety concerns. This shift contradicts efforts to promote sustainable transportation and combat climate change. Moreover, the financial burden of removing existing infrastructure is substantial. A recent city staff report estimates that removing bike lanes in Toronto will cost at least $48 million, a significant expenditure that could be allocated to more pressing community needs.\nUndermining Local Governance:\nBill 212 represents an overreach of provincial authority into municipal affairs. Local governments possess the contextual understanding necessary to make informed decisions about transportation infrastructure that best serves their communities. By imposing top-down mandates, the bill disregards the principles of local democracy and the autonomy of municipalities to address their unique transportation challenges.\nConclusion:\nIn light of these concerns, I urge the provincial government to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 related to the removal of bike lanes. Maintaining and expanding cycling infrastructure is essential for fostering a safe, sustainable, and economically vibrant urban environment. Collaborative efforts between provincial and municipal authorities are crucial to developing transportation policies that reflect the needs and aspirations of all residents.\n"

The funds could be used more productively to fund housing, health education or anything that has a positive effect on citizens. As a driver, I find that the existence of bike lanes has reduced my use of my car and increased the use of my bike.  So at an individual level, I have contributed to the de -congestion of roads, while increasing my health and fitness and decreasing the pressure of care in an overstretched public health system.\n"

Bike lanes are one of these essential alternatives as are high quality local transit and pedestrian areas.

This becomes ever more important as our population increases in the years ahead. Please stop this bill before it makes gridlock even worse.\n"

Bicycle lanes would help give vehicles a place to get out of the way of these vehicles to allow through way.  I have seen police cars go off lakeshore road onto the bike path to get through, no need to explain how terrifying that is.  We can not pack any more vehicles on the  roads there is no way this is an option.  To be honest the more we accomodate vehicles the worse it becomes for pedestrians. Focus on safety not speed.\n"
