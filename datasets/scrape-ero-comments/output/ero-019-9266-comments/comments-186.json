        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to removing or limiting future bike paths in Toronto.  This is an over-reach of power by the province, in favour of out-of-towners, and it penalizes the people who live here, maybe because they don\u2019t vote for him.  It is an environmental crime to promote use of cars over bicycles. We should be promoting alternatives to car traffic. Safety issues are also important given the risk to cyclists on the streets.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is poorly thought out, does not achieve the goal of reducing traffic, and is not evidence-based. Further, it is significant government overreach. I have no interest in the province meddling in my daily commute. Why should mpps from all over the province have any say in affairs that have no impact on their riding? It's just additional bureaucracy for no reason, every one loses if this passes.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is a massive overreach, centralizing power that should be devolved to municipalities. Ripping up existing bike lanes is a colossal waste of money and puts vulnerable road users at massive risk while increasing their commute times. The gutting of environmental protections will cause devastation. The best way to reduce congestion is to reduce the number of cars on the road. As an alternative, start properly funding public transportation. In short, do better.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this motion. More space for cars at the expense of cyclists is not the solution. Many cyclists use bike lanes throughout the warmer months and bike lanes keep them safe!\nThe government should be getting the eglinton subway line open, and building more lines, connecting across the GTA. With half a million new Canadians every year, we need to build Toronto (and Ontarios) infrastructure to support the population we\u2019ll have in 10 years, not do small measures that make little to no impact today, and in 5 years will make no impact and cause the death of cyclists!\nThink bigger, Mr Ford. Bike lanes, speed limit changes, these are band aid solutions! No more bandaids! We want real change in Ontario, with long term benefits.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are absolutely vital to any city, Toronto has far fewer bike lanes than it needs and restrictions on bicycles is not the answer. Better to restrict the cars, increase public transport and improve our city. Places like Amsterdam and much of Europe have shown how cities prosper and grow when people are prioritized over cars. More bike lanes would also be a great chance to add more trees and increase greenery. I would love to be able to cycle (or walk) in Toronto without some giant SUV trying to murder me every other block.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212, as it undermines municipal authority to prioritize environmentally friendly and safe transportation options like bike lanes. Municipalities are best positioned to make decisions that reduce traffic congestion, cut emissions, and improve road safety. Requiring provincial approval for bike lanes where a vehicle lane might be removed could discourage sustainable transit development, harming both the environment and public safety. This bill imposes unnecessary administrative burdens and hinders cities\u2019 ability to create greener, safer streets for all residents.\n"

Local governments understand their communities\u2019 unique needs and are best suited to decide on infrastructure changes that reduce emissions and promote active, safe transportation. By requiring provincial approval to repurpose traffic lanes for bike lanes, this bill risks stalling vital projects that help reduce congestion and improve air quality, compromising both environmental goals and road safety.\n"

More bike lanes, transit, and sidewalks should be built before prioritizing movement of personal vehicles.\nMunicipalities are also better positioned to understand their needs for cycling and trade offs for moving traffic at a local level. The province should not interfere with this.\nThe province's bill to have authority over whether a bike lane on a municipal street is built in place of a travel lane is contrary to cutting red-tape. This bill will create more red tape.\nI would like to see the province build more bike lanes next to their highways across all of Ontario. Be bold. Provide more options than driving so people feel like they are safe and have a choice for mobility.\n"

        "comment": "On the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is a short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\n"

Environmental assessments and standards should be upheld and not up for removal from the provincial government.\n"

As a cyclist, driver and pedestrian I am supportive of providing transportation options for everyone in the city. Bike lanes provide a safe way for everyone to get around the city, including drivers. People who ride bikes are not Cyclists, they are mothers, fathers, friends, brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles. They are our nurses, doctors and our teachers. They deserve to be safe too. Please reconsider your proposed removal.\n"

In addition, it is counter factual and will only create the opposite effect of reducing gridlock, decrease cyclist safety and negatively impact businesses (doubly hurt but first the installation of the bike lanes, and now tearing them back up again).\nHow about the government concentrate their efforts on healthcare (physician access, long term care homes, disability assistance, autism support for children etc. etc.) education, housing... Anything else really.\n"

It is an overreach and absolutely insane attempt that will make our roads less safe and does not make any actual impact on resolving gridlock. If you want to fix traffic why not fix our public transit first. The Ford government is sickening and the attempt to slip in exempting the 413 from environmental regulation is disgusting act of  deceit. I love this province but all I see are reasons to leave, why should my taxes fund a government that openly disrespects and attempts to ruin public safety, health, and the environment? Why are you wasting money with this failure of a proposal to resolve a problem that isn\u2019t even true. Keep the bike lanes, don\u2019t pave over the green belt , and spend the money fixing our healthcare and educational systems. Do the right thing.\n"
