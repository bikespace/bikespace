        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. All around the world bike lanes are proving to be an effective way of reducing traffic congestion. Every person in a bike lane is likely someone who would otherwise be driving, a bike takes up way less space on the road than a car. I understand that not everyone can bike, however enabling the people who can bike to bike will free up space on the road for those who can\u2019t bike.\nI\u2019m also just appalled at the lack of fiscal awareness that this idea shows. I\u2019m sure this will be a complete waste of tax payer dollars that could otherwise go to more useful causes such as health care and education. We could spend this money making a smarter healthier population, instead we\u2019re going to end up having a less intelligent and less healthy population, which are both things that will be drains on social programs in the future.\nIt is abundantly clear that the premier, Doug Ford, has no regard for the power elation he serves and does things for the sake of doing them, quite often lining the pockets of his friends, instead of improving the province.\n"

This bills represents another example of this government's overreach into municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a direct attack on the personal safety of cyclists, since our safety will clearly count for less than the convenience of drivers who consider it their right to move swiftly through busy places. At a time when pedestrian and cyclist deaths are going up rapidly, this is unconscionable.\nBut since streets with bike lanes have also proven safer for ALL users \u2013 pedestrians, car drivers, and cyclists \u2013 this legislation would also reduce public safety in general.\nAs has been clear from countless studies of urban mobility, the legislation will NOT reduce congestion. In order to reduce congestion, our urban areas need to incentivize more people to get out of cars so that roads are not so crowded. Any moves to curtail safe bike lanes, on streets where close-to-the-ground local officials have deemed such lanes appropriate, will simply force people to stay in their cars in spite of the congestion.\nThis proposed legislation is misguided on every level and should be withdrawn in its entirety.\n"

Please don't support this if you don't want to be morally responsible for deaths and life-changing injuries that will inevitably occur along the affected  routes if the lanes are removed.  Don't play with people's lives just to score cheap culture-war points, when all the evidence shows that bike lanes REDUCE congestion in the city rather than cause it. (The DVP has no bike lanes, but plenty of gridlock)\nI understand that some people want to drive. What I don't understand is why these people want to force everyone else to drive as well. I own a car and a bicycle, and when you make it unsafe for me to use my bike, I will drive. But that does not help other drivers. To reduce gridlock, the goal should be to have as few cars on the streets as possible, and bike lanes help with achieving that.\n"

Drivers and cyclists alike benefit from the availability of bike lanes.\nThis provincial government is yet again trying to interfere with municipal matters that are not their jurisdiction and do not suit the expertise of their leadership. It shows a car-centric attitude towards urban planning that makes cities hostile towards cyclists and pedestrians, while offering little to no benefit to the drivers for whom it is intended to provide relief.\nThe provincial government must, utterly must, focus on non-car solutions to travel throughout the province. This means bike lanes, this mean extensive rail transit, this means medium-density and mixed-used developments that reduce the need for the the use of cars. Not only would rail transit be more efficient, it would also allow the operators to explore non-fossil fuel energy sources without requiring the individual users to make the jump from gas to electric.\n"

        "comment": "Sharing my comment in case it helps inspire thoughts of others:\nThe stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "This is a horrible idea. The PC Government of Ontario is ignoring the data that many large metropolitan cities like Toronto have already produced that bike lanes do not cause grid lock. Removing bike lanes will actually entice more cars onto the roads, increase CO2 emissions, and simply kill more people in road accidents due to the lack of patience drivers will have from sharing a lane of traffic. Bike lanes are not causing grid lock. The excessive amount of cars being driven by one person are causing grid lock. Trying to turn left without a designated light causes grid lock. Blocking the box causes grid lock. The excessive 60,000 cars in Toronto that are being used for ride shares cause grid lock. Invest money into transit and that gets people out of their cars and onto subways and streetcars and reduces grid lock. Leave municipal concerns alone and get back to work getting the Finch and Eglinton LRTs opens and replacing the line 2 subways.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is contrary to the interests of Ontarians. The purpose of government is to protect public goods, like the environment, our communities, and families and individuals who are unable to fend for themselves. Why would we remove the requirement for environmental assessment for 413? I want that step to be done so we can understand exactly what the effect will be. Furthermore, to regulate the municipal use of bike lanes is an overstep of the province into municipal affairs. It also demonstrates an inherent bias against bike users and a preference to use public funds for roads and automotives. Part of the reason we have congestion is because there are poor alternatives to driving. Spend public money, including that which is spent on public servants writing these bills and planning these projects, and direct it to improving transit, healthcare, and even zoning laws -- these are crises in Ontario right now. This bill is a waste of time and money and is just fast-tracking the pillaging of our beautiful province. Thank you.\n"

This feels like a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars and like going back in time.\nAs the population in Toronto continues to increase, it makes no sense to remove bike lanes, when a bike takes up hardly any space compared to a car. Downtown Toronto is dense. We need to encourage other means of getting around as much as possible.\nAs someone who must drive for work (transporting equipment), and prefers to bike on weekends and in evenings, it is much safer for all road users to have separated bike lanes. As a driver, I feel safer knowing cyclists have a designated space. As a cylist, I feel safer knowing I don't have to worry about cars that are passing too close to me.\nIt should be up to the municipalities to do the research to decide where bike lanes should go.\n"
