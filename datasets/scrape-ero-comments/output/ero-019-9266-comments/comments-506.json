        "comment": "Although I don't favour any part of the bill, the portion of the bill allowing the Province to review future installations is at least palatable - but only if the review process is truly a review. In ordinary business and governmental practice, reviews are generally carried out by individuals or panels of individuals who have more expertise than the group that made the initial decision. There is nothing that gives me any confidence whatsoever that this will be the case of reviews carried out under the proposed legislation. As an example, prior to installing the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge streets, the city conducted full environmental assessments, carried out studies and analyzed data with contributions from subject matter experts. There is no indication that the Ford-led government undertook any of these steps prior to its decision that the bike lanes should be removed. It has instead relied on uninformed opinion, populist sentiment and imprecise data with little to no relevance.\nThe Ford-led government is once again stepping outside of its jurisdiction and infringing on a municipality's right to govern itself. The electorate have the right to be governed by the bodies they chose to represent them in jurisdictional matters. Instead, the Ford-led government has chosen to infringe on that right and overturn a sound, informed decision with an uninformed one, for which its central arguments are baseless and without merit.\nThe city incurred significant costs in carrying out studies that insured it was making the right decision prior to installing the bike lanes and then incurred further costs in labor and materials to construct the lanes. The money that has been spent is not recoverable. Once the Ford-led government removes those lanes that money will have been wasted. The Ford-led government will then waste an equal amount of money to remove the progress that was made. This bill is ill-conceived and the worst example of what is not supposed to be able to happen in a country that prides itself on the oversight built into its systems to prevent this very type of whimsical policy decision-making from happening. When the removal of bike lanes fails to reduce gridlock in any meaningful way, my hope is that those that currently support the bill may turn their attention to the cost and the manner in which it was carried out. Keep in mind the streets and highways that have the worst gridlock also have no bike lanes. The way to reduce gridlock is to create networks where people can safely, conveniently and enjoyably get around without a car. Money should be spent improving those networks, rather than removing them.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE) plays a vital role as the advocacy body and voice of the engineering profession in Ontario. Ontario is home to over 85,000 professional engineers, 250,000 engineering graduates, 6,600 engineering post-graduate students and 37,000 engineering undergraduate students, OSPE serves as a unifying force for the engineering community in the province\nI am writing on behalf of OSPE to express our concern regarding the proposed legislation that may prohibit the installation of bike lanes when motor vehicle lanes are removed. We believe this policy is regressive, reinforces a car-centric approach, and undermines municipalities abilities to make choices that align with the needs of their communities\nAs engineers dedicated to fostering safe and efficient transportation systems, we recognize the persistent issues of gridlock and traffic congestion in Toronto and surrounding areas. However, limiting bike lane installation does not address these challenges and instead disregards the growing demand for sustainable and safe transportation options.\nMany experts and politicians alike have spoken out about this proposed legislation, and we echo this sentiment and caution against reverting to a transportation model that prioritizes cars at the expense of cyclists and pedestrians. The safety implications are significant; with six cyclists tragically killed in Toronto this year alone, policies that do not protect vulnerable road users are unacceptable.\nDifferent neighborhoods and municipalities require customized solutions based on population density and the community needs:\nHigher density routes require mass transit Light Rail Trains (LRT) & Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) with dedicated lanes, where it is economically feasible.\nAreas with more sparse public transit services, could have on demand transport (ODT). Many lessons can be learned from Edmonton who currently has the largest ODT network in Canada.\nThe downtown core could benefit from mobility as a service (MaaS), which is deemed the future of public transportation. MaaS integrates various forms of transport and transport related services in one comprehensive and on demand mobility service enabling users to plan, book and pay for multiple types of services all on one platform.\nWe urge the government to reconsider reevaluating the proposed legislation and empower municipalities to make decisions that reflect their communities' needs and invest in various public transportation initiatives to alleviate gridlock. A balanced transportation strategy must prioritize multi-modal solutions that support both cyclists and motorists, enhancing the safety and quality of life in our cities.\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue. We hope to see a commitment to forward-thinking transportation policies that prioritize safety, sustainability, and municipal autonomy.\nSincerely,\n"

Having them bike lanes put Toronto up on par with some other best cities in the world such as Paris, Amsterdam and the list goes on. We are already a car centric society, just take at look at up down and everyone agrees, and it makes perfect sense considering how sparsely packed everything is. However, in a densely packed area like downtown Toronto, it makes sense that a bike lane needs to exist to provide a safe, fast and convenient way for people to transit. Removing the bike lane would do no help but encouraging more road rage towards cyclists and making accident more frequent. So please for the love of God and the people of Toronto, don\u2019t remove the bike lane, it\u2019s not going to solve the traffic problem in Toronto if not making it worse. We need a transit system that actually WORKS in densely packed downtown and bike is one of them. Don\u2019t go backwards!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the removal of existing bike lanes on Bloor and Davenport.\nBike lanes provide alternative, safe transportation routes and as the parent of two children, these lanes will protect them when they travel downtown.\nConstruction is the issue. Condo developments and constant road work, often multiple projects at different times on the same stretch of road, is the blocker. Delivery trucks parked on major streets are much more of an issue, as is general congestion due to volume. More lanes means more cars and it's already difficult enough to get around downtown.\nThis is money better spent on traffic patrols ticketing trucks parked in lanes, faster construction of LRT and transit, and more bike lanes on smaller streets!\nDO NOT CREATE MORE CONSTRUCTION ON MAJOR ROUTES!!!!\n"

        "comment": "Re: Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane; ERO number: 019-9266\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 212. I feel compelled to speak out against the regressive amendments proposed in Bill 212, as I strongly believe it will negatively affect the health and safety of Ontario and its residents.\nI would like to raise the following concerns regarding the amendments to Part XII - Municipal By-Laws and Bicycle Lanes:\nDiscouragement of Sustainable Transportation: The bill increases the approval process required for municipalities to install or modify bicycle lanes, potentially disincentivizing sustainable transportation options. By adding bureaucratic hurdles, municipalities may deprioritize or delay bike lane projects, reinforcing reliance on car travel. Motor vehicles contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution, therefore alternative, lower-emission transport options like cycling must be prioritized.\nReduced Efficiency for Infrastructure Development: The proposed approval process can create unnecessary delays and additional costs for cities aiming to develop bicycle lanes. Streamlined procedures for bike lane installation would enable municipalities to rapidly respond to urban mobility needs and enhance public safety for cyclists. Requiring Ministry approval and information requests, especially when changes reduce car lanes, would make the process more cumbersome and infeasible for municipalities, ultimately hampering efforts to create safer, more sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nUndermining of Climate Goals: The amendments emphasize maintaining the \u201corderly movement\u201d of motor vehicle traffic, which could bias the Ministry's decision-making against bicycle lane projects. Given that private vehicles contribute to urban congestion and increase infrastructure costs, reallocating road space to bikes could help achieve broader climate and public health goals. However, this amendment would make it more challenging to make that transition, keeping cities locked into car-centric planning rather than promoting efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transport.\nIn summary, this legislation should be opposed because the amendments will make it more difficult for municipalities to incentivize alternative modes of transportation, increase the time and costs associated with implementing infrastructure to reduce congestion and compromise municipal and provincial climate commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is strong evidence to suggest that unfettered support for car-centric infrastructure, colloquially thought of as the \u201cone more lane\u201d mentality, makes traffic congestion worse. I urge the Ministry of Transportation to consider these concerns, as the implementation of Bill 212 will only result in a perceived benefit for the few at the expense of Ontario's most vulnerable road users.\n"

        "comment": "I find it shocking that the Ontario Government is considering removing freedom of choice and personal responsibility from it's citizens.  Bike lanes give people options to take ownership over their way of getting around.  At best, this bill adds red tape and bureaucracy to cities that try to give their residents options.  At worst, it dictates how people have to get around in a way that may not be fiscally prudent, forcing people to invest in car ownership, insurance payments, and fuel costs, just to get around when a bicycle could do the same for a fraction of the cost.  Not to mention that forcing bicyclists onto busy roadways will cause further congestion for drivers as cars take up far more room on the road than a bicycle in a bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "Adding more car lanes increases traffic. This is a phenomenon well understood by city planners. The more car infrastructure you build, the more inclined people will be to drive. The more people drive, the more traffic there is. Removing bike lanes WILL NOT reduce traffic; it will have the opposite effect. Cars per capita are an extremely space-inefficient mode of transport. Instead of tearing up bike lanes we should be investing in public transport.\n"

        "comment": "Unbelievably short-sighted and lacking common sense.\nMaybe the transport minister should try to read up on urban planning and phenomena such as induced demand to see that removing bike infrastructure is possibly one of the worst ways to reduce traffic in Toronto. Obviously they don't understand these concepts as their only bright ideas for reducing traffic is adding more lanes to the 401 so more cars can get stuck in gridlock in downtown Toronto. Why would we ever increase GO Train/Bus availability and alternative methods of transportation that isn't 1 person in a car.\nWhatever happened to Vision Zero in Toronto? We'll make the city safer for pedestrians and cyclists by removing infrastructure designed to protect them from vehicles. Seems like a good idea to me.\nDoug and the Transport Minister could learn something by trying to comprehend what people who actually care about their city and it's livability are trying to communicate to them.\nI got here from a video by \"Oh The Urbanity!\" on YouTube and have been a consistent viewer of another channel called \"Not Just Bikes\".

Bike lanes are a crucial part of creating a safer, more inclusive city for everyone \u2014 including those of us who still feel unsafe cycling.

        "comment": "BILL 212 WILL MOVE US BACKWARDS - WE NEED TO SUSTAINABLY MOVE FORWARD INSTEAD\nThe proposal of Bill 212 to remove certain bike lanes and create a more difficult process for the implementation of new ones in the name of reducing vehicle congestion is extremely concerning.\nTo begin, research has shown that creating more traffic lanes creates induced demand. This means that an initial decrease in vehicle travel time incentivizes more people to drive their cars, and actually contributes to more congestion in the long run (WSP & Rand Europe, 2018).\nBeyond the fact that this Bill will not actually address the problem that it says it will, the removal and prevention of bike lanes will have detrimental impacts on the achievement of local and global emission reduction targets. This Bill is essentially encouraging more people to drive their cars and weakening infrastructure for healthier and more sustainable travel methods.\nRemoving bike lanes is going backwards. By implementing Bill 212, we are setting ourselves up for failure and more problems in the long run. I urge the provincial government to rethink their decision to remove existing bike lanes and instead contribute to more cycling infrastructure that will support environmental sustainability when it is needed most.\nReferences\nWSP & Rand Europe (2018), Latest Evidence on Induced Travel Demand: An Evidence Review.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\n"

As a daily user of these bike lanes, I rely on them for my personal and professional activities, which include supporting local businesses and performing community volunteer work by delivering food and supplies using my cargo bike.\nThese bike lanes are not just a mode of transportation; they are essential for the safety and protection of families, including my own. My son and I use these lanes regularly, and their presence significantly reduces the risk of accidents and ensures a safe commuting environment for all cyclists.\nThe decision to reduce or eliminate bike lanes would have a detrimental impact on the community, particularly for those of us who depend on them for daily activities and contributions to local welfare.
