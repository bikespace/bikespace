        "comment": "I think what we need from Doug Ford is a detailed explanation that demonstrates that bike lanes increase congestion and that the  removal of bike lanes will lead to a reduction of traffic in any substantial amount worthy of Torontonian tax payer dollars. It is absolutely absurd that this is even a proposition when it has been showed time and time again that induced demand is the cause of traffic and more lanes does not reduce traffic. Prove your work or it is nothing but junk and distraction.\n"

        "comment": "Why are we wasting money on this stupidity?\nBike lanes make it easy for people to commute without a car. People should really not be driving if they can bike safely or take transit.\nWe should make one way streets with timed lights if we want to move car traffic.\nStreetcars should get the green lights automatically.\nTaking out bike lanes that have been built is a waste of money. Not a priority for the province and really not the business of the province to intervene against the city about.\n"

Those actions impact traffic far more than taking bikes out of vehicle lanes.\nInvest in our education and healthcare services and stop punishing cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians.\nDoug, you're going to hate traffic more when cyclists are in the same lane as you. Guaranteed. We will not back down on this. Removing bike lanes will kill people.\n"

        "comment": "I, and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people, realize that bike lanes are not causing traffic. A lack of other transportation options is causing traffic. On roads where there are no bike lines, cyclists still use them and although they don\u2019t take up and entire lane, they effectively make the lane they\u2019re in useless to vehicular traffic. Might as well make it safer for everyone and give them their own small lane. People pass cyclists on roads with no bike lanes dangerously. Sometimes too close to the cyclist, sometimes cutting people in the left lane off to get around. Not having bike lanes puts lives at risk and causes bottlenecks. And you\u2019re probably thinking, well, \u201ccyclists aren\u2019t there all the time\u201d, but are cyclists not all over the city during commuting times when traffic is also at its heaviest? Outside of rush hour, there isn\u2019t enough traffic to even matter. Having a bike lane doesn\u2019t affect low traffic.\nHonestly, the things this provincial government chooses to spend my money on is absurd. Can we fund more public transit projects? The Eglinton Crosstown and its extension are great, the scarborough line is great, but we need more even further out than that. We need high speed rail. We need more trains going to different parts of different cities outside of Toronto. People commute from further cities to Mississauga, Scarborough, Ajax, Oakville, etc and where there is public traffic, it would take extraordinarily longer to get there using it than it does by car. This creates lots of traffic. Not bike lanes. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this huge bleeding cut, and instead of putting a bandage on it, you\u2019re taking a bandage off an older cut and hoping that solves the new cut.\nI don\u2019t know if me writing this is going to do anything, but I hope it gets read and I hope you have to think about it. You are in charge of putting forth policies for the people, and I hope that if you realized that the people don\u2019t like it, you\u2019d stop.\nThanks for your time.\n"

        "comment": "Removing numerous bike lanes that are both integral to traffic flow and to the safety of Torontonians is perhaps the most egregious proposed legislation I have seen of late. Not only is it a massive waste of money, but will further impede traffic to to the necessary construction to remove them. Dedicated bike lanes reduce traffic congestion as they promote cycling and allow traffic to move around cyclists with greater ease and safety. A logical step to reduce congestion would be to further restrict downtown street parking during rush hour, or actually enforce the current laws. This is a massive overreach by the province on what should be a municipal matter.\n"

        "comment": "IN SUPPORT OF MORE BIKE LANES\nA leader in this country that I admire above all others is Valerie Plante, the wildly popular and much loved Mayor of Montreal. She is a visionary, a leader, a role model and a person who listens to the people. She has boosted public transit, created sponge parks, increased the tree canopy, massively boosted bike lanes, greened the city with native plants in boulevards, closed streets to cars in front of schools. And she is beloved for all of it. And she didn't need to buy votes with bribes because she was elected on her policies. She crafts policy based on recommendations from advisors who are actually experts in their field, not just her wealthy friends or whoever texted her that morning. She is moving that City forward in a way that puts Toronto to shame. One reason she is successful is because her Provincial counterparts don't get in her way, they support her. Unlike here in Ontario where the ONPCs made multiple bad decisions based on zero research and then had to reverse them a few months later. Greenbelt, Bill 23 DC refunds, urban boundary expansions and now bike lane removals.\nFor the sake of the people in this tanking province PLEASE listen to the multitude of traffic experts who are telling you that adding MORE bike lanes and offering people choices on tranport other than cars is the way to get out of gridlock. Go to Europe and see how they get around with a train or LRT every 2 - 10 minutes. Scrap the highway expansions. Build MORE bike lanes. Build a TON of more public transit and make it free for everyone.\nThese are the progressive policies your government should espouse. Instead you are taking us back to 1950.\n"

        "comment": "This is utterly ridiculous.  Each city should be able to make decisions about 'traffic' independently.  This seems to be more a 'Toronto' issue.  The number one complaint about driving in Ottawa is about speeding, street racing and loud vehicles.  The congestion we do have in our city is due to a completely dysfunctional public transit system, combined with above normal construction (due to LRT).  So 'solutions' to traffic congestion in Ottawa are simple (not easy):  better public transit (more frequent, more reliable, more coverage, cheaper fairs), and a real active-transport network (not the existing patchwork of disconnected paths).\nStudy after study shows two things:  1) active transport users (walking, biking, scooters, etc) spend MORE $$ in local shops and 2) adding lanes for vehicular traffic, simply creates MORE traffic and congestion.   Maybe Toronto should take a look at the 401 and ask itself....how many more lanes would we need to get rid of all the traffic congestion?   Are the 14 existing lanes (in some places) not enough?  Did the 401 always have this many lanes or did it start out with less and then we increased its capacity thinking 'if we just add another lane or two will it reduce traffic congestion'?  I think the hwy systems in and around TO have been expanding over the decades, and yet traffic is getting worse.  Can our leaders not spot the irony here?  It's insane to keep doing the same thing, expecting different results.\nFinally, its hard not to feel this is nothing other than a petty issue that Mr. Ford has with they cycling community.  I have yet to hear a coherent argument with evidence based reasoning why this is a good idea.  We want our communities to have amazing livable cities, with healthy citizens, that contribute to the local economy.  Cyclists do this.  They use less healthcare, they have less impact on infrastructure, they spend more in local shops, the decrease carbon footprint which has a positive impact on our environment, they KILL far fewer people (traffic accidents), etc, etc.  Let's just give them a bit of space, and stop running them over with cars.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am a city planner by profession and would like to submit my comments and knowledge regarding this proposed Bill.\nThe proposal flies in the face of established best practice for reducing gridlock. Furthermore, it is counter to the well established understanding that any interventions to increase car lanes has an adverse effect on vehicle travel times.\nThe bill lacks any type of consultation and research with experts on this topic and it shows. If the ministers would like to improve traffic flow for all, an initiative I full support, I would seriously caution against supporting this bill as it currently stands.\nFrom a best-practice and backed research perspective, the reallocation of road space to accurately reflect actual usage: bike users, drivers, and pedestrians, has a positive effect on ALL users. By removing bike lanes from roads, this bill will force cyclists to merge with vehicles thereby slowing down car drivers, and increasing the risk of serious conflict and collision.\nMoreover, ministers need only look at any other country or even province for that matter that is tackling the issue of traffic. Look to Vancouver or look to Montreal. Measurable successes are clearly shown in these cities where bike lane introduction has reduced traffic times for all (yes that includes drivers).\nI do not support this bill. I do not support the proposed forcing of cyclists back into lanes with vehicles. As a driver and a planner, the road is safer for everyone, more pleasant to drive on when best-practice separation of space is taken into account.\nOn a more personal note, the current government ministers should have a long look at their motivations behind the implementation of this bill as it displays a shocking lack of regard for any actual proven measures at improving the quality of life for road users.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly apposed this bill.  The government should be increasing bike lanes and protecting bikers from traffic for their entire trip to reduce gridlock not eliminating bike lanes.  Keeping bikes seperate from cars saves lives and keeps cars off the road.  I would bike my kids to daycare and school and bike to work if I could safely do so for my entire trip and be protected from traffic. The research and science behind this decision is not available and going against what urban planners tell us works.to reduce gridlock.  I urge you to reconsider this proposed legislation.  It is a terrible idea.  Leave it to the municipalities and cities to decide about bike lanes and support them on the creation and maintenance of bike lanes.\n"

In the end it will likely balance out to roads being just as congested. The only differences being less freedom of choice and more pollution. I'm sure you already know all this. I guess the other difference is that it will make it pretty clear who not to vote for in the next provincial election.\n"
