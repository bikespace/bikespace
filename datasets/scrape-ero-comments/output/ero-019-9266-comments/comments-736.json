The city is a shared space, and we should be prioritizing climate-friendly transit. I do not own a car, and have typically walked or used the TTC to get around. Having just moved to a less central location, I'd like to start biking more. Having safe bike lanes on major roads is one of the only reason I'm confident enough to do so.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto is already a dangerous city for cyclists, with thousands of cycling related injuries presenting to emergency rooms every year. If the Government of Ontario's plan is approved, Toronto will become even more dangerous for cyclists, with the removal of bike lanes on three of Toronto's busiest streets, and possibly more in the future. This is not the solution to gridlock for commuters coming into the city. Public transit into and out of the city needs to be improved, with plenty of infrastructure in satellite towns for parking cars safely so that people in rural neighbourhoods from improved transit.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my concerns regarding the proposed bill 212. The sections related to adding more highways will only be a temporary panacea for reducing congestion. Instead adding additional highways leads to induced demand and there will be even more traffic and congestion. I would encourage MPPs to read 'The Power Broker' by Robert Caro and look at outcome of adding more highways: it always led to more congestion. If the government is serious about reducing traffic, they must look into other options for moving Ontarians around. This includes bike lanes and more public transit (busses and trains).\nI would also like to voice my displeasure at the sections related to reducing environmental assessments. Climate change is a serious issue and we should be doing everything possible to preserve the environment we currently have. We should also seek alternatives to private vehicle usage: adding more highways is not the answer.\n"

Bike lanes have become a major part of our tourism draw, allowing for bike enthusiasts to conduct events throughout Perth County, stopping to eat at local farms and ending in Stratford, where they can safely ride and enjoy our restaurants and shopping.\nThe Premier has no knowledge of what our city does or does not need.  Stay out of our municipal politics, it is our decision what we do or do not build for bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am very disappointed to hear about the pending removal of bike lanes in the Toronto core. This is key infrastructure that enables people to stay active, reduce pollution, and reduce traffic and noise. I use these lanes to get around the Bloor West area often, as does the rest of my family. Mixing bikes with cars without bike lanes increases physical risk to cyclists. Bike lane infrastructure takes a while to take hold as people trust that there are sufficient networks of lanes to get around the whole city. The solution is to add more lanes as opposed to making less. Also, this is a significant provincial over-reach; stay out of local politics and city planning! People who live in the suburbs should not dictate what happens in the inner core. People who don't like to sit in traffic can use the TTC/go trains. Doug Ford, you should try the Go Train!\n"

As a downtown resident I am and will be extremely angry if Bill 212 is passed. There needs to be protected space for everyone on the roads of Toronto and the removal of bike lanes will not improve the traffic congestion in Toronto. Maybe focus on opening the Ellington LRT and developing other public transit services.\n"

It's called induced demand and has been studied to death for decades. It's the same reason why the 401 is jammed packed during rush hour and obivously there are no bike lanes on these highways.\nThe main issue is that people like Ford and the Transport Minister think they can solve congestion, well the truth is that they can't. They will spend billions wasting money trying to solve this, we will look back decades from now and see how foolish this gov't is.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing the amount of bike lanes will reduce the number of people who are opting to use active transportation. Community members of all ages are more likely to walk and bike when they are supported by infrastructure like bike lanes to do so. Additionally, requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lane implementation (even just when that implementation removes a lane of motor vehicle traffic) will add red tape bureaucracy that the current Provincial Government wants to avoid, and will ultimately reduce the number of municipalities implementing these traffic calming, health-promoting, and environmentally-friendly measures. Adding lanes of motor vehicle traffic, whether on highways or in municipalities, does not reduce traffic and driving times - it induces traffic by promoting driving, and increases the likelihood of motor vehicle crashes.\nDriving motor vehicles rather than taking active or public transportation is not more convenient. It is just more comfortable and normalized. The Province has the opportunity to support eco-friendly and healthy transportation for our communities, and it is demonstrating that with its investments and stated commitments to increasing train transit around Ontario. If safe bike lanes are not maintained and added to our streets, the Province will contradict its own investments, and instead make Ontario a less safe, less healthy, less environmentally-friendly place to live.\n"

As a constant user of the bike lanes I have found them to be lifesaving as drivers in Toronto do not know how to share the road with cyclists. Please do not remove any bike lanes as their existence will enable more people to use them as a form of commuting. This will help the environment, people's mental health, and people's physical health. If the removal of bike lanes does go ahead I will not be voting for the current provincial government in the next election.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider the impacts Bill-212 will have. We all want to get around cities easier and safer, and there are many of us who also want climate-friendly options. Transportation is the second largest emitter in cities, and in Toronto accounts for 35% of the cities carbon emissions. Separated bike lanes are an important port of how people currently get around, and when there are more of them, even more people will use them. These are people who will then not be using a car, which translates into less cars and less traffic. Getting rid of bike lanes will only increase congestion. This needs to be done in parallel to improvements to public transportation options, including subways, streetcars and buses. I have seen the development plans for the neighbourhood in the west end of Toronto, and more lanes for cars is not going to solve the massive influx of people planned to arrive there, let alone our current day congestion problem. Its critical people are safe to walk and bike, especially being mindful of kids and seniors. And when you listen to people in the community, this is what separated bike lanes are doing, acting as buffers between the cars and people walking streets, particularly busy streets like Bloor, Yonge and University. As a parent, someone who also drives around Toronto, I want more of these separated bike lanes, not less. Cities around the world are doing this and it\u2019s working, even in places you might not expect like Texas. Please reconsider this, arguably overreaching, Bill and let cities do what the people who live in them want. And bigger cities want separated bike lanes, as well as more and better public transportation to get around, so we can leave the streets to those who really need it.\n"

        "comment": "Congestion in Toronto IS getting worse (costs GTA ~$11 Billion annually according to Toronto Region Board of Trade) but it's because the GTA has grown by ~500,000 people since 2020 and is expected to add another 3 million in the next 20 years. Removing a few\u00a0safe bike lanes in downtown Toronto and replacing the thousands of people on bikes with some cars won't improve congestion, especially considering the months of construction-congestion will outweigh the few seconds expected to be saved for drivers afterwards. But it will kill people, tear families apart and waste millions of taxpayer dollars. Please do better.\n"

Removing the existing bike lanes will just cause issues in our daily routines, put us in danger by sharing the road with drivers.\nWe urge you to consider our petitions and take in consideration that cycling is the cleanest form of transportation.\nThanks.\n"

        "comment": "Throughout my life I've enjoyed biking with my family, friends, and now my own child in Ontario for work, errands and fun. Biking is a great leveller for moving around. It is affordable, active and good for the air we breath.\nBike lanes have very slowly improved over my lifetime. From painted lines and shared lanes to protected lanes with barriers only recently have I found almost enough protected bike routes to help me get around safely in the GTHA. Still, there are dangerous areas where I still worry for my safety and the painted line or shared lane sign is not enough. As a province we are in need of more protected bike lanes.\nThis legislation dismisses this need and reverses the slight progress that has been in safe bike culture in Ontario. It is a travesty to think this legislation could become reality.\nBike lane projects have often been spurred on by cycling deaths within our communities in Ontario. These projects often replace a lane that was dedicated for automobile use only with a safe lane for cyclists. These bike lanes, like the Keddy Access Trail in Hamilton named after Jay Keddy who was killed biking on the location of the trail, act as memorials for those who have died cycling there. With this legislation these lanes and there history and role as memorial are on the chopping block.\nTo think that these deaths and the continued deaths of cyclists on our Ontario roads are considered not \"enough\" by the Provincial Government to even warrant the beginnings of a functional bike lane system begs the question: how many Ontarians will have to die to justify bike lanes existing in our province?\nThis legislation is dangerous, reckless and a provincial overreach. Keep bike lanes local. Honour the memory of those Ontarions who have died cycling. Make communities safer by building up bike lane infrastructure. Abandon this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a bad idea which makes bikes the scapegoats  for the problems of having too many cars. As reported by the CBC, the evidence is mixed (at best) for how much bike lanes actually contribute to congestion. The government's claim that only 1.2% of people in Toronto bike is intentionally misleading - in areas with bike lanes, the number can be up to 8%.\nWhen drivers are slowed by even a couple of minutes, the government is willing to spend billions of dollars attempting to fix things. Yet, when 6 cyclists have already been killed this year in the GTA, the government couldn't care less. A couple of months ago, I attended my first ghost ride for a cyclist killed by a motorist in Guelph. The complete randomness of that collision made me realize that it could easily have been me (or my wife or my friends).\nI don't own a car - I need my bike for many of my day to day chores such as getting groceries. Thankfully, the road to my local grocery store has bike lanes. The thought of making that trip without a bike lane is a scary one. Cycling should never be an act of courage.\n"
