        "comment": "Toronto is far past the point that it is driveable. You can\u2019t keep building population dense areas like City Place and Liberty Village and think that traffic will be the same it was 10-15 years ago. If you want to reduce gridlock, provide people other options - reliable, safe  public transit that runs at convenient times, protected bike lanes so people can ride safely. Build walkable cities, ensure outlying cities and towns have adequate resources so they don\u2019t need to commute Toronto.\nThis government has repeatedly demonstrated it doesn\u2019t care about the residents of central Toronto . They clearly care more about commuters and tourists. They rush to build population-dense communities and don\u2019t care about their quality of life once the buildings are filled.\nThey have demonstrated that the owners and residents of single-family homes are valued more than those in multi-unit residential areas.\nRemoving bike lanes is not going to prevent gridlock on the DVP, the Gardiner, the Allen.\nRemoving bike lanes is not going to prevent gridlock anywhere in Toronto. The only thing that will prevent gridlock is reducing the number of people driving.\nOnce the bike lanes are removed, and the government realizes that it did not make an impact, the drivers will be angry that you lied and the cyclists will be angry that you didn\u2019t listen. You will have no one to blame it on but yourselves.\n"

In fact, it will make it worse.\nhttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/58x8436d\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856423001465\nWe need to invest heavily into multiple modes of transportation to provide people with more choices of which mode of transit to use. This will get cars off the road so that only people that need to drive are the dominant road users and will help traffic flow better.\nThe proposal of this bill is so backwards and is completely against what other major and minor cities worldwide are doing in order to move people more efficiently.\nBike lanes, mass public transit, regional rail are much better investments than more road capacity for cars. Cars are an inherently inefficient way to move a large number of people. They have their place in today's society, but we cannot afford to keep on investing in cars and not people!\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is both shortsighted and dangerous. It is also an incredible waste of tax payer money. We should be investing in green, sustainable city practices. World-class cities are not built for cars. World class cities are built for walking, cycling, and public transportation. This obsession with removing bike lanes is a weird Ford-ism, and is NOT supported by me. I am primarily a driver, but also cycle and walk on weekends to do errands. As a driver, I appreciate bike lanes as I do not want to hit cyclists. I also appreciate cyclists as they are not in a car contributing to traffic, and they are not contributing to climate change. Which I, as a driver, am. On the other side, as a cyclist, these bike lanes make me SAFE. They mean I\u2019m not going to be hit on my ride. They mean I\u2019m going to make it home.\nAs a taxpayer and home owner in Toronto, I am not pleased with the thought that I will be paying to rip out these bike lanes that I just paid to install. It\u2019s outrageous.\nI do not support this. I will protest. Rethink this lunacy.\n"

A distinction should be recognized for emergency, delivery, maintenance vehicles versus enabling mostly more private cars.\n4. A significant traffic congestion surcharge should apply to all non essential vehicles on the roads in Toronto, payable monthly or semi annually, enforced, to discourage non essential use of the roadways.\n5. The province is overstepping its authority by deciding local issues like inner city usage of roads with bike lanes where the pros and cons are felt locally not provincially.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to this proposal to review municipal bike lanes and specifically to remove bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge Streets. There is no evidence that removing bike lanes reduces congestion. Bike lanes, particularly in downtowns where there are a lot of people making short trips, reduce congestion by shifting trips from more congested modes (both cars and transit, for these routes), reduce GHG emissions, and most importantly improve safety.\nI personally use both the Bloor and University bike lanes. With the University bike lane to Dundas my ride has become much safer, since I can avoid taking Dundas from Beverly, which is narrow and doesn't have a bike lane.\nTo address congestion downtown, I would recommend focusing on addressing congestion resulting from construction, and improving enforcement, particularly of illegal parking and blocking of intersections.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my extreme displeasure with the proposed provincial legislation concerning bike lanes (in The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024). By having this provincial government rule on whether municipalities can remove an existing vehicle lane to create a bike lane, you are potentially prohibiting the expansion of active transportation corridors in older areas of cities and towns.\nStudies in various North American and European cities have shown that bike lanes don't contribute to gridlock. Improving inter-connected active transportation routes and public transit takes more vehicles off the roads, which actually decreases traffic congestion.\nToronto's proposal to implement a congestion charge, and put that money into public transit, would have done more to improve gridlock. Unfortunately, this provincial government refused to consider that plan, and traffic continues to increase in the city. I live outside of Toronto, and would have wholeheartedly supported a congestion charge to travel into the city by car.\nAn additional concern about the proposed legislation is that municipalities might have to remove existing bike lanes. Cities and towns have spent money studying, planning, and implementing these infrastructure improvements. To require them to remove the lanes, and assist in paying for their removal, represents a significant amount of wasted spending. Municipalities have challenges keeping costs under control and funding their priorities. Requiring them to spend taxpayers money to remove something that was paid for by taxpayers is simply counterproductive.\nBy potentially curtailing bike lanes, this provincial government is prioritizing car users over bicycle users. Active transportation will increase if people feel safe using dedicated bike lanes. If they have to compete with vehicles on the roads, they will feel unsafe and will be less likely to use bicycles for transportation. Getting people out of their cars and walking or biking would improve their health, decreasing reliance on our struggling health-care system.\nOne of the supposed goals of this provincial government is to eliminate red tape. By requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes, you are actually adding to the bureaucratic red tape for municipalities. Municipal leaders know their communities best. Let them do their work without so much provincial legislative interference, and concentrate on province-wide issues that are part of your mandate.\nI've read that many of Toronto's gridlock issues have been caused more by construction than by bike lanes. Blaming bike lanes without considering other contributing factors shows single-minded support for a car-dependent society. Progressive countries and cities have embraced public transit and active transportation, thereby reducing car usage. If you want Toronto to be considered a world-class city, let it act like one and have the ability to implement its own innovative infrastructure policies.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out bike lanes without any proof that they contribute to congestion will only cause further gridlock. Additionally, attacking cyclists and people who commute via bicycles will make it harder for Ontario to reduce its carbon output and prevent positive action towards mitigating the effects of climate change. Above all, removing bike lanes and making it impossible to put them in will make it more dangerous for Ontario residents on two wheels.\n"

        "comment": "I'm sorry - I just do not get how bike lanes reduce congestion. All I see is more and more cars, trucks etc sitting in traffic, barely moving, (increase of pollution just sitting there) while the bike lanes I drive by the most sit basically empty. This would be the Bloor West one for 1000% sure, Yonge Street around Rosedale, University Ave around the hospitals (no place for cars to drop off people going to the hospitals), and Bayview Extension which I understand is undergoing some changes.\nRegardless, bike lanes are for the most part money not well spent - money that could be put to more important issues in Toronto currently such as homelessness, mental issues, housing etc. Or how about just general cleaning of the city? Look at the weeds and garbage etc everywhere - Toronto is becoming an embarrassment.\nOne of my biggest beefs with bike lanes as follows:\nMedia coverage of how wonderful bike lanes are NEVER comment on the fact of how badly behaved many many cyclists are. They act like they own the road - oh and the sidewalks, laneways, crosswalks etc. And they don't WALK across a crosswalk - they ride through them - often at high speed. I have had friends knocked over by cyclists going too fast and running stop signs - one having her shoulder dislocated as the cyclist rode on giving her the finger, nice.\nSo - how about some sort of licensing for cyclists where they need to pass a road test? And pay something towards all of these bike lanes they are demanding. Or get insurance so when they injure someone or damage a car,there is coverage.\nIt would just be nice if they were better behaved - some common courtesy about SHARING the streets with everybody on them these days - people, cars, scooters, etc.\nOn the film clip they kept showing on the news on Bloor Street, it shows a car in the right hand lane making a right hand turn. The car is already part way into it's turn when a cyclists comes along from behind and makes sure to drive to the right so that he can go around in front of the car as he is obviously the more important person here. First this is dangerous and it's totally unnecessary - why can't they just wait a few seconds to let the car finish it's turn or just go behind it?\nOn Queens Quay by the ferry docks which is an area full of tourists - there are traffic lights specifically for cyclists - do they abide by them? The very odd one does but most don't pay any attention.\nAnd of course everyone loves to note about bike lanes and use in places like Amsterdam but all you have to do is google \"Amsterdam bike riding problems\" and it's pretty shocking many of the comments. An example:\n\"I've been living here for a couple of years, but throughout my whole life I've cycled through the city plenty of times before moving in completely. I really enjoy cycling and I therefore always opt for it whenever I have to go somewhere.\nDuring the past few months however moving around in a bike through the city has started feeling like a progressively more dangerous activity. Every day, whether it is commuting early in the morning or leaving my job late at night, I come across plenty of cyclists that plainly disregard the most basic conduct rules, like the appropriate path for each direction, through which sides to take over or the priority in crossroads.\nI've even been in life threatening accidents, where a visibly high scooter driver nearly T bones me by driving on the wrong side of the road in a crossroads where he wasn't visible. I've discussed this with other friends and they also agree that the roads are becoming less safe and in general they agree that there is a rage inducing behaviour amongst cyclists.\"\n\" In cities where cars are more frequent in the city center they are very careful around pedestrians. They adapt the speed to the number of people and the traffic situation.\nIn Amsterdam there cyclists apply full speed. It\u2019s like \u201csince I have the right I will apply maximum velocity and enter tunnel vision mode\u201d \"\nAnd I love bike riding - have been doing it all my life. But it is totally out of hand now in many countries.\nWhen will we smarten up????\n"

Removing cycling infrastructure will make cycling more dangerous by creating more points of conflict between drivers and cyclists.\nAdditionally, cycling promotes healthier living compared to more sedentary lifestyles that many car users are used to. Cycling is also a more environmentally sustainable mode of transportation. Addressing climate change and improving the quality of life for Ontarians is a key part of the Provincial Planning Statement. Removing bike lanes and increasing promoting car-centric lifestyles are directly contravening the intent of the PPS.\n"

Especially since it's proposal to remove bike lanes is not based on any data or scientific studies. We need to look at actual research to inform the direction of our infrastructure spending and not make changes based on anecdotes. (See attached study)\nWe have built up low density suburbs for far too long which have continued to fuel the need to get around by using a car.
