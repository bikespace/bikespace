        "comment": "This is wonderful news to a Bloor Street community that has been crushed by gridlock post installation of these poorly located bike lanes.  Thank you Doug Ford and the whole team for listening to members of the communities so badly impacted!\nIt is still mind-boggling to understand how a small group of City Councilors can unilaterally decide to install bike lanes in a community they don't live in without even a consultation or vote.  In a community heavily occupied by families and elderly members where commuting by cars are a necessity, these bike lanes used SPARSLY for 4 months of the year by less than 5% of the community has been a disaster.\nFinally removing these bike lanes will allow members IN THE COMMUNITY to return to normal commute times from school, work, extracurriculars without having to plan an additional 30-45 minutes to their travel times.\nBike lanes are great when planned properly on side streets - but as an avid cyclist that rides more than 2500kms a year - you can't hitch your kids hockey equipment on a bike in the winter or ride your bike with you daughter to a dance recital when its pouring rain out.  Of my 2500kms of cycling this year, can safely  say I've used the lanes less than 1% of the time.  Those that cycle don't want to do that on a busy stop and go street like Bloor.  In fact most of us would avoid Bloor and find better more scenic routes.\nThank you!!\n"

        "comment": "re proposed Bill 212: The most effective way for managing the traffic issues in a municipality is from the municipal government who know and have direct knowledge of the problems, issues and impacts, and the needs of the City's citizens. Many studies locally and internationally, and several cities across the world, e.g. Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Seattle, Portland, Ottawa to name a few, have shown that bike lanes have proven to be effective in reducing traffic gridlock and keeping people moving, because bike lanes are not exclusive to bicycles, but for multi-mode transportation. Most cyclists also drive cars, so if you remove bike lanes, these people will use their cars instead and hence, exacerbate the traffic congestion. Therefore, the government of Ontario should not interfere with the municipality's well thought-out planning and implementation of bike lanes (in my case Toronto and the GTA). Municipal governments are better equipped in decision making regarding local traffic congestion. Therefore, I am against the proposed Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Nov 6/24. My comment on the bike lane removal. First let me say that I have lived on a residential street with real trees - American Chestnut trees - downtown core- Univ Ave and Dundas St.- \"China Town\"/ hospital corridor 2 blocks away...since 1989... And in all those years I have driven  BOTH a car and a bike. Car is often parked for two weeks as driving in the downtown core is very very congested and the bike is the perfect mode of transport for trips to Kensington market/ Fresco...etc.\n Let me focus my comments on the street s around the 3 major hospitals in Toronto -  University Ave /Murray St and  Elm St.exit to Univ Ave.- very very heavy traffic area-- MADE WORSE BY THE INSTALLATION OF BIKE LANES/LITTLE CURBED ISLANDS at the intersection of Elm St and .Univ Ave. Amazing how stupid  this design is... Cars are often  lined up exiting  from the TWO elevated and one ground lv parking  lots on Murray St,down to the   corner of Elm St and Univ Ave..WHY?\nOnly ONE lane of traffic can enter Univ Ave. If you are going directly East or turning North or South on Univ Ave you have ONLY ONE LANE of passage.. The right turning lane at that corner on Elm St is now blocked a stupid concrete island that starts  the bike lane....And 2 other similar curbed islands at that intersection but on Univ Ave..\nPlease get rid of those traffic impeding islands and use  two traffic lanes to exit Elm St.\n"

        "comment": "Speaking as a constituent who uses both a car and a bike to travel between work sites, this proposal would have a negative impact on my commute. The removal of bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University would make my commute both slower and less safe. The removal of these bike lanes would not incentivize me to switch to my car while within the city (the bike is simply more cost effective, faster, flexible, and easier to store), but it would make the bike commutes significantly more dangerous and put me at higher risk of accidents.\nAdditionally, there is evidence that the installation of bike lanes on Bloor resulted in increased retail traffic and economic activity for merchants in the area. The study found that customers who bike or walk return more frequently than those who drive. In fact, less than 10% of retail customers on Bloor St arrive by car; the vast majority arrive by foot, bike, or transit. The removal of bike lanes in this area would have a negative effect on retailers in the area.\nSource:\nArancibia, D., Farber, S., Savan, B., Verlinden, Y., Smith Lea, N., Allen, J., & Vernich, L.

I would like to the bike lanes to remain - removing them is a step backwards in fostering a safe and healthy environment in our city.\n"

I need safe bike lanes in order not to be afraid for my life and safety.\nBike lanes are an essential part of Toronto's transportation network. They have been proven to reduce congestion in the long run, by encouraging people to get out of cars and get onto space and energy efficient vehicles - bikes!   Ripping out existing bike lanes is a retrogressive step that will cost taxpayers needlessly and result in the death and injury of cyclists and pedestrians.\nPlease keep the bike lanes.\nThank you!\nLily\n"

        "comment": "Speeding through Bill 212 to undo decisions made by the city and tear out bike lanes (not to mention pushing through Highway 413 without the required environmental assessment) is a clear overreach of the provincial government's power.\nBike lanes or no, cyclists will keep riding across Bloor, or up Yonge, or down University. We'll just either do it more safely and confidently in separated bike lanes, or we'll do it in among cars and trucks, at much greater risk. It's all very well for Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria to say that cyclists can use secondary roads instead, but if I'm going from one location on Bloor to another location farther along Bloor, I'm taking Bloor. I love taking secondary roads. I love riding on Shaw\u2014but obviously that's not the route that going to take me east-west across the city, a route we all find we need to travel. There really isn't an east-west alternative to Bloor for a cyclist, particularly keeping in mind that it's human strength and energy, not gas or electricity, that I'd need to go down the extra several blocks down to Harbord or up to...I don't know, Davenport? Bike lanes minimally impact vehicle traffic times, but they improve the cycling experience hugely. First and foremost, of course, they save lives.\nNever mind that people should have other alternatives to get around the city, like well-supported public transit, like the Eglinton Crosstown, which it seems will never open. Never mind that we shouldn't have so many people driving through the city as we do. Never mind carbon emissions and our worsening climate crisis (even electric vehicles have their carbon imprint). Never mind that it's not bike lanes that have led to traffic congestion but population increases, driver increases. We know that if we make more room for cars, more cars will come. Congestion will never be solved by adding more lanes for cars.\nPeople tell me that this is a culture war and a distraction, but that doesn't mean this huge step backwards is something I can ignore. I used to be an ordinary cyclist, minding my own business, and you've turned me into a cycling activist.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is an awful idea. In ontario trying to get almost anywhere by cycling is already a challenge with lacking or unsafe bicycle infrastructure. The main problem is how ontario has long been building almost exclusively for cars and leaving any other form of transit with barely anything. This has been changing in the last few years, but this bill would contribute to that same problem and keep us stuck in it. If every bike lane needed approval from the ontario government then these important projects would unnecessarily get caught up in red tape, local governments need to be able to meet local needs for transportation without having to deal with this extra layer. And the constant anti-bike sentiments that lead to this proposal will mean the government will be able to reject bike infrastructure regardless of how well it serves the community, which they have shown themselves to be very willing to do.\nI and many others need bike paths to get to where I'm going on a daily basis, they're essential infrastructure just like sidewalks are and removing and restricting them like this when we're already working with scraps would make the commute of me and many others more and more impractical and unsafe, all for the justification of saving drivers some time. If we don't have these places to cycle, many cyclists will be forced to use the road as riding on sidewalks is illegal, and motorists constantly complain about dealing with bikes on the roads, so this proposal doesn't even help cars as much as it would claim.\nFinally, the assertion that bike lanes are the cause of congestion is flimsy at best. Many studies have been done and show that places with more bike infrastructure have less traffic congestion because people have the option to cycle instead. There are several places that can be pointed to that have bike lanes and traffic flows fine, there are plenty of places without bike lanes that are backed up. So if we want less traffic congestion and less bikes in the middle of the road to deal with, then the only way is upgrading the bike infrastructure. This bill will only make things worse for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I like my bicycle. But there is no way I should be taking space\nname traffic arteries. The protections required for bikes to operate on major arteries make the streets almost impossible to understand in terms of who can turn when and who has the right of way. On roads like Yonge Street and make no sense at all given there is a subway system right underneath the road which can move large numbers of people around efficiently and effectively. We decided to go the subway route and have a marvelous system in Toronto which also works during the winter as well as the summer. Let's focus on it for more of our transportation needs.\nAnother major consideration is safety. I spoke to the city about this but there is no sensible message coming back. Take for example turning north on the University from Richmond St., West. At night is almost impossible to tell if there are bikes in the bike lane heading west given poor lighting and the fact that most bicyclists do not have proper lighting of the bikes. This makes it incredibly dangerous to be trying to turn right with clarity on whether there are bicyclists, coming up on the inside. It is extremely dangerous and the city must do something to fix this risk. I do not believe they will fix it. In my view intersection now is setting a trap for motorists by making conditions so poor that there is a great risk of accidents occurring. Furthermore is an incredibly busy intersection virtually at all times and it does not make sense to be introducing bicycles in areas like this and making it super risky for pedestrians, motorists and bicyclists.\n"

The Ford brothers could have done with some cycling, if Doug doesn't want to end up like Rob he should get on a bike.\n3. Don't tread on me, the small government conservatives are introducing bureaucratic bloat and infringing on my local government rights.

        "comment": "I am writing to say that I do not support Bill 212. Firstly, the taxpayer money that would go into removing the bike lanes could best be spent elsewhere, such as public transit & building new train/subway lines to provide alternative methods of transportation in order to alleviate car traffic. Like much of North America, Toronto has built itself around the use of cars when we should be implementing greener methods of transportation.\nSecondly, the safety of cyclists is extremely important. As someone who has cycled to work on some of Toronto's busiest downtown streets, I have felt unsafe in areas that do not have dedicated bike lanes. In these areas, cyclists have to compete with vehicles, both moving & parked. They also at times have to compete with street car tracks, which are very easy to catch a wheel in and cause injury. On the note of cycling to work, the number of food delivery employees who use bicycles to make their deliveries continues to grow and they are often spotted along the busiest streets having to weave in and out of traffic to avoid moving & parked vehicles. To avoid accidents, having dedicated bike lanes would provide safety to cyclists as well as car drivers.\nThirdly, most local businesses have not reported a decrease in sales due to the implementation of bike lanes. On Bloor Street, most merchants reported a higher number of customers than before the bike lane's installation, visitors gave higher estimates of spending and visit frequency, and vacancy rates were stable (see supporting link: Economic Impact Study of Bike Lanes in Toronto's Bloor Annex and Korea Town Neighbourhoods).\nFourthly, I worry about the congestion that is going to be caused during the removal of bike lanes and afterwards. As we all know, construction causes a lot of traffic build up and while the bike lanes are being dismantled, the gridlock will continue. I also worry that after the bike lanes are removed, the amount of drivable lanes will still be restricted. A lot of 4 lane streets in Toronto dedicate 2 of those lanes towards short term parking, so drivers are essentially left with 1 lane of travel in either direction. In order to alleviate traffic, the idea of not allowing parking on those streets at all would have to be considered. However, if people are not able to continue parking on these streets, then we could see a potential decline in revenue for local businesses.\nIn conclusion, it is a waste of taxpayer money & time to remove these bike lanes. The City of Toronto has already spent money & time creating these bike lanes to create a greener city and provide people with alternative methods of transportation. Most businesses have not seen a decline in revenue due to these bike lanes and promoting cycling encourages people to live healthier lifestyles and also save on commuting costs (ie. gas, fares, etc). Instead of removing bike lanes, please focus on implementing other methods of transportation, such as building new train/subway lines, so that car users have the option to ditch the car and alleviate gridlock.\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment.\n"

        "comment": "Like the Province, we believe that Toronto should have bike lanes but only on appropriate streets. Yonge Street is not an appropriate one. It has led to considerable gridlock on Yonge and compromised the safety of bikers, pedestrians and motorists alike. In our view Yonge Street between Bloor and Davisville should never been selected for bike lanes when it is/was 1) already a relatively narrow four lane, now reduced to two lanes, major north/south thoroughfare 2) houses two important mid city fire stations just off of it 3) is currently a significant TTC bus route with more buses likely to be added to alleviate crowded subways 4) has a significant retail area and 5) is now subject to considerable new high rise development plans. Bike lanes on Yonge have led to constant traffic  congestion not only during the morning and afternoon rush hours but during much of the day. This will only become worse as construction starts on the 28 major real estate developments approved and proposed for the area along Yonge Street between Bloor and Heath Street, just north of St. Clair.\n"

        "comment": "As both a motorist and a cyclist I can tell you that bike lane creation in the city of Toronto has gone much too far. City council operates on the assumption that every bike lane created means less people in cars and the reality is that no one is abandoning their cars to cycle.  Every major road I drive or cycle on that has bike lanes I see one or two other cyclists and hundreds of cars backed up in gridlock. What's more, in places where there were already bike lanes such as the Leaside Bridge, major construction (costing we don't know how much) has now created new boutique bike lanes to double the size. For a handful of cyclists who ALREADY HAD BIKE LANES going both ways. Again hundreds of cars caught in gridlock and 1-5 people on bikes.\nBloor West has lost two lanes of car traffic.  And there is maybe 5-7 cyclists you would ever see. But cars stuck in traffic stretch as far as the eye can see.\nWoodbine Ave, Eglinton...I could go on and on, street after street. I am a cyclist and a motorist. I understand both worlds. Believe me when I say it has gone too far.\nAnd when you see trees and grass and concrete islands built in the middle of major roads it is hard to believe this is to benefit cyclists and not simply to gleefully punish motorists.\nFor a city that is supposedly strapped for money it seems there is plenty to splash around for the ravenous appetite of bike lanes\n"
