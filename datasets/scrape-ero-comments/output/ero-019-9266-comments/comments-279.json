        "comment": "This is one of the most wasteful policy proposals I have ever seen in my life. Bike lanes save lives, they reduce gridlock, and they reduce carbon emissions. I have never seen a government so content to waste millions of dollars ripping up bike lanes that are already installed. One of the stupidest proposals I\u2019ve ever seen. Please do not do this.\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad idea and is not in line with the policies in the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024, that just finished receiving comments (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-8462). That document contains numerous mentions of active transportation and its role in building homes and sustaining strong communities.\nI live just North of where the bike lane ends on Yonge St. In the past two years, numerous new apartment buildings have been proposed, consulted on and approved with minimal and even no car parking under the assumption that people would be able to use transit, bike or walk for their needs. These decisions may need to be revisited if cycling options are removed, delaying and adding new costs onto housing at a time when housing starts are already far below this government's targets.\nThe Yonge subway line is currently experiencing frequent delays due to slow zones caused by delayed maintenance. The province has not offered help and delays therefore seem likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Cycling therefore remains the most reliable way for many Toronto residents to reliably get to work or social events downtown. Removing this option will hurt Toronto's economy and will not improve congestion.\nThis sort of policy lurch undermines not only reliable transportation options and housing progress, but also public trust in the government.\n"

        "comment": "I am utterly disgusted at this proposal. Doug Ford needs to stay in his lane. What we need is better public transportation to reduce traffic congestion. Our transit system for being a world class city is pathetic. Our money should be going to improve public transit.\nBike lanes save lives and the removal of bike lanes that were JUST put in is a complete waste of money and will cause even further traffic congestion. The blood of any cyclist that gets injured or killed because of this bill will be on your hands.\nJanet\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes in Toronto are absolutely crucial for the city - especially on the major axes like Bloor/Danforth, University etc. They allow so many people to bike safely instead of driving / taking TTC especially during rush hours.\nThe safety aspect is also extremely important for all cyclists around the city. Please keep the lanes!\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is BAD POLICY. It goes against years of extensive research on the many benefits of bike lanes, including the fact that safe bike lanes actually reduce congestion. Removing bike lanes and giving more space to vehicular traffic will encourage more people to drive cars, worsening congestion long-term. This is referred to as 'induced demand.'\nAs a result of induced demand, building Hwy 413 may ease gridlock initially, but it will lead to increased congestion in the long run. Just look at Hwy 401 -- how many additional lanes have been added over the years, yet it is still the worst highway in North America when it comes to gridlock!\nInstead of wasting money on more roads that only feed the congestion problem, money should be invested in public transit which is more affordable to the general population and can be used by everybody. Not everyone drives (e.g., children, people with certain disabilities) and many people cannot afford to purchase a vehicle.\nWhen you create more road space for cars, more people will choose to drive cars and these extra cars will clog up the roads. Conversely, when you create more infrastructure for cyclists (e.g. protected bike lanes) and improve public transit, people will choose cycling or taking transit instead of driving a car. These cyclists and public transit riders are actually freeing up road space for other drivers. It's simple geometry -- 50 individuals each driving their own personal vehicle takes up way more road space than 50 individuals riding on their own bicycles or 50 individuals riding in one single bus.\nThere is also data supporting the fact that bike lanes are good for businesses. The City of Toronto conducted an economic impact study of the Bloor Street bike lanes and found them to be beneficial for local businesses.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 is a huge overreach by the provincial government. Bike lanes are a municipal issue which the province should not interfere with.\nBILL 212 IS BAD POLICY. It contradicts extensive research that SAFE BIKE LANES ACTUALLY REDUCE CONGESTION by giving people a viable alternative to driving a personal vehicle.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not take steps to endanger the lives of those who are not travelling in a metal box protecting themselves. The growing number of cyclists in cities within the province should be the envy of other cities in North America, transit and journey times in cities with strong cycle infrastructure with similar density and populations to that of cities in Ontario like Toronto are much lower. This bill is a big step backwards and will not be forgotten if passed. This government should be promoting progress! How many cyclists need to be run over to understand how ridiculous of a proposal this is.\nI am not a cyclist, I do not own a bicycle nor do I partake in any bike share scheme. I am a resident of Ontario who wants to be proud of the place i live not ashamed.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, bike lanes keep me safe as well as cyclists.  That said, I only drive when necessary.  The answer to congestion is fewer cars on the road.  What we really need is more public transit that is affordable and reliable.  Canada is not reaching its GHG targets.  If we are going to mitigate climate change we must have emergency climate action.  That includes limiting cars, and certainly not building more highways.  Bike lanes encourage more people to cycle - and that is critical to our collective responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for restoring sanity to Toronto's transportation system. My community of the Kingsway had been hijacked by the pro cyclist anti car faction causing major chaos and safety issues in my community. City councillors turned a blind eye to the community residents' concerns. Transportation staff were presenting  statistics to support their actions which residents know we're absolutely ludicrous. Now it seems the government of Ontario is going to do something positive about it. Thank you once again.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycles do not emit any greenhouse gases, and this help to lower the emissions on traffic roads. However, the existence of bike lanes on the roads that have subway lines, such as Bloor and Yonge Streets, does not add to the production of emissions.\nAdditionally, on a busy road such as Avenue, there are spots to park a car that are exist between a lane that is dedicated for vehicles to drive and lane that is dedicated for bicycles to go through. This means that the parked car is exposed on both sides, and puts the driver and their passengers at more risk.\nThe addition of bike lanes creates a problem in the winter, when snow tends to fall in accumulate. The existence of lanes for bicycles, make it difficult to store snow on the side of the road.\nIt should also be noted that commuters on bike lanes are put at risk when they are next to cars. As such, bike lanes should be installed on roads that do not have motor vehicles.\n"

It\u2019s is disappointing that the province and the governing party has stepped out of their lane so to speak.\nThis will not have any impact other then reduce cycle safety, and something the city continues to invest in.\nAs a cyclist and a driver, it\u2019s clear that cars fill the space provided and cause traffic.  Open another lane, more cars.  It\u2019s an equilibrium that always leads to gridlock.  The only solution is transit faster.\nTaking out these cycle lanes will cause fatalities. Bravo for trying to bring this global city backwards.\nThere was a chance at my vote, but it\u2019s gone until we have a new PC leader.\n"

This puts me in danger on my commute to work and does nothing to solve the problems cars cause on our roads. This bill does NOT save me any time, it does NOT reduce gridlock. Look no further than the 95% of roads in the City of Toronto which do not have bike lanes yet still face gridlock. Look the 401 and the Gardiner. Use provincial dollars to fund public transit. Build an Ontario that is less reliant on cars.\n"
