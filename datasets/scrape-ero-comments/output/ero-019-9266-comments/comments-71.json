        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal.\nIts purpose is to split the voter base and stoke division amongst an already-divided population, to distract from the horrible decisions being made by the current administration.\nEnvironmentally speaking, it's also obviously a huge issue and will cause:\n- more CO2 emissions\n- more smog\n- more traffic\n- more deaths (as a result of collisions as well as indirect causes from the air pollution resulting)\nIt's been well documented that bike lanes reduce traffic by taking cars off the road, and there is no evidence that \"one more lane\" is simply going to fix the issues we have with traffic. The best way to reduce traffic is to induce demand for other methods of transport. That means funding the creation of safe bicycle infrastructure and public transit options.\nThe fact that bicycle lanes save lives seems entirely lost on this administration, who probably believes all bike riders are liberals anyway. They are probably happy to see them die at the hands of a vehicle.\nFinally, this is a massive overreach from the province and this is an issue that should be owned by the municipalities.\nI don't know why I'm even bothering to write this comment because it's obvious that the conservative party only cares about the pockets of it's MPs and their donors, and will never bother to actually read the comments anyway. I'm sure even if there was a reason this proposal was illegal they'd still ram it through using the notwithstanding clause.\n"

        "comment": "Building more highways and more lanes will not ease traffic problems.\nIt has been proven that doing so will create induced demand.\nIf the Ontario government goes through with removing bike lanes to increase car lanes, building highway 413, adding more lanes or tunnels to existing highways, yes, it'll ease congestion for all of a few months, before induced demand gobbles up all of the \"bandwidth\" the lanes created.  And you'll be right back in the current position.\nI am opposed to any plans to remove bike lanes or plans to restrict municipalities from building bike lanes.  Bike lanes are the easiest form of public transit infrastructure to create and maintain.  Private cars create congestion; not bikes.\nIf the Ontario government wants to ease traffic problems, reducing the number of private cars on the roads is the key.  By increasing funding and reliability to all other modes of public transit, from bike lanes, buses and bus lanes, streetcars/ tramlines, subways and even high speed rail, all of these will encourage citizens to use these to get around for their daily needs and commutes instead of using private vehicles.\nEncouraging public transit and bikes, reduces traffic congestion.\nThe implementation of bike lanes and reducing car lanes in major cities from New York to Paris have been successful in reducing congestion and traffic.  Follow Paris' lead.\nOnce and for all, build high speed rail from the Windsor to Ottawa corridor, work with Quebec to make the line reach Quebec City, work with Michigan to connect it to the USA.\n"

        "comment": "While it is appreciated that the province is trying to find solutions for gridlock for vehicles, biking is a valued mode of transportation for many individuals.\nThe fact that this bill appears to prioritize car vehicles over bikes is incredibly unfair as we all need a way to commute, we all need to share the same space and these spaces should allow for alternative modes of transportation that are also safe and not restricted to owning an automotive.\nAlso the idea that the province, who may have no understanding of municipal transport routes, gets the authority to decide bike lane decisions is something I am strongly against given that bike lanes are very local pieces of infrastructure. I do not believe the province should have this much power over a piece of infrastructure that is ultimately for the local community and not for provincial levels of transportation.\n"

I don't see why Queen's Park needs to stick its nose in, adding more red tape to something that's the purview of city planning departments. While this is clearly aimed at Toronto, I don't want my own city's planning interfered with on such a small and petty level after local decisions have been made.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is going to achieve the opposite of the intended effect, and is far overreaching in terms of provincial powers. I would hope to see this not go through.\nReducing gridlock is best achieved by reducing the number of cars on the road, not by building out better car focused infrastructure.\nA single bike lane has a significantly higher capacity for transporting people than a single car lane, and if using a bike or public transport is a viable option to get from point A to point B, more people will take those alternatives, resulting in fewer cars on the roads, which ultimately results in a higher quality driving experience for those who prefer or require driving.\nRemoving a bike lane for a car lane removes using a bicycle as an option for transportation, urging people to drive instead, which causes far more cars on the road than what an additional lane can support, because a single bike lane has a higher capacity for transportation than a single car lane.\nThis also disproportionately impacts those who are unwilling or unable to drive. Removing alternatives to driving restricts freedom of movement for those who cannot drive.\nPlease, reconsider this proposal, it will do more harm than good.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is meddling in the jurisdiction of municipalities and is a huge waste of time for a Minister in the provincial government. Jurisdictional boundaries between the province and municipalities are responsive to the fact that the level of government closest to an issue will be best placed to manage that issue. The provincial government and the Minister tasked with reviewing bike lanes will have no specific knowledge about the local landscape that would inform any decision about bike lanes. Municipalities are best placed to make these decisions. This is an unnecessary level of bureaucracy that will waste resources and make it harder for municipalities to do their job.\nBike lanes are an important part of a city's infrastructure that make it possible for people to use different forms of transportation. Bike lanes make it more possible and safer for people without cars to commute to work and give people the option of using active transportation. Encouraging active transportation for all, and providing transportation options for lower income people who cannot afford vehicles is an important part of city planning.\nThere is no evidence that bike lanes are contributing to congestion or the ability of emergency vehicles to navigate the roads. The only impact of this decision will be to make roads more dangerous for vulnerable road users and increase the number of annual deaths and injuries for cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is just a sneaky way for highway 413 to get rushed in without any environmental research into impact. We are at a time where we need to be protecting the environment that we have, not adding to the sprawl. The vast majority of Ontario drivers will never need that highway, and they will never need to worry about bike lanes in the City of Toronto.\nAs a province, we need to encourage environmentally-friendly modes of transportation, like public transit, walking, and biking. Adding more cars to the road is bad for all of us. But increasing other ways of transit reduces the number of cars on the road - which actually helps with traffic. The government of Ontario should focus on completing existing projects that actually cause gridlock - like the Eglinton crosstown project, or large-scale building projects. The Province should look at improving alternative forms of transportation that get more cars off the main roads, rather than adding lanes which will only encourage more traffic.\nLook at any other major city that has increased their bike lanes - all of them have seen shorter travel times for cars. Toronto businesses near bike lanes have seen an increase of business. Bike Share has increased exponentially because more people feel safe enough to get around in another way.\nAnd, for the record, it's embarrassing to have a Premier be so solely focused on only one city in our Province. Those of us that live outside of the City of Toronto feel that the Province has more pressing issues than Toronto's so-called gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "It is bewildering to me on several fronts that the province is choosing to interfere in municipal affairs such as local road design. It is even more bewildering that the province is ignoring its own data as well as those of municipalities to drive these decisions. Data from emergency services, local businesses payment processors, and municipalities all support the provision of safe alternate options to driving private vehicles, such as protected bike lanes. Spending money to rip out perfectly functional existing infrastructure seems like a colossal waste of public money, and runs counter to any notion of fiscal conservatism that the Ontario PC Party pretends to aspire to.\nIf Minister Sarkaria finds driving a single-occupancy vehicle from Brampton to Queen's Park to be too onerous a commute, he should avail himself of the GO Transit and TTC option that exists between Brampton and Queen's Park. Should that option prove lacking, then improving the quality of service on regional transit actually *is* something within his purview at the MTO. Perhaps the provincial government should instead focus on fixing transit and delivering longe overdue projects like the Eglinton LRT, instead of trying to distract the public by sticking its nose into municipal matters like the design of local roads.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal on multiple grounds.\nFirstly, it is a gross overreach for the Premier to micromanage municipal affairs when there is no critical issue that the municipality is not able to address.\nSecondly, and more importantly, it is a deeply irrational proposal which flies in the face of empirical evidence. Studies conducted both in the GTA and globally repeatedly show the positive impacts of expanded bike infrastructure. Common fallacies touted by anti-cycling commentators regarding the impact of bike lanes on transit times, access or emergency response times are just not supported by facts. I'm reminded of studies carried out in Etobicoke showing that emergency response times improved after the introduction of bike lanes.\nFundamentally, the GTA cannot grow without substituting personal vehicle trips for more rational, efficient transportation options. Personal automobiles suffer from fundamental inefficiencies which render them ineffective for an urban environment: They consume an incredible amount space relative to the number of people they move.\nThe global cities that Toronto aspires to compare itself to have already learned these lessons. I hope that someday we have a provincial government that makes decisions based on reason and empirical evidence. Until then, it seems we are stuck with one that engages in petty culture war politics at the expense of our shared prosperity\n"

It will simply make it unsafe for cyclists, and increase congestion more when cars need to coexist with cyclists in their same lane. Create safe cycling infrastructure, and you will have less cars on the road. Ontario should be forward thinking, and embrace the micro-mobility revolution, which results in less environmental impact. The province should not have any business in municipal affairs when it comes to bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the Bloor and University Bike Lanes will greatly inconvenience my life in Toronto. I am 25 years old and recently moved to the city from Richmond Hill. The city is expensive to live in, which makes biking to work a very great way to save money and stay in shape. I use the Bloor and University bike lanes on a daily basis in order to get to work at Osgoode Hall. If the bike lanes were to be removed, it would make my commute to work very dangerous. When biking on streets that don\u2019t have bike lanes (such as Dufferin) I have been exposed to very dangerous situations such as being hit by a car this summer. When I bike on the dedicated bike lanes on Bloor i am able to go from my neighbourhood near Dundas West station all the way to my work in a safe manner. I beg parliament to please reconsider removing the bike lanes as they have made my life as a cyclist so much safer.\n"
