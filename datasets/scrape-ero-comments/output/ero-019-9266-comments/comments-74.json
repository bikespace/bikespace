        "comment": "Since being elected into office, Doug Ford has wasted my tax dollars by:\n- unconstitutionally attacking union rights with B124 and wasting countless millions fighting for an obviously unconstitutional law\n- bringing beer into corner stores 10 months early\n- trying to use a one-size-fits-all approach to overrule municipal planning committees' decisions on sprawl (FYI - sprawl increases taxes and reduces services, but you all already know that and clearly don't care)\n- promoting a record number of MPPs who do absolutely nothing to cabinet and/or parliamentary assistant positions\n- selling off public goods to enrich shady developers and other private interests\n- building a multi-billion dollar highway to save an average commuter 30 seconds of travel time (allowing Doug Ford to funnel more public money into the hands of his friends)\n- wasting money on OPS real estate (and increasing emissions via commutes), when the pandemic has proven that the vast majority of OPS work can be done from home\n- underfunding our healthcare, including wasting money on agency nurses instead of increasing pay for nurses employed within our public healthcare system, so it can be increasingly privatized (which, as shown by the disaster that is privatized long-term care, created by your conservative predecessor, the outcomes will be MUCH worse and will cost more money)\n- underfunding education so the future citizens lack the critical thinking to recognize just how much contempt Conservative politicians have for their electorate\n- hoarding federally-provided COVID funds to offset the wasteful spending and reduce the deficit, instead of spending it to save the lives it was intended for\n- buying votes for the 2022 election by cancelling license plate renewal fees (this has cost over $2 billion so far, which will just continue to increase as the years go on)\n- the plan to buy votes for the upcoming early election will cost another $3.2 billion\nThis wasteful spending amounts to TENS OF BILLIONS which could be better spent by IMPROVING the public healthcare system, not adding a profit motive through privatization.\nAnd now Doug Ford wants to further interfere with the safety of pedestrians and increase gridlock by removing bike lanes? There is ample proof that encouraging people to bike and/or use public transit will actually reduce gridlock and trying to introduce more cars into downtown areas will do the opposite, but Doug Ford's Conservative party prefers spreading propaganda around how having more lanes will reduce traffic, despite them KNOWING THIS IS NOT TRUE.\nDoug Ford needs to stop pretending to be the Mayor of Toronto and do his job as the Premier of ONTARIO, which is to make our future better. INVEST IN PUBLIC HEALTHCARE. INVEST IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. INVEST IN EXPERTS PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. Stop with this \"cOmMoN sEnSe\" BS that has no lasting positive impact for the future of our province.\nThis government is a disgrace and you should all feel ashamed of yourselves.\n"

        "comment": "This policy is a gross overreach of provincial government into municipal matters. Removing bike infrastructure only causes more congestion as more vehicles will be on the road and cyclists will be forced to take up space in car lanes. This is more dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians. Our hospitals do not need more patients taking up ER space due to preventable accidents. The funding for this idiotic policy could be used for healthcare, education, and social programs that have been severely neglected by this government.\n"

More people live in cities in Ontario = more cars. That\u2019s why there\u2019s more traffic, it\u2019s called math.

Both cyclists and drivers will suffer from reduced bike lanes, taxpayer dollars will be spent undoing work that we already paid for, and requiring provincial approval for local projects will introduce needless time-wasting bureaucracy into an already bloated system. Honestly, surface level, this just seems like a thoughtless appeal to Doug Ford's base of people who think that bike lanes are a polarizing political issue. They're not. They're a basic necessity of any growing urban centre and casting them as a wedge issue is both moronic and dangerously short-sighted. It's a sad state of affairs when this is how politicians in Canada try to earn votes.\n"

I am one of the thousands who commute each day on my bike - its already scary end with how many cars are on the road and with a bike lane. Without it, you are going to just have a huge increase in bike related accidents. Last time I checked, our healthcare system wasn't doing so hot - so curious how this bill will remotely help that. This is as backwards as trying to bring back coal plants - it just doesn't make any sense in 2024 let alone the future.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI do not think it is for the province to decide whether a bike line is appropriate or not on municipal roads. Municipal roads should be managed by the municipal government as elected by its people. I believe this will create unnecessary extra bureaucracy in which the municipal government will need to have the provincial government OK their plans for municipal roads. I also find it absurd that the province is looking to remove bike lanes that have already been installed. This is a waste of tax payer money, and would also increase the time for municipalities to be able to make necessary changes to make roads safer and more efficient for all its users.\nAs a cyclist, there are many roads that I do not feel I have a safe space to ride my bike. Either I ride on the sidewalk, which slows me down or risk injuring pedestrians if the sidewalk is not wide enough. Or I ride on the road - which has much more serious consequences of being hit by a car, including serious injuries or death.\nGood bike lanes, such as those recently added to University in Toronto, reduce the risk to cyclists, while also ensuring a safe drive for drivers as they don't have either be stuck behind a slow moving cyclist, or risk going around the cyclist which causes the driver to change lanes, slowing traffic or worse yet causing accidents. With the University bike lane specifically, I also noticed dedicated parking spaces, which again keeps drivers and cyclists separated and safe as they aren't required to share that space, i.e. it is not uncommon to see drivers park/stop/interfere with bike lanes, which cyclists then need to navigate around and away from their bike lanes into traffic.\nAs a driver, I prefer dedicated bike lanes to keep my fellow cyclists safe, and to keep myself safe as I don't have to worry about one swerving to avoid debris or falling in front of my car.\nAdditionally, the safer our bike lanes are, the more people will actually use them, and the less gridlock we will see (with the additional bonus of healthier and greener commuters, reducing costs to our healthcare system).\nSafety aside however, I do ultimately think this is a totally unnecessary waste of tax payer money by having the province involved in municipal affairs. Municipal roads should be managed by municipalities - and if that means they want to add bike lanes, it's their prerogative to do so.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong support for the continued existence and potential expansion of bike lanes in Ontario. While I understand that the government has many pressing priorities, I believe that investing in cycling infrastructure is a crucial step towards building healthier, more sustainable, and equitable communities.\nWhile I acknowledge the importance of addressing issues such as public transit, healthcare, and the cost of living, I believe that these challenges are interconnected with the need for improved cycling infrastructure. By promoting cycling, we can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and encourage healthier lifestyles.\nOver the past five years, I have significantly increased my reliance on cycling for transportation. From commuting to work to running errands, I have found bike lanes to be invaluable in ensuring my safety and convenience. The dedicated lanes not only provide a safer environment for cyclists but also contribute to a more efficient transportation system.\nI am concerned about the potential negative consequences of removing bike lanes. Such a decision would not only discourage cycling but could also lead to increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and safety risks for vulnerable road users. Instead, I urge the government to consider expanding bike lane networks to accommodate the growing number of cyclists and to encourage even more people to adopt this sustainable mode of transportation.\nI believe that investing in cycling infrastructure is a long-term investment in the health and well-being of our communities. By prioritizing bike lanes, we can create a more livable, sustainable, and equitable province for all.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,\n"

        "comment": "The government of Ontario needs to critically review Bill 212 and realize it is counter productive and will not solve any traffic issues, but instead make it worse.\nBike lanes are for commuters and travelers to safely get through Toronto, and other areas with bike lanes. Traffic is caused by cars, by removing bike lanes, the government is removing viable alternatives to driving, so for each cyclist who is no longer biking, they are now driving, in a car, adding to traffic, making this entire proposal counter productive and completely uneducated.\nStudies have proven businesses on Bloor St improving business after installation of bike lanes, studies have also shown in Manhattan, NYC, bike lanes actually decreased traffic time by 30%. This is because, bike lanes, as well as transit (subways, buses, streetcars), remove cars off the street, alleviating pressure from roads.\nThe bloor and university bike lanes have proven to be incredibly successful as they provide a fast way of commuting, comparable to the TTC subway with line 1 and 2.\nEvery cyclist is 1 less car on the road, which means less traffic.\nThis bill will make traffic worse as it is not data driven, but rather emotional driven. It is harmful to the environment as cars add to noise and air pollution, as well as are poor towards health and promote the lack of movement leading to obesity.\nThe reason for all the grid lock is the lack of new subway lines, such as Line 5 and 6 being constantly delayed, the lack of new forward thinking transit, the slow progress of bike lane installations, and policies such as bill 212 making Toronto and other cities in Ontario more grid locked.\nIt also is harmful and dangerous towards youth, elderly and people actually living in the neighborhood and focuses more on the suburban commuters who dont even live in the areas bike lanes are installed.\nI urge the government to not pass this bill, if they have any regard for traffic time (for cars and cyclists), safety, health and the environment.\nIt also does not solve the issue of bikes just sharing the road with cars, being more dangerous for everyone involved, and instead making cars slow down behind cyclists as required by the law.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous premise for provincial legislation. Three reasons:\n1. I pay property taxes to a municipal government that is elected to make infrastructure decisions that make sense for my community. A one-size fits all approach authored in Queen's Park does not reflect the needs of my city and should not take precedence over the knowledge of local officials.\n2. Bike lanes make driving safer and faster. I used to commute to and from work by car every day along a busy stretch of four lane road with a 60km/h speed limit. When cyclists rode alongside traffic, it made all the drivers nervous, slowed traffic significantly, and increased the risk of accident and death. I couldn't blame cyclists for using that thoroughfare, they were there for the same reason that I was - it was the fastest way to get through that part of the city. Bike lanes solve this problem and keep traffic moving.\n3. Since becoming a parent, I've done more cycling in my community. I used to feel boxed in by the major roads that surround my neighbourhood. The introduction of separated bike lanes has made it possible for me to cycle safely on those roads with my child in tow. I would never take that risk without the separated lanes. This infrastructure has helped my family to get more exercise during the summer months, and has improved the parking situation at our local farmers' market, because families like ours can bike to and from doing groceries.\nHow about you stop posturing and solve real problems that Ontarians face, like our crumbling health care system, our under-funded schools, or our lack of inter-region public transit options?\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes to create more lanes for cars in an effort to reduce traffic is a terrible idea that is not backed by any research or evidence. It will not achieve the stated goal of the bill, and in fact will worsen the problem.\nIt has been proven again and again over decades of attempts and research that adding lanes does not reduce traffic, but increases it. This is a phenomenon known as induced demand. I have pasted basic information about this from Wikipedia below, but if you'd prefer to watch videos, I've added supporting links to this comment.\n\"In transportation planning, induced demand, also called \"induced traffic\" or consumption of road capacity, has become important in the debate over the expansion of transportation systems, and is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity as a cure for congestion.[...]City planner Jeff Speck has called induced demand \"the great intellectual black hole in city planning, the one professional certainty that every thoughtful person seems to acknowledge, yet almost no one is willing to act upon.\"\n\"The effect was recognised as early as 1930, when an executive of a St. Louis, Missouri, electric railway company told the Transportation Survey Commission that widening streets simply produces more traffic, and heavier congestion.[12]\"\n\"A 2004 meta-analysis, which took in dozens of previously published studies, confirmed this. It found that:  ... on average, a 10 percent increase in lane miles induces an immediate 4 percent increase in vehicle miles travelled, which climbs to 10 percent \u2013 the entire new capacity \u2013 in a few years.[20]\" \"\nIt is also illogical when you consider how much more space a car takes up on the road than a bike. Far more people can fit on the road when they're riding bikes than when they're sitting in cars. Bikes, busses, and subways are far more efficient at moving people across a city than cars are. Making biking viable, as bike lanes do, means that more people will use these modes of transportation and that will reduce the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes will discourage riders from biking and increase the likelihood that they will die due to proximity to large vehicles. This is evidenced by the increased use of the bike share program in the city this year.\nFinally, this is such an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars as the cost to remove and replace the existing infrastructure far outweights the initial cost to install in. As seen in our recent history:\n\"Toronto has removed bike lanes in the past. In 2012, after a protracted battle in council led in part by former mayor Rob Ford and Doug Ford, then a city councillor, the city opted to remove protected lanes on Jarvis Street. The lanes cost roughly $86,000 to install and about $270,000 to remove because a centre lane for vehicle traffic had to be re-added to the busy street.\"\nIf you are a fiscally responsible conservative, you should be raging at this waste of taxpayer funds.\nMoving forward with this bill would be a huge step backwards that services only to harm the people living in the city of Toronto, and additionally serve as a massive waste of taxpayer dollars. If you are fiscally conservative, you should be opposed to this solely based on the lack of value derived from this project.\n"
