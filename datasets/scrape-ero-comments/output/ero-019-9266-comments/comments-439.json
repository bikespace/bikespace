        "comment": "Please consider the environmental impact of encouraging driving over cycling by not providing protected bike lanes. If there were no sidewalks, wouldn't more people choose to travel in a protected vehicle? As gas prices rise and the environment becomes increasingly unstable due to fossil fuel pollution, as we are seeing record high October temperatures right now, we need to build our infrastructure to support alternative choices. As the cost of living increases, cycling is a less expensive option of transportation in our dense urban centres. There physically is not the capacity to hold the number of cars now if everyone who currently walks or takes transit suddenly decided to switch. Removing bike lanes is quite literally reducing the value and livability of our streets. Additionally, many of the streets highlighted for being congested have on street parking on both sides! This is a luxury convenience for a tiny fraction of people - much fewer than would be using the bike lanes! The majority of parking is better served in condensed parking lots or underground to efficiently use street space. Before challenging bike lanes, please require the removal of all on street parking, which is an incredibly inefficient use of space that will slow traffic, especially as we wait for someone to navigate a tight parallel parking process. Additionally, if we are to reduce congestion, please consider congestion pricing in dense urban centres like Toronto. This will greatly increase the flow of traffic for essential vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, transit, garbage pickup, and deliveries.\n"

It is a complete reversal of progress towards safety, the environment and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Once again, Doug Ford is focused on the wrong things that are needed to improve this province. Eliminating bike lanes and the ability to buy beer at Costco should not be the priorities. How about spending significant time, money and effort on rescuing our healthcare system from the brink of disaster for so many Ontario families!\n"

        "comment": "The province\u2019s proposal to REMOVE bike lanes is preposterous. First of all, these lanes in Toronto have been years in the making, have cost a ton of money to implement, and the idea of just ripping them out (spending even more taxpayer dollars) is a disgusting use of resources. Furthermore, with the state of the climate crisis, we should be incentivizing people to use transportation with a lower carbon footprint - walking, public transit, and biking. You know what causes gridlock? CARS. Even if you don\u2019t care about the climate, maybe you care about the data: there are numerous instances around the world (Copenhagen, New York City, etc) where research has shown that adding bike lanes REDUCES car travel times, because when people feel safer (with dedicated bike lanes) more people will bike instead of drive. When you add additional lanes for cars, more people choose to drive. You don\u2019t improve travel times this way. The research doesn\u2019t support it, the ethics don\u2019t support it, and the finances don\u2019t support it - what on earth are you doing???\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes that have already been added to Bloor, Yonge, and University is a waste of taxpayer's money. Preventing the addition of more bike lanes (which can hold a higher volume of traffic than motor vehicle lanes) is counter-intuitive to reducing gridlock. One extra lane will not make a difference when cars are still getting stuck at lights. At least bike lanes provide a safe lane for individuals to be able to safely bike instead of drive/take public transit, if they so choose. This is not a decision that should be made by the provincial government, and should be left up to individual municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in favour of vehicle traffic lanes is a step backward for sustainable, efficient urban mobility in Toronto. Research shows that bike lanes not only reduce traffic congestion but also contribute significantly to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, with cycling saving an estimated 200 kg of CO\u2082 per person annually. Studies from Toronto and other cities show bike lanes boost local economies by increasing retail activity, while also enhancing public health by promoting active commuting. Removing these lanes would risk higher emissions, reduced safety, and lost economic benefits, moving us further from climate and urban liveability goals. We urge Ontario to work with stakeholders to find balanced solutions that support both growth and environmental responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to the control that Bill 212 gives to the province over bike lanes in municipalities.\nTransportation planning within a municipality is is properly a municipal responsibility.  This is because\n(1) municipalities are much beter placed than the Province to take into account local circumstances, and\n(2) bike lanes are an important  component of many municipal policies, including transportation planning (providing alternatives to automobile use, and Vision Zero reduction of cyclist injuries/deaths), public health (providing opportunities for active transportation) and climate change (providing low carbon transportattion options).\nChanging or removing bike lanes will interfere with the integrity of these municipal policies.\nThe province is competely unsuited to reviewing in an informed way these municipal policie\\s and the role that bike lanes play in these policies.  What will result if Bill 212 is passsed will be a costly, bureaucratic and inefficient process for approving bike lanes, and ripping oout existing ones, with a lack of accountability for decisons made. This is especially suropring for a goevrnment that rides itself on reducting red tape to get things done.\nIt is particularly objectionable for the Province to have the authority to order that long standing and successsful existing bike lanes be removed.  I ride my bike regularly downtown from the east end of Toronto as an alternative to using my car.  Bike lanes provide a safe way for me to do this.\nThe proposed s. 195.2 of the Highway Traffice Act should be removed in its entirelty from Bill 212\n"

More lanes don't fix traffic, it just invites more and more cars.  The only way to reduce traffic is to create bills that to the opposite of this. Bills that promote the use of public transportation and bikes.  This will undo the good that has been done in the city, making it safer for people not in cars to get around.  We need to be moving forwards, not backwards and this bill is doing exactly that.  Shame on this.\n"

        "comment": "My comments are specific to aspects of this proposed bill that single out removal of bike lanes within the City of Toronto. I oppose this aspect of the proposal for a few reasons:\n1) this is a local issue that only affects the City of Toronto. Why is the provincial government interfering in local matters? This is against the will of the locally elected Toronto city council and takes away resources from the Ontario government that should be put to use in a way that benefits Ontario as a whole. While I am currently a resident of Toronto, I was raised in Niagara Region and lived in Waterloo Region for 5 years and I don\u2019t feel like this has anything to do with such areas of Ontario.\n2) I am a driver, a cyclist and a user of the TTC. I understand that a sound transportation plan for the City of Toronto involves multiple modes of transportation and we should not only be thinking of streets as being for the benefit of motorists. Frankly, I don\u2019t understand why anyone would drive on Yonge, University or Bloor when all three have subway lines along them? As a motorist though, I actually prefer to drive streets with separated bike lanes. There are many people in Toronto that commute, socialize and do errands by bike so they will still be there if bike lanes are removed. Bloor before bike lanes was a mess of trying to get around cyclists to drive along. It felt unsafe as a motorist and as a cyclist. For all but two hours per day, parking was allowed on Bloor and when it wasn\u2019t, the right lane was taken up by cyclists anyway which effectively meant there was only one driving lane in each direction anyway. I feel the current setup with bike lanes is safer and more orderly.\n3) The City of Toronto has already done the traffic studies and considered that information upon making the decision to build the bike lanes. This proposed act reeks of political meddling with no logical reasoning. Again, I\u2019ll state this is a waste of provincial government resources.\n"

        "comment": "As a recent UofT Dental school graduate removing the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes is an absurdly backwards move with respect to safe, efficient traffic infrastructure.\nYou have a population of students in various UofT programs (Undergraduate, Masters, PhD, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medicine) as well as Mt. Sinai healthcare workers who use the University street bike lanes every day. By removal of the bike lane you will be requiring them to walk or add additional traffic to public transit or lanes. The foot print of one car parking spot can hold ~10 bicycles, or 1 car in a lane holding about 6 stopped cyclists. With the ever growing population of toronto set to increase year by year, how does it make sense to make currently overburdened public infrastructure, or currently overburdened car lanes take on even more commuters?\nTying in that statistic that 1 car's parking spot can park 10 bicycles, how many more customers can small businesses fit with a bike lock stand of 10 bikes per 1 car. There are definitely not 10 customers in one car but there can easily be 10 customers on 10 bikes. (or more with the recently more popular cargo ebicycle)\nAlso consider that other commentators stating \"bike lanes aren't used enough\" are often looking at bike lanes in that appear out of nowhere with no safe connection to other bike lanes in the city. If you saw an incomplete street that cars don't regularly use because its not incomplete you wouldn't make the same remarks.\nThere are also more social benefits that are so carelessly overlooked. The lower amount of road damage needing repair and environmental damage that costs tax payers money in the long run are so much higher for automobiles compared to bicycles or public transit. The detriment to health by hazardous gas emissions, the increased cardiovascular risk without regular exercise (Which cycling to work reduces). There's a lot of reasons this bill is extremely short sighted. Despite how obvious the benefits of safe cycling infrastructure are for the city and the people its almost like the city planners have prioritized the financial embezzling tax payer by demolishing bike infrastructure into rather than invest into the health and wellbeing of the city and its people.\nSincerely,\n A prior undergraduate student who biked to school, a current dentist who bikes to work when he can, and a citizen concerned for the financial, health and safety of the people of the cities this bill affects.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly urge you to reconsider this proposal. Removing bike lanes and restricting new ones would be a step backward for Toronto's transportation infrastructure and safety.\nAs a daily bicycle commuter who also relies on the TTC, I can attest to the vital role protected bike lanes play in our city. These lanes not only improve safety for cyclists but also contribute to better traffic flow overall. Protected bike lanes have been shown to increase road capacity and reduce congestion in many cities that have implemented them extensively.\nMoreover, prioritizing cycling infrastructure aligns with Toronto's climate goals. The city's TransformTO Climate Action Strategy aims to have 75% of trips under 5km made by walking or cycling by 2050. Removing bike lanes would directly contradict this objective and potentially increase our carbon footprint.\nIt's also worth noting that removing bike lanes may not achieve the desired effect of reducing congestion. According to the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, cyclists are entitled to use a full lane when it's unsafe to ride to the right. Without dedicated bike lanes, more cyclists will likely exercise this right, potentially leading to slower traffic flow and increased frustration among all road users.\nFurthermore, the safety implications cannot be overstated. Protected bike lanes significantly reduce the risk of accidents between cyclists and motor vehicles. By removing these lanes, we risk increasing accidents and potentially deterring people from choosing this eco-friendly mode of transportation.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, I urge you to consider expanding our cycling network. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have demonstrated that comprehensive cycling infrastructure can significantly reduce traffic congestion while improving public health and environmental outcomes.\nLet's make Toronto a leader in sustainable urban transportation. Please invest in our cycling infrastructure rather than dismantling it. Our city's future mobility, safety, and environmental health depend on forward-thinking policies that embrace all modes of transportation.\n"

I have moved back downtown and since then my car has broken down and I decided to not replace it because it makes more financial sense to not own a car in a city that is already prohibitively expensive to rent in.\nI do almost all of my commuting by bicycle. Transit is poor and traffic is dense in a way that the small amount of space allotted for bike lanes being removed will make no difference.\nThere is no where to park cars in most residential areas. Removing bike lanes and encouraging driving will actually increase dense traffic. It will create dangerous situations for young people and people without drivers licences and for people who are already struggling to get by financially.\nOur tax money has also already been spent on the existing infrastructure and spending it again to remove it is absolutely unacceptable.\nThe lives of cyclists are not worth less than the extra time that drivers have to spend waiting in traffic--and I know how awful it is to sit in Toronto traffic.\n"
