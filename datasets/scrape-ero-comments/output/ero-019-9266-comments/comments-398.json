Bike lanes help encourage people to cycle instead of drive, which relieves congestion. And as a drive I feel safer when bikes have their own space on the road rather than are forced to share lanes with cars.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important infastructure for day to day use. It won't help car divers by removing bike lanes. This bill would be a waste of time and money. Furthermore, If you don't want cyclists on the roads then protected bike lanes would help achieve that.  This bill should not be approved.\nA great way to look at this issue is to think of the other hand. Would people drive cars if there was a spotty road next work that was not fully connected through out the city? Obviously not. Not that might shine light on why there are few cyclist in certain sections of the city. It is a cyclical problem. More bike lanes will help everyone.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident in the province of Ontario, I would like to take a moment to voice my displeasure with this proposed legislation. There are several issues I would like to highlight.\nFirst, I am opposed to this legislation since it impedes on cities' and municipalities' autonomy and expertise. Mayors and city councillors generally live and work in the city or neighbourhood they represent. As such, they are aware and have a good understanding of the local traffic issues and potential solutions in their neighbourhood. Requiring that all plans for new bikes lanes be approved by the province devalues the work of city councillors, ignores local and on-the-ground context, and undermines municipal democracy.\nSecond, I am concerned that adding provincial oversight to municipal road projects will add excessive red tape and simply slow construction on much needed infrastructure. It is genuinely hypocritical that the current Conservative government is so keen on removing so-called red tape to build Highway 413 but has no issues adding it to the construction of bike lanes.\nThird, I am incensed that the government is proposing to rip up existing bike lanes in Toronto and Ottawa. This is fiscally irresponsible and a waste of taxpayers' dollars. I believe that building Highway 413 is fiscally irresponsible as well. The proposed route cuts through farmland, wetlands, and forests, the loss of which would result in increased food insecurity, more flooding in surrounding municipalities, and less clean air and water.\nIn conclusion, I request that the government take these and other comments into consideration when debating Bill 212. I urge the government to scrap this proposed legislation since it takes away decision-making power from democratically elected municipal officials, adds unnecessary red tape, and wastes taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous decision. Removing bike lanes will actually INCREASE congestion. It's obvious. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits and business along Bloor, for example, have spoken up in favour of keeping bike lanes. Why would the govt ignore the voices of the affected business and the expert studies? Not to mention safety: cyclists will be at risk without bike lanes. This is the worst decision this govt has made and this is saying a lot as this govt seems to make nothing but poor decisions. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the further amendment to the proposed framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane, for the following reasons:\nFirst, removing the bike lanes will not reduce congestion. As noted in by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute: \"The proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices. It is also counter to the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes.\"\nSecond, removing the bike lanes will endanger public safety. As noted by the Ontario Traffic Council: \"The proposed legislation will have a serious negative impact on road user safety in Ontario. There is a demonstrated link between adding cycling facilities and improving safety for all modes of travel; any impediment to building safer cycling infrastructure puts people at risk of collision, serious injuries, and death.\nThird, removing the bike lanes will hurt small businesses. See, for example, the Bloor Business Improvement Area noting that the removal of bike lanes would be \"disastrous\".\nFourth, removing newly-installed infrastructure is a waste of taxpayer dollars and will create months of congestion (with all its associated economic harms).\nThe proposed legislation represents a profound failure of judgment and a dereliction of your duty to the public good.\nYou are callously putting lives and businesses at risk and I urge you to reconsider.\n"

People die from biking because of altercations with cars as cars are dangerous and because infrastructure for biking is insufficient for their safety. Removing bike lanes is a safety concern as this will increase death related events from biking. Saving time driving should not be prioritized over health and safety for people.\n"

        "comment": "What actual confounded nonsense is this. \"Oh, just one more lane, just one more lane, one more lane will fix everything!\" and then you get the 401 which has SO many got-dang lanes and is STILL bunged up tighter than a frog's butthole in a watermelon seed fight.\nIt's a proven fact at this point that adding more lanes doesn't fix the problem of traffic. The solution to traffic is to stop making cars the only viable way to get around: we need reliable public transit, walkable city planning, and BIKE LANES. Not yet more car infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes so we can have more car lanes is asinine.\nAlso, we're in a climate emergency. If we don't curb emissions, we are all going to die. Building more car infrastructure is the opposite of curbing emissions. I'd like to still have a livable planet in five years.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not what\u2019s causing traffic congestion within the City of Toronto. Endless, uncoordinated road construction on every possible route is our biggest problem. As a driver, I have experience unacceptable delays sitting in road construction zones. Lanes are closed for either no visible reason or to park equipment for months on end. As one example, the St.Clair/O\u2019Connor sewer replacement has been ongoing for more than 3 years. It has added 30 to 45 minutes to my commute just passing through this intersection, and I have no alternative as it is the only route out of my neighbourhood. I will gladly take an extra minute or so to accommodate bikes as they are a very viable alternative to cars both for personal transportation and delivery. While I sit in construction gridlock, near storefronts that have gone out of business due to the endless construction, bikes pass me!  I think all levels of government know this is the real problem or they wouldn\u2019t be curtailing construction during the upcoming Taylor Swift concert dates to keep traffic moving. Leave bike lanes alone, save lives and the air we breathe!\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Etobicoke my entire life, and I believe this Bill is a huge step backwards in reducing congestion and saving time.\nThere are many people in the City of Toronto that rely on the bike infrastructure on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street for daily trips. Removing the bike lanes will not only waste taxpayer dollars, but also further strain the road capacity by eliminating the choice to do anything but drive.\nAs an Etobicoke resident, I wish I could bike to fulfill my daily needs, but the current bike network is not developed enough to safely allow me to do so. As a result, I drive, and take up space on the road that would otherwise be free.\nWhen I drive in Etobicoke, I much prefer that cyclists have their own lane, since this makes driving simpler for me.\nI believe this Bill to be a severe overreach of the provincial government into municipalities, and that with the passing of this Bill, Ontario residents will experience more congestion and waste more time.\nThe attached link to the 2019 City of Toronto Cycling Survey shows a clear upward trend in cycling throughout the city, including utilitarian cycling.\nThe attached link to the 2023 Bike Share Toronto Business Review shows that 50% of all bike share trips in Toronto occur along Bloor-Danforth or Yonge, the very routes that this Bill aims to eliminate.\n"
