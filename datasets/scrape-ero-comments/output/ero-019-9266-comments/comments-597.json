In the meantime it's going to waste billions of taxpayer money and wipe out acres of valuable wildlife habitats. Nobody wants this besides the developers who will profit from it.\n"

        "comment": "The City of Toronto needs to removes most bike lanes from all major road. For example, the Danforth and Bloor Street lanes contribute to gridlock and ems cannot reach their emergency sites immediately.  The Bike lanes contribute to gridlock and it is not an efficient system in the Toronto area.   Bring back the two lanes on the Danforth and Bloor road.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money and bureaucratic overreach. Doug Ford is trying to make his own life better at the expense of countless cyclists and Ontarians. Removing bike lanes does not add additional lanes for vehicles, it just puts cyclists in even more danger for being hit or killed by inattentive drivers. Requiring all municipalities to seek provincial approval for new bike lanes is unnecessary red tape imposed by non-experts pushing their own public interests above the needs of their communities. Induced demand is why more vehicle lanes does not solve traffic congestion - giving people the safe, equitable, and accessible opportunity to choose walking, cycling, or public transit for their daily travels is what reduces traffic congestion in cities. An attempt at getting people to their destination quicker by prioritizing vehicles\u2019 speed and importance is a step backwards in time and a detrimental decision for our climate emergency protocols. As a province, we need to seek better options for everyone to have a choice about how they get around their cities safely and efficiently. The minister of transportation is not an expert on traffic engineering or climate science - the people of Ontario are and the government should be consulting with the people who are dealing with these problems every day to find actual, defensible and productive solutions. It is heartbreaking to see our government continue to push for corrupt, backhanded deals to benefit a small minority of high-level or influential individual, when millions of Canadians are left without a voice in the matter. Please, for the love of our climate and our community, reverse Bill 212 and consult with actual verified experts on the topic for what the best and highest use case scenario is for our complex urban street systems going into the future.\n"

        "comment": "My 27 year old son Zachary has Fargile X syndrome, a form of cognitive disability.  Zachary has found joy and independence riding his bike to his regular activities in our neighborhood, Leslieville.  Thanks to the bike lanes, including the bike lane on the Danforth, Zachary comes home from his rides alive.  Toronto\u2019s bike lanes keep my special son safe.\nThey also keep me safe.  I have been commuting by bicycle in Toronto for 40 years; I have also been driving on these streets for 40 years.  It is safer and easier for drivers and cyclists when good bike lane infrastructure is in place.\n"

        "comment": "It's hard to understand how politicians who don't live downtown, don\u2019t cycle, and somehow still expect to breeze through a major metropolis by car are the ones making decisions to dismantle bike lanes. After years of planning and investment in this infrastructure, we're now supposed to believe that removing it will \"improve\" traffic flow. In reality, this decision wastes taxpayer dollars, puts cyclists like myself at greater risk by forcing us back into shared lanes with cars, and conveniently funnels money toward construction contracts. And yet, as public transit remains underdeveloped, it seems we\u2019re supposed to accept this as a \"solution\" to congestion. It's a misguided attempt at progress that misses the mark on safety, sustainability, and smart urban planning.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the provincial government adding an extra level of red tape to approving (and keeping existing) bike lanes. The municipal governments are fully capable of making these decisions.  Ontario cities and towns have a long way to go to catch up with enlightened municipalities elsewhere that recognize the benefits of providing safe cycling infrastructure.  Don't slow down the progress that is being made, and definitely don't go backwards by removing bike lanes that have been carefully studied prior to implementing.\nStay in your lane! Life is precious. Citizen safety far outweighs convenience.  Encouraging more car traffic only adds to congestion.\n"

I enjoy biking safely on Bloor Street with my child, and taking away bike lanes would make it harder for my family to lower our carbon footprint through daily activities. Toronto residents have already rejected Doug Ford\u2019s policies in the past, and I\u2019m frustrated to see him continue pushing his agenda through provincial power. This approach is far from reasonable.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this bill for many reasons. First, from a governance point of view, municipalities should decide what are best for them. Bike lanes are a local issue, they should be decided by local politicians.\nSecond, this is a blatant power grab by the 905 trying to assert its will on the 416. Toronto residents are not telling Brampton or Mississauga or Oshawa what to do, nor should they decide what is best for torontonians.\nThird, what is the premier\u2019s vision for the province? Is it that we all live in concrete boxes in massive sky scraper canyons filled with concrete and no green space. That we all drive massive Cadillac Escalades like the premier. Live in dead smog filled cities like Sao Paolo or or Houston or Wuhan? What happened to the True North Strong and Free? Perhaps the Premier should visit Munich or Copenhagen- large cities built on human scale with significant green space. Where people actually walk places and neighborhoods exist. Places that are nice to live.\nBike lanes reduce congestion by taking cars off the road, they speed commute times, they provide cleaner air, less noise and create more livable cities. They encourage healthy living and a healthier population with lower health care costs which enable lower taxes.\nIt is a fallacy to think that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion. Our cities are growing and more people in more cars is not the answer to less congestion. Go to Sao Paolo or Houston and see. We are not the first city to navigate growth. Learn from the cities that have done it well.\n"

        "comment": "Our planet is in a state of emergency, and continued inaction will lead to irreparable damage for generations. This bill not only reflects a profound misunderstanding of the climate crisis by our policymakers but also represents an active effort to reverse progress.\nAs someone who uses our bike lanes 4-6 days a week to commute, I know firsthand how essential they are. They allow me to navigate the city safely, avoid adding to traffic congestion, and reduce the burden on our already inadequate transit system.\nThe proposals in Bill 212 represent a harmful misallocation of resources, endanger the safety of cycling commuters, and will worsen congestion in our city. Instead of dismantling critical infrastructure, we need to invest in more cycling networks, improve public transit, and take meaningful action to meet our emissions targets.\nThis bill highlights how disconnected our government is from the realities facing our province. We need leaders who prioritize sensible, data-driven policies that benefit people and the environment\u2014not ones who undermine progress and jeopardize our future.\n"

I strongly protest removing existing bike lanes and putting a moratorium on new bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I have a strong disagreement with the title of this bill and its contents. I live in Toronto and commute to work 5 days a week on a bicycle. I also use my bike to get around the city for errands, visiting friends and family. Removing bike lanes in the city on Bloor, University, Yonge or other streets in the city will reduce my mobility in the city, reduce my safety, and add time to my commuting - the opposite of this bills intention. The tile of this bill assumes the \u201cYou\u201d drives a vehicle, which so many people do not do. Prioritizing the car in the city caters to a certain band of the population, at the expense of others. I believe we need more infrastructure for cyclists, and adding a level of involvement with the provincial government will slow this down.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my opposition to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time, because this is clearly an overreach of the Provincial responsibilities, and it doesn\u2019t improve traffic or security for citizens of Ontario and its communities.\nAs per the report from the city of Toronto (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-250545\u2026), removing bike lanes will reduce alternate means of transportation, prioritizing cars, and putting people\u2019s lives at risk for those who opt for bicycles.\nIt is a known fact that providing the infrastructure and secure transport options is the best way to reduce gridlock and traffic jams in cities. We can take examples from Europe like London, or Amsterdam.\nThis bill does not have people\u2019s best interest as the objective, and has the potential to make a bad situation eve worse.\nThe province should prioritize the development and improvement of railways, buses, bike lanes, and other alternate means of transportation to incentivize people to rely more on transit than cars.\n"
