        "comment": "The restriction and removal of bike lanes in cities is counter productive. Business with bike lanes in front of them have increased business (as studies by the City of Toronto and other institutes have found). Our own emergency services say their response times are shotten father the installation of the Bloor bike lanes. People are safer. Traffic will be better as more people can use an alternative method of transport to let those who need to drive do so with fewer other cars on the road. Bike lanes in dense cities moke so much sense to add, let alone keep when they are already there. Please reconsider this legislative goal.\nWith respect to the construction of the 413, a normal environmental assessment seems appropriate for a project like this to make sure we get things right without harming things like the water we drink. I do not support reducing this assessment.\n"

        "comment": "Leave bike lanes alone. It's a waste of taxpayer money to take out bike lanes that are already installed. I use them all the time and they make me feel much safer when I'm biking with my kids. I also drive all the time and appreciate bike lanes, as they make bike behavior more predictable and easier to navigate around. Plus - we need more alternative forms of transport not less.\nI'm also confused about why you're focused on telling municipalities what they can/can't do on their roads - let municipalities govern themselves and focus on the mess in Healthcare and education. Why is this even a focus for a provincial government? It makes no sense. Stay in your lane!\n"

The bike lanes on University, Bloor and Yonge should be seen as part of the larger network to connect routes around the city. Look at the bigger picture. Bike lanes save lives.\nLook for the evidence. Gather the GLOBAL data. Talk to citizens across the city. Don't just listen to special interest groups.\nWhy throw bad money after good? The bike lanes cost a lot of money to install. Why is the provincial government spending millions to get rid of them? Why is this Conservative government, claiming to be \"for the people\" spending PROVINCIAL tax money on a local municipal issue? Aren't people in outside the GTA mad at this move?\n"

I live in Ottawa and Toronto-based lawmakers do not have the required understanding of our city to make informed decisions.\n2. Bike lanes are, for the most part, beneficial to health communities. They have promote active living, keep people safe and have positive environmental impacts. While of course their positioning needs to be carefully considered so that all modes of transportation are balanced, there is no reason or data supporting limiting bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely absurd proposition--wasteful and a terrible misuse of public funds. Consider the cost of salaries to conceive, design and build the bike lanes, and the material resources that went into creating the bike lanes. This alone should be a reason to preserve them. But there is more.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge streets are well-used and increase safety for cyclists and pedestrians.\nLet's follow this logic: more cars on the road results in more congestion. Transit policies that support more cars on the road are going to create more congestion. Transit policies that support accessible, effective public transportation and bike transit will reduce the amount cars on the road.\nBike lanes reduce air and noise pollution in the city, and create safe, effective means of transportation for cyclists.\nMunicipalities should have the right to determine the appropriate bike lanes in their cities. This is not a provincial concern and the province should stay out of it.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government should not be seeking to add red tape and bureaucracy. Municipalities should be allowed to make decisions in the best interest of their citizens and the province should not interfere with those decisions. Bike lanes provide a climate friendly way for people to get around and the province should not impede their development. Bike lanes are also proven to reduce congestion, reduce collisions, improve health, and bolster economies. The province should not stand in the way of any of these goals. Bikes lanes are essential infrastructure with many benefits and the province should not stand in the way of their development.\nIn addition, the province should not be spending it's time and money meddling in the affairs of a single municipality. Bills passed by the Ontario government should benefit all Ontarians. My tax dollars should not be used to impact the policy of a city where I don't live.\nThis bill is regressive, uninformed, and does not benefit Ontarians. I am firmly opposed to Bill 212\n"

Add more bike lanes and make cities less car focused to reduce gridlock - I don\u2019t even cycle but I know less bike lanes won\u2019t mean less cyclists, especially when people use them to save money and to actively put less cars on the road.

        "comment": "This is a good start,  the special interest groups at the local level seem to have too much power.    Here in Ottawa, bike lanes went up on a main aterial business street bank street and it has turned into a parking lot and the bike lane sits empty.    They are a expense to install and remove for the winter.  We only have so much tax dollars and if I have to choose I would rather feed the homeless considering  that people with $2000 bikes and $300 riding outfit have their dedicated lane at public expense and it is an expensive uber eat and door dash subsidy when we have higher priroties.\nI suspect tpt as a Service wil eventually destroy all the premise for these bike lanes anyway.  Solving tomorrow problem with yesterday out of context studies seems stupid to me.\nSome bike lanes are great but they are not a method of mass transit.  The City of Ottawa has completly ruined public transit, we have an LRT bought at walmart that is always broken an d buses now don't have the right routes anymore.\nSolve congestion by improving public transit and make it free and or affordable.  It is mostly subsidized anyway, why not go the extra mile?   That would make more of an impact then the useless carbon taz in reducing emission.\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out bike lanes on these major streets will not only make cyclists' commutes more difficult and dangerous, the construction work will make drivers way more angry and late than they claim to be now! This hasty proposal is being made without proper evidence or data. My entire office of 15 people cycles to work at least 3 times a week, and almost all of us use the bike lanes that are being proposed to be removed. While I understand being frustrated stuck in traffic, I do not think removing the bike lanes will help, and even if they do, why are drivers being prioritized over folks who don't have access to a personal vehicle? When public transit is as underfunded and therefore unreliable in Toronto, cycling is the easiest, cheapest, fastest way to get to work and school for many. I DO NOT support this act and would like to ensure my voice is heard in this manner.\n"

        "comment": "I hesitated as to whether to provide comment to this proposed law. I have never provided comment to anything like this in the past, but this proposal makes me so angry that I felt I had to say something. Unfortunately, the proposal to remove bike lanes strikes me as a 100% political move by our Premier, who is trying to create a wedge issue before an early election. Kory Teneycke pretty much confirmed this on the Curse of Politics. A summary of my points against this proposed legislation is below:\n- The focus should be on getting people around, not just getting cars around. This will remove freedom from people to choose their preferred mode of transportation and get to their destination safely. It favours people who are wealthy enough to own a personal vehicle.\n- Decisions around bike lanes should be made by local governments based on study, data and a longterm vision for getting people around. It is fair for the Ontario Government to ask the City of Toronto to study whether or not the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University are having the desired impact. The Ontario Government should work with the City of Toronto to determine if there are other solutions that could work. Poor decisions are made when a higher level of Government over-rules the local Government making decisions without the data and longterm vision.\n- This decision makes of mockery of our local democracy. There are more ridings in the City of Toronto that voted Liberal or NDP than Conservative, and the City voted for a mayor who supports active transport.\n- This decision will lead to more deaths and serious injuries. Drivers (and bike riders) will continue to make errors that lead to injuries and deaths, and without separated bike lanes, bicycle rides are at an increased risk. While driving a bike on a side street is definitely preferred, this is not always possible. Side streets often end at a major street, side streets often do not have traffic lights at major streets and many destinations are on major streets such as Bloor, Yonge and University.\n- Many studies show that an increase in the number of roads/lanes for vehicles does not rude traffic due to induced demand.\n- World Class cities all over the World have chosen more bike lanes, not less. New York, Montreal, Amsterdam and many more but our bicycle network to shame. We should learn from these Cities if we want Toronto to become a true world class city.\n"

        "comment": "As a biker who regularly uses bike lanes in the city of Toronto to get around, this Bill will gravely impact my ability to safely navigate the city. Having dedicated bike lanes has encouraged me to bike more often and decrease pressures on public transportation and road ways (as one bike is exponentially smaller than a single car). As a health care professional I see many bike vs car related accidents that could be prevented or reduced with dedicated bike lanes that keep bikes and cars separarte. As a driver dedicated bike lanes also make me feel safer that I won\u2019t be hitting someone on a bike when driving in the city. Reducing car lanes seems worthwhile under these conditions. Making bike lanes in the city of Toronto a provincial issue instead of a municipal issue disregards the insight our municipal elected leaders have into the needs and wants of the people of the city of Toronto. After all the money that has been put in to making Toronto a bike friendly city, it seems nearsighted to demolish this work for the slim chance it will improve traffic conditions (which is slim considering it will most likely increase this issue as people who no longer feel safe biking bring more cars on the road). Though it is understandable to look for solutions for traffic issues, more research should be conducted to inform decision making as other cities have found increased bike lanes have decreased car traffic by encouraging more people to use bike lanes which take up less space but allow more people to commute then car lanes. As a citizen of Toronto I vehemently oppose this Bill.\n"
