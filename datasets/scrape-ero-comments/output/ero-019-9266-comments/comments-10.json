        "comment": "Removing bike lanes, and preventing new ones from being built, will do nothing to fix congestion, and will only result in more cyclists being killed. The University Avenue bike lanes in particular are a key asset to allow health care workers to get to work safely. The bike share station outside Toronto General Hospital sees so much use they need to have a valet to manage overflow. Bike lanes allow more clarity and visibility for drivers, as they make it less likely a cyclist is in your blind spot. Drivers choosing to cycle instead of drive, as many will do when bike lanes open, allows for much more efficient road use, and will relieve congestion for other riders.\n"

        "comment": "I believe strongly in Toronto's goal of having 75% of commutes under 5 km done by walking, cycling or transit - we know for a fact that our city's population will continue to grow and more cars are inevitable. Converting car commuters to cyclists is essential to our goals, our health and environment - bike lanes are the infrastructure needed to encourage this change. This bill should be scrapped - leave these decisions to the cities themselves.\n"

        "comment": "Everything about this bill is wrong. The province is way overstepping its authority and micromanaging municipalities. This is also obviously a cynical ploy by the premier to shore up political support from homeowners/car drivers (his main constituency). And ultimately, a stupid, backwards move. Cities are trying to build for the future and move forward. Residents have embraced biking as a healthy, cheap, alternative to driving. Along with well-funded public transit and beautiful, functional walking paths, bike lines are the way forward. I am tired of ugly multi lane car-only streets that make life more dangerous for everyone. We've had too many cyclist and pedestrian deaths this year. One death is too many! we want SAFE STREETS for EVERYONE.\n"

        "comment": "I think that this is a silly proposal that is more concerned with pandering to a tiny minority of the population with grievances against bike lanes than it is with actually reducing congestion. The fact is that providing people with safe and speedy options other than an automobile to move around cities actually reduces congestion, because cars take up a lot of space and are inefficient. By reducing the use of bike lanes as a means of providing safe, alternative options for commuters, the province will force more people into automobiles which will actually increase traffic congestion. This is just basic geometry: cars take up more space than bikes, and the vast majority of them are only holding one person at rush hour.\nIn addition to being misguided, the proposal also represents a gross overreach of provincial authority. This government claims to want to reduce 'red tape', but this proposal would add an enormous amount of red tape for municipalities seeking to make decisions about the use of their own public roadways. Citizens in municipalities vote for municipal representatives, and those representatives, empowered by the consent of the governed, should be free to make decisions about the use of their public roadways based on the specific needs of their citizens. They do not need 'oversight' from the provincial government to do so.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes reduce traffic, help people feel safer, and are the way forward - everywhere except Ontario seems to understand this as a matter of policy. Passing legislation which would enable the province to micro-manage municipal planning matters is a dangerous, onerous, and expensive proposition. I get that this government\u2019s priorities are not environmentally-conscious policy and providing an off-ramp for carbon-emitting vehicle users as our planet is literally dying around us, but people are also dying on the streets. Stop politicizing and penalizing people trying to live economically and consciously, and maybe spend some money sorting out the tire fires that are Infrastructure Ontario and Metrolinx. No wonder we can\u2019t get decent public transit in this province. If it\u2019s not clear yet, I will conclude so that my submission is firmly recorded as negative feedback: I am not in favour of Bill 212 and think it would have extremely negative social, economic, and health impacts on local and province-wide key stakeholders and communities.\n"

This will encourage more use of transit and reduce the number of cars on the road for those that really need to drive.\nThis will save me, the TAX PAYER, the billions being spent on the 413 etc. and will increase the well being of the citizens of Ontario.\nHere is an interesting link on machine learning regarding bike lane use.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to emphasize the importance of maintaining bike lanes on our major streets and to clarify why this issue falls under municipal jurisdiction rather than provincial oversight.\nFirstly, bike lanes are crucial for promoting safe and sustainable transportation options. They encourage cycling, which not only reduces traffic congestion but also lowers greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier environment. Removing these lanes could discourage cycling, leading to increased car use and worsening air quality.\nAdditionally, bike lanes enhance the safety of all road users. Studies have shown that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians. By maintaining these lanes, we can foster a safer community for everyone.\nFrom a governance perspective, transportation planning, including the implementation and maintenance of bike lanes, is primarily a municipal concern. Municipalities are responsible for local roadways and infrastructure, allowing them to tailor solutions to the unique needs of their communities. Provincial authorities typically focus on broader policies and regulations, while specific local conditions and community feedback should guide decisions regarding bike lane maintenance.\nIn conclusion, preserving bike lanes is not just about cycling; it\u2019s about promoting a sustainable, safe, and vibrant community. I urge you to consider the long-term benefits of these lanes and support their retention.0\n"

        "comment": "Please don't remove bike lanes. As a driver, they make my commutes safer as I don't need to worry about passing cyclists, and surprisingly, often faster and easier as they remove bottlenecks on the road created by cars switching lanes to weave between parked cars in the right lane.\nThe data shows that the addition to travel time is extremely minimal when examined using proper statistical methods (i.e. comparing against other routes to control for overall increase in traffic) instead of anecdotal methods.\nAs an occasional cyclist, they also ease congestion, as myself and many others like me choose to use bikes to do grocery runs, visit friends, etc, instead of driving the car or taking an Uber.\nThis proposed policy also completely oversteps municipal jurisdiction and flies against all of the goodwill the province had garnered with its Ontario-Toronto New Deal.

The responsibility should rest with municipalities who understand the urban planning of their cities and towns in far more detail then the provincial government. It's a gross overreach of power (which is ironic as this government committed to less red tape and restrictions). As someone who was supportive of this government, if bike lanes and innovative traffic solutions become part of the chopping block my vote will change.\nCar transit is wholly not sustainable for a city growing and becoming far more dense. I truly hope the government will rethink their involvement in the bike lane topic.\n"

Studies have shown that bicycles reduce congestion, and increase business in the neighbourhoods where they exist.\nWith bi-directional cycling lanes, instead of separate single direction cycling lanes, emergency vehicles can use them to bypass the traffic congestion caused by the single-occupant motor vehicles.\nDon't genuflect before the automobile gods, but cater to the betterment of humankind. Help the environment by reducing car use. Reduce sprawl with walkable and cyclable neighbourhoods and street front shopping in new mixed-use developments.\n"

        "comment": "I genuinely believe blocking bike lanes is the worst thing we can do to address grid lock. I am going to write from the perspective of a Torontonian because this proposal is squarely aimed at the city and hopes to reduce people\u2019s quality of life in the city.\nOur overall public transportation is lacking and it\u2019s showing in the form of gridlock on the highways not in the city centre. When the bike share program is growing at the rate that it is in Toronto, it\u2019s telling us a couple things:\n1- biking in the city as a reliable form of transportation is realistic and people are opting to do so.\n2- our public transit system needs more lines and faster especially in the east west direction below bloor.\nTo combat traffic we need to get as many cars as we can off the road and people in those cars on public transit or other micro mobility devices such as bikes to the extent possible.\nAnd on the bike lane topic I will give you one great example. I have been familiar with the Danforth area for over a decade now. Before the bike lanes that stretch just had cars parked on the right lane, cars and bikes weaving in and out of traffic to avoid parked cars causing more traffic and endangering lives. Now with the new configuration, micromobility users are safer. There is still parking on the street and the traffic flow is better than it was before bike lanes. Businesses are happier that people can bike down Danforth to get their errands done increasing business to the stores.\nI think we need to be really careful about not taking a step back here. We\u2019ve come a long way in making this city somewhat bike friendly in the past few years and a blow to that progress would surely be another dark episode of the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are healthy for any growing city. Not only do they get me where I need to go much faster than driving, when done correctly I also feel a lot more safe and secure. As a driver, biker and pedestrian, we need cleaner, safer streets, removing bike lanes will only make things more difficult and dangerous for all commuters. I do not feel safe having to share a lane with a biker, or a car. We should be looking at removing on street parking on major arteries such as Bloor instead as they cause bad visibility, more gridlock and slow down emergency vehicles. A bike lane is much narrower then space dedicated to street parking.\n"
