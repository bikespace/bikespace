        "comment": "The Provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to municipal governments who are trying to speed up local transportation and giving people transport options.\nI use bike lanes everyday and consider them essential infrastructure like sidewalks.\nWe need to think about guaranteeing safety for everyone not just those in cars and maximizing how many cars we can physically fit. The commute times on some streets increased by minutes due to large return to work programs not the bike lanes.\nWhen I drive I would rather bikers be in their own protected lane rather then mixed in with cars.\nBike lanes support transit which in turn takes people and their cars off the road reducing traffic. Removing lanes will likely have the opposite effect.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose bill 212 and any measure that impedes the safety of cyclists, motorists, pedestrians, and anyone on our streets. Bike lanes are not only important for cyclist safety but can also reduce congestion by making it easier and more accessible for people to choose cycling as an alternate means of transport to a vehicle. Additionally, the decision of how we use our streets should remain municipal and reflect the needs of the municipality. I want to live in a community that keeps me safe, that moves towards environmental sustainability and minimises the reliance on personal vehicles for urban transportation. Bill 212 is a regression and restricts municipal agency.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, this bill is a big step back and a horrible idea overall, we should be adding bike lanes, not removing them, especially lines that are relatively well done. Removing bike lanes won't fix traffic, but adding more public transportation and safe bike lanes will do it.\nI live on Bathurst/Lakeshore and work from home, but most of the time my commute is by bike, University and Bloor's bike lanes are convenient and safe. If I need to go on Bloor I and use a secondary street, at some point I'll still end up riding on Bloor, but it'll be an unsafe ride with pedestrians, or unsafe for me with cars.\nListen to people and urbanists, cities are for people, not cars\n"

        "comment": "Subject: Opposition to Proposed Removal of Bike Lanes in Toronto\nDear Ontario Ministry of Transportation,\nI am writing to express my opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto. This proposal would hinder sustainable, safe, and active transportation options that are vital for a growing urban area like Toronto.\nKey Concerns:\n1.\tSetback for Sustainable Transportation: Removing bike lanes discourages cycling, increasing car dependence, emissions, and congestion. Bike lanes play a crucial role in reducing pollution and supporting a multi-modal transit future.\n\t2.\tCompromised Safety for Cyclists: Dedicated bike lanes protect cyclists on busy streets, fostering safer, healthier commuting options. Their removal would place cyclists at higher risk, deterring this important mode of transportation.\n\t3.\tUndermining Local Autonomy: Municipalities have the best understanding of local transit needs. Limiting their control over bike lane development ignores local expertise and restricts tailored solutions.\nInstead of scaling back cycling infrastructure, Ontario should support expanding it to build a safer, healthier, and more sustainable transportation network for all. I urge the Ministry to reconsider this proposal and work collaboratively with cities like Toronto toward a balanced, forward-looking transportation strategy.\nThank you for considering this perspective.\nSincerely,\nRaheel\n"

Bike lanes DO NOT slow down traffic. 1000s of cars all with one driver creates traffic. Removing bike lanes will be a disservice to the people of Toronto. It will make it more dangerous to be a cyclist and will likely result in more accidents.\n"

        "comment": "The science is overwhelming. The precedent in other countries is obvious. The rhetoric being used to justify this bill is nonsensical.\nBike lanes do not cause traffic.  They alleviate traffic by providing a more efficient alternative. This is blatantly obvious to anyone that has ever been in the Netherlands or Paris or Copenhagen or any other city that dedicated itself to improving its bike infrastructure. These cities move more people with less road space than we do in Toronto. See any NotJustBikes video for more information.\nDoug Ford is a bad conservative. He claims to value individual freedoms over government overreach, but has committed himself to massive overreach of provincial power to exercise specific control over one city's road use. Let municipalities make their own decisions and keep provincial power provincial.\nI have a job opportunity on Bloor. I was so excited about it, but now it's tainted with fear the I might not be able to get there safely and efficiently.\nVote NO on Bill 212\n"

        "comment": "Why is this Bill so one-sided, in favour of cars? Not everyone has access to a car. I live in Ottawa, I work from home, and I don't have time to drive my autistic young adult son everywhere. He has a part-time job and has to use the bus and LRT service to go downtown. This takes 3 hours out of his day. The bike paths are not continuous, or safe enough to get him to his destination. And when he wants to socialize with his special-needs group in the evening, I have to drive him. There are many, many people with disabilities, seniors, and young families who would love to have safe bike lanes to get to their destinations. If they had options like safe and continuous bike lanes, this would take a lot of car off the roads, including mine, which would alleviate pollution and make driving smoother for car owners. Why is this not taken into consideration at all? Despite the numerous studies that show that adding more car lanes is dangerous, polluting and ultimately self-defeating?\n"

        "comment": "Dedicated bike lanes are a much needed alternative and need to remain.  The data being quoted as evidence against them is inaccurate and as old as I am.\nHaving lived in every region of Toronto and GTA over the last 35 years, i have commuted in a variety of ways (motorcycle, car, bicycle, TTC) to Toronto. While a vehicle still being my primary means of transportation, it's super obvious that we need other options beyond cars.       I can bike at twice the speed of a car in Toronto, and the TTC and frequently did. This was the case before the bike lanes.\nThere are no feasible alternative bike routes and removing them is at odds with new residential housing that come with no parking that they are near.\nConstruction companies and delivery trucks blocking 1-2 lanes for a year to offload goods have caused me more grief driving than a cyclist ever has.\nCar traffic is not sustainable, and removing bike lanes will do nothing. Everything will still be bumper to bumper.\nThe uneducated officials at the helm of Ontario need to stop constantly meddling with carefully thought out city planning that know far more about infrastructure\n"

This city has a large cycling community, and having these bike lanes makes it much safer for cyclists, and puts less cars on the road, which actually RELIEVES congestion for cars.

        "comment": "TLDR; by exempting highway 413 from Environmental Assessment, schedule 3 risks the environmental health and community well-being of Ontario.\nSchedule 4 moves transportation in the opposite direction of what is needed to reduce congestion and increase individual freedom and mobility by putting barriers in the way of more bicycle lanes.\nA) Schedule 3, exempting Highway 413 and associated works from the Environmental Assessment Act, is a dangerous move that removes government accountability for environmental and community impacts.\nEnvironmentally, the 85 waterways and 220 wetlands the highway would cut through could disrupt countless habitats and further stress already endangered species. The ecosystem services of water infiltration and drinking water will also be reduced and put at risk.\nIn terms of community impacts, I live right beside one of the sections of Highway 413 and know that - if it proceeds as intended - it would segregate the new neighbourhood of Heritage Heights from the rest of the city, turning from its intention to be a lively \"town centre\" to yet another disconnected suburban bedroom community. This division would render Heritage Heights unable to sustain the amenities that make for pleasant, accessible, and environmentally-conscious urban or suburban living.\nB) Schedule 4, particularly the provisions requiring ministerial approval for bicycle lanes and initiating a review of existing bicycle lanes, is an ill-advised transportation management strategy.\nFirst, prioritizing cars and car lanes will likely result in induced demand, cancelling out any reductions in congestion in short order.\nSecond, bicycles are simply a denser mode of transportation, allowing for (with sufficient infrastructure) a greater flow of individuals, contributing to an actual congestion solution.\nThird, cyclist separation not only ensures their own safety, but allows those who choose to drive to do so without worry of minding passing and weaving cyclists.\nFourth, promoting cycling supports economic mobility due to its reduced cost of ownership and operation.\nI, as an occasional cyclist, have often been dissuaded from cycling due to fragmented and dangerous bicycle lanes. The use of the University, Bloor, and College corridor bicycle lanes show that even slightly improved infrastructure can induce bicycle ridership. Putting more barriers in the way of bicycle lanes - and reviewing and removing existing ones - would shift more people back to cars, reduce mobility options, and have a negative impact on sustainability.\n"

Bike lanes are PROVEN to increase the business of stores nearby them compared to parking spots. Moreover, cycling keeps people fit and healthy, reducing the load on the healthcare system.\nRemoving bike lanes does not convince cyclists to start driving, it just makes it more unsafe. This policy change will put people in danger.\nDuring a climate crisis (which we are in right now), transportation policy needs to be focusing on reducing the number of cars on the road. Cycling infrastructure is an excellent way to reduce GHG emissions.\n"
