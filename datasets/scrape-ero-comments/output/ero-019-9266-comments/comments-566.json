        "comment": "This proposed bill misses the mark on many levels and must be rejected and the process started over with a clear objective on improving transportation systems into the future.\nBuilding new highways should be where it is shown that they are needed in the context of alternate transportation sytems, not just where a premier thinks is good (and his supporters happen to have already purchased the land), with minimal concern for envinronmental  and farmland damage.  If a new highway is called for after a careful analysis, then also do a cost comparison of re-publicizing the 407, a highway that was too quickly privatized by a past administration to balance a budget, something we are all paying for now.  MTO has qualified staff to make these analyses, don't throttle them with a poorly thought out 'bulid more highways fast bill!  Get with the times and do it right!\nBike lanes: European countries, and even non-first-world countries such as Colombia, know the importance of active transportation and are well ahead of us in designing and building safe, efficient and well engineered active transportation systems.  It is time we get with the times and do the same; having a bill to reduce or eliminate bike lanes in an already inefficient system is going backwards.  Further, it is time that the province stop interferring with Toronto and its attempts to do the right thing.\nSCRAP THIS 'BUILD THE 413 FAST AND TAKE OUT BIKE LANES Bill!  Go back to the drawing board and look broadly at transportation systems, environmenetal concerns and effeciencies, and how different modes  fit into a compreshensive system, and ensure interconnections with these different modes.\n"

We should be building better bike and transit infrastructure to encourage more people to choose not to drive - that's the only approach that makes sense and is backed by international research and precedent. This bill is blatantly corrupt meddling by Doug Ford for the benefit of his friends. Stay out of municipal affairs! And bike lanes aside, I do also notice and abhor the nonsense provisions being proposed here to circumvent checks and balances standing rightfully in the way of letting Doug pave the greenbelt for the benefit of his developer friends.\n"

        "comment": "The decision to remove existing bike lanes is foolish and pandering to a select few who are able to afford a private motor vehicle. For those of us who rely on public transit, our own two feet and most enjoyably, our bikes, many of these bikes lanes are our main ways of commuting into work.\nI personally use the Bloor Street bike lanes several times a week, well into the winter season until they are no longer maintained and are obstructed with snow (another issue altogether). I use them to run errands, to commute to work, to get across town to visit friends and to stop along at the shops and restaurants along the way. Whenever I use them, I am never the sole occupant of the bike lanes. There are always at least 20-25 other cyclists that I pass along the way to my destination. These range from others like me who are commuting, to parents with their children in a bike seat behind them, to delivery drivers who need those lanes to stay safe as they go about their jobs.\nTo remove bike lanes and completely prioritize motor vehicles on roads, you are making it exponentially more dangerous for those who cycle. We will still need to be on the road, but now we will have to share a lane with cars. Cars that, if they are properly following the highway control act, should be at least a meter away from cyclists. Meaning technically alone main arteries like Bloor, cyclists could rightfully take up the whole lane of traffic by riding in the center. Somehow I don't believe motorists would enjoy that scenario either. Even with the separated bike lanes, I almost get hit by motorists at intersections at least several times every time I venture out. You would be making things so much more dangerous for those of us who have limited other forms of transportation. Our lives are in your hands. Please make the right and educated decision.\nTo further disprove the 'need' for removal and deprioritization of bike lanes, here is an article detailing exactly how that would not be the case should that even be implemented:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319#:~:text=Bi\u2026\n"

By choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing us back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions. This WILL increase injuries and deaths on what is on track to be one of the worst years on record.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city. Studies have continualy found that bike lanes increase spending and local buisnesses and make roads safer for all users.\nFarthermore, none of this bill will fix congestion. Building more highways like the one in this bill will only provide more car-centric sprawl.\n"

As a driver along these routes, I feel safer with the cyclists being provided protected lanes, knowing that together we all are working to get to our destinations in the best way possible.

These bike lanes were installed after research, consultation and deliberation by the municipities in question. Tearing them up is a waste of taxpayers money that could be better spent on things that will actually alleviate traffic congestion, such as public transport. You are the provincial government. Deal with provincial matters and let the cities make their own decisions.\nBike lanes also make commutes safer for the thousands of cyclists that commute daily on these thoroughfares.

        "comment": "I am a driver and am horrified by the potential for bike lanes to be removed. I commute through the city everyday and bike lanes have given me significant peace of mind. Cyclists being forced to join the main roadway is a very scary thought as it is all too easy to clip or turn into cyclists when they are on roads without bike lanes now. I very much do not want to hurt or kill a cyclist who could do easily be protected.\nWhen bike lanes are removed, it will discourage so many people from cycling and many will instead drive, adding far more cars to the roadway, causing further congestion and doubling or tripling the amount of space occupied by one person on the roadway.\nAdditionally it is abundantly clear that traffic congestion lies in several factors caused by drivers overselves, not bike lanes . The number of cars blocking traffic by stopping where they shouldn\u2019t and causing a bottle neck is beyond frequent. This desperately needs to be policed and enforced. Drivers also seem unaware of basic anti congestion techniques and etiquette that could easily reduce congestion if there was a consistent understanding through drivers.\nFor example, if everyone is aware of and implements zipper merges, two lanes of a roadway can be used equally approaching a bottle neck with each continuing ahead at an equal rate, rather than a twice as long queue of vehicles approaching the bottle neck, causing some to move right, cut ahead several cars then cut back in, causing a rubber band effect. The current disorderly movement on the road causes frustrations amongst drivers who then make more adjustments trying to move ahead and ultimately causing a ripple of stopping and starting vehicles in its wake.\nPlease do not remove bike lanes, I\u2019ve never heard of a worse idea.\n"

        "comment": "Schedule 4 proposes that the Ministry of Transportation has jurisdiction over decisions relating to municipal roads and municipal planning. I have worked as a general contractor on road projects, there is already a lot of complexity working with the city and the region, adding more government entities can only cause further costs and delays to road improvement projects.\nSchedule 4 poses restrictions on bicycle lanes where such bicycle lanes would impede traffic. Motor vehicles have a capacity of 600-1,600 people/hour, while a two-way protected bikeway has a capacity of 7,500 people/hour. With the increasing density of Ontario cities, prioritizing higher capacity modes of transportation is the only long-term solution for decreasing gridlock.\nSchedule 3 proposes an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act to construct Highway 413. Further to my above comment, I am strongly opposed to constructing Highway 413 in favour of higher capacity transit options. In addition, in this time of climate crisis, it is everyone's responsibility to prioritize environmental recommendations, especially the responsibility of governments.\nSchedule 2 provides more leeway for the government to expropriate land for Highway 413. I am opposed to highway 413 and do not believe land owners (residential, ICI or otherwise) should be displaced for infrastructure that will add no long-term value to this province. As if that wasn't concerning enough, I am horrified at the prospect that taxpayer money could be used to remove and/or relocate existing utilities in support of this project.\nSchedule 1 I have some minor concerns about expropriation, however I do not live in a rural area and I don't understand the tradeoff of losing profitable farmland in exchange for better internet service. I can say that my family's cottage does not have infrastructure for high speed internet, so I understand the need.\nSchedule 5 no concerns.\nI have both lived and worked in the GTA and I will never move back due to the vehicle dependency and the amount of traffic. I have a 5km commute on two-way protected bikeways in the Region of Waterloo. I arrive at work having finished a workout, alert, and ready to start my day. In the GTA I arrived at work either resigned to my fate of traffic purgatory, or frustrated nearly to tears from higher than usual volume. My friend had a 14km commute in the GTA, which they would have cycled if not for the fact that cycling down Eglinton at rush hour is a death sentence.\nIn summary, my preference is that the Ontario government shift its focus from archaic transportation plans towards solutions that better reflect the population density needs of the present and the environmental sustainability needs of the future. Or better yet, direct funding towards MRIs and ICU beds because the state of our healthcare system makes me genuinely afraid to continue living here.\n"

Safety should be the number one priority and bike lanes are a major contributor to HEALTHY, HAPPY, ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CITIES.

I beg you PLEASE do not removed bike lanes in the city. We need more bike infrastructure not less!!!!\n"
