        "comment": "I am opposed to Bill 212 in that it unfairly targets people who cannot afford, or cannot drive a motorized vehicle. People who prefer to travel using their own energy must not be put in dangerous situations. The limiting and removal of bikes lanes puts cyclist back in traffic lanes. Cars must allow a meters length beside a bicycle and this is often ignored by drivers. Instead of removing bike lanes, improving and adding infrastructure encourages more people to travel without a motorized vehicle thus lessening gridlock. The additional benefits of better physical health and less pollution are also of note.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Senior who still rides his bike on city streets. I contend that it can be a dangerous situation when trying to share the road with cars. I have become increasingly frustrated by the changes and so-called improvements of bike lanes in Hamilton. Reducing car lanes has obviously increased congestion and frustration for cars and their drivers. They fall short of providing bike riders any degree of comfort and safety.\nHere is my idea: Why not save a ton of money by simply paving a two-foot bike lane beside a sidewalk? It's cheaper and most important safer for bikers. Streets are for cars; bikes belong off the roads.\nI do not feel safe when sharing the road with traffic. I can't tell you how many near-collisions I have had with distracted, speeding or just plain angry car drivers. That's why I have no problem driving on sidewalks. When I encounter pedestrians, I go out of my way to apologize for being on the sidewalk and many agree that riding the road is a dangerous thing.\nHamilton has wasted millions of dollars in redesigning its roads to accommodate bikes but I believe from first-hand experience that it's not working. I would rather share space with pedestrians and leave the streets to the cars.\nSuch a simple idea; why hasn't anyone thought of this before?\n"

        "comment": "As a local resident of Toronto downtown and user of the bike lanes, removing them, specially from the main roads mentioned in the proposal, feels like a big step backwards. The goal should be towards a complete bike infrastructure that would further encourage the use of these lanes thus helping reduce car traffic. This situation is circular, the less bike infrastructure (reducing the transportation options), the more traffic you will cause because you are forcing people to use cars or other means of transportation. On top of that, you will put bike users in danger of being runover and causing more deaths. If, unfortunately, we want to become a car city, just go and see Los Angeles, the traffic is unbearable but the city does not have any other reliable mean of transportation.\n"

Remember how congested TO was before3 bike lanes?\nIncreasing access to good, affordable, consistent public transit would be a good step. So would continuing to support remote & hybrid work models.  And even, dare i say it, increasing the bike lane infrastructures and encouraging it's use. Reminder not all people can afford a car to get to work, and still have to get to work.  Let's not be too hasty to eliminate an affordable, environmentally friendly, high capacity transportation option.\n"

        "comment": "Please look at any case study worldwide on the benefits of installing bike infrastructure and you will see that this is a fundamentally wrong headed decision. Bike lanes, in addition to protecting cyclists, also reduce pedestrian deaths and injury. Widening roads or adding more roads in will not decrease commute times, it will just cause more deaths. I have personally enjoyed walking down Bloor and Yonge much more as a result of this protection for me and my son, and as a part time cyclist the Eglinton bike lane has been transformative. I guess the 30%+ of transit users and walkers can just suffer to benefit the insanely large 61% who choose or need to use a car. To suggest side streets as an option is a facile statement to throw into the ether with no nuanced explanation. If e.g. I was to do that with Eglinton or Bloor I would take such a tortuous and indirect route that I would just block up your precious main routes anyway as I would risk the danger. This does not and will not apply to families and inexperienced cyclists who are now permanently condemned to second class stature... You are worth less than pedestrians, who are worth less than cars. As somebody who lived in London, UK for 20 years these are exactly some of the bankrupt arguments that car drivers made. Though incomplete and bitty, the bike infrastructure in London has helped to increase the safety and cleanliness of the centre of town, and it has increased the throughput of people on its narrow streets... 1 cyclist takes up a lot less space than 1 driver in a pick up, so every cyclist we support means and easier passage to work, a cleaner city and less maintenance of our roads.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes. This measure adds unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, wasting taxpayer dollars that could be better spent.\nBy investing in safe and accessible bike lanes, we encourage more people to cycle, which reduces congestion and lowers road maintenance costs over time. This bill represents an overreach of provincial power and feels like a blatant power grab, undermining local decision-making and community needs.\nAs someone who regularly uses bike infrastructure, I can attest to its positive impact on my life and the lives of those around me. It makes cycling safer and more enjoyable, encouraging a healthier lifestyle. When I say \"safer\" I mean literally life-saving.  This bill will costs the lives of Ontario citizens.  It's better for drivers too because having cyclists separated in their own lanes significantly reduces stress.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and allow municipalities the autonomy to make decisions that best serve their residents. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support removal of existing bike lane infrastructure along Yonge, University, and Bloor.  Removing infrastructure to separate bikes from cars will not alleviate traffic since it will force bikes to instead use the right lane of traffic forcing cars to move at their pace, and putting bikes at risk unnecessarily.  We need stronger investment in transit and bike infrastructure, and this bill would set us back a decade.\n"

        "comment": "I recognize that this proposal is intended to improve travel and delivery speeds, and ease of use within Ontario, specifically on Bloor street, andvUniversity, and Yonge avenue.  I also understand that an increased capacity within a network will result in greater individual cost due to an increased demand on the system, what is called Braess's Paradox; and that while this concerns unduced demand, it also includes (See: Bittihn & Schadschneider 2020).  For these reasons, I won't mince words.  Unless you want greater stress while driving through Toronto, this proposal will not accomplish anything other than removing modes of transportation that could alleviate the congestion of vehicles on the street.\nI heard your suggestion earlier Mr. Ford that you would prefer them to be on sidestreers.  Unfortunately due to the aforementioned Paradox, this won't improve traffic or time.  Construction and accidents, when they happen, currently occupy the bike lanes.\nHaving more lanes will only result in them reducing the number of lanes and increasing traffic as people attempt to merge, to literally funnel traffic.\nLastly, I do not know what the increase in internet broadband as per bulletpoint three has anything to do with this proposal.\nUnless your desire is more traffic, your proposal, in lieu of these poor reasons, will do nothing but aggravate the system you're attempting to help.  Unless you don't believe in your words and just want problems for everyone, then it would be good to seriously reconsider this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I agree with a review of bike lanes and restricting them when they cause traffic congestion.\nA few points to also review:\n1) Costs - here in Hamilton they are not just putting in mostly unused bike lanes, but adding poles every few feet along them, in addition to cement curbs, plus ridiculous amounts of traffic signage, which are very visually distracting as a driver, and painted areas on roads to show where a bike may turn.  Also bump outs at corners and speed bumps going in everywhere, anything to deter drivers.  Also they put up small bike image lights next to regular traffic lights - so both turn red or green at the same time, but one has a bike image on it - how dumb and waste of our municipal tax dollars.\n2) Safety - many times I see trucks, buses and other large vehicles riding over center lane to avoid being close to and possibly hitting the bike barriers.\n3) Usage - I almost never see anyone using bike lanes, especially in winter, and although I agree cyclists need to be safe, the onus is on them as well as drivers.  I think cyclists need to be tested and possibly licensed to know rules of the road as most don\u2019t stop at stop signs, lights or signal.  Many don\u2019t even wear helmets.\n4) regulations - please publish studies to show the costs of these infrastructures to tax payers and compare to actual number of users, bike accidents, and how other cities do things.  Then regulate signage, road painting based on the drivers handbook, etc.  One round-about in Ancaster has about a dozen signs, most saying the same thing, which is visually distracting\u2026drivers know a cross walk when they see it, and don\u2019t need 4 signs telling you.\nDriving in Hamilton has become a nightmare, due to congestion, reduced lanes, traffic slowing measures, which only one person has to ask for and the councillor can do at their discretion, excessive, visually distracting signage and mostly unused bike lanes.  Some areas around the university and college and downtown warrant bike lanes, but keep it simple.   In London there are bike lanes with simply a painted line with image of bike in the lane and occasional signs stating \u201ccars and bikes share road\u201d.  That\u2019s all that\u2019s needed.\n"

        "comment": "This bike lane framework is a step backward in every way. I live in Hamilton, Ontario, where we have been fighting for years to painstakingly expand our protected bike lane network. I can tell you with absolute certainty, having lived here for nearly 8 years, that as separated and protected lanes have been built and the short sections of lane have been connected into a continuous network, I have watched the number of cyclists in this city skyrocket.\nMany of those bike lanes have been built on roads requiring removal or reduction of a lane. This bill would put them at risk of removal, taking us backwards dramatically.\nCycling is good for any city. As a mode of transport, it is affordable and accessible, it is environmentally friendly, it promotes physical fitness in our citizens. Perhaps most importantly for urban design, it is highly space efficient compared to cars.\nMoreover, cycling is safer for the public. Hamilton, along with much of southern Ontario, has very high levels of injury and death as a result of motor vehicle incidents. These incidents are far more likely on wide multi-lane streets - as a result, we have actually narrowed lane widths and reduced lane numbers on our downtown streets, even where a bike lane is not planned to be built. This framework would make our roads more dangerous by increasing traffic flow.\nOur transport infrastructure uses bicycles, walking, buses, and trains as efficient and sustainable ways of getting around. We need more investment in that infrastructure for the public good - not this slide backwards into cities that don\u2019t work well for their citizens, choked with smog and gridlock due to ever-larger numbers of cars.\nPlease do not pass this bill.\n"

        "comment": "There are currently too many vehicles on our streets (approx. 1.6 vehicles for every resident in Ontario). Bicycle riding uses minimal fossil fuels and is a pollution-free mode of transport. Bikes reduce the need to build, service and dispose of cars. Bicycle riding conserves roadway and residential space, thereby providing opportunities for less concrete and more plant life in urban areas. The government should be looking at solutions promoting alternative methods of transportation, not hindering positive solutions that minimize both carbon and physical footprints.\n"
