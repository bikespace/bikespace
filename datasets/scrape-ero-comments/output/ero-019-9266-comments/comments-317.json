        "comment": "I strongly disagree with any removal of bike lanes in Ontario. Bike lanes provide so much to a city and are forward thinking. They\u2019re integral to getting people out of their cars.\nI\u2019m particularly upset about the talk of the Bloor bike lanes being removed. They\u2019re extremely useful for so many people and they just make sense. It\u2019s an excellent, healthy, non-polluting means to get across the city.\nWe need to stop thinking of our roads as thoroughfares through the city, but as main streets in the various communities that make Toronto great! These main streets need to go back to being the hubs of the community, not highways through them.\n"

        "comment": "This is spiteful, Draconian legislation that will set back road safety and lead to more needless cyclists' deaths and destruction of families, in favour of private motorists with an axe to grind.\nThere are numerous studies from all over the world that bike lanes do not cause congestion. In fact, the opposite is true. Increasing the number of lanes for motorists only increases congestion, by inducing demand. The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more driving appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to use cars, thereby putting more vehicles on the roads. This is what increases congestion. For a short period of time after putting in a new lane for motorists, there may be slight improvement, but within 1-3 years, traffic will be worse than ever before. This has proven true on our 400 series highways as well, as new lanes are added, more motorists clog up the roadways.\nResearch shows that adding dedicated bike lanes to roadways slows down speeding motorists and increases safety for pedestrians. It reduces emissions, increases quality of life, and increases economic activity for local businesses. These are wins all the way around.\nThis government's introduction of Bill 212 is an unprecedented jurisdictional overreach that will put many Ontarian's lives needlessly at risk. There is no call for this. It is a cheap ploy for votes from specific communities of people ahead of a pending call for an early election. This cannot be allowed to stand. I have watched too many people die on their bicycles on our streets due to traffic violence and bad road design.\nI am a motorist AND an all-year cycling commuter with a 9-year old son who also rides his bike on our streets. Please don't kill us with this legislation.\n"

Similar to London, Tokyo or New York, it is not reasonable to expect to drive across the middle of a major city.  Focus on improving the highways and adding transit.  Bike lanes allow lower income folks to move around and have minimal impact on traffic.\nPlease please please rethink this policy and ESPECIALLY the move to waste money and remove bike lanes.\n"

Please do not remove them. It would set us back a whole lot of invested money! A bike lane along a major public transit artery makes a whole lot of sense, and according to research reports, the businesses along the route have not been negatively impacted!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212. While I understand the government's intention to alleviate traffic congestion, this legislation will instead increase traffic congestion by adding more cars to the road while having adverse effects on environmental sustainability, public safety, and municipal autonomy.\nThe proposed Highway 413 Act within Bill 212 exempts the Highway 413 project from the Environmental Assessment Act, replacing it with an accelerated environmental impact assessment process. This exemption raises significant environmental concerns. The construction of Highway 413 will destroy irreplaceable farmland and ecosystems, and encroach upon the Greenbelt, undermining efforts to preserve Ontario's critical wetlands and causing more flooding.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 requires municipalities to obtain provincial approval before installing new bike lanes that would remove existing traffic lanes. This provision will hinder the development of cycling infrastructure, which is essential for promoting active transportation, ensuring the safety of cyclists, and reducing the number of cars congesting the city.\nFinally, the legislation's requirement for provincial approval over municipal decisions regarding bike lanes represents a significant overreach into local governance.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes separated from cars save lives and make commuting by bike feasible. My children and I regularly use the Bloor St bike lanes to commute downtown and go to and from school and we love them. These bike lanes actually reduce car congestion because if we didn\u2019t have bike lanes to use, commuters like us would otherwise drive.\nToronto commuters are frustrated because of road construction projects, like the Eglinton Crosstown project, that have continued to snarl traffic for years past than their promised completion dates. This is understandable, but removing bike lanes isn\u2019t going to reduce traffic congestion, it will only add to it while wasting city and provincial resources. Plus tearing up major streets to remove bike lanes for years will just make traffic worse with yet another road construction project.\nAlso, biking is fun, great exercise and connects us to our community and the city as a whole.\n"

Perhaps your should address that to fix some gridlock issues.\nWhat side streets do you propose be built to replace the existing bike lanes on Bloor/Danforth, Yonge and University? Side streets like that don't exist in Toronto... I most areas on these streets there are no side street replacements available. Aren't you and most of you MPPs living in the GTA? How can you suggest to the public that you are not aware of this fact?\n"

Bike lanes save lives.\nAdding more lanes for cars solves congestion only temporarily, rarely, and at best.\nIf municipalities want to prioritize the vitality of their neighborhoods, the safety of their residents, and the efficiency of travel for the people that live there, they should not be interfered with; they should be encouraged by the province.\nThe ideas around bike lanes presented in this legislation are idiotic and will set us back greatly in our progress toward better cities, while offering absolutely no long-term benefit to traffic woes. There are decades of research from cities all around the world that make clear the fact that car dependency is not a sustainable model for cities economically.\nStay in your lane, Doug Ford.\nThe 413 is also a generally preposterous proposal. Getting to cottage country 30min faster is not worth the environmental concerns or the cash being \"invested\" in it. If that instead went to strengthening public transit in the GTA, we could clear the roads we already have while solving urban transit issues at the same time.\nSmarten up.\n"

Removing bike lanes will not relieve congestion or make our streets safer, as every reputable study of bike lanes and traffic unambiguously shows. Moreover, coming from the Province, this is severely undemocratic, and if pursued I hope it will be remembered at election time. Put simply, this proposal is a cynical and desperate attempt to play politics that, if realized, would cost real human lives.\n"

It is an overreach into municipal affairs, aside from the fact that bike lanes are essential for saving lives, relieving congestion, and benefiting the environment. This piece of legislation is not based on any studies or scientific rationale. It should be scrapped entirely.

Preventing new bike lanes, and even more outrageously, removing existing bike lanes will cost lives, increase air pollution, contribute to congestion, make people more miserable and poor and less healthy. Ontario needs to make active transportation and public transit more accessible, safe, available and affordable. Making car the king like it's 1950 again flies in the face of all of the evidence and is simply about buying votes.\n"

Why is the Province dealing with local matters?\nWhy does the Government of Ontario get to decide where bike lanes are put?\nBike lanes are good for the environment, peoples health, traffic, and are safer.\nThink about how many single people drive in cars every day. If they could safely ride a bike, they might!\nThis would help solve traffic issues, as well as improve the community.\nAll this would do is make people buy and drive their cars more, which will cause more fatal accidents, increase pollution, cost of living, noise and yes, gridlock/traffic.\nFor bike lanes, if you make them full width (The same size as a car lane), you can also have emergency vehicles use it, like how they do in Europe. This would help save on emergency response time as well.\nIf you search about bike lanes have a positive impact. Does this bill cite any papers or research about how removing bike lanes benefit traffic?\nAlso, why is highway 413 now exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act? Just because you want to build highways, does not mean we can just ignore the Environment. We are already seeing the impacts of Climate change (like the recent floodings of Toronto). Why would we want to ignore the assessment that building a giant highway across farmland and wetland might cause the environment to have issues.\nAnd this bill has a terrible name.\n"

This bike lane is an essential piece of infrastructure in my\nneighbourhood and I am strongly against its removal. Some parts of this bike lane\n(e.g. between Spadina and Avenue Rd and underneath the rail lines west of\nDufferin) were only finished this summer. The idea of ripping up these streets\nagain, when work has only just been completed, in order to take a giant step\nbackwards, is absolutely preposterous (and will significantly increase traffic!). The\ncurrent setup of Bloor, with one lane of traffic in each direction, protected bike\nlanes, and the majority of transport taking place below the street on the subway, is\na design that has actually reduced traffic, reduced fatalities, improved the safety of\npedestrians and cyclists, and increased foot traffic to the many independent small\nbusinesses along the street. The government's plan to remove bike lanes defies all\nfacts and logic. I hope that the government will take a hard look at the real facts\nsurrounding the impact of these bike lanes rather than making decisions based on\nthe Premier's ignorant rhetoric.\n"

        "comment": "I am heartbroken about the removal of bike lanes. I am a senior, and I cycle at least four times a week. I am grateful for the Yonge, Bloor, and University lanes. Because of bike lanes, I can get to the Waterfront, to the various shops I support, to the markets I purchase groceries from, to city hall to watch Council, to the opera house, to the TSO, to CanStage, to live music venues, to my music lesson, and restaurants on Bloor and Queen. I use my bike for all of these things.  I even cycle to my doctor's offer at Yonge and Davisville.  I cycle to Mt. Pleasant graveyard to visit my family.  I cycle.  And it is not an electric bike.  I ride my bike. And now my city is being forced by the provincial government, which I didn't vote for, to make it unsafe for me to cycle.  Removing bike lanes will get me killed. Since Ford's announcement, drivers have told me to f&*k off, get off the road, and get out of the lane.  I have been honked at by a driver who drove right up behind me to force me off my bike.  It was a one-way street with cars parked on both sides.  It was my lane to take, yet this UBER driver laid on the horn to get me out of his way instead of waiting a minute.  It was a short street.  The end was in sight.  This has been all since Ford's announcement, and I know he does not care.  I know this.  I know he will see the removal of a few bike lanes as a start.  Oh! And I drive and own a car.  I find driving where bike lanes are the best as I can see the cyclists.\nI have lived in Toronto for 44 years. I have contributed, paid my taxes, and voted for a council that supports bike lanes, yet the Premier wants to be the Mayor and Councillor and he gets to bully his way around.\nWant to eliminate gridlock? Reduce the number of Uber and Lyft drivers coming into the city who stop their cars and wait. Or prevent developers from taking a car lane to build yet another new condo that will take years to complete. Remove the parking lanes first.\nBut I know... no one cares about seniors (Ford has shown that), and no one cares about making a great livable city.\n"

        "comment": "On the surface \"common sense\" would say more lanes = less traffic, but like most complex issues the solution is not obvious. If this were a plumbing issue one could improve flow by increasing capacity but traffic is much more complex than plumbing. Remove the bike lanes and more drivers will choose that route and more cars will fill that void. Removing the bike will not create a magical empty lane. This reality is call induced demand, more lanes = more traffic. On the surface it defies \"common sense\" but it is real and measurable. The solution for too many cars is less cars. More lanes does not fix the problem but actually makes this worse. Viable alternatives to driving, like public transit, walking and biking is a real solution. Look at the strategies and evidence from around the world where traffic has been brought under control through alternatives to driving.\nBeyond these real proven solutions to traffic congestions, removing bike lanes will mean more dead cyclists for the perceived convenience of drivers. As a taxpayer I cannot live with that. As a driver I am glad to see bike lanes. It is safer for everybody.\n"
