        "comment": "I cycle, own a car and frequently use the subway and GO train. To remove bike lanes in favour of private vehicles is extremely short-sighted. Adding more lanes to accommodate more vehicles will only lead to more congestion in the long-run. Government officials should be consulting with planners who did this sort of a thing for a living.\n"

        "comment": "After many years of research on cycling for transportation, it is abundantly clear that separated bike lanes increase revenue for main street businesses, move travellers from motorized transportation to bikes, reduce collisions for all kinds of travellers, and save lives, not to mention health care costs in our already stressed system. The reduction in travel time for drivers is marginal, and it is clear that as long as the GTA population continues to increase in areas where there is little public transportation for commuting and other travel, then automobile travel will also continue to increase, stressing urban infrastructure. Abundant research has made it clear that building more roads results in more traffic, which creates more urban congestion and the solution is moving travellers out of cars as our cities grow. Investment in public transportation and active travel is the only way to reduce congestion and travel time. This initiative to remove and prevent bike lanes will cost us lives, health care dollars, will slow drivers as cyclists become single occupancy vehicle drivers instead, and will increase local pollution levels. There is no evidence based argument for implementing these measures.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a ludicrous overreach on the part of the province into municipal affairs and flies in the face of intelligent and data-driven policy.\nIt is unreasonable to grant 'strong mayor' powers on the basis that municipalities know beat, and then to decide on the narrowest issue that, actually, they don't.\nThe biggest issues facing Canadians are housing and climate. If there is to be more housing, it needs to be where people want to live (urban centres). If more people live in urban centres, they need to be able to get around. Cycling and public transit are the only answers that do not accelerate the climate crisis. They are the most efficient uses of public resources and roadway space. The province has fumbled their public transit commitments, so I fail to see an answer to this problem that does not include Cycling infrastructure.\nIt has been proven again and again that giving cars more space and lanes does nothing for travel time or congestion, so what are we even accomplishing here?\n"

        "comment": "This change will not only endanger cyclists, but also hurt small businesses that don't have many parking spots nearby. Bike lanes also improve walkability. As the safer option for cyclists especially those like myself who are adult cyclists that learned as adults (and thus aren't confident on a bike) is to ride on sidewalks. I have already experienced almost being hit while trying to practice biking in local areas without bike lanes and this is an unacceptable change. Biking is not only better for the environment it is also a physical activity that has personal health benefits and I think this proposed change will actively make it harder for those especially like myself who are not as confident or experienced on a bike to get around on a bike.\nI do sincerely hope this proposed change will be rescinded as I do not see it doing anything but harming my hometown of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI would like to make clear my opinion on the bike lane removal proposal. As a decades long downtown resident who pays property taxes, owns and drives a car and actually lives, works and plays in the downtown core, I feel the proposal is unjustified and based in popularity for winning favor of the masses of suburban and not quite urban car drivers. I can sit outside my house or ride 7.5 km to my place of work and watch the constant stream of single occupant car drivers in traffic. So many of these single occupant vehicles are massive pickup trucks or SUVs and their mere size alone create a large portion of so called grid lock. The amount of size and weight causes so much road wear, noise and air as well as sound pollution. I would encourage anyone to get some exercise,  walk or bike around the downtown core and tell me I'm wrong. So many of these single car occupants are also driving with a cell phone in one hand, which causes another level of gridlock..I can see only 4 cars get through a light when there should be 8 because one driver is distracted with their phone. Horns honk, people get angry, etc. Any rational person should agree that opening up another lane of traffic does nothing to ease gridlock. Rather,  it immediately gets filled with more traffic from other routes and encourages more single car occupants. I chose to live and work in the city, raise a family and support local communities. I rely on bike lanes to get around. My car sits parked a week at a time as biking and walking is a progressive means of living. These things are important to me and I intend to do whatever I can to support like minded and resist any and all backwards \"provincial\" thinking.\n"

        "comment": "Dear reader. I'm living in Toronto for more than 6 years, and I am now a Canadian citizen, so I'm voting.\nI strongly reject any idea of removing the University Avenue bike lane. I live close by and I have been crossing this avenue, every day, these six last years, to bring my kids to school (among many other families!). Six years ago, it was like crossing a highway. It was dangerous and stressful and it was so large that it often had to be done in two times! I cannot imagine that anyone honest and aware could wish to return to this situation. Then there was the Covid / bike lanes experiment, and things improved... Then the beautiful work done last year on one side on the avenue. It's more secure for cyclists and pedestrians, and it makes the avenue more enjoyable. And the best part is that there is not even TRAFFIC JAM HERE. There was some, last year, with the heavy work of canalization replacement/road resurfacing - but it's done! - and the Ontario metro line at Queen St. These days, there is absolutely no traffic issue here. I'm attaching pictures of this morning, around 9pm.\nThis whole project is very upsetting, and this last example shows it's obviously ill-advised.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently disagree with this proposed Bill for two reasons:\n\"The Ontario government is proposing an addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles.\"\nRemoving bike lanes within these major streets will only 1) make it more dangerous for cyclists who use the routes to commute to work and 2) push cyclists to other roads that may not have dedicated bike lanes, thereby only increasing their exposure to dangerous cycling conditions and subsequently increasing the number of cyclist collisions. This in return will only increase traffic\n\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\"\nEach municipality should have the authority to build bike lanes they see fit based on their assessment of municipal needs. Implementing a provincial layer of approval is an unnecessary bureaucratic step to hindering our efficiency as a province. I personally cannot condone my tax dollars being spent on the asinine removal or review of existing bike lanes and for the superfluous red tape steps on approving municipal bike lanes. If the Government of Ontario chooses to spend it's citizen's money so irresponsibly, then I am inclined to not file my taxes this year or any given year going forward.\n"

Bike lanes improve the odds for bike riders to get to work or to get home alive. With respect to all Ontario citizens, we should be encouraging people towards bike riding and public transit and providing incentives to leave their cars at home for non-emergency travel. Incentivizing this transition will be better for the environment, public safety, farmland and our lungs.\nThe best way to reduce gridlock is to have fewer cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Where is the data showing that bike lanes are playing a major role in grid lock? These decisions should be driven by data and impact, not by the opinions of provincial politicians. Toronto has invested in bike lanes that have made cycling safer for everyone and enabled the community to stay active. Spending money to remove them without any evidence that they are contributing to gridlock, and without considering their positive impacts does not make any sense. Our tax dollars should be spent on better things\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes downtown move tens of thousands of people daily. If even a small percentage of them switch to driving a car once the bike lanes are removed, the traffic would get significantly worst. Additionally, with the population of Toronto increasing by 60,000 every year, having safe alternative transport options will reduce the number of cars long term on the road. It is not sustainable for all new residents to be driving.\nAdditionally, Toronto Bike Share is on track for 6 million rides a day, which makes up a small percentage of bikers in the city. Many of these people, including myself, will switch to driving to get around if we don't have safe bike lanes.\nIt is well documented through research across Canada, the US, and Europe that bike lanes have a net positive on traffic in the long term.\n"

        "comment": "Let the campaign to eliminate all safety measures commence! Pedestrian and bicyclist safety appears to be a low priority. Removing bike lanes is conveniently located within 2-3 km of Queens Park. The sole beneficiary of this policy is the MPPs who seek to commute to work.\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has reported that numerous cities have implemented bike lanes and identified their various benefits. It is important to note that these public spaces should be shared equitably. The Government of Ontario (GoO) should prioritize strategies to expedite the ongoing construction projects in Toronto. Toronto\u2019s sewer system comprises 6,100 kilometers, of which 15% is over 100 years old (https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/building-construction/infrastr\u2026). If GoO continues to prioritize the construction of high-rise buildings at the core of the city, they should contribute financially to the replacement of the necessary infrastructure to support these approvals.\nIt is imperative that the GoO prioritizes fostering unity among the diverse user base within the downtown core. This entails preventing the creation of any divisions or barriers that may hinder the seamless integration of all users.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose removing the existing bike lanes in Toronto, including on Bloor and Yonge streets and University Ave. My daughter uses the Bloor bike lane daily to safely commute to classes at U of T. My family of four regularly uses the bike lanes, including the latest extension on Bloor St. W. to the Royal York area, and to ride safely downtown. For instance, this summer we used the exact stretch of the Bloor West bike lane that is proposed for removal to attend the Taste of the Kingsway festival and patronized the businesses there. When we need to go to Service Ontario at Islington and Bloor, we use the Bloor bike lane.\nThe contention from groups such as Balance on Bloor that \"nobody\" is using the bike lanes, particularly in the Royal York area, is categorically false and devalues the lives of those who use those lanes.\nMy family and others like us are not \"nobody\".\nI will be putting my $200 rebate cheque from the Ontario government toward legal efforts to fight Bill 212.\nI make this comment in memory of the teacher at my children's old primary school who was killed in Toronto while cycling.\n"
