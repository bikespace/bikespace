        "comment": "This comment is primarily concerning the potential implementation of requiring the provincial government's approval for new bike lanes, as well as plans to remove the bike lanes at Yonge, University, and Bloor.\nThere seems to be a rather haphazard decision-making that will make the urban design worse for everyone. Traffic is going to become worse if the bike lanes are removed, and if decisions to add more bike lanes are suppressed by more red tape by having the provincial government's approval for them. Having more space for more cars might seem a logical solution to solve traffic, but time and time HAS CLEARLY SHOWN that traffic does not get better in the long run. I am sure that you are not ignorant of the reasons as to why traffic is still a big problem.\nToronto has clear statistics to show and there is no need to find data from other cities or even countries to show that bike lanes are one solution to traffic congestion. If you want to solve traffic, you are going to have to provide solutions that provide alternative options to driving. I may have said earlier that you are not ignorant, but just to be sure, that the common denominator of the cause of traffic is the number of cars, and to reduce the number of cars, you are going to have to provide options that make driving cars less attractive. Having bike lanes will provide that option. Bike lanes have CLEARLY SHOWN to reduce, if not, add total traffic time. And if it does not add traffic time, why even bother? Even if biking is not used for transport, it is an option for some Ontarians to use for recreation and even for business.\nThis Bill is only a wedge and a pandering to the masses. There are other issues that the provincial government should prioritize rather than instigate a culture war to win over the other side because of one side's supposed arrogant encroaching of \"bad urban design.\" This is not based on logic and evidence. It is only to gain more support from your voters and similarly aligned allies.\nRegardless of our different political views, it is in your best interests not to implement the contested parts of this bill. Because you will also benefit from this, even if you would never use this. If it is only to gain support from voters and allies, for money and power, despite all the evidence that I am totally sure you are aware of, then you are making a grave mistake. Tax money has already been used to build the bike lanes, and the same said tax money will be used to remove them if implemented and passed. It is a waste of money and a waste of time for everyone involved.\nThe Bill contains other proposals that will act as a precedent (not that it hasn't already) to bad political decision-making that will negatively affect millions of Ontarians. For example, Schedule 3 for Highway 413 has exemptions from environmental regulations of the Environmental Assessment Act. Normalizing deviance with exemptions from regulations sets precedents that can snowball into big decisions that have big impacts that can be difficult to reverse. There are environmental regulations for a reason, whether it is for climate change emissions, wildlife, or even property value.\nBike lanes help with a greener environment by providing transportation options that do not emit greenhouse gases by having more travellers travel by bike.\n"

        "comment": "I work at a business on Bloor street that has been positively impacted by the bike lanes. This plan to remove them would make it impossible for me to bike to work and force me to be part of the gridlock problem and drive. I have so far been enjoying being active and saving money. The bike lanes have significantly boosted walk in enquires at our business and made it far easier for clients to get to us, something that was a problem for client retention in the past. Since the bike lanes have gone in we have had more walk in leads, more business and longer client tenures. The Bloor bike lanes are good for business, they're good for our employees on time performance and they are good for community safety. This bill is egregious over reach from the province- Torontonians were clear that they did not want Doug Ford as the mayor back in 2014, for him to now dictate to the city what infrastructure it can and cannot build AND undo a decade of progress is disgusting and a disgrace.\n"

        "comment": "As someone that uses the bike lanes, removing them would force me to use a car, thereby adding to the gridlock traffic in mention. The people haven't had time to get used to the bike lanes yet, as people get more accustomed less people will use cars and more public transit/bikes as a city should. If all the resources being used to tear up the already existing bike lanes were put into improving public transit we might see an actual decrease in traffic as more people feel safe to use bikes/busses/subway to travel.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential part of a city\u2019s transportation network. Many city dwellers rely on  them not just for their daily commutes, but for errands, courier services, and daily transport from point a to b. Removing a city\u2019s autonomy and placing more barriers to creating new infrastructure will simply endanger cyclists and prevent more people from becoming cyclists - which ultimately leads to more folks in cars and in traffic. This is a short sighted approach that will lead to fatal accidents and further gridlock by encouraging over reliance on cars. The point of living in a city is to have accessible, space saving transportation options. Public transit is one such option, and bikes play a vital, growing role in this as well. Save bike lines! Put it in more bike infrastructure and encourage people to lessen car traffic by getting them on bikes! That\u2019s how we save time. Not by going backwards and putting people in danger.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes in the downtown area will be disastrous. It has been proven that adding more lanes to a road will only relieve traffic in a short time frame, but in the long run it induces demands in driving, which will then produce more traffic. More traffic means more pollution and longer waiting time at traffic lights, so there is no reason to remove the nicely built bike lanes.\nOn the other hand, bike lanes, especially the protected ones, provide safe environments for young people, the elderly, and everyone else who could not drive to get from point A to point B. The increased mobility of people has led to increased revenue in shops along the Bloor bike lane, which brings income to the government.\nRemoving bike lanes not only solves no problem in terms of traffic, but also set our city back a decade by creating a dangerous environment for everyone outside the car. To reduce the car traffic in a city, the most effective way is to provide viable alternative transportations. For example, public transit, car-pooling, or biking.\n"

        "comment": "Scrap this bill. This is bad policy for several reasons:\nA) you are stomping on jurisdiction of municipalities\nB) you are sending a message that cyclists' lives are not important\nC) you are failing to encourage more Ontarians to cycle in a time where we need to be helping more people opt for active transportation and other  environmentally sustainable transportation options. You should be alarmed that cycling rates and look for ways to increase ridership.\nD) you are amplifying hostility between people who cycle and people who drive - tension is already high.\nE) cycling infrastructure is in it's infancy and already fragmented in most Ontario cities. Give it a chance to grow. fewer people will cycle with fewer safe options and those who do will assume greater risk\n---\nInstead of taking a bullish approach, I suggest providing funding to municipalities to expand bike networks.\nI also suggest banning the ownership of pick up trucks in Ontario for any person that is not licensed in the trades. They are unnecessary and detrimental to our safety and planet.\n---\nAs public servants, I expect you to pursue policy that protects lives above creating convenience for people in gridlock. Perhaps that is too much to ask.\nSigned,\nA living and breathing (for the time being) cyclist\n"

        "comment": "This is a complete overreach of power by the provincial government, removing agency from the city and the people who live in it. Why should people who don't even live in this city demand that we rip out existing infrastructure? This seems like a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and a complete disregard for human health. If the goal ultimately is that we should prioritise motor vehicles over human lives, I can understand the rationale, but that seems like a bad goal for the government. Fiscally and morally irresponsible.\n"

        "comment": "Shame on the transport minister!!\nAll around North America professional transport opinion is evolving to move away from driving to transit and biking. Meanwhile, the most populous province in Canada is trying to prevent progress on the future.\nWe\u2019re in the middle of the climate crisis. We are in the middle of a traffic crisis. We need to give people sustainable alternatives to driving. The fact that a dense city like Toronto has transit the envy of most cities in North America really should afford it to do whatever it pleases with its streets. Heck we should prevent single occupancy vehicles in most streets in the city. The privilege motor vehicles have is not fairly paid for. Instead we pay for it in lives lost due to traffic violence and pollution.\nThis bill is a shame. Get rid of it. Fund transit. Fund cycling.  Fund alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI have been commuting regular as a bike rider in downtown Toronto for the last 2yrs from Parkdale Area to the Financial District on Bay and King St in Toronto. I have never owned a vehicle in Toronto as biking is \"always faster than both TTC and driving during peak hours\" and I save tremendous time not having to look for parking spaces if I had a car. I also save money on the expenses of owning, operating and maintaining a car.\nI strongly oppose Bill 212 in the context of \"requiring the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\". For the following reasons:\n- I strongly believe that inadequate bike infrastructure is a contributing factor to fewer people cycling. This has been proven in other car centric cities like Dallas, Texas where I visited, and many suburbs of Sydney Australia where I used to live.\n- Toronto's growing bike infrastructure has proven to me that its possible to live a healthy and productive life without being car-dependent; compared to when I lived in Sydney, Australia.\n- Seeing Torontonians who earn lower incomes than I do, the ability for them as taxpayers to have a choice in their mode of transport such as public transit and cycling for a better life should not be overlooked.\n- Furthermore to the above point, we should allow and encourage those who can cycle to where they need to work, play and live, the safety to do so. This ultimately will free up the existing road network to those who absolutely need it. Such as tradespeople, emergency services, freight trucks and those who cannot cycle for medical reasons.\n- Making more efficient use of our existing road network is logically cheaper and faster than building new roads.\n- Building bicycle infrastructure is cheaper than upgrading a road for more cars.\n- It has been proven multiple times over globally that any additonal car lanes only temporarily eases traffic and car congestion returns due to 'Induced Demand'.\n- While cars don't cause as much air pollution as they used to, it is logical that fewer cars on the roads (as more people can cycle), will reduce air & noise pollution further.\n- Taxpayers money has already been spent to build the infrastructure and it would be logically unwise to spend more taxpayers money to remove the existing bike lanes for only a temporary improvement to car traffic. This would further reduce funding that could be better spent on public transit or other services.\nFinally, I strongly believe that cyclists should be able to to contribute in some form to the maintenance of Toronto's biking infrastructure directly; just like a motorist pays their car registration fees for the upkeep of the road network. This could be achieved by levying a small fee as part of the usage of Toronto Bike Share system or by means of bike registration as long as the system does not cost more to administer than it receives in revenue.\n"

I feel more comfortable using these lanes.\n- After spending money to build these bake lanes, we are now spending more money to remove them?\n This is inefficient and counterproductive.\n- How will catering the roads to more cars and less bikes help Canada accomplish the Paris agreement? This is going backward.\n- The more bike lanes, the more people will feel comfortable biking in the city which will reduce car traffic and congestion.\n- The increase of car traffic is due to more people getting their packages/food delivered and there are more people coming to the city and not because of bike lanes.\n- Having more bike lanes and more bikers in Toronto brings a more dynamic lifestyle and a sense of community.\nThank you.\n"

Instead we should be focusing on encouraging the construction of more bike lanes and public transit links. Take a look at Amsterdam and all of their magnificent bike infrastructure! Or even our fellow Montreal. Why is it that Toronto must never become as great as these cities and hold onto its outdated ideas of car dependent life? Maybe it\u2019s because Doug Ford can\u2019t stand watching all the bikers zoom past him on his way into downtown Toronto\u2026 Biking is better for the environment, physical health and congestion.

This proposal completely lack any compelling evidence that moving cyclists from bike lanes back into traffic will actually decrease road congestion.\nNot only that, it's beyond dangerous. I've lived in Toronto since 2021. I love walking, and I live in a great neighborhood around Young and Eglinton with shops and parks as well as quieter residential street. However, as a pedestrian, I have been almost hit by motorists more in this city than ever before in my life. Growing up in Thunder Bay and doing my BA in Montreal were noticeably safer experiences for me walking around my neighborhoods. I've attached an article about the number of cyclists dying in Toronto below. Even if this proposed plan improves road congestion, it will not make cyclists safer at all. Road congestion is not the only problem. I have been almost hit on uncongested residential street many times. Toronto drivers are simply unsafe, and often unfit to be behind the wheel. Improve public transit to insentivize less crowded roads. Do not force cyclists into closer contact with cars in a city where people drive the way they do here.\n"
