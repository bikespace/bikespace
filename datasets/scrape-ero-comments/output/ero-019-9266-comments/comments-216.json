I'm in favor of a congestion charge for the downtown core and increasing parking rates and costs for SUVs. We have a lot to learn from European cities such as Paris and London.\n"

In the interest of creating healthier, more livable communities, we need to encourage the expansion of safe bicycle lanes in all of our municipalities. Putting roadblocks in front of cities working to do so is contrary to this goal, and only caters to Premier Ford's car-loving supporters.\nIt's also an unacceptable overreach. How a city chooses to build out its road infrastructure should be a municipal decision.  Unless it involves a provincial highway, the province should have no say.\n"

Some of the route has bike lanes, but others do not (such a much of Dundas and Queen west). These stretches without bike lanes are where I truly fear for my safety as well as the safety of the kids. I\u2019ve nearly been struck several times by cars who weren\u2019t paying attention or just didn\u2019t care that I was there. I\u2019ve also witnessed the aftermath of several accidents where a cat has struck a cyclist, including one where the cyclist was killed. The provincial government has no business interfering with municipal infrastructure projects. This bill would be a disaster for public health and safety and I am strongly opposed\n"

Municipal governments are best equipped to assess and meet the needs of their residents and road users. Removing bike lanes puts local residents at risk to save car commuters a few minutes drive. If we want to reduce congestion we should invest in our transit system and affordable housing so people can live near their work. I am strongly opposed to this bill, and I think if passed it will endanger my life and the lives of my children\u2014we use bicycles to get to work and school regularly.\n"

        "comment": "I am shocked and angered at the Ford government's proposed Bill 212, the Orwellian-ly named \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" as it has been currently written and tabled.  Particularly, my concern is with the planned exemption of the proposed Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act.  Such an exemption reduces transparency, closes off consideration of other less expensive and damaging alternatives, leaving both the environment and democracy vulnerable to the whims of developers (where have we heard this before?) and other self-interested parties. The Ford government clearly did NOT learn anything from the Greenbelt fiasco of a few months ago, as this is another clumsy, sophomoric attempt to benefit a small cabal of developers, unconvincingly disguised as a magnanimous \"service\" to the people of Ontario.\n"

It works! Because I can\u2019t trust the ttc to get me there on time, nor can I trust unexpected traffic delays, bike lanes are essential to having safe and timely commutes for everyone. We\u2019ve already taken time out of millions of torontonian lives to construct these lanes, it makes no sense to remove them.\n"

        "comment": "These are some great ideas! In a city (Ottawa) that is blanketed in snow 6 months out of the year it makes zero sense to make cycling a priority to a handful of entitled cyclists. There is currently a network of bike lanes in the city that can get you anywhere you need to be, in fact it makes even more sense to restrict cycling on some roads like we do major highways. Ie if a road is a direct lead on or off a major highway, cycling should not be allowed. Catherine St would be an excellent example. If a road is within one block of a segregated cycling lane, cycling should not be allowed on that road either. Everyone wants to get to their destination safely so there\u2019s no reason to bike on Elgin for example when there is a segregated lane on both O\u2019Connor and along the Canal.  Bringing traffic to a standstill so a handful of people can enjoy their bikes should be limited to the existing cycle lanes or less than.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is disastrous in almost every possible way. Ontario's gridlock is caused largely by our over reliance on cars, and a lack of reliable transit options (Go Transit forcing everyone in the GTHA through Union station, the complete dearth of transit options outside the GTHA). It is very well documented that by building more road capacity we will simply be making this situation worse.\nStudy after study have also shown that bike lanes are an excellent way to reduce congestion by getting drivers off the road for shorter trips.\nFinally, removing environmental assessments to push through an unnecessary and destructive additional highway is simply ridiculous.\nI know that the Ford government does not care for what actual Ontarians want, and instead prefers to court the support of developers who wish to build suburban sprawl over the Greenbelt, but I would like to ensure that my objection is noted.\n"

Car traffic is car traffic, the only way to improve it is to provide alternatives so that more people chose not to drive. 1 person occupying a 4x2m+ sized area of the road with their car is enormously inefficient way to move high populations of people. Public transit, bikes, walking are so much more efficient. Our city is growing and we need transit, bike lanes, and walk-able neighborhoods years ago!\n"

But by far my quickest route to work is by bicycle. 30 minutes on bike: 45 in a car, and 50-90 via TTC. I only started riding to work when the TTC ride got longer and longer. I was afraid of cars. However when they added safe bike lanes my concerns went away and I don\u2019t fear for my life on the streets of Toronto. Thank you for adding bike lanes. Please add more. I use them 12 months of the year. I am a 57 year old woman. Thank you.\n"

Getting rid of bike lanes will not relieve car congestion.GETTING CARS OFF THE STREET WILL HAVE MULTIPLE POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR FORD\u2019S \u201cmy friends\u201d.\n1. Health and safety \u2014 fresher air and exercise for all ages. Ontarians are already too sedentary. Getting in a car to go 5 minutes to pick up Fast Food instead of walking to the local market sold at resonable prices and supporting the community instead of big International companies like McDonald\u2019s.\n2. Even a small decrease in polluted air caused by exhaust emissions reduces both acute and chronic respiratory illnesses BIKES DO NOT POLLUTE\nNone of this health information is NEW. Multiple studies/sources in health, urban planning and safety have shown the benefits of dedicated BIKE LANES.\nMany advanced countries around the world have shown these benefits for decades. You do not see obese people in Japan, the Netherlands or any of the Scandinvavian countries. Does FORD want Ontario to seen as a progressive place OR A PLACE NOT CARING ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ONTARIANS???\n"

Keep the bike lanes and build more! Studies from around the world prove they are beneficial to a city.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong support for bike lanes as part of Toronto\u2019s transportation infrastructure. Evidence consistently shows that bike lanes contribute to:\n- Reduced traffic congestion: By encouraging more residents to adopt cycling, we can alleviate gridlock and improve the overall flow of traffic.\n- Environmental benefits: Bike lanes help lower greenhouse gas emissions, supporting provincial goals for a sustainable and healthy environment.\n- Efficient mobility: Bike lanes help people move faster through urban spaces, especially during peak hours.\nBeyond convenience, bike lanes are essential for many residents who rely on affordable and accessible transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, and individuals who cannot afford vehicles due to high living costs, depend on public transportation and bike lanes to navigate the city. With the rising cost of living, car ownership has become unattainable for many, underscoring the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nTraffic congestion also tends to be self-reinforcing\u2014more cars lead to more traffic. By expanding bike lanes, we create an opportunity to break this cycle, encouraging people to choose alternative modes of transport that reduce congestion and improve travel for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is crucial not only for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities but also for addressing pressing environmental and urban transportation challenges. Neglecting these needs reflects a lack of vision and leadership in meeting Toronto\u2019s evolving needs. Bike lanes represent a practical, evidence-based solution that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, and we need governments at all levels working in concert to make them a reality.\nI urge the policymakers involved in this bill to prioritize decisions grounded in evidence and the broader public interest. This province needs policies driven by data and community needs\u2014not by emotion or political gamesmanship.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is not based in facts or statistics in anyway shape or form, it is instead based on what can be best described as \"Emotionally-based anecdotal evidence\". Studies have shown that bike lanes have little to no impact on the travel time. For example, The City of Toronto recently released a report on a section of bike lanes on Bloor Street between Runnymede Road and Resurrection Road. In that report, it compared traffic before installation to after installation. The findings from that report showed that at most, the impact would be a less than 5 minute increase in travel time. Such increase could also be explained by other factors such as population growth or the gradual return of in-person work. Cycling in cities such as Toronto has been growing exponentially in the last couple of years. For example, this year, Ridership of the city's bike share system managed to surpass the Annual ridership for 2022 by September. Removing bike lanes could cause traffic to become much worse as cyclists no longer feel safe riding on the roads.\n"
