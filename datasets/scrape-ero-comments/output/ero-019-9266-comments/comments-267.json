        "comment": "When Doug Ford got elected, I remember him proposing policies that would limit government overreach. He talked about red tape reduction and reducing regulation. Should I be surprised that he has apparently reneged on this promise and decided to override the voices of Toronto residents? My wife and I lived on or near Bloor Street for many years (my wife grew up at Jane and Bloor). For decades, cars drove too fast and dangerously, it was loud, and Bloor Street itself was often unpleasant to visit and shop along. I was living near Bloor Street when the first set of bike lanes were opened. Not being able to afford a car, they were a Godsend -- especially given the state of the underfunded TTC. But apparently, if this legislation is to be believed, I'm not the right type of working class person that Ford and the Conservatives care about. I see that Ford wants to make my commute more dangerous and more difficult simply because I cannot afford a car. I find it insulting that apparently my daughter's safety as a pedestrian and a road user is considered \"gridlock\" to Doug Ford. This legislation will, inevitability, lead to more deaths. And it seems that I will now have to pray that my family will not be one of this Bill's victims.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 currently under consideration in the Ontario Legislature. As a concerned resident and active member of our community, I believe that this bill poses significant threats to the progress we have made in promoting sustainable transportation, particularly concerning the protection of our bike lanes and the authority of our municipalities.\nBike lanes are vital infrastructure that not only encourages cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation but also enhances the safety of all road users. They play an essential role in reducing traffic congestion, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting healthier lifestyles. The loss or restriction of bike lanes would be a step backward in our commitment to fostering a vibrant, sustainable, and accessible urban environment.\nMoreover, Bill 212 threatens to undermine the decision-making powers of municipalities, which are best positioned to understand the unique needs and priorities of their communities. Local governments should retain the authority to determine the appropriateness of bike lanes and other transportation initiatives based on local contexts. By centralizing power at the provincial level, we risk ignoring the voices of the very residents who are most affected by these decisions.\nAdditionally, I urge you to implement a clear timeline for the Ministry of Transportation to respond to municipalities regarding their transportation plans and proposals. Local governments require timely and constructive feedback to effectively plan and execute projects that serve their communities. Establishing a deadline for responses will foster greater collaboration and ensure that municipalities can proceed with their initiatives without unnecessary delays.\nIn conclusion, I strongly urge you to reconsider Bill 212. We must protect our bike lanes, empower our municipalities, and ensure that local voices are heard in transportation planning. Together, we can build a more sustainable, safe, and inclusive Ontario for all residents.\nThank you for considering my perspective. I look forward to your response and hope to see positive actions taken in support of our communities.\n"

        "comment": "The provisions of Bill 212 expose a troubling misjudgment of Ontario\u2019s transportation and housing realities. Presented as a solution to traffic congestion, Bill 212 instead risks derailing critical local infrastructure projects through new layers of red tape, while undermining the authority of municipalities to address the unique needs of their communities.\nThe Greater Toronto Area\u2019s gridlock crisis is driven by three deeply rooted issues\u2014none of which have anything to do with bike lanes:\nChronic Underinvestment in Public Transit: After decades of neglect, Ontario\u2019s public transit networks are overburdened and inefficient, forcing millions of Ontarians into cars as their only reliable option. True congestion relief requires significant investment in public transit that meets 21st-century demands, empowering commuters with real alternatives to driving. Without tackling this transit deficit, any attempt to reduce gridlock is like treating symptoms without addressing the disease.\nOutdated and Inefficient Land Use: Decades of restrictive zoning, urban sprawl, and single-use developments have driven housing costs sky-high and pushed families to the urban periphery, increasing commute times and straining road networks. This land-use inefficiency is a fundamental driver of gridlock. Addressing it will take bold zoning reforms that enable more compact, mixed-use communities, reducing the need for personal vehicles in favor of accessible, community-based transportation. Properly planned bike lanes are a key part of this urban transformation, supporting denser, more vibrant neighborhoods.\nBottlenecks in the Road Network: Certain high-traffic intersections and interchanges in Ontario simply cannot accommodate the sheer volume of vehicles, creating bottlenecks that ripple outwards. Strategic improvements to these pressure points, along with intelligent traffic management technologies, would deliver real congestion relief. In contrast, the focus on bike lanes in Bill 212 completely sidesteps the root issue of these chokepoints, neglecting to improve the network's core efficiency.\nLocal governments already work diligently to build transportation systems that meet the needs of all residents, not just drivers. When designing bike lanes, municipalities rigorously assess traffic and safety impacts. Numerous studies show that bike lanes ease traffic, boost local economies, and increase road safety for everyone. These decisions are led by expert planners and transportation engineers who understand the needs of their communities down to the block. To substitute these local experts with top-down mandates from the Province dismisses this expertise and sidelines those most equipped to make informed decisions.\nIf the Province genuinely wants to alleviate traffic issues, the answer lies not in blanket legislation but in a cooperative approach that recognizes and respects local expertise. Partnering with municipal governments would foster pragmatic, customized solutions, providing a foundation for effective long-term congestion management. Encouraging flexible work policies to reduce peak traffic, bolstering regional mass transit networks, and implementing comprehensive zoning reforms to support urban infill would tackle the heart of Ontario\u2019s congestion problem.\nThe Province should recognize that its broad and heavy-handed measures risk making things worse, not better. I implore the Province to reconsider the regressive measures in Bill 212. The municipalities of Ontario are ready and willing to tackle these challenges collaboratively and constructively\u2014if only the Province will, as the saying goes, \"stay in their lane\" and allow our cities to do what they do best: shape solutions that work for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "1) Removing bike lanes will significantly slow traffic, as it will force bicycle users to convert to motor vehicle drivers;\n2) The main goal of all of the existing transportation improvements along the proposed corridors has been to increase traveller throughput. This has been achieved. Again, removal of lanes will reduce overall traveller throughput, as well as slowing the movement of motor vehicles.\n3) Emergency services routinely use the space in bicycle lanes for fast transits. Removal of flexible bike lanes will impede their flow, thereby delaying the delivery of police, fire, and paramedical services; This is well established in the literature, as well as by evidence complied by hospital ERs and EMS services.\n"

They make it dangerous to park and are an environmental disaster with nothing but idling cars, and underused by bikers.\nI drive regularly along Bloor as I have to drop my disabled daughter off at her school and there is hardly ever a biker, but traffic has never been worse. The bike lane change has materially increased my commute time.\nWe have a productivity crisis in this country - why are we making people\u2019s lives more difficult, taking people\u2019s time away from their families sitting in traffic and polluting the environment through cars sitting in traffic?\nI don\u2019t know a single person in my neighborhood (including avid cyclists) who don\u2019t think the bike lanes are awful for the city, environment and community.\n"

We also saw a fantastic and fun Neon Ride from a group of bikers. It further drove home the point that biking is safe, fun, healthy, prosperous and most importantly adds to the culture and sense of community in a city. Doug Ford's backward looking plans want to destroy years of hard work and decision making that have finally given cyclists a deserved place on the roads of Ontario.\nI emphatically DO NOT support anything to do with the provincial government overstepping their  reach to meddle in municipal affairs. I will remember this when I vote next in a provincial election and will not be voting Conservative.\n"

The focus should be on fixing driving infrastructure like highways, improving public transit to move all these Torontonians and people from surrounding area, opposing Trudeau's mass immigration policy and staying in your lane. If I have a job in downtown Toronto: I check how long it'll take me by TTC, Driving, Walking or Biking - more often than not it is still quicker in off-peak/non-rush hour times to drive. The TTC SHOULD be the choice most convenient, but it is not.\nGet your hands off MY city Doug Ford - why have a municipality at all if you can veto it's powers at any given moment?
