        "comment": "Toronto resident M5A 0N5\nI do not support the proposed bill.\nThe bill infringes on the rights of municipalities to make decisions regarding transportation on their streets and disproportionately favours personal automobile users over users of other methods of transportation. The proposed framework also does not include any scientific empirical evidence that it would actually reduce congestion in the areas it would come into effect, as opposed to other methods such as incentivizing public transport usage. Multiple-lane streets are also more dangerous for pedestrians crossing and I am concerned for the safety of our municipalities should this framework come into effect.\nI am also highly opposed to using provincial taxpayer money to remove bike lanes that already exist, and were already built using taxpayer money. This frivolous use of public resources feels like a targeted attack against users of non-automobile transportation. The streets in question in the city of Toronto (Yonge, Bloor, and University) are important commuter streets and also touristic streets that see a lot of pedestrian and cyclist traffic everyday, and removing bike lanes on this street would allow for more dangerous, high speed drivers to threaten cyclists and pedestrians on these streets. Many public healthcare workers and students use bicycles daily to commute to their work at the hospital and university, and putting bike lanes on other streets will make their workplaces less accessible and will not contribute to making their commutes safer or faster.\nFurthermore, I am concerned that this blatant favouring of automobile drivers will drive more people to use personal automobiles as a form of transportation rather than alternative methods of transport, which will obviously result in more cars and congestion on the road, which will actually contribute to more traffic. I am concerned that the lack of environmental assessment is not taking into account the additional impact that pollution and idling will have on the environment and our health as a result of more cars on our already busy downtown streets. Increasing car traffic will disproportionately negatively impact residents of Toronto who will be breathing in the smog and pollution in the cars, and may cause adverse health effects that further burden the economy such as asthma and cancer.\nFinally, I ask why the province does not question the allowance of vehicles to block whole lanes of traffic by tightening street side parking laws, which are much more detrimental to traffic than the relatively smaller bike lanes. Target traffic by targeting the actual problem, which are other cars causing traffic congestion and accidents.\nI worry that this provincial overreach will make Toronto a less safe and welcoming city for all. Thank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I am horrified at this suggestion to remove existing bike lanes and hamper the addition of new bike lanes in Toronto. I am a cyclist, pedestrian and driver, and the parent to a two-year-old child. I commute to work daily by bicycle, from the West End of Toronto to downtown. I regularly bike with my toddler in a child seat, to take her to medical appointments downtown and to daycare.\nThe addition of bike lanes on major routes which I already used as a cyclist (including Bloor, College and University) has made these much safer, for me and my child. Separated lanes reduce my risk of injury and death, from cars opening their doors on me or swerving into me in traffic.\nWhen I drive, I also vastly prefer to drive along streets with separated bike lanes installed. They reduce my risk as a driver of coming close to and potentially injuring cyclists, who use major streets whether separated bike lanes are available or not. I actually find my progress quicker on streets with separated lanes, as I can move at the speed of car traffic rather than going slowly behind a bike until there is sufficient space to safely pass them (giving the one metre of space required by the Highway Traffic Act, s. 148(6.1).)\nI can guarantee that removal of bike lanes will increase my use of a car over a bike, contributing to increased congesting rather than the opposite, particularly for trips I would have taken with my child in the relative safety of a protected bike lane.\nThis proposal is absolutely unjustifiable, given the obvious increased risks to life and limb it poses to vulnerable road users and the absence of evidence that it meets the stated policy goals of reducing traffic congestion. Spending provincial tax money to remove existing infrastructure, without any consultation, expert input or consideration of broader city planning is an unjustified use of funds and overreach into the municipal sphere. Moreover, in the context of our global climate crisis, promoting use of motor vehicles over transit and active transport contributes to the broader risks of our warming planet.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the proposal because it does not directly address the problem of gridlock on the roads in Toronto, which is more likely the result of an inefficient public transit system. Targeting bike lanes is a bandaid solution to the traffic problem and cyclists are being unfairly compromised. Can we consider cyclists\u2019s conscious efforts to resolve the vehicle traffic problem by cycling to work??\n"

        "comment": "A considerable amount of money was recently spent creating the existing bike lanes on University Avenue, Bloor St. etc. Getting rid of them is a complete waste of money and time and will create further gridlock while this work is being done. Instead, the traffic light system in Toronto needs to be upgraded to 'smart' lights that can be controlled in real time or programmed based on traffic patterns.  Such systems exist or are being implemented in other cities such as London, England and there is no reason we can't do it in Toronto where it should be easier since Toronto streets are on a grid system for the most part. This will improve traffic flow in the downtown core considerably.\n"

Bike lanes have been proven to reduce congestion as it gives options to avoid use of cars, especially for short trips.\nIf anything it makes more sense to remove all on-street parking on these routes, not active transport lanes.\nThe fact that the province wants to mess with municipal powers means that it is not devoting the time and resources to its own responsibilities like health care, education, provincial infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Provincial Government\u2019s proposal to require municipal approval for bike lanes that replace traffic lanes is a poor policy choice that opposes public interest. Ontario\u2019s cities, especially Toronto, struggle with severe gridlock, which stems from decades of underinvestment in modern, efficient, and safe transportation options. Cities simply can\u2019t sustain an endless increase in car lanes without compromising livability, safety, and travel times. Shifting toward cycling and other alternative forms of transportation is key to easing urban congestion.\nThe City of Toronto funds its own transportation infrastructure and manages its roads, and the provincial government does not contribute financially. Therefore, the province should not be imposing controls over bike lanes or demanding local approval.\nThis proposal does nothing to tackle gridlock genuinely; rather, it is a politically motivated effort based on faulty assumptions. It undermines public safety, sustainable development, and the quality of urban life. This regulation should be rejected to preserve the best interests of Toronto and its citizens.\n"

        "comment": "Adding more bike lanes is important to get more people moving to where they need to go without taking their cars.\nSkipping arterial roads compromises safety if the destination or origin is at those locations. How can you encourage more people to bike if they aren't safe?\nOne biker takes up less space than one car. The more city dwellers switch to bikes for local travel, the less cars there'll be jamming roads for long distance drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I support the removal of bike lanes on major roads.  The ones that most affect me the most personally are the ones on University Avenue.  These bike lanes are largely disused and do not have enough bike traffic to warrant them.  You can drive all the way up University at any time of the day or walk in the area and see that there are very few bikes.\nVehicle lanes are year round infrastructure.  In contrast, bike lanes are a poor use for this infrastructure because they are seasonal use only for the vast majority of cyclists who only ride their bikes in good and warm weather.  Most disappear if it is raining in summer and most are gone in the shoulder seasons when it is just cold enough to need a sweater.\nThe bike lanes are largely empty in winter when the City spends money ploughing them in priority to sidewalks.\nI think the province should also look at the combined reduction in road capacity on King St and the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond St.\nCars are only allowed to drive one block before turning on King St which has eliminated King St as a useable road for motorists.  The City has erected largely disused (and often dirty) street furniture in the curb lanes in many locations on King St.  This big street is now largely empty of cars.\nEither the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond should be moved to King St or one through lane of vehicle traffic in each direction should be restored to King St. The King streetcars would still be able to travel quickly as long as they have a dedicated separated right of way like on Spadina and Queen\u2019s Quay.\nI think the significant expansion of bike lanes in Toronto has been ideologically driven and has made the traffic one of the most congested cities in the country far worse.\nThe congestion adds to the frustration of motorists, discourages workers from retuning to the core, and it is also frustrating for pedestrians because motorists get caught in the intersections at the light and pedestrians have to walk around them.\nThe problem at intersections is compounded because the City has reduced the amber lights to just 3 seconds, below the provincial standard.  This makes it harder to get a few cars through a left turn at the intersections, adding to congestion.\nIn summary, I support the removal of bike lanes and urge the province to take a deeper look at the problems impeding traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This bill proposes the removal of existing bike lanes and the enactment of barriers to building new bike infrastructure. I am shocked the provincial government thinks this should be their responsibility rather than that of each municipal government, who are better positioned to manage transit on local roads. The province is best positioned for highways that bridge multiple municipalities. If the province really cared about mobility within the GTA, they would ensure transit projects are fully funded and completed in a timely manner. Or perhaps ensure critical provincial infrastructure is not effectively sold to the private sector (407 long-term lease). Adding more lanes and car capacity is not a solution to car gridlock. There are multiple examples of this in other urban areas such as Texas/Houston, which continues to have high gridlock despite massive highways and roads with high car capacity.\nThe best solution to gridlock is to incentivize individuals & families to take forms of transit that are denser, faster, and more reliable. The way you do that is by investing in biking infrastructure and in trains. Car infrastructure does not scale as effectively as bikes/trains and is not a long-term solution for the GTA.\nIf the problem with our current streets is gridlock (too many cars for the available road capacity), why does the province think the solution is to further incentivize car driving (via the building of additional car lanes)? This bill shows a complete lack of understanding of incentive structure in designing effective policy.\nI have also yet to mention the issue of climate change, and how a reduction in car dependency is required in order for us to meet our climate goals. Reduced car dependency would also have positive effects on people's physical health, as other transport methods are inherently healthier with the walking/biking required.\nI would like to see the province acknowledge the well researched best-principles of urban design as seen in countries in Europe and Asia. A basic start would be the YouTube channel Not Just Bikes. These resources are already in existence and to see them ignored is equivalent to the province sticking its head in the sand because we have a premier who likes driving. This is irresponsible governance and this bill is inexcusable.\n"

        "comment": "The decision to reduce bike lanes to reduce congestion is extremely shortsighted and does not adequately account for the necessary growing pains required to make Toronto into a truly modern city. The prioritization of car traffic above all other means of transportation is not only a hinderance to the cities growth - it\u2019s truly nonsensical. Taking away the citizens of this city\u2019s right to choose to make a healthy decision for their bodies and for our planet goes against logic. And for those who insist it\u2019s the only way for commerce to continue, I beg you to look at Denmarks policies in response to concerns about air pollution, climate change, and the need for desk-bound people to get enough exercise.\nBikes were their answer and they could be ours too, if we are willing to push past these growing pains and continue to be smart about the way we organize cars/ pedestrians in the downtown core of this city.\nYou already have the right terrain and a willing population. It is your job, as politicians, and municipal leaders to decide what is best for a population who may not be able to glean that for themselves. It is your job to look long term, and make decisions that will positively impact our cities future.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 seems to be incredibly under thought and one sided. I am curious what types of studies and research were done when developing this bill. I have been biking in the city for almost 20 years and am finally feeling relatively safe on the roads because of the bike lanes that are available. Previously there were ad-hoc and non connected bike lanes which meant I spend much of my time biking on roads without bike lanes beside cars. Introducing more bike lanes have created a far safer environment for myself and other bikers. This bill sounds like reverting back disconnected and disjointed bike lanes. This not only is a safety risk for bikers but is not intuitive or safe for drivers.\nI strongly urge the government to do real studies, connect with people who actually use the roads by bike and by car on a daily basis and understand what other solutions may be available.\nI am disheartened that my government has so little regard for my safety and the safety of our communities.\n"
