        "comment": "I drive to work in downtown Toronto everyday in a car, and this bill is possibly the most ill-thought through thing the province has tried to do lately.  Bike lanes allow me, a car driver, to get to work faster because I am separated from the bikes.  We are able to independently move at a speed that works for both modes of transportation. Pushing csrs and bikes back into the same lanes makes zero sense.  Use the provinces money on things that actually make lives better, like health care, and stay out of municipal decisions.\n"

        "comment": "This is a profoundly stupid idea\u2014there have been numerous studies indicating that bike lanes do not cause traffic and even if they did, if people can no longer ride bikes, they will take cars and therefore add more to the traffic and gridlock. Bike lanes provide an affordable and accessible means of transit for a lot of the city and removing them to cater to the residents of suburbia is egregious. The city has invested a lot into the bike lanes and the idea of my tax dollars being used to remove them, as if that\u2019s helping anyone, is disgusting. The province has much greater problems than cyclists\u2014it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of stupid decisions that Ford has been making to make Ontario and Toronto a worse place to live. Please do not pass this and rip up our existing bike lanes, you have already caused too much damage to the city.\n"

        "comment": "Does not surprise some Canadians that we are the fourth most car dependent country in the world and we are trying to get to the top. That is a backward proposal coming from a regressive old minded government putting those who cannot afford and maintain a motorized vehicle. It is a very discriminatory proposal where a so-called \"monoculture\" in terms of transportation is prioritized creating a destruction of our environment, depletes one's finances,  and causes a long term damage in our health. Our public transportation is not reliable and with an aging population we are leaving them without the opportunity to move around for their appointments. The electric car is not a solution and it will still cause massive horrendous traffic jams and people do not realized that they are the cause of such issue blaming others for their comfort. Shame to elect a corrupt politician.\n"

No longer for the people in any way shape or form.\nFor every bike lane removal you should match that with an alternative to be constructed. What alternative is being provided?\n"

So the whole premise is simply bonkers. See article below.\nIt is beyond ludicrous to think that a blanket, one-size fits all approach to traffic issues which are by definition local and in which every road and street is different and in which each demands unique solutions can possibly be addressed by this farcical policy.\nIn addition, consider that municipalities have far more experience and expertise in urban road planning than the Ontario government. They know their issues and problems intimately.\nIn sum, a triumph of ideology over science.\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n"

        "comment": "I can not understand how this should be in scope for the provincial government or how it is beneficial to the environment or gridlock specifically.\nThe bike lane structure we currently have in Toronto, while not sufficient, is an essential part of some Torontonians daily commute.  Removing these bike lanes will force bikes back into traffic, increasing potential fatalities and possibly increasing cars (for those who no longer feel safe commuting by bike).\nThis is aside from the fact that these bike lanes have already been installed at significant cost and I do not believe the research backs a material increase to commuter times along the major routes currently identified (Bloor, Avenue, Yonge).\nThis seems like a waste of money with little to no tangible benefits; outside of potential votes.\n"

There are no bike lanes on the 401 the DVP or any other highway in Toronto and traffic on those roads is worse than ever.\nCongestion tolls, improving public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, is the only practical solution to getting people out of their cars.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are proven to reduce congestion: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7358319. The provincial government is overstepping it's jurisdiction and meddling in affairs it doesn't understand.\nSure removing a lane decreases the car-capacity of a road, but it increases the safety of cyclists, encouraging bicycle use for short-distance commutes, and removing cars from the road. The net effect is likely a reduction in traffic congestion.\nThe Ontario government should not make decisions for municipalities to remove bile lanes, especially when it hasn't run any studies to understand the impacts on traffic.\nAlso: the addition of highways won't solve gridlock because more cars will use them and you'll just get more roads that are gridlocked.\n"

The reason we have gridlock is because WE HAVE TOO MANY CARS ON THE ROAD!\nGet more people on buses, bikes, and walking and the gridlock will diminish. My safety as a pedestrian and as a cyclist has become much worse in the last several years. My safety as a car driver feels about the same.\nOy! How did we end up with such a government?!\n"

Only lane for public transportation and bike lanes solves traffic.\nThis proposal is pure based on a car driver biases, no data to support it.\nPlease, focus on a better public transportation system where it is the priority so people don't have to use cars. There is no solution for transit that involves more space for personal cars.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an affront to the public. First it is expanding the power of the provincial government into what should be the authority of municipalities. Second it's increasing the red tape for sorely needed infrastructure all over the province. Thirdly, if it is used to remove existing bike lanes, or currently planned bike lanes, it is wasting tax payer dollars. This bill is directly breaking the basic tenants of what this conservative provincial government is built on and I hope it is voted down and never brought back. Thank you for your time.\n"
