If you look at the highest functioning cities in the world (Tokyo etc) they all give people multiple options to get places that don\u2019t include a car, mainly biking and public transit. Doug ford wants to take toronto into the past by making it more car dependent. Which will increase traffic. It is so planly obvious this is a horrendous plan. The entire province doesn\u2019t need to run like a suburb. Let cities be cities. Toronto could be a great one if our politicians let it be.\n"

        "comment": "Having moved to Toronto over 10 years ago I have been able to lower my carbon footprint in the city and on the plant in general by replacing my car with a bike and use of local transportation system. This removes a harmful environmental vehicle from the road and reduces congestion in the city as well. Bike lanes that have been implemented in Toronto have allowed me and my family to get around in a safe manner and lessen our impact on the environment and hopefully help in more climate crisis.\nRemoval of bike lanes only hurts local tax paying citizens and benefits no one in the long term. Short sighted gains for vehicles will result in more environmental damage and possibly more harm to people how pay for the roads and upkeep in the city they live. It would be better if Ontario government focused on transportation infrastructure and lessen the burden on people who already live and use bike lanes for the benefit of their communities.\n"

Properly installed, they provide the only defence cyclists have against motor vehicles.\nEnvironmentally, why would the province not want more people on bikes? It lessens emissions and provides a healthy alternative to sitting in a car or on public transit.\nI see the increase of commuters on bikes in the morning, evening, and throughout the day. People who are able, are embracing this healthy, cost effective, environmentally friendly mode of transportation! We need more bike lanes!!\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto close to the Bloor Bike lanes.\nI commute by car every day to Brampton, and regularly drive in the city.\nI think it's rediculous to even entertain the idea of removing the city's well deserved bike lanes.\nWe spent so much money and time doing the right thing to create these lanes. I regularly see bicycle commuters using the lanes (and moving much faster than myself). And I'm 100% ok with that.\nI live in Canada's largest city. I don't expect driving by car to be easy. But I do expect it to be safe. Since these lanes were installed, my fear of a collison with a cyclist has greatly diminished, knowing they are traveling in a protected lane.\nIf our Premiere wants to do something about traffic congestion in our city, he can review the extensive construction project delays (such as the ERT) and figure out how to get those moving. That would have a far greater impact on mobility then removing existing infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Strongly disagree.\nYou are intelligent people, decision makers, so it fits that you already know the causes of congestion.  You already know bike lanes are not the cause of congestion.  You\u2019re simply playing politics.\nBut I\u2019ll play along.\nSingle occupancy motor vehicles are the cause of all congestion.\nCountries and cities around the world have proven this time and time again.  By turning their 2-4-lane roadways into 1-2 lane boulevards with walking and bicycle paths. By turning their downtown cores into pedestrian-only hubs.  By investing in efficient and capable public transport routes and putting them on transit-only lanes.  By incentivizing car-pooling.\nIt\u2019s adding these elements that decrease congestion.  Not removing them.\nTaking these decisions out of the municipalities hands will cause further delays in action and will further politicize the decisions.\n"

Turning lanes turned into bike lanes, sometimes mean that you have to wait for that traffic lights to change three times till you are able to turn.\nWith all my respect for the bike riders the bike lanes are not justified. They are causing anxiety, congestion and enormous cost from the tax payers money.\nPlease stop the nonsense!!!\n"

        "comment": "I am woman in my late 20s and I have lived in Toronto for three years now. I would definitely consider moving if these bike lanes were taken out. Biking is by the far the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable way to get around the city. I used to live around Lansdowne and College and without the Bloor bike lane, it would have taken me twice as long to get to work (year round) or see friends in other parts of the city. There are only arterial roads in that part of the city so it\u2019s not possible to navigate on side roads. I even owned a car for most of the last three years but driving anywhere except in the middle of the night would reliably make me late because of all the unexpected delays. Even when I had to go North of the 401, it was less stressful to bike there than drive. The subway is also not as reliable as biking and it\u2019s so expensive! For hundreds of dollars a year on the subway, I could instead buy and maintain a nice bike and get everywhere faster. I\u2019ve now moved to Yonge and Davisville and there is literally no way for me to get to work without the Yonge bike lane, which I use year round. Because Mount Pleasant and Bayview are such high traffic streets, the cemetery means there are no side streets, and the subway is so slow north of Yonge, I would probably just use a lane of traffic on Yonge to bike in if the bike lanes were removed. Also, part of the space taken from car lanes on Yonge has now been allocated for patio seating. Will the province also remove all this outdoor seating space on Yonge?  I would really consider leaving the city if these bike lanes were removed. I don\u2019t have time or money to go to the gym after work, so if I was forced to spend over two hours commuting every day, my lifestyle would be way less active and it would cost be hundreds of dollars a month for the subway. And as my husband and I think of having kids in the city, we\u2019re discussing things like where we could raise kids where they could safely bike to see friends and bike to school, so they don\u2019t have to be dependent on us driving them everywhere.\n"

Look at the science/data.  Bike Lanes do not impact traffic in the manner you think.  Each bike that is in a bike lane is one less vehicle on the road.  Cycling and public transit infrastructure needs to be expanded, not reduced.  The rhetoric of car vs bike is unbelievable.  I recently travelled to bentonville Arkansas and the anger between drivers and cyclists is non existent.  It was so enjoyable to be in a city that works.  Doug, you were on TVO and experienced first hand what it is like to ride a bicycle in Toronto, it boggles my mind that you are now making the decision to remove and prevent a better cycling infrastructure.\n"
