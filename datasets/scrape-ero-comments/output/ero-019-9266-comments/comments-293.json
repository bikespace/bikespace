        "comment": "The paramount priority should be the safety of cyclists. My sons and daughters cycle to work and also with my toddler grandchild to daycare. Bike lanes improve their safety. The focus should be on the design of bike lanes for maximum safety. The reasons for gridlock in Toronto include construction (roads and buildings) and a public transportation system that is woefully inadequate. Removing bike lanes will not solve the problem but will put cyclists at risk. Existing bike lanes should be maintained and more bike lanes developed.\n"

        "comment": "A complete no brainer to anyone with a brain. Removing the bike lanes will result in more cars on the road, more congestion, and more fatalities. It\u2019s incredible this waste of money endeavour is even up for debate. If you\u2019ve ever ridden a bike in the city, you know how efficient and, just as importantly, fun an experience it is. This has only been more true with the addition of new bike lanes, which allows people to feel safe while taking part in an economical, environmentally friendly mode of transportation. More often than not biking is a faster way to get around that the city than any other mode of transportation. If you haven\u2019t cycled around the city, maybe actually give it a try before tearing up the one actual positive development this city has had in a decade.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous. If adding lanes solves traffic, the 401 would be the envy of the world.\nPretending this is data driven is asinine. Bikes will still use the curb lanes, and drivers (if they follow the law) will be forced to share. All it does is makes things more dangerous.\nIt\u2019s not as if College, Bay, Dundas, or Lakeshore are great fast routes even without bike lanes.\nThis is vote buying in the suburbs through populist spite of the city.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has done in-depth research, community consultations with politicians and business leaders and chose this path. Statistics back that the change does not impede traffic. For every cyclist on the road, that is one less car. And considering most cars have one person in them, it's incredible apparent as to what is causing traffic congestion: cars.\n"

Remove them and we (as many others) will be forced to buy one more car and add to the gridlock. Encourage bike lanes. Encourage public transit. That is how you reduce gridlock for those who then choose the car out of many other options.\n"

        "comment": "\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

This is a disastrous overreach by the provincial government and sets a very bad precedent. Let the people who actually live in the city of Toronto decide what to do with their streets.\n"

A foot of space on the curb is not doing anything for gridlock traffic. Maybe you should fix the disfunctional highway system before you spend all this money and time ripping out bike lanes. This government is a disgrace.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is horribly misinformed. It is a proven fact that adding lanes of traffic do not reduce gridlock, but diverting modal share away from personal vehicles does.\nToronto's bike lanes are very well travelled at all times of the year, and provide a significant number of residents with improved safety, accessibility, and more welcoming main streets.\nBusiness along Bloor Street improved with the installation of bike lanes. Collisions were reduced. If we want to reduce gridlock, then bike lanes and improved public transportation is the key, notably improving GO transit services on routes other than Lakeshore West to alleviate highway traffic on the 401, 427, Gardiner, and local downtown routes.\nLeaving municipal infrastructure to the municipalities allows those that are closest to the issue and the most informated to make the decisions, and I question the capabilities of the MTO to act in municipal interest. Are we trying to build destinations or are we trying to build roads through them?\nI strongly oppose this bill, and encourage the ministry of transportation to consult with transportation engineers and urban planners before making further misinformed decisions\n"
