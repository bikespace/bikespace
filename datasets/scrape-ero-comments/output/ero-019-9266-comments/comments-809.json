        "comment": "I strongly oppose removing bike lanes in Toronto and Ontario. Toronto needs more bike lanes, not fewer, if it wants to retain its status as a world-class city. The last time I was on Bloor, I saw countless people of all ages and backgrounds using the bike lanes. They were contributing to congestion reduction \u2014 imagine how much more traffic there would have been if they were in cars instead! Reducing motor vehicle lanes makes it easier to cross the street as a pedestrian as well, which helps support local businesses.\n"

        "comment": "Commenting as a resident of Toronto:\nThis is absolutely ridiculous and the removal of bike lanes isn't going to reduce gridlock. Cars must give all cyclists a minimum safe distance, so the removal of bike lanes will force cyclists to share the lane with cars causing more congestion. The cars will have the treat the cyclist with the minimum distance and let them into the lane.\nIf the province is so invested in reducing congestion in the city (not their job), then they should invest the money into facilitating infrastructure that allows people to use as many varied means of transport as possible to reduce the number of people in cars. This has been shown to be effective multiple time throughout Europe and other cities. The money spent on dismantling the bike lane on bloor could go towards the TTC to ensure fast, smooth, uninterrupted commutes. Or it could go towards literally any other service the provincial government has decided to cut back on (healthcare, education, etc).\nI am born and raised in Toronto. I live in vibrant downtown communities. Having a car has never been a need to navigate the city and having multiple options is great. The overreach of the provincial government in this matter of the city is disgusting and should not be happening. Cars make navigating the city an absolute pain. Buses are stuck because of someone trying to make a left turn at an intersection for several lights. Streetcars can't go forwards because someone is blocking the intersection. If you want to decrease congestion makes all streetcar routes their own dedicated lane so it's the fastest option and there are less cars on the road.\nI specifically continue to live in Toronto because it's a commuting, bike friendly city. If I wanted to live in a car based city I'd go to Etobicoke or some other suburb. It is genuinely disgusting this amount of overreach and the absolute waste of resources that will be spent if this bill goes through.\n"

These lanes are not just a convenience\u2014they are a critical safety measure for cyclists and drivers alike. Without them, cyclists are forced to share lanes with cars, leading to a higher risk of collisions and endangering everyone on the road. Removing these lanes also sends the wrong message about our city\u2019s commitment to sustainable, eco-friendly transportation. Toronto should be making streets safer and more accessible, not rolling back progress. This decision jeopardizes lives and undermines efforts to create a city that works for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I agree that bike lanes can be provided where feasible. I vehemently disagree with the implementation in Toronto.  Whoever determined and agreed to remove a traffic lane to implement bicycle lanes has ignored facts of existence.\nI believe Toronto was \u2013 and is - built around traffic - automobile, truck, delivery van, police, ambulance, firetruck, or any other public, private, or corporate mode.  Each is necessary for people, goods and services to be provided to Toronto citizens and businesses.\nAlong Bloor (South Kingsway through Royal York and Islington) removing a traffic lane has resulted in  gridlock morning, afternoon, and evening.  There is a TTC Subway underneath.\nMy observations:  insufficient bicycle traffic to offset the resulting traffic impediment.  This implementation has prevented  Wheel-Trans vehicles from providing service.  These lanes have also removed access to on-street parking, deliveries, and clients, affecting local businesses and services -- how many have evaporated because access has become more difficult?\nHow much fuel is being wasted and additional exhaust being created by these bicycle lanes?  Making a left turn has become difficult, and traffic on residential side streets is out of control as frustrated drivers attempt to get around the gridlock delays; impatience and frustration have increased dramatically since the bicycle lanes removed a lane of traffic.\nWe are serviced by neighbourhood police, ambulance, and fire stations \u2013 but flashing lights,  sirens, and klaxons cannot move traffic that has become immobile.  Or are we waiting for a tragedy to occur before we take corrective measures?  When the inevitable happens, will the people who approved and implemented these bike lanes take responsibility for property damage and life-threatening incidents?\nThank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns.\n"

The city is in Gridlock and only getting worse.  While the concept of bike lanes has SOME merit, the planning an execution to date of bike lanes has been flat out wrong.\nThe city needs to understand that we are not a bike commuting society.  We have kids that play sports.  We have cottages outside of the city.  We have large families that require groceries that don't fit in a knapsack.  We commute to work because housing isn't available or affordable where work resides.  These are hard facts.\nThe in its infinite stupidity has decided that moving 200 single bikes a day is more important than moving 10000 cars a day.  The concern becomes even greater when the winter comes and bikes lanes are nearly abandoned.\nThe gridlock in this city and loss of economic output as a result of time lost in traffic for employees, time lost in raw and finshed goods transported can't be calculated. However, it's massive.\nI believe that the next city and provincial elections will be won and lost based on the stances of the parties running.  I will no longer be supporting my local city counselor as a result of his views on bike lanes.  This includes financial support and my actual vote.\n"

Why doesn\u2019t anyone attribute gridlock to the fact that individuals are buying SUVs and trucks instead of sedans and compact cars, not to mention that personal vehicles are 12% longer than they were 20 years ago? It\u2019s shameful that cyclists and bike lanes are blamed, when these and other factors, like the province and feds chronically underfunding the TTC and cutting train service are to blame? Look at the whole picture, and the impace of cyclists and bikelanes fades away. Do the right thing and encourage/subsidize greener modes of transportation.\n"

And it then weaves to the right where many trucks cars double park requiring one to weave left.\nGoing north where there used to be 3 lanes there really is only one as the right lane has become a right turn lane. The small left turn is not reachable such that there remains only 1 viable lane which causes much weaving.  It is an accident waiting to happen.  For many of my younger years I road a bike.  Never had a problem as I respected the cars on the road. Today it's an open race for motor bikes and much more dangerous than ever.  Get rid of them before the death toll mounts.  The streets are no longer safe.\n"

        "comment": "The Province of Ontario should not move forward with this legislation for the following reasons:\n1) Businesses where bike lanes have been created have seen an increase in revenue. Less parking spots does not mean less patrons. In fact, it's the opposite. When you take away bike lanes you take away the opportunity for people to use different modes of transit to visit an area and experience neighbourhoods. Studies have shown that bike lanes increase profits of businesses significantly. A New York City study found that following the construction of a bike lane on 9th Avenue, local businesses saw an increase in retail sales of up to 49 per cent, compared to a three per cent increase in the rest of Manhattan. Similar impacts occurred when this was studied in other cities like Salt Lake City and San Francisco. There was a broader evaluation of bike lanes in NYC conducted by municipal officials that indicated that streets with protected bike lanes experienced retail sales spike by up to 24 per cent compared to streets without protected lanes.\n2) By removing bike lanes you increase rates of collisions, injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths. Bike lanes save lives. Having a separate lane on a major road allows for smoother flow of traffic and clearer sightlines for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. It becomes more organized, which makes it smoother, which makes it safer.\n3) Adding more car lanes has shown to only increase congestion. Traffic becomes more efficient when you provide people with options and alternatives. Cycling in this city has grown significantly since the adoption of more lanes and Bike Share. This allows for less cars, taxis, and Ubers on the road because people can opt for other modes of transportation. An increase in car lanes will only lead to more cars, which leads to more congestion. When you invest in safe sidewalks, safe bike lanes, and adequate transit, that's when you see a decrease in congestion.\n4) This will only cause more red tape and create more bureaucracy. Conducting a review of existing bike lanes is not an adequate use of tax payer dollars. And forcing municipalities to get provincial approval is inefficient and unnecessary. Municipalities should be the ones making decisions on these specific local needs. The Province should not be focused on these \"in the weeds\" policy decisions, they should be left to mayors and local councilors. The municipalities know best when it comes to their local needs. It is the ultimate irony that the government that created the Ministry of Red Tape Reduction is tabling this Bill, as it will only create more unnecessary red tape and slow down municipal and provincial decision making.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who often commutes by car, and occasionally cycling, I strongly oppose this bill.\nTearing up critical bike lanes will not only be of significant fiscal cost to the taxpayers but will make the streets significantly more dangerous for both drivers and cyclists.  Beyond that, the goal of trying to improve traffic with this is nonsensical. Removing the bike lanes does not remove the cyclists, they now have to cycle in the same lanes as cars.  There is no aspect to this that is beneficial to the city or it's commuters.\nBeyond that, the prospect of the province having power over the municipality's ability to construct life saving infrastructure is outrageous. It's a clear example of the provincial government over-stepping it's bounds to a direct detriment of the city's residents.\nLooking at bill 212 as a whole, there seems to be no data to back up the proposals outlined. It is wholly unclear how the province expects removing bike lanes to decrease congestion or what their sources are for making such a decision. The remaining aspects of it, waiving environmental assessments for highway 413, and reducing the rights of landowners in its path, are equally egregious.\nAny government member voting in favor of this bill seriously needs to reflect on their motivations. I will be ashamed to live in a province so corrupt as to allow such a level of idiocy in our government.\n"

        "comment": "I believe bike lanes make a lot of sense in the downtown area where there is a younger demographic who ride their bikes to get around the downtown area.\nHowever, the bike lanes installed along Bloor St in Etobicoke has resulted in chaos and safety hazards for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.  There is confusion with the markings and rules of the road.  There are visibility issues with the setup having the bike lanes closest to the side walk then parked cars then driving lanes, especially for residents who live on side streets off of Bloor.  There are many young families as well as senior citizens in the area who require their cars and would not be able to get around using a bicycle.\nI have experienced many unsafe situations as a pedestrian and as a driver in my neighborhood.  Some examples:\n- cyclists riding on the sidewalk\n- cyclists riding in the wrong direction in the bike lane\n- cyclist not stopping at crosswalk even though flashing light was on and cars have stopped for me\n- cyclists not stopping at stop signs\n- cyclists coming out into the driving lane to pass another cyclist\nCyclists should be licensed to ride on the roads and be required to follow the law just like a driver.  They should also be required to have insurance in case of accident.\nWe are now seeing more emergency vehicles going through residential areas to avoid Bloor St.  It would be safer for all involved to have the bike lanes on smaller subsidiary streets.  There is already a great bike path for cyclists to get across the city along the Lakeshore.  Since the installation of the bike lanes, cars are often idling bumper to bumper due to the reduced lanes causing increased air pollution while the bike lanes sit empty.  Although the city has stated that the number of riders has increased in the last year, the actual number of riders using the bike lanes is still very small and do not justify the large number of drivers that are affected.\nAs a side note, the concrete blocks and posts used to create the bike lanes has created an eyesore in our once beautiful neighborhood!\nPlease fix this disaster and remove the bike lanes before winter approaches to improve conditions for residents and so precious tax dollars are not wasted to maintain the bike lanes which are not used!!

Instead of encouraging \u201csharing the road\u201d you are polluting our cities and encouraging anger and reckless driving.

Healthy communities deserve modes of transportation that decenter the inaccessible and unnecessary car in favour of public transit that works and a culture that promotes safety for all.

The way things stand now with extra wide bike lanes that eliminate care lanes all demographics, bicyclists, motorists and pedestrians are losers. The congestion on arterial roads is both frustrating and dangerous and slows down the movement of emergency vehicles. The bike lanes are now being used by motorised electrical two-wheel vehicles of various sorts which are powerful and terrorise ordinary bicyclists--they should not be allowed on bicycle lanes! Pedestrians, especially senior citizens, also have a great deal of difficulty crossing the street because of the chaos caused by this mixing of traffic. Everything that is motorised should be banned from bike lanes to return sanity to them. Toronto is now one of the most congested and unpleasant cities to drive in in the world and this is all because of terrible planning, it is all because of our own doing. The late Jane Jacobs, the doyen of what makes good cities would be appalled by what has happened to the Toronto that she moved to because of its livability. In her last book she said that city planners have become completely irrational and I could not agree with her more.\n"

        "comment": "As a Resident of Toronto, as well as a cyclist, transit user, and a driver, I am strongly against the proposal to remove bike lanes from the city and insert the provincial government into city planning matters. This would be a step backwards for the work that has been done in improving the liveability of Toronto, instead further increasing traffic congestion.\nCongestion is at alarming levels throughout the city but this is not due to bike lanes, it is due to politically motivated decisions that have for decades stifled more effective forms of transportation. The answer to congestion is not removing other forms of transportation and giving priority to cars. If every Torontonian (and suburbanite) travelled by car, no amount of car lanes on our roads or highways would suffice to fulfill that demand. Instead, the provincial government should focus on what IS within its purview, building effective transit systems (and hopefully completing them within a reasonable timeframe) to reduce the number of people that see no alternative to the car.\nThis proposed law also goes against the (alleged) principles of a Conservative government, that pretends to be about streamlining government and \"cutting red tape\" while proposing to create a cumbersome bureaucratic approval process for what has been, and should remain, a municipal decision. Destroying existing bicycle lanes is another example of a politically motivated decision that is both wasteful and irrational. This decision would waste money, worsen congestion, and cost lives.\nAgain the provincial government has seen it fit to disrespect Toronto's democratic processes. Bicycle lanes, when incorporated into a network that transports people in a safe and effective manner using multiple modes of transportation, is the only way to reduce congestion in and around Toronto.\n"

Putting in one to five spots in areas of Bloor St and Yonge St does not solve the lack of infrastructure misaligned with the population growth/influx in Toronto.\nFurthermore, electric motorbikes, scooters etc are not regulated or held accountable for traffic violations along arterial roads.\nI have heard arguments regarding not being able to remove bike lanes because of the cost of putting them in. This is ridiculous and not a reason to keep bike lines creating all this congestion on arterial roads but also neighbourhood side streets which are being used as cut through solutions.\nLastly, money should be spent on public transportation accessibility, safety and efficiency. Part of this issue is that the TTC has become a makeshift homeless shelter for the unhoused. This is not OK for anyone. The city of Toronto is doing a terrible job managing very serious and significant issues for human dignity, security, safety and mobility.\n"
