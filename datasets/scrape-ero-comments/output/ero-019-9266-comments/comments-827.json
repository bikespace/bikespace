        "comment": "Bill 212 is overbroad, and reactive policy that risks serious harm to the environment, the rights of property owners facing expropriation, and the safety of cyclists.\nThe intent of the 'Building Highways Faster\u2019 and \u2018Highway 413 Act\u2019 is to accelerate construction of Highway 413. The Provincial government has not provided any explanation as to why it is in the public interest to exempt the project from provincial environmental assessment and restrict the rights of landowners facing expropriation simply to speed construction. The Provincial Government spent ample time and public funds to challenge the Federal Government\u2019s jurisdiction to complete an environmental impact assessment for Highway 413. The Province is now proposing to exempt the project from any provincial environmental assessments beyond the significantly diminished Impact Assessment process it agreed to with the Federal government in the wake of its constitutional claim. The Federal Government has recently put forward a new framework for Federal Impact Assessments as a result of the Province\u2019s challenge. From the perspective of Ontarians and all Canadians, Bill 212 is a transparent attempt to rush construction of Highway 413 before the Federal Government has opportunity to require a complete Impact Assessment under the new framework.\nThe Minister of Transportation and Premiere have made clear through public comments that the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are intended to facilitate the Province\u2019s plan to remove bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge streets, and University Ave in Toronto. However, the Proposed amendment would affect all Municipal Jurisdictions, and give the Province veto power over new bike lanes.\nDecisions about bike lanes should be made by Municipal planners who have an in-depth understanding of the needs and activities of their residents. The City of Toronto is a world leader when it comes to research regarding the interactions of cycling and vehicle traffic. These studies and others worldwide consistently demonstrate that bike lanes actually reduce congestion, as well as traffic accidents involving cyclists, and overall emissions. It is also a well known phenomenon that adding more space for vehicle traffic does not actually reduce congestion. In fact, it can increase the overall reliance on vehicular travel thereby worsening congestion.\nThe Ministry of Transportation has failed to explain how this abundant research has informed its decision-making in proposing this amendment. In appearances, the amendments read as an over-broad and forceful attempt by the Province to target a well documented pet peeve of the Premiere and his primary support base in his own riding.\n"

Putting more of it back in our city helps no-one.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor (at least in Toronto, can't comment on whatever is going on in Etobicoke), on Yonge, and on University are great. They're a good alternative to driving or walking, make our streets safer, and improve our streetscape to be a little less of a hellscape of exhaust and noise and dangerous vehicles right next to the sidewalk.\nIf people want to come into the city from a distance, take the subway. That's what it's for.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nI would like to express my dismay about Bill 212. This widely unpopular proposed legislation would be an extreme overreach into municipal jurisdiction. It goes against science, which overwhelmingly shows bike lines in fact reduce traffic, not cause it (1,2).\nIf Bill 212 is passed, there will be more traffic and congestion in the years to come because you get more of what you build for (1). In addition, more cyclists will die (3).\nIt is not too late to listen to the people of Ontario, who are calling on you to do the right thing and repeal this proposed bill.\nThank you.\nSources:\n(1) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\n(2) https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026\n(3) https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190529113036.htm\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the Removal of Bike Lanes \u2013 Safety Must Come First\nAs a resident of Etobicoke, I am strongly opposed to the removal of bike lanes as proposed in Bill 212 and its addendum. This decision jeopardizes the safety of cyclists, including children, and will have tragic consequences. I currently only feel comfortable biking to High Park or downtown with my kids when protected bike infrastructure is available. If bike lanes are removed, the next death of a cyclist\u2014or worse, a child cyclist\u2014will be blood on the hands of those supporting this measure. Safety must always be the number one priority.\nBefore the bike lanes, I used to bike the Bloor Street Bridge on my own, but I was terrified every single time. It was dangerous and stressful. When the bike lanes were added, it was transformative. Last year, for the first time, I was able to bike across the bridge with my entire family to attend the Santa Claus Parade at Christie Pits. This wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the bike lanes ensuring a safe route for me and my children.\nSpending $48 million to remove infrastructure that is still being installed is absurd and a blatant waste of public funds. This money would be far better spent expanding protected bike infrastructure or improving public transit, not dismantling something that has already been proven to save lives and increase accessibility.\nAdditionally, traffic congestion has been an issue in Etobicoke long before bike lanes were installed. Removing this infrastructure will not solve gridlock\u2014it will only put more vulnerable road users at risk. On sections of Bloor Street that have had bike infrastructure for many years, I\u2019ve seen countless bikes using the bike lanes, proving how well-used and essential they are for the community. The Etobicoke section has barely been installed for 1 year and ridership is already increasing.\nThe Bloor Street bike lanes have made biking safer and more accessible for everyone, from casual riders to families like mine. Prioritizing safety over convenience for drivers is not just the right thing to do\u2014it\u2019s a moral imperative. I urge you to reconsider this harmful and shortsighted proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I am pleased to provide comments on behalf of the City of Mississauga regarding the Government of Ontario\u2019s proposed Bill 212 \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\u201d and the proposed framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. The City has a long history of productive collaboration with the Province generally and the Ministry of Transportation specifically, and we look forward to continuing in that spirit of collaboration.\nThe City has several concerns with the proposed framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane, and feel that there are many unanswered questions that will need to be addressed if we can work as effectively and efficiently as possible within a new approval and review process.\nCycling infrastructure design is multifaceted. Ontario Traffic Manual Book 18 is an excellent resource and outlines both the decision-making process for selecting an appropriate cycling facility type for any particular road, and provides detailed design guidance to maximize the safety of vulnerable road users. The City contributed to the development of OTM Book 18, along with representatives from several other Ontario municipalities, and the Manual was published by the Ministry of Transportation. The collaborative effort of creating the manual should be echoed by a collaborative approach to the framework proposed in the legislation.\nMunicipalities develop plans for roadway projects through several steps. The City\u2019s Official Plan, Transportation Master Plan and Cycling Master Plan all provide progressive levels of direction regarding future infrastructure investments and cycling investments specifically. The amount of detail increases as plans progresses, however as early as the Transportation Master Plan phase, potential opportunities to expand the cycling network by repurposing existing uses on the roadway might be identified. Certainly, once a project moves forward to preliminary planning and design, alternative roadway designs begin to be reviewed. Municipal staff investigate several factors leading to a recommended road design. Factors that are typically considered prior to arriving at a recommendation include: traffic volumes; road safety; urban tree canopy impacts and opportunities; coordination opportunities with other scheduled works; cycling infrastructure design; and many others.\nUltimately, roadway design is more complex than simply weighing the impact to vehicular traffic throughput. Roads are places for the movement of people in a variety of modes, including in vehicles and on bicycles, but roads are also places where businesses and communities can thrive. It is the role of the municipality to balance the use of roads as both transportation corridors and the existence of roads as an integrated component of the communities they run through. Sidewalks, streetlighting, catchbasins, trees, front yards and patios are all components in how roads are designed and function.\nAt any point in this process, the potential for removing a lane of traffic to accommodate any of the other cross-section elements may be deemed feasible, including removal of a traffic lane in favour of a bicycle lane. However, there may be compelling reasons to modify a roadway cross-section for reasons other than installation of a bicycle lane. For example, changing an existing four lane roadway to a three lane roadway (thereby removing one lane of traffic) can have tangible road safety benefits, most notably a tendency towards slower operating speeds, or put another way, more appropriate operating speeds for a city street. Curtailing speeding on our roadways is a critical prerequisite to improving overall safety and reducing traffic injuries and fatalities on our roads. This is only one example where a specific benefit may be derived from a modification to the number of lanes on a roadway, but every project must weigh the various factors before arriving at a recommendation.\nThe City\u2019s Cycling Master Plan is currently being updated, and the intent of the project had been to identify a five-year implementation plan alongside a list of \u201cquick build\u201d projects to realize shorter term significant improvements to cycling network connectivity in Mississauga. This effort is taking place against several intersecting backdrops. The Province has set housing targets that the City is working to achieve, along with other policy directions such as elimination of parking requirements in Major Transit Station Areas. The Province continues the development of critical public transportation infrastructure like the Hazel McCallion Line. The City has also recently launched a shared e-bike and e-scooter program, in line with the Provincial e-scooter pilot program which was recently extended until 2029, with over 100,000 trips taken since June 21st of this year. These intersecting policy initiatives compel the City to consider all alternatives to quickly expand transportation choice and provide increased safety for our growing population. Specifically, safe cycling infrastructure and cycling as a transportation option is required to ensure mobility for residents of Mississauga, and all reasonable alternatives must be permitted to be explored in an efficient and timely manner.\nTherefore, the City would appreciate additional details and clarity from the Province as to the process and timing for initiating any review of projects that propose the installation of cycling infrastructure alongside the removal of a lane of traffic. Some details would include what data the Province would require for their review, the stage of project development for the submission to take place, thresholds for traffic impacts that the City might be provided in advance of submitting a review, and a \u201cone-window\u201d approach with the appropriate division at the Ministry. The City would further recommend that if such a review process is put in place, the Province provide a guaranteed turnaround time for reviews and decisions, so that the City can manage expectations with the public and stakeholders, and proactively plan project timelines to build in Provincial review when appropriate.\nI am available to discuss the City\u2019s recommendations further at your convenience.\n"

        "comment": "I approve of the removal of the bike lanes.  No referendum was taken in their implementation.  They have caused difficulties, financial hardship and massive, unnecessary inconvenience.  Emergency Services are delayed.  Seniors cannot get around as much or as easily.  Driver frustration is huge.  Businesses are suffering.  Parking is full everywhere.  Time spent travelling has been lengthened considerably.  The installation of the lanes without public approval demonstrates the catering of the Municipal government to an extraordinarily small minority of people.  It is curious as to whom gave orders to have them implemented in the first place.  The most recent so-called public meeting hosted by Amber Morely made it very clear that it doesn\u2019t matter what the majority of the people want\u2026we just have to suck it up and put up with it, and our opinions mean nothing.  This does not in any way demonstrate the responsibility of government.  The government is supposed to work FOR the people, not act as dictators.  The Municipal government has acted in its own best interest, and in the interests of the lobbyists it seems, not in the interests of the people in the regard of the bike lanes.  Removal of them would be wonderful.  I, and many, many, many others would LOVE to see on what metrics, and by whom, the lanes were implemented in the first place.\nAs for the rest of Bill 212, I have no legitimate opinion, as I have little information or knowledge on its impact.  I do not want the obvious frustration and disgust that the bike lanes have generated be the catalyst for not-so-good additions to the legislation being passed, however.  It may behoove the Provincial government to separate the permissions for removal of traffic lanes from the other items, to truly show good faith.\nSarah of Etobicoke.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed changes to the law will put cyclists in harm's way and will not accomplish the stated goal of reducing motor vehicle traffic congestion. If the goal were really to reduce congestion, it would be better to encourage the building of bike lanes, and more generally encourage people to cycle, since a bicycle takes up far less road space than a car. That would benefit even motorists, to the extent that motorists would choose to cycle instead. But the proposed framework would result in just the opposite: cyclists on Bloor St and wherever else bike lanes are removed will be forced to ride among motor vehicles, risking their lives, or else they will simply not cycle -- and perhaps drive instead, increasing pollution and traffic congestion. The capability of bike lanes to reduce congestion while increasing safety is documented -- see the attached file \"6597_Reducing_Congestion_7.pdf\". It is easy but totally wrongheaded to blame bike lanes for increased congestion while the real causes go unexamined. To really reduce congestion requires adapting transportation systems to growing and densifying cities, and that adaptation should include bike lanes.\nAnd even if it were the case that traffic congestion would be reduced by the proposed changes, is it worth the risk to cyclists' lives? I know people who have been injured or barely escaped injury or whose family members have been killed because of collisions with motor vehicles in places where cycling infrastructure was lacking. I also know people who have been late to work. People's lives and health matter. Being stuck in traffic is frustrating, but not to be avoided at all costs.\nI am also displeased that the government of Ontario wants to interfere with the ability of municipalities to push forward with their own goals of improving cycling safety and encouraging people to travel in ways that emit less greenhouse gas.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor St in Toronto have also led to increased customer traffic for businesses on that street -- whose proprietors, themselves almost all motorists, underestimate how much of their traffic comes from cyclists.

The government can help both groups get to their destination faster by providing infrastructure for each group. Insufficient arterial bike lanes mean cyclists will ride elsewhere. Residential streets are not options for commuting cyclists (as for motorists). An alternative for some cyclists is to drive cars, resulting in more cars on the road which slows traffic, and increases gridlock.\n2 Safety of Ontarians is of prime concern. Bill 212 will lead to more collisions and fatalities.\n3 Less arterial bike lanes will lead to some cyclists using their cars, and thus longer motorized vehicular commutes, which leads to worse air, shorter lives for Ontarians and atmospheric warming.\n4 Less cyclists and more people in their cars, and for longer, leads to less exercise and a less healthy society. Shorter lives, less productivity, higher health care costs.\n5 Cyclists are good for business. They shop on commutes, easy off and on, no car parking challenges - not only do they help employ many in the cycling industry (retail sales and repairs, manufacture, road design ..), they are more likely than motorists to stop and buy more on their commutes.\n6 Cycling is way more efficient for use of road space (e.g. numerous cyclists can fit into the typical SUV/car footprint) thus getting more folks to their destination faster.\n7 On a per capita basis, way more road space and public funds are allocated for motorised vehicle users than cyclists. That\u2019s the opposite of nurturing the greater public good, and getting all to their destination sooner.\n8 There are many better ways to use over $100 million taxpayer dollars - planning, building and then eliminating bike lanes.\n9 The well-being of Ontarians should rank higher than politics.\n10 Transportation decisions should be based on evidence. Many of the actions envisaged by Bill 212 are not supported by evidence. Further, Bill 212 proposes eliminating backbone Toronto arterial bike lanes on University Avenue, Bloor and Yonge Streets without any further data.\n11 To reduce gridlock, try reducing time to build the Eglinton Crosstown, funding more and better public transit and generally get folks out of cars and onto public transit, or cycling - which needs more cycling infrastructure, not less. E.g. see what is happening in the rest of the world\n12 Municipal affairs such as bike lanes are best handled by local i.e. read municipal government. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-doug-ford-needs-\u2026\n13 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-doug-fords-plan-\u2026\nPlease correct course by withdrawing Bill 212.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "The update to Bill 212 that would see the province weighing in on the creation of proposed bike lanes and the insistence on the removal of existing bike lanes in municipalities throughout Ontario is irresponsible and damaging to public safety, traffic management, environment and health outcomes, and street level business access.\nBike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University help move a large number of people of all ages through the core of the city in a safe and efficient manner. As someone who drives, cycles, walks, takes transit and uses taxis/ride hailing apps, the existence of bike lanes do not negatively impact my travel experience. In fact, they enhance it. Bike lanes contribute to a healthier city, lowering greenhouse gas emissions. When I cycle along Bloor, I am able to hop on and off my bike, visiting and spending money at multiple businesses along my route, allowing me to feel connected to the neighbourhoods I ride through. Multiple Business Improvement Associations and the small businesses that make up their membership like their bike lanes and see the positive financial difference they make to their bottom line. Business is already so precarious right now and removing the lanes and the ensuing construction that will entail, will affect them negatively and needlessly.\nBike lanes also safer for cyclists and pedestrians. With dedicated bike lanes, there are fewer collisions between cyclists and vehicles. There are also fewer collisions with pedestrians on sidewalks when there's a dedicated bike lane. Is it perfect? No, but it is much better with bike lanes than without. Removing bike lanes will ensure that needless deaths and life-altering injuries will occur in greater numbers. I don't know how a government can decide that increasing the number of citizens who will receive death or life-altering injury in exchange for increased drivers on the road is an acceptable price to pay.\nMultiple studies have shown that increasing lanes of traffic doesn't reduce traffic, it creates more traffic. More rush hour gridlock, more traffic accidents, more congestion on streets. The idea that removing these bike lanes will speed up travel times by a significant margin is an incorrect assumption. Traffic in the main road corridors of Bloor, Yonge and University have increased due to two factors: population increase in the city of Toronto and the rise of ride-share apps/private transportation companies. The population of the city has grown significantly since 2016 when the first Bloor bike lane was installed as a pilot project. In addition to the population increase, the bike lane installation coincided with the rise in ride sharing apps. There are now 92,000 licensed Uber drivers in Toronto, many who operate in the downtown core and who circle the main arteries of Bloor, Yonge and University waiting for a fare. According to this report from the City of Toronto, ride sharing along the University and Bloor corridor contributed to 14% of their daily traffic.\nWith hybrid work from home, there are also food delivery people who use the bike lanes extensively as their main route to deliver food to customers throughout the city. Without the existence of these bike lanes, those Uber Eats drivers will travel with vehicular traffic or ditch the e-bikes in favour of cars for safety. Traffic is congested on Bloor, University and Yonge DESPITE the presence of bike lanes, not because of them, and without them traffic will actually be worse. That 14% of daily traffic along those corridors will likely rise.\nThis bill is called the \"Saving You Time\" act but that will not be the case for all citizens. Instead, the wording of Bill 212 is clearly biased towards drivers over all other citizens of the province, favouring this one subset of the population (drivers of motor vehicles) over cyclists, pedestrians, and those taking public transport. If the province was serious about saving the time spent in transportation for all citizens, it would invest more heavily in public transportation which would reduce the reliance on ride sharing and reduce the traffic pressure from the main arteries where the province wants to remove bike lanes, creating a truly efficient transport system that works for all.\nFinally, in addition to the price to the environment and citizen safety, the financial cost of removing these existing bike lanes without truly studying the impact of doing so is financially reckless. Let the bike lanes stay.\n"
