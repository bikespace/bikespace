        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to and extremely distressed by Bill 212. This bill is contrary to the best interests of Ontarians \u2013 cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. The bill's proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\nAs a cyclist and driver living in Toronto, I rely on bike lanes to commute safely and efficiently. By choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and deaths, and/or push us to using cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions. I have been a cyclist in Toronto for over 10 years, before the existence of all of these bike lanes on Yonge/University/Bloor that the government is seeking to remove. I have seen firsthand how much these bike lanes have improved safety, quality of life, and accessibility to local businesses. I have seen more and more cyclists taking advantage of a greener and healthier way to commute/get where they need to go. I have been able to get around without fearing for my life on a daily basis. So much work and money has gone into the construction of these bike lanes. We need MORE bike lanes on major streets, more cycling infrastructure, not less.\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nI now have a commute in Leaside where there are very few bike lanes and though I bike some days, I find it to be extraordinarily unsafe. As a result, I choose to drive some days, even though it only saves me a few minutes compared to my bike commute. I would desperately like to advocate for a bike lane on this route. I and many other people I know would absolutely choose to bike instead of drive, if it was safer to do so \u2013 and doing so would take so many cars off the road and improve congestion. If Bill 212 were passed, there would be no way we would get a bike lane on this route because it would necessarily require the reduction of a lane of traffic. While reducing a lane might have a negative impact on traffic in the short term, cycling infrastructure is premised on the idea that \u201cif we build it, they will come\u201d. When cycling is more appealing than driving, people will choose to bike. When transit is more reliable, people will choose to take transit. A blanket ban on bike lanes where it requires removing a car lane is not evidence-based and takes away the ability for the city to properly study what would make sense for all road users when it comes to infrastructure/city planning. The province should not be interfering in this.\nStudies also show that more lanes for cars will not reduce congestion in the long run. Within weeks or months, we will be back to the same level of gridlock and congestion because more lanes are not the solution. We need alternatives so that people who need to drive don\u2019t deal with excessive congestion and the people who don\u2019t have to drive choose an alternative.\nToronto\u2019s own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city\u2019s own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic\u2014precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\nFurthermore, overriding municipal decision-making on an issue that directly affects residents of specific municipalities is extremely inefficient, destroys the benefits of our system of local government, and does a disservice to voters. Toronto bike lanes came about after hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent studying the impacts of bike lanes on urban traffic flow and safety, and they were built because these studies indicated that bike lanes improve traffic flow, public safety, and money spent at local businesses along bike lane routes. It would be extremely counterproductive to override the positive impact that bike lanes are having by spending *even more* taxpayer dollars to rip them out. A responsible Ontario government would encourage cycling as a healthy and green means of transportation. It would work to reduce gridlock and support local businesses, as many municipalities around the world have already done, by encouraging the use of public transit and pedestrian/cycle traffic in intensified density urban cores, the economic drivers of our province.\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\nWe need the government to invest money in better transit and cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city, rather than rip up existing infrastructure. Rather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban commuters and drivers.\nWith respect to the building of highway 413, it appears the government is trying to ram this through while ignoring years of environmental studies at taxpayer expense that both indicated that its route will irreparably damage vulnerable habitats for our native species as well as encourage more people to use cars for transportation. Again, rather than build more highways that will inevitably get filled with car traffic, the government needs to invest in improving public transit (including GO Train service) in the wider GTA.\nAs another example, I use my car to travel in or near the GTA almost every weekend. While it is an electric car that does not contribute emissions, it is a terrible use of time and unpleasant to sit in so much traffic. Every weekend I wish that trains or buses were a reliable alternative. I have family that live close to a GO Train station. I was very excited when they moved there because I thought I would be able to visit them without needing to drive. I then discovered that the train service only runs for commuters in the direction of traditional commuting (south in the morning, north in the evening). There are so many GO train corridors that could be well used on weekends if weekend service was made possible. Cyclists who would take the train to the Caledon area to ride without having to drive there. People who would visit their family members in Peel or York Region. Or people who live in those regions who want to come into Toronto for the day or the weekend. People drive because it is the only option, not because they necessarily want to drive. Traffic in every direction is supremely awful on the weekends and Highway 413 will do nothing to improve this and will endanger forests, farms and waterways.\nThese initiatives are counterproductive to every stated objective and fiscally irresponsible. Bill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes and public transit, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\nAs an Ontario voter and taxpayer, cyclist and driver, I urge you not to move forward with Bill 212. I urge you to stop pushing for Highway 413 and the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and instead focus on bolstering public transit (within Toronto and the GTA and beyond), cycling infrastructure, and the integrity of our greenbelt. The long-term quality of life of Ontarians depends on it.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, which mandates the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto streets, is a misguided approach to addressing traffic congestion. This policy not only misallocates taxpayer funds but also fails to enhance traffic efficiency.\nThe City of Toronto estimates that removing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue will cost at least $48 million, in addition to the $27 million originally spent on their installation. This substantial expenditure diverts resources from more effective congestion mitigation strategies.\nResearch indicates that bike lanes can alleviate traffic congestion. A 2024 CBC News article highlights global studies demonstrating that bike lanes can ease congestion, reduce emissions, and benefit businesses. Moreover, the concept of \u201cinduced demand\u201d suggests that increasing road capacity often leads to more traffic, not less. Conversely, reducing road capacity can decrease traffic volumes, as drivers adjust their behavior by seeking alternative routes or modes of transportation. \ufffc\nIn summary, removing bike lanes is unlikely to reduce traffic congestion and represents an inefficient use of public funds. A more effective strategy would involve investing in comprehensive transportation planning that promotes diverse and sustainable modes of travel.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Scarborough, and strongly support the existence of bike lanes. Wider streets do not make better traffic; less cars on the road do! Providing infrastructure for alternatives to cars means people are more likely to take eco-friendly, traffic-fighting methods. I speak from experience; this summer, I took my bike to work every day specifically because there was a bike lane. Without it, I would not have felt safe enough to choose this option. I urge Toronto to keep the bike lanes that we already have, and to add more!\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers as they negotiate public roads. The Bill also proposes the building of highway 413 through the Greenbelt to alleviate congestion, but the 407 is already an existing and underused highway that needs to be addressed first before spending billions to pave way for another highway that will likely be tolled with the proposal for broadband internet. We need another solution for density in our province.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing Bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, Halifax, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behavior. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why?\nThese environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more.\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

I\u2019m not a fan of the Province of Ontario getting involved in civic matters, and it feels like a distraction to satisfy one group of people in order to take the focus off all the ways the province under Doug Ford has tried to give money and opportunity to wealthy developers at the expense of the City of Toronto and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "I am a car driver, a bicyclist, a wife, mother of two children.  It upsets me that bicycle lanes have become a political wedge issue in this province when the focus should be on the right for people to be able to choose a mode of transportation and get to where they want to go safely.\nAs a health care worker taking care of acutely ill patients in one of the hospitals in downtown Toronto, biking to and from work using the Danforth, Bloor Street, and University Avenue bike lanes has been essential for me.\nBiking has not only been an effective way to help me and my family live within our means, it has also improved my physical and mental health, both of which were severely tested as I helped to treat patients during the Covid pandemic.\nIt has been a joy for me to see my children bike safely along Danforth Avenue and observe how the bike lanes have increased foot traffic at local businesses and livened up the neighbourhood in which we live.\nRemoving bike lanes for more car lanes is not a long-term solution to relieving traffic congestion.  More car lanes will only result in induced demand (ie more cars on the road) and endanger the lives of people like me who will be forced to share the road with faster, heavier moving vehicles.  As I am sure you are aware, 2024 has been one of the worst years in recent memory when it comes to bicyclist deaths.\nContinuing to build safe bicycle infrastructure in this city and expanding public transit are the only long-term solutions to the congestion issue we currently face.\nIt is for these reasons that I urge you to reconsider Bill 212.\n"

That\u2019s what municipal governments are for.\nInstead the provincial government should focus on completing Metrolinx projects including Line 5 and GO Expansion.\nThe provincial government should investigate undoing the disastrous decision of a previous PC government and repurchase the 407.\n"
