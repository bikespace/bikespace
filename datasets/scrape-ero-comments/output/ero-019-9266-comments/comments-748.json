        "comment": "As someone who has been hit by an SUV Truck while cycling in Toronto I want to strongly support the need for the expansion and not removal of bike lanes in Toronto. I was seriously injured and not able to work for three months. To go backwards with the bike lanes would put Toronto and Ontario back 20 years and be seen as the laughing stock of large urban centres globally. Cycling supports physical and mental health and helps the fight against climate change. DO NOT REMOVE BIKE LANES AND SAVE LIVES!\n"

        "comment": "I bike to work everyday and only do so because of the bike lanes that are in place. Biking takes something that takes 30mins+ and reduces it to 15-20mins. It helps me get around the city with ease and I don\u2019t have to feel unsafe biking around. I bike around 10 months of the year (I biked to work this morning on Nov 20!) so to say these bike lanes are not utilized is frustrating and annoying! I see bikers all the time, the majority of my friends bike, and bike lanes in downtown Toronto should not be dictated by the people who do not live or experience this city outside of driving to work!\n"

This group affected has lots of money, power and sway, but is a very small subsection of our city as a whole.\n"

Bikers who are activellly reducing vehicle traffic by choosing another mode of transportation would be put at unnecessary risk so Mr. Ford can award construction contracts to his friends.\nInvest this money elsewhere and encourage public transit use, give funding where needed to bus and train lines. Adding traffic lanes has done nothing to address this problem in the past.\nMr. Ford instead of working to award your construction buddies more contracts that waste taxppayer dollars, perhaps actually listen to the people you're meant to represent\n"

        "comment": "Highway 413 won\u2019t ease congestion\u2014it will only make it worse. Experts from around the world have proven that building more highways leads to \"induced demand,\" meaning more traffic and more pollution. This project seems focused on serving those who can afford cars, but what about everyone else? To truly reduce gridlock, we need forward-thinking solutions like better public transit and safer bike lanes. Every bike on the road means fewer cars, which translates to less pollution, less noise, and safer streets for all.\nThe removal of bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a major setback. These lanes do more than serve cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Local businesses also benefit from the increased foot and bike traffic. Why take away something that makes our streets safer and supports our economy?\nI urge you to reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that benefits everyone, not policies that cater only to the privileged few and leave the rest of us behind. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-focused transportation that brings us all together.\nSincerely,\n"

Making those bike lanes traffic lanes will just mean more cars will file in them, over pickups etc they will not in any way increase traffic time, parking going to side streets and taxi pickups is much better and safer for pedestrians\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m both a cyclist and a driver, and it\u2019s extremely clear that bike lanes improve safety for both cyclists and drivers. They improve traffic flow by reducing the chaos of cyclists in driving lanes, and improve congestion by encouraging alternative modes of transportation. Removing the lanes will worsen traffic in the short term from the construction on these roads, and in the long term by placing cyclists in driving lanes. City costs will increase in the door term because of unnecessary construction and in the long term from instead health care needs of cyclists struck by drivers on newly unsafe roads. The morbidity and mortality of these collisions is also entirely preventable. This unnecessary, expensive, regressive change will cost Torontonian lives, and all that needs to be done is the conservative thing \u2014 nothing.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford is wasting our taxpayer money. He is endangering the lives of cyclists. If you look at the actual evidence, bike lanes increase cyclists on the road thereby reducing cars on the road, and reducing gridlock. I've ridden a bike to work in Toronto for decades, with and without bike lanes and I will continue to do so. It is just safer with bike lanes. I bike for my physical health, because it's better on my mental health than driving and because it's better for the environment at a time of climate crisis. If there were more bike lanes across the entire city, there would be even more cyclists and fewer cars. That's what we actually need.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the removal of bike lanes! Living in downtown Toronto, congestion exists because there are too many single occupant vehicles in the city. These cars block the intersections, double park for deliveries, park illegally etc, causing congestion.\nEveryday I walk to work and the intersection of Bay St and Lakeshore and Harbour are blocked because drivers dont follow the rules, not because a bike lane exists. They go into the intersection thinking they are invincible, then the light turns red and the other direction of traffic cant move.\nI am a professional in the planning and transportation field and can tell you that the removal of bike lanes is not the solution to reduce congestion. More enforcement of rules will help! Red light cameras, not having cars double park in lanes of traffic for pick-up, drop-off and uber eats will help.\nThink about what complete streets look like - use good planning and city building rather than give into one voice of the car driver. Why invest so much money in GO expansion if we are still favouring the car as the most important mode of transit.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.\nMoreover, many of Toronto's worst traffic problem spots, such as Lakeshore and Jarvis, are in no way related to the presence of bike lanes.\nBike lanes create induced demand, which means that over time, more people will choose to bike over take their car. They are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are scientifically proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions. There is no supporting scientific evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n"

        "comment": "this is what i wrote, feel free to copy and modify:\nTraffic in Toronto is an urban planning issue that has nothing to do with the bike lanes. Removing bike lanes does not remove the cyclists. Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\n"

I use these about 75% of my commute and will be forced to now drive which is costly and will add to any traffic .\nAlso the waste you are proposing is horrific and definitely not a conservative plan. Since when did conservativism mean tear things up. What happened to reducing costs ?\nAlso why can this government tear down things so quickly (at taxpayers costs) but does not seem to build much in a timely matter. Ie the LRT lines around the GTA and Ottawa\nDisappointed that the PCs are meddling in local transportation plans\n"
