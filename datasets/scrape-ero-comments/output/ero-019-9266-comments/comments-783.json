        "comment": "Safe bike lanes are important to ensure more Torontonians use the biking infrastructure and move away from using their vehicles. That is how you address traffic, you find ways to move individuals away from using individual vehicles, towards cycling, walking, better transit options, not by making it more unsafe for cyclists by removing bike lanes.\nWhere is your proof that this is necessary and that it will lead to improvements for driving conditions? Have you assessed the additional danger removing these lanes have on cyclist safety? Families use these lanes daily and them (as do I) use these and hope to get from point A to B to C safely. Also, should the government's policies not be for the benefit of all its citizens, i.e. including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, not solely for drivers.\nWhy should there be the need to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of a bicycle lane? This should be the decision of the city due to the needs of the city, not of the province.\nI am firmly opposed to this proposal and sincerely request you rethink. This is a safety issue for many Torontonians who just want to get around the city safely.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a senior citizen who moved into Etobicoke near Bloor St. W. in the past 21/2 years.  My husband and I chose this location for the accessibility to subway and easy shopping along Bloor St. W.  We love this community, but have found that accessibility to Bloor St. has declined significantly with the imposition of the bike lanes.  Parking spots have been reduced, so it makes it more difficult to go shopping and attend any medical appointments.  As well, just opening the car doors becomes hazardous due to the narrow parking lanes.  It is almost impossible for my husband to stop and let me be dropped off anywhere along the street.  This means that I have to walk a long way to my destination.  As I am aging and my arthritis is worsening, I fear that I have to look to other businesses to support.  Please don't tell me to get on a bicycle at my age to go grocery shopping!\nAs well, I see very few bikes using these lanes that are causing traffic nightmares along Bloor St.\nA lot of drivers are using alternate routes and speeding through residential areas to avoid the heavy traffic.\nPlease be reasonable and consider the accessibility issues of the senior citizens who live in this part of town.\n"

        "comment": "As a City Planner (not with Toronto) and an expert in Urban Transportation, I strongly disagree with this Bill for the following reasons:\n- Bike lanes have had a negligible effect on vehicle travel times, if any effect at all\n- EMS response times have been quicker since bike lanes were added, as per Toronto's Fire Chief\n- Bloor bike lanes did not remove any lanes of traffic through most of it's length\n- There are no major studies that conclude removing bike lanes alleviates traffic congestion\n- Removing bike lanes will kill people, and again, not change travel times by more than 1 or 2 mins\n- Successful cities have excellent cycling and active transportation infrastructure\n- Removing/adding bike lanes in a single municipality is not and should not be Provincial jurisdiction\n- The cost or removal is too high to defend and will create years of actual traffic congestion\n"

        "comment": "Summary:\nAs a responsible tax-payer, I cannot approve paying for ripping out sustainable transportation infrastructure. As an environmentally responsible human, I cannot allow for projects to proceed without environmental impact assessment and due diligence.\nA big-picture aim of infrastructure planning should be to promote a healthier, happier, and productive society. Although it might appear that a faster vehicle dependent society is faster and more productive, in the longer run, this approach is unsustainable. Some of the factors often ignored are-\n-\tunproductive time for driving a car,\n-\tmental and physical fatigue of driving a car,\n-\tgreenhouse gas emissions,\n-\tlocal pollution due to emissions from vehicles,\n-\tlocal pollution due to resuspension of road dust, which includes dust from vehicular tires and brake pads,\n-\tcorresponding need and investment of large parking spaces,\n-\tcorresponding additional urban heat island load because of big roads, parking areas and the vehicles themselves,\n-\tcorresponding increase in stormwater runoff load both in quantity and pollutant loading on surface waters,\n-\tcorresponding loss in biodiversity- both in urban areas, soils and in receiving waters,\n-\tincreased noise pollution,\n-\tmarginalization of economically weaker sections of society who cannot or do not want to rely on personal vehicles,\n-\texpensive infrastructure management- vehicular traffic infrastructure is more expensive to build and maintain then biking and pedestrian transport infrastructure if you look at the overall picture (eg. include costs of installing and maintain underground utilities, include costs of increase healthcare due to poor mental and physical health).\nAbove factors are just few. A real 2-day workshop by concerned and knowledgeable citizens with wide experiences MUST be conducted to come up with better ideas with a longer term vision. Current proposed bill transfers too much power from Cities to the Province.\nExpanding roads is just a band-aid type quick fix solution to alleviate traffic and reduce commute time. Main goal must be to promote a commute friendly city, and many established cities have demonstrated that it is possible \u2013 like Montreal, Amsterdam, and more recently Vancouver, Boston and Paris. Toronto was well on it\u2019s way to do it but looks like we are back-paddling now unfortunately. For newer areas, 15-minute City model should be entertained.\nTo emulate these cities' successes, Ontario could consider the following strategies:\n1.\tIntegrated transit solutions: Develop a network that connects cycling, walking, and public transit, making it convenient to switch between modes. This requires investing in high-quality public transit and ensuring accessibility for all. Focus on enhancing connectivity and speed for public transport rather than individual vehicles.\n2.\tUrban redesign: Follow 'complete streets' models where roads accommodate all users\u2014cyclists, pedestrians, public transit, and cars\u2014ensuring safety and efficiency for everyone.\n3.\tPublic engagement: Actively involve communities in transportation planning. Regularly assess the impact of changes on residents' lives and adjust plans to maximize positive outcomes.\n4.\tIncentivize sustainable transportation: Encourage the use of bikes and public transit through incentives and by making them more convenient and faster than driving.\n5.\tLeverage technology: Utilize smart city initiatives to optimize traffic flow and transportation networks, reducing congestion and enhancing the commute experience.\n6.\tReduce speed limits: This will enhance road safety and promote commuters to use alternative sustainable transport modes.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario as a whole has not done enough to protect bikers. Bike lanes provide alternate modes of transportation for a diverse province such as Ontario. More cyclists mean fewer cars on the road, which can lead to less congestion. This can also contribute to shorter travel times for motorists; therefore, the premise of this bill is incorrect and misleading.\nRemoving bike lanes reduces safety. They provide a dedicated space for cyclists which helps to reduce conflicts and potential accidents with motorized vehicles; therefore, bike lanes increase safety for both cyclists and motorists. Tax payer money has already been spent on these projects and the lanes are already successfully being utilized and have become part of many people's daily lives. This proves that bike lanes are essential for a mixed transportation hub such as Toronto.\nRemoving bikes lanes and adding unnecessary red tape is a deterrent for cities looking for ways to improve the quality of life and health of the general population. Moreover, this bill will make it more difficult for cities to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\nThere are many economic benefits of bike lanes. Bike lanes can have positive economic impacts on local businesses. Cyclists tend to shop more locally, and bike lanes make areas more accessible, this can lead to increased foot (and wheel) traffic; thus, providing economic benefits for local businesses. In the long term, maintaining bike lanes is generally less expensive than the wear and tear caused by motor vehicles on roadways, which can lead to cost savings for the city. Lastly, cities with well-developed cycling infrastructures are often viewed as more progressive and attractive to tourists and potential residents.\nRemoving bike lanes can negate these positive benefits and send a signal that Ontario does not prioritize sustainable and healthy transportation choices, potentially contributing to negative outcomes across safety, environmental, social, and economic aspects. Municipalities do not need interference from the Ontario government in improving their cities.\n"

        "comment": "I am in agreement that the Province take a closer look at the bike lane situation.  I support including bike lanes in our city, however not at the cost of safety for the cyclist, the pedestrian AND the driver.  The congestion that has been created with removing one lane of traffic has doubled the drive time, idling time, and therefore emissions.\nThe bike lanes installed from Runnymede Ave to Islington Avenue were not researched for usage and were poorly installed. They have created a hazard for drivers, and pedestrians.  For the cyclists, the curved lanes are dangerous and the ramps are slippery when wet.\nMoreover, it is unsafe to park on Bloor Street. Trying to navigate getting out of the vehicle into incoming traffic is very unsafe.\nAs a regular pedestrian and driver on Bloor St. West, I have witnessed the congestion on the roads, increased idling vehicles and very limited bike lane use.\nAdditionally, the Kingsway area has a boulevard, and since the bike lane installation, there is no route for emergency vehicles. This is very poor planning considering the demographic of this neighbourhood.\nI support removing the bike lanes from Runnymede Ave to Islington Ave. There must be a better option.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not have say in how individual municipalities organize their road infrastructure. Different populations have different requirements based on their specific local.\nMore lanes of traffic won't solve gridlock in the Toronto core, especially at the cost of major bike lanes. Those cyclists will end up in traffic increasing congestion and decreasing safety. Many deliveries happen on bike now, as well as off hours commuting by construction and essential workers when public transit is not available.\nBiking removes the need to drive for many in Toronto, ultimately reducing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "If the goal of this bill is to reduce congestion, it is 100% wrong-headed. Congestion is not caused by people on bikes - whether they're in protected bike lanes or sharing lanes with cars. Congestion is caused by cars on the road. Good bike infrastructure gives people options other than driving, which decreases cars on the road and decreases traffic.\nSeeing this kind of ignorant and mean policy being advanced based on feelings which completely ignoring all data we have about how to effectively move people through a city core is really heartbreaking.\nThese problems have been solved elsewhere - like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Paris. And the people who solved them are willing to share their results with us. The data is there, the experiments have been run, we know what doesn't work and what does work. Let's embrace sensible and data-driven policy in this province.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto makes no sense. Listen to the experts that have clearly testified at committee and leave them in for the clear benefits they have for efficiency, safety, choice, and support for local businesses. The common sense solution is to leave them in and let municipalities decide what local safety infrastructure they need. Getting involved in local transportation issues is a waste of provincial resources.\nI support highway 413 to unlock more land for development, provided the 413 has a dedicated transitway and the new development is higher density than the suburban sprawl of the GTA.\n"
