The bike paths are good for all road users. Bike lanes allow kids to get around the city safely. Bike lanes help drivers feel comfortable knowing their separate from cyclists, who are vulnerable to injury compared to drivers. Many modern world class cities have strong bike networks, let's continue working towards maintaining Toronto's reputation of being one too.\n"

        "comment": "I disapprove with this new bill, particularly the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University in the City of Toronto.\nFirst, this government is overreaching on its jursidiction and is using provincial funds to go against municipal planning.\nSecond, this government is basing policy on statistics that is biased and out of scope. The commonly used \"2% of commuters are bikers\" encompasses districts OUTSIDE where the bike lanes proposed for removal. It also ignores recreational use, ages below 15, and other demographics including students.\nThird, this government has not studied the benefits of these newly established bike lanes before removal. There is NO strong evidence that congestion has worsened pre-bike lane when controlling for the effects of the pandemic.\nFourth, there is a study conducted by the City of Toronto in 2019 that shows numerous citizens use bikes for commuting and recreation, plus there are numerous citizens who would consider using bikes if infrastructure was available (for improved safety).\nFifth, this government is ignoring multiple studies that bike lanes improve safety for all road users plus small businesses. There are businesses on Bloor that have received increased business due to the flexibility of bikes parking directly outside businesses.\nSixth, this government has not considered the number of commuters that move on these major streets when including and excluding bikers. It only considers the movement of cars, which may or may not hold only 1 passenger at times.\nThe government should seriously listen to its constituents, especially citizens who live directly in the downtown area of the City of Toronto. Basing policy based on pure observations without supporting evidence is extremely ignorant.\n"

        "comment": "As both a cyclist and a driving commuter who's lived in Ontario for all of my adult life (~15 years) I've seen cycling grow continually. A lot of this has to do with growing cycling networks. I was astounded back in the 2010s how many people were biking late in the year, despite the cold, on the Bloor and University lanes. I think this is an awful, unthinking and backwards policy and should not move forward. Especially with the increasing density coming to Toronto. You think removing bikes rather than adding them will help gridlock in the long term? I think not.\n"

The province should be focused on dealing with it's own responsibilities instead of adding additional red tape on Municipal decision making.\nOntario is more than just Toronto and this bill is clearly targeted at a specific section of roads that have been come the center of a growing culture war between suburbanites and urbanites.  This bill ignores the growing set of data that identifies that less cars on the road reduces congestion and environmental impact.  Not to mention the increased risk of cyclists and pedestrians when traffic calming techniques are removed for favor of more cars and higher speed roads.\n"

        "comment": "Government people,\nI feel like your really out of the loop here because your stuck in your privileged rich people echo chamber... But wanted to share in case you weren't aware that CYCLING IS FOR EVERYBODY. It isn't really a city vs rural Ontario issue. Anyone can take it up.\nHaving more bike lanes increases safety for cyclists & cars, which means more people will choose to cycle, which means less people using cars, which means less cars on roads, which means less traffic.\nThe solution to your gridlock problem is connected to bike lane access/infrastructure as well as public transportation. Help municipalities build better bike infrastructure and public transportation where people have reliable, safe, and affordable transportation options. Cars create traffic all over Ontario!\nIf we used the low numbers of cyclists in Toronto/Ontario that you referenced yesterday (which is inaccurate by the way), I would like you to think about why it would be okay to remove/prevent bike lanes IF there was a situation where they were used less frequently than cars anyways. Don't we build pedestrian walkways all over the place so that those that walk can do so safely all over Ontario? What's the logic behind not wanted cyclists to cycle safety in a designated lane? In the suburbs few people walk, but you still make safe spaces for those who do. Why would we not treat cyclists similarly? Doesn't Ontario want to provide safe transportation options for people who cycle? Don't we want people to cycle and want to build better infrastructure to support cycling? Wouldn't more people cycle if we had bike lanes available in more places so they could actually get someplace they want to go (school, work, shops, etc.)? If more people cycled less people would clog up the car lanes with their big chunky cars and we'd all be able to travel faster!\nThis legislation will not have the results you stipulate it will. I think you already know that though, since all the data, research and basic logic demonstrates the opposite of what this government is saying.\nPlease stop constantly making Ontario worse and worse. Vote NO to this nonsensical Bill.\nSupport municipalities where they deem bike lanes should exist and more should be built!\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am a 20 year old economics student at Guelph that works in London in the summer. I occasionally bike to school or work because I need to share a car with my sister. This is a common situation for people my age because extremely few families can afford 4 cars for a household. I am fortunate that my route to work has a multi-use path because there are not enough bike lanes for me to safely get to work. Thankfully, the cities of London and Guelph are improving their infrastructure but I am afraid that this bill would drastically slow progress because of increased beurocracy and red tape. Finally here is a summary of key points:\n-Bike lanes allow freedom of transportation for people of all ages\n-Biking drastically decreases people's cost of living\n-Bike lanes protect citizens and make cities safer\n-Biking is the healthiest form of transportation\n-Every bike on the road is one less car in traffic\n-You can't judge the ridership of a bike lane if there isn't a network\n-Beuraucracy makes governments less efficient and more expensive\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Red tape and bureaucracy should never be implemented by a provincial government to supercede the decisions made by the municipality that deals with infrastructure on a day to day basis. As someone who partakes in all modes of transit, I know with utmost confidence that removing bike lanes would not solve motor vehicle congestion. If anything, it will increase numbers of cyclist fatalities and make the roads more unsafe for all users. Whenever I drive, I feel more safe on University, Yonge and Bloor as I know that I don't have to worry about cyclists when I am driving. WIthout the existence of good cycling infrastructure, driving is going to become more difficult. Furthermore, current cycling usage is low due to lack of infrastructure. We have some so far in the last 10 years, why go back now. With proper investment in cycling infrastructure and other infrastructure, we can increase cycling usage. This bill is definitely a step back for the city of Toronto as a whole.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes and heavy-handed approach to regulation on new bike lanes in this bill is a mistake. The people of Toronto were surveyed and the majority (57%) agreed that they would like to bike more, see the first link. From the same survey, 34% of households in Toronto contain at least one person who cycles to work. From the 2021 census, an average of 10% of people in the downtown area served by these bike lanes commute to work by bicycle. These are not insignificant numbers. The people of Toronto just voted for a pro-bike lane mayor in Olivia Chow. The people of Toronto themselves are the ones who deserve an increased say over whether they want these lanes. For the province to override their concerns is undemocratic, and goes against the  small government principles the conservative party supposedly represents\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this Bill in any capacity.\nScientific studies around the world have shown that bike lanes ease congestion and reduce emissions. Studies have also shown that businesses benefit the most from these programs because pedestrian and bike traffic are a majority of customers along major roads, not drivers. This bill is based on false information and factually incorrect rhetoric that gets repeated.\nPersonally as someone who has lived in Ontario for 8 years, I have seen first hand the positive impact on our communities. Previously when there were less bike lanes, roads were busier while the traffic was just as bad. With introduction of bike lanes and other municipal pilot programs such as removal of cars sharing roads with streetcars, there was a massive improvement in quality of life around these areas.\nThere is also no consideration for safety of bikers and pedestrians. Many of these bike lanes were installed after tragedies and yet the province prioritizes extra car space in exchange for human lives. The provincial government does not commit to building additional bike infrastructure along alternative routes, while only looking to remove these.\nWe have all seen the improvement in emissions due to the pandemic and air quality. We should be striving to reduce car traffic and give as many people as possible a viable alternative to driving. Instead, this bill destroys progress made by the cities in Ontario that have invested in public infrastructure without providing an alternative. Not to mention, the province is overstepping its already wide reach and encroaching on municipalities that invest in our quality of life, instead of increasing funding for these programs to improve traffic both for drivers and non-drivers.\nThis bill improves nothing to society, has no scientific or empirical evidence supporting it and is based on false dichotomy that traffic is zero-sum game between public transportation infrastructure and car infrastructure. Drivers, bikers, pedestrians all should be against this bill based on mountains of scientific evidence.\n"

Cyclists can use these routes year round because they are cleared of snow etc. We need to encourage more people to use public transit and cycling to reduce pollution. If cyclists are expected to mix in with cars, there will be a huge increase in accidents. That means those lanes will get bogged down with an increase in ambulances to deal with that!\nWe need less cars on the road, not more!\nLook at cities like Amsterdam and other European cities that are great at balancing bikes and cars. It is possible!\n"
