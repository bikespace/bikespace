        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the removal of existing bike lanes. Removing infrastructure that has already been installed is a considerable waste of taxpayer money and undermines progress toward a safer and more sustainable transit system. This proposal represents a shift toward prioritizing car traffic over active transportation, which may be at odds with modern urban planning practices that emphasize multimodal transit, environmental health, and climate resilience.\nI understand there is an ongoing tension between dedicated cyclists and drivers, yet removing a bike lane that\u2019s already in place would only intensify these frustrations. Without designated lanes, cyclists will still need to navigate these roads, but with less space, potentially taking up entire car lanes and further slowing down traffic. Bike lanes provide safety not only for cyclists but also for pedestrians on sidewalks and drivers themselves, as everyone has clearer boundaries.\nBike lanes are a forward-thinking investment. Cars take up significantly more space per person than bikes, and adding lanes for cars often simply fills them back up with more traffic, making the change ineffective. In contrast, bike lanes require less space and can move more people efficiently, which ultimately reduces congestion. While bike lanes may not immediately benefit every business or commuter, they are critical for public health, safety, and environmental sustainability in the long term.\nUrban planning in North America has historically prioritized cars, but as we aim for a future that values balanced transit options, bike lanes will be essential in reducing car dependency. The quicker we recognize that biking is a fast, healthy, and effective way to reduce strain on both our roads and the TTC, the quicker bike lanes will reach their full potential.\nAs a frequent user of the Bloor bike lane, I can personally attest to the safety and comfort it provides. I rely on this bike lane every weekday during the summer, and I feel far safer with it in place. By preserving bike lanes, we encourage healthier, safer, and more environmentally conscious travel options that benefit all residents.\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and please don\u2019t get rid of bike lanes\u2014especially those that are already implemented. If anything, find a compromise, perhaps by slowing the addition of new lanes rather than removing existing ones. It simply does not make sense to me to spend more money to undo progress that\u2019s already been made. When I return from school, I look forward to using these bike lanes to commute to work, as biking is far more cost-effective than owning a car and more reliable than public transit. I love biking, and I love our bike lanes.\nThank you for considering the lasting benefits of bike infrastructure over short-term pressures to reduce traffic lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply disheartened by the policy agenda that prioritizes highway construction and vehicle-based infrastructure at the expense of sustainable and equitable transportation options for all Ontarians. The proposal objectives are clearly discriminatory, catering exclusively to drivers and disregarding the needs of those who rely on other modes of transportation, particularly cycling.\nThe government's priority to \u201cget people and goods out of gridlock\u201d and \u201csave drivers time and money\u201d blatantly ignores the value of bike lanes and active transportation, which can significantly reduce congestion if supported. Instead of investing in accessible, safe cycling routes, the government has chosen to throw resources into car-centric projects like Highway 413, catering solely to drivers while disregarding those of us who use cycling as our primary means of transportation. This approach leaves cyclists increasingly unsafe, marginalized, and without support in a province that claims to value all its residents equally.\nAcknowledging that \u201caccidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact quality of life\u201d is hypocritical when this government systematically fails to protect cyclists and pedestrians from exactly these hazards by removing crucial bike lanes. Building more highways, at the cost of sustainable infrastructure, reflects a narrow-minded vision that prioritizes the comfort and convenience of drivers over the safety and well-being of a growing number of Ontarians who choose environmentally friendly, health-promoting, and affordable transportation.\nI urge the government to prioritize inclusive infrastructure that recognizes the rights and needs of all residents. We deserve a city that is safe and accessible for all, regardless of how we choose to move through it.\nSincerely,\nOne less car.\n"

        "comment": "This framework is backwards. It would spend money that is needed to address other issues within the province to wage a fight on bike lanes. Bike lanes offer a car-free way of getting around cities without reliance on automobiles. The idea that the province meddles in municipal planning decisions on a street-by-street level of detail is a complete waste of time and an overreach of provincial jurisdiction. The province here has decided to impose car travel at every level unilaterally.\nThe idea that it might even be forced on cities to return vehicle lanes by removing already existing bike lanes is absurd. This is a complete waste of money, effort and makes roads less safe for everybody. (See \"Based on the outcome of the review, a regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane and its return to a lane of traffic.\" in teh framework). This framework should not exist.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has regularly driven since 1981 on the three Toronto streets specifically called out in the proposal, I have my own experience to add: That can be summed up as removing the bike lanes will not speed up the flow of automobile traffic on those streets.\nTraffic has been heavy on those streets throughout the time I've driven on them. However, it has gotten worse and is more likely to be gridlocked the closer you are to downtown. My observation from the street is that since TPS reduced their traffic unit in size in the early 2010s, the root cause of the congestion lies almost entirely in the lack of civil behaviour by car drivers. Intersections are regularly blocked, right-hand and left-hand turns are made unsafely, and car drivers routinely ignore red lights. Illegal parking runs rampant.\nAs well, there's some science to back up the view that bike lanes are not the culprit. The Bloor Street BIA put it much better than I can: Bike lanes result in no increase in congestion and an improvement in business outcomes. I want to underline that no data supports the government's assertion that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion.  It's probably important to note that most people who regularly commute by bicycle are also licensed drivers and, without a safe way to cycle to work, will add their cars to the congestion. Aside from this, the suggestion that cyclists use side streets to get to their destination is ridiculous. A look at the map of Toronto shows that very few alternatives offer direct routes to where people need to go that are not major arterial roads.\nAs a final point, both the head of Toronto EMS and Toronto Police Service's Traffic Division report no increase in response time or an improvement where bike lanes have been installed.\nWhat will be the end result if the PCs get their way?\n   More traffic congestion\n   More dead pedestrians and cyclists\n   Reduced revenue for businesses on those streets\n  A likely increase in response times for emergency vehicles.\nNone of these probable outcomes are the stated desired outcome.\n"

        "comment": "I am 100% opposed to Bill 212 as it relates to bike lanes. It seems ill-conceived, under-researched, and grossly lacking in data-driven reasoning and transparency. I have not seen any data to support this huge tax-payer expense and suggest that this is an over-reach by the provincial government into specific municipal-level concerns.\nAs someone who drives in downtown Toronto, I have welcomed bike lanes and seen traffic improve in terms of well-being and safety. Before bike lanes, cyclists would weave in and out of traffic. This was not only stressful for drivers like me, but it meant cars were constantly breaking to accommodate cyclists that seemed to come from nowhere (usually avoiding potholes, storm grates, and garbage near the curbs) and slow down and speed up in irregular ways. Anyone who has had a cyclist suddenly fall over in front of their car because of a pothole or issue with their bike will agree with me that giving cyclists their own lane out of car traffic has significantly reduced the stress and anxiety of driving downtown.\nFurther, since the bike lanes have gone in on Bloor/Danforth, Yonge, and University, I have not seen any road rage incidents related to bicycles and have not seen any bicycles \"doored\" or police or ambulances stopping traffic to deal with these incidents. I no longer worry about bicycles in my path and feel that Toronto is a world-class city when I look over to see entire families riding (even with small children) and tourists on rented bikes using the bike lanes.\nTo recap:\n- having bicycles out of traffic reduces stress and danger to both cars and cyclists\n- bike lanes do not inhibit traffic flow\n- bike lanes are a sign of a world-class city\nThe idea has been put forth that bike lanes will be shifted to residential neighbourhoods. If anyone in the provincial government lives in a downtown residential neighbourhood, then they must know that this is not a realistic move. Residential streets in Toronto have only one lane plus parking, so there is no space to put in a dedicated lane. Second, this assumes all cyclists are riding for pleasure and have no limits on their time or energy. Most cyclists are commuting to work or on errands. They will be taking the shortest and most energy-efficient route, even if that means going back into traffic. Simply, residential bike routes are not realistic and will do nothing to keep cyclists out of traffic.\nTo recap:\n- Building dedicated bike lanes in downtown residential streets is impossible because of limited space\n- Commuter and delivery cyclists, as well as those on personal errands choose routes for speed and energy efficiency: they will not use meandering \"detours\" through neighbourhoods.\nOverall, I question who is asking the Ontario government to step outside its mandate in order to meddle in municipal concerns. The hard-line nature of this issue reduces my faith in provincial government as a transparent office and reduces my confidence that the provincial government is making wise fiscal decisions with my tax dollars.\nTo go forward with this bill will mean I will not vote for this government to continue in its role in the next election.\n"

        "comment": "Conservative governments have a history of supporting democracy and providing lower tiers of government autonomy to do what works best for their respective communities.  This makes good sense, since cities like Toronto know far better how to meet the needs of their constituents than the provincial government does.\nBill 212 is a noticeable departure from this policy of non-interference to be replaced with centralized planning from the top of Queen's Park. This will inhibit municipalities' ability to provide their residents the freedom to make investments in transportation options.  These choices enable a city to create an environment that is tailored to the community's needs, not dictated from the provincial government. Widening roads and highways only induces further demand to said roadways while doing nothing to \"Reduce gridlock,\" it only creates more.  This affects the livelihood and economic choices for everyone in the province by prioritizing only drivers.\nYet, we have an ageing population and for much of the province, no alternatives besides driving.  Keep the provincial government's hands off a municipality's and people's right to have transportation freedom.\n"

        "comment": "Hello -- I am a High Park resident writing to voice my strong support for the bike lanes on Bloor Street and University Avenue. In any given week, I am a driver, a pedestrian, a transit user, and a cyclist. My interest is getting around the city as quickly as possible, and cycling is often the fastest way.\nThe bike lanes, especially those on Bloor, have made it easier to run errands; I do most of my shopping in the neighbourhood and I am able to support local businesses much more easily by being able to lock my bike directly in front of them. I spend more money in the neighbourhoods that make our city special and unique, and having bike lanes makes this safer and more accessible.\nMoreover, I am an avid road cyclist for fitness, making destinations out of many smaller communities in Halton, Durham, Peel, and Niagara this year alone. When there, I often make a day out of visiting (and spending money at) local businesses and coffee shops. While Toronto's bike lanes don't affect these trips directly, they encourage people to get into cycling, which naturally extends our enthusiasm to get out of the city and travel by bike throughout southern Ontario. But getting more people on bikes safely, especially on busy streets, is the first step.\nLastly, I plead that our scarce provincial tax dollars be directed to the dire and pressing challenges we face as a province: homelessness, crumbling schools, and a heavily strained health care system. Please direct our tax dollars toward projects that will improve as many lives as possible -- taking out newly installed bike lanes isn't that. Minimally increased transit times are not the greatest problem to solve; big cities are busy -- it's what makes them economic engines. Please direct our resources to those issues that will make this, in the PC's own words, a place to grow.\nThank you.\n"

And removing bike lanes is also a disastrous policy that will make all forms of travel more difficult, from crowding sidewards with dangerous bicycles and scooters (endangering pedestrains), making cyclists, and other vulnerable road users unsafe, and increasing traffic for public transit and those in cars. This is a cheap ploy to score political points with voters who do not live in Toronto, and should not even be considered. Leave municipal decisions in the hands of municipal decision-makers and focus on healthcare instead you ghoul.\n"

I, as well as most people in the city who do not reside under Doug Ford's immediate constituency of Etobicoke, are so tired of the needless chest-pumping antics of the Ontario Conservative leadership. Doug's nearly senile gripes with the matters of the city harkens to his penchant for treating everything as if he was still a boy in the 1970s. The high number of deaths in 2024 show that these safe biking initiatives are necessary. A continuous growing city with no room for more roads and more vehicles show that alternative methods of travel are only going to be increasingly necessary. And the millions of dollars invested into Metrolinx shows a counterintuitive, downright contradictory messaging about the future of public transit. Shouldn't we be discouraging people to be driving into the city at all? Should we not divert the millions of dollars that will undoubtably be needed to reverse the functioning bike paths into our crumbling, decaying, and underfunded public transit system? I'm sure a few millions would go a long way to creating a bus route so Doug Ford doesn't have to see the bikers he despises so much that he wants to implement legislation for complete and tyrannical control over every aspect of his miserable life that he can lay his fingers on. I truly do not care who needs to drive down Bloor, University, or Yonge, when they can hop off and take the train into the city like the rest of us.\n"

It creates additional red tape, which is the exact opposite of what a conservative government is supposed to do.

I want bike lanes - improved, more of them and none removed.\nThis being a distraction tactic makes sense, maybe to draw our eyes away from problems surrounding the 413. My concern there is that this anti-cycling rhetoric will embolden our dangerous drivers to not treat all road users (cyclists and pedestrians) with the necessary respect. I hope this distraction is worth the danger your government will put vulnerable road users in.\nI don't like the other parties, but you've ensured one fewer vote for the OPC.\n"
