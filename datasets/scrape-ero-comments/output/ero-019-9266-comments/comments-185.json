        "comment": "As a driver in Toronto, I prefer to drive on streets that have bike lanes, especially the ones that have a curb separating bikes from cars. Not having to share a lane with cyclists makes driving so much less stressful. Plus because bike lanes get more people to ride bikes instead of driving, that means less traffic congestion (not more). What's more, the BIAs along Bloor are now confirming that their business actually went up after bike lanes got installed. They're literally a win for everyone.\nIt's clear that removing bike lanes isn't based on facts, it's based on childish personal grievances coming from the top. It will be using my taxpayer money to make traffic worse, harm businesses, and cause more crashes. The Progressive Conservatives are supposed to be about fiscal responsibility. Start acting like it. I'm not interested in voting for a party that meddles in municipal decisions and uses my taxpayer money for petty score settling.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the Provincial Government's decision to remove bike lanes on Toronto streets. It is a waste of tax payer money, and counter intuitive to fixing traffic and grid lock, not to mention lives will be lost from the removal of safe cycling infrastructure, that also doubles as making streets safer for pedestrains, bolstering local businesses, and increasing emergency response vehicle times.\nWhile cities across the globe are moving forward, it is incredibly disapointing to see Doug Ford forcing Toronto backwards. All just to cater a vocal minority of his voter base who are intent on making everything in a city yield to them because their car commute times are slightly up than they use to.\nWhat will Doug Ford and co. say once the streets are coverted back to how they were before the bike lanes and the traffic doesn't get better but instead gets worse due to the induced demand of car traffic?\nPlease reconsider this decision, this is the worst use of my tax payer money I have ever seen.\n"

Not to mention the risk this will place on cyclist as by law we are still entitled to 1/2 of a lane by MTO rules if no cycle lane is present.  In addition the 3ft passing rule is also in place.  So removal of the safe cycling lane is actually more likely to impeed traffic more.\n"

Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nb) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is one of this most poorly thought out things I\u2019ve read in my life. First off adding additional red tape to adding bike lanes, for the party that talks about removing red tape is laughable. Secondly, I live on bloor, I have a car, I go down young and university almost daily to get to work, removing bike lanes will not accomplish anything, congestion isn\u2019t a mathematical equation where you double the lanes you reduce the congestion in half, the new lane that gets added in is going to be used for useless street parking like on Bay Street, or it will just add a couple of more cars that will still result in congestion because everyone is blocked off at intersections. Instead of coming up with random solutions a toddler could come up with, go look at how other successful governments have solved the issue, it\u2019s a solved problem it\u2019s not something new. But since our government can\u2019t do research by themselves let me help you out, the way to reduce traffic isn\u2019t by increasing lanes, because everyone wants to get into or out of the core, there are going to be choke points and adding lanes does nothing, you need to reduce the amount of cars. That\u2019s it, it\u2019s very simple, less cars, less traffic. How to do that? Invest in transit, instead of bribing everyone with $200 right before an election how about spending it on transit infrastructure, how about while the Gardiner is being fixed for the next two years you subside the cost of go transit and the TTC, make it a no brainer to use transit. Also invest in ways to get to stations, Mississauga is building the LRT, what about Oakville, and other suburbs, why is driving the reasonable only way to get to the Go station, it\u2019s silly. If you love drivers so much (keep in mind I am one) make it better by reducing the amount of cars by giving people proper alternatives, taking away bike lanes is literally reducing alternatives because guess what I used to bike instead of drive but if you remove the bike lanes on bloor and university, I now have to drive because the side streets are not as safe as protected bike lanes, so that means you literally just did the opposite of what your bill intends which is add more traffic because now I have to drive when I would not have done so before. Please just think for a little more than a few minutes before writing a bill, like actually put some thought into it, look at what other successful governments that have large growing populations have done, you don\u2019t need to come up with random crap, others have already solved this problem.\nSigned someone with a car who lives on bloor and bay and thinks this bill is one of the most poorly thought out things ever written.\n"

This is beside the fact that, managing a municipalities' bike lanes is a gross overreach of provincial power, and the premiere is in fact NOT the mayor of Toronto.\nThere is no indication that the proposed plan would even actually achieve the indicated goals, and in fact the research seems to suggest it would actually make gridlock worse. This point is made especially poignant by the fact that no documentation has been put forward that refutes the overwhelming amount of existing research on this topic.\nI would believe that there is value in building a new highways, but the adversarial approach taken thus far leaves me questioning the validity of this plan.

        "comment": "Toronto needs more safe separated bike lanes. All the data shows that if people feel safe biking they do it. More people biking means fewer single occupancy cars on the road and improved traffic for the cars that have to be there. Having broken and incomplete bike lanes makes people feel unsafe biking, which renders the remaining bike lanes less used. Biking is healthier than sitting in a car. It\u2019s easier to stop and lock up a bike to support local businesses than to find (and pay for) parking for a car. Toronto Bike Share ridership is booming. Other cities that have a good network of bike lanes show that people absolutely use them if they\u2019re built and connect all the way from destination to destination. Ford isn\u2019t providing any data for removing bike lanes. Are the bike lanes he has a problem with affecting his personal commute? The premier is supposed to serve Torontonians.\nFocus on enforcing traffic laws and fine drivers heavily for breaking them. Have red light cameras for gridlock. Use the funds from that to speed up work and generally improve transit. Don\u2019t allow construction to take up lanes of traffic unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Have work around the clock if the construction is taking up a lane. If there are city owned lots that have available space, have an app that directs private utility companies and large delivery vehicles to use them instead of blocking traffic. Don\u2019t allow those vehicles to block traffic during rush hour. Time lights better. Have speed cameras on the Lakeshore with heavy penalties. Have an app that allows cyclists to submit photos of cars stopped in bike lanes or doing other dangerous things. Fine those drivers, use the funds for transit improvements. Penalize cops parked in bike lanes, that aren\u2019t handling an active emergency (not financially, which just means tax payers are paying, if they can\u2019t follow the law it should affect their promotions, bonuses, and ultimately their jobs.) When developers are planning condos, have them include plans to dig for future subways (at the developer\u2019s expense.) Other cities consistently work on their transit systems, Toronto needs to learn from this instead of the piecemeal way that things are done here.\nHaving more cars in the city will just make traffic worse. We need better options so that people will actually use them.\nMy 5km+ commute takes roughly the same amount of time on transit or walking. Biking or taking a car are faster and also take about the same amount of time. For a few years, I had a friend who lived by the GO station in Oakville who worked across the street from my work in Toronto. Her commute with the GO train from Oakville to Union, then by subway for a few stops, was faster than my commute from Toronto to Toronto. We need to improve commutes for people within the city instead of focusing on suburban commuters. Locals are the ones that are likely to support local business instead of running for the train or trying to beat car traffic to get home.\n"
