My husband and I have been riding our bikes to go downtown and come back since 2020. We have seen the new bike lanes and have loved the new connections and how far we can go by using them. Removing them should not be an option. People like my husband and I, DEPEND on bike lanes. Not having bike lanes allow cara to get so close to me. A lot of car drivers do not care about bicycles and rush past us all the time. They feel entitled as if the whole street is theirs. Having bike lanes at least keeps them at a safer distance.\nPlease do not allow this bill to pass through. I\u2019m happy with all the bike lanes we have as it is easier and faster to get around.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to all parts of Bill 212. I feel strongly it is not in the best interests of Ontarians or Ontario.\nLimiting bike lane installation and removing environmental assessment processes for major highway projects does nothing to reduce gridlock. In fact, it actively ignores the growing demand for more sustainable, safe, and diverse transportation options.\nI completely agree with the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers who say,\n\u201cThe key to solving Ontario\u2019s traffic woes is not about maintaining the status quo of car-dominated roadways. Instead, we need to embrace multi-modal transportation \u2014 an approach that supports different forms of transport that cater to the needs of the people in each community.\u201d\nTo reduce congestion, we need to offer alternative and varied ways for people to get around. This means investing in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and transit. Evidence-informed research says this is the best way to combat congestion. This government, by proposing to do anything EXCEPT create more bike lanes, is not following the evidence. Instead, this government is creating false evidence to support their narrative.\nThe Evidence:\n-\tInvesting in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure also has long term benefits for the health and wellbeing of our community. The Dutch invest \u20ac595 million annually on urban biking, resulting in \u20ac19 BILLION saved in public health care costs alone.\n-\tA poll conducted for the City of Toronto found that one-in-10 Torontonians say they bike to work. It also found a full 70% identify as recreational or utilitarian cyclists who use their bikes to get where they need to go. I am one of them.\n-\tinstalling bike lanes on 9 routes between 2014 and 2021 boosted the number of riders by an average of 200%\n-\tToronto\u2019s emergency services have for YEARS said that bike lanes do not present a problem for front-line responders. Police, fire and paramedic officials have all assured city officials that bike lanes do not hinder their effectiveness. The former head of Toronto\u2019s paramedic service, told city council in 2022 there was \u201cno evidence of emergency response impacts as a result of the midtown installation.\u201d Fire service similarly assured council there was \u201cno degradation of response time in this area.\u201d\nIn fact, removing the bike lanes will COST money. Ridiculous. As a taxpayer and Torontonian I am deeply offended and angry that the city would waste time and money REMOVING public infrastructure.\nBikes lanes are a \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d situation. Put in new bike lanes and they will be used. But remove them, and *people will continue to bike*. And there will not be bike lanes to help bikes and traffic share the road. And there will be accidents, and people will be hurt. Some people will die. Six people have died cycling in Toronto so far this year. Bill 212 says these lives don\u2019t matter.\nRequiring municipalities to receive approval from the province goes against everything this government claims to stand for. It will create red tape and bureaucracy. You should allow municipalities to do what\u2019s right for their communities. Trust that elected officials can represent their local communities.\nIt also horrifies me that the government would do anything less than a comprehensive and complete environmental assessment for highway 413. We are in a climate crisis and an assessment should always be the first step. I work in health care, and we talk about assessment as being critical to safety. Timely and comprehensive assessments in health care is a fundamental skill that is REQUIRED, and I expect the same from you.\nAdditionally, information gathered during assessment informs ongoing decision-making. It is a step that cannot be skipped.\nI urge the government to listen to the people they represent and scrap Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "My comments regarding this theme centre on two major themes.\nThe first, is that bike lanes make cycling safer for everyone, and going forward we need more cycling infrastructure in cities. Bike lanes mean I worry less when my kids bike to school. Bike lanes mean drivers worry less when sharing the road. And bike lanes mean everyone can navigate safely in their lane. All the data shows that remove bike lanes would not help with congestion.  The only thing that will help congestion is having fewer cars, so let\u2019s focus on that. (Hint, bike lanes and public transit are key.)\nSecond, the Ford government wants to fastrack the building of Highways including highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, but this act illustrates this government\u2019s disregard for public due diligence. There is a reason it makes sense to go slow with projects of this magnitude. I\u2019m very worried about the negative impacts to the environment, in particular to the encroachment on the Watershed of Lake Ontario as we see climate change have serious implications for communities around the globe. I\u2019m also worried that the true intention of these Highway projects is to enable development of the land for suburban communities, which would be even more detrimental to the environment and watershed. Single family homes in sub-urban environments is not the answer to our housing crisis. We need family-sized units in medium sized buildings in already established municipalities. We go slow with big projects because careful consideration is required.\n"

        "comment": "The City of Toronto report linked below states that separated bike lanes have been independently peer reviewed to reduce the risk of cyclist injury (9x lower than major streets with parked cars and no lanes).\nAs a mother of two children who commute to school on my husband\u2019s cargo bike, I\u2019m outraged at the thought of bike lanes being removed.\nRemoval of bike lanes is an equity issue. Cars (and maintenance, gas, insurance, parking) and public transit are expensive. Bikes are a more affordable option and allow people with less disposable income to move freely around the city. Having a bike lane allows them to do this more safely.\nFinally, the City of Toronto report states that removal of bike lanes will cost provincial taxpayers an estimated $48 million dollars to remove existing bike lanes. Surely that alone is reason enough to scrap Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Taking away bike lanes in the city is a misguided approach if the goal is to reduce gridlock. Bike lanes are essential for providing safe, dedicated spaces for cyclists, which helps keep them off busy roads and reduces the likelihood of accidents involving bikes and motor vehicles. By removing bike lanes, the city may force cyclists into traffic, potentially creating more congestion and unsafe conditions for both cyclists and drivers. Furthermore, reducing bike infrastructure can undermine efforts to promote alternative, eco-friendly transportation options, which ultimately could help alleviate gridlock over the long term. Instead of removing bike lanes, the focus should be on improving and integrating transportation options to better accommodate all users of the road.\n"

Those bike lines are used and are also future proofing us from further traffic. Modern apartments are not prioritizing parking. The number of pedestrians needing alternate forms of transportation will only increase.\nLet's stop being car brained and look at real models of efficient transportation like subway, bikes and walking.

        "comment": "We've seen that the more we build and design our cities and transportation infrastructure around cars that the more people end up driving. The best way to reduce traffic is to remove drivers from the road by giving them viable alternatives. Bicycle infrastructure provides a good first/last mile option for regular work commutes when combined with good public transport as well as a solution for shorter trips that would otherwise take too much time to walk to.\nRemoving viable transportation options will add to congestion no matter how many lanes get added, this has been seen in other cities and countries where the endless cycle of highway expansion and traffic. Investing in non-car infrastructure will give citizens more freedom of movement as well as allowing those who are unable to drive (children/teens, and the elderly) a safe and convenient way to travel. This will allow them to become more independent as well as save time and money for either themselves or their guardians.\n"

Moreover, I'm concerned with the overstep in provincial authority over a decision that is municipal in nature. Torontonians, through city council, debated, planned, and paid for the lanes. The province should focus on delivering its transit projects quicker, and this will alleviate congestion on our roads.\n"

        "comment": "I believe that the decision to rip up the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge is ill-advised, fiscally irresponsible ($48 million!), and not driven by real data. In particular, without the Bloor lane, there will be no way to get from one side of the city to another on a bicycle. This will only increase cars on the road, who will then be competing with bikes for the same lanes. This will lead to avoidable deaths. Just back in July, a cyclist was killed on Bloor when they were forced to leave the lane due to an obstruction. For much of this bike lane, there isn't even room for another car lane. Moreover, the bike lanes are being used more and more by Torontonians. For some hard traceable data, just look at the city's bike-share program: we are on track to seeing more than six million trips in 2024! And those are not the bikes you even most commonly see in the bike lanes. This move on the part of the provincial government just doesn't make sense.\n"

The whole western world is moving towards adopting bike lanes and your government is trying to take us back a decade. Your decision to remove bike lanes in Toronto will undeniably cause people to die. This has already been the deadliest year in Toronto's history for cyclists, how on earth is removing bike lanes going to help this. If you remove bike lanes under the premise that you want to speed up traffic you are announcing to the whole world that you value 5 minutes of your time more than the lives of living breathing humans.\nBloor, younge, and university are all destination streets. They have plenty of business on them which our vital to our economy. The lanes on Bloor have driven more people to visit the businesses, and people who bike spend more money at these business. Therefore, bike lanes are beneficial to the economy.\nPlease think of this from a pragmatic, data driven lens, and not pandering to your voters. It is clear to anyone with an ounce of critical thinking that what you're doing is simply trying to bolster support for your party. Your job as a leader is not to ensure your reelection, it is to create a healthy and thriving province, something which you have grossly failed to do.\nDo better.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, as a Toronto resident who actively uses multiple modes of transportation, including driving, taking the TTC and GO Train, and biking.  This legislation undermines the progress we\u2019ve made toward creating a sustainable and equitable transportation system in our city.\nFirstly, the bill threatens to prioritize car-centric policies at the expense of public transit and active transportation. Toronto is already grappling with congestion and limited road space; further entrenching car dependency will only exacerbate these issues. We need to invest in and expand public transit services to meet the demands of our growing population, not hinder them.\nSecondly, biking is an essential component of our transportation landscape. The safety and accessibility of bike lanes have become crucial for encouraging more residents to choose biking over driving. Bill 212 risks rolling back the protections and infrastructure improvements that have been implemented, making cycling less safe and less appealing. This will ultimately deter people from biking, which goes against our collective goal of reducing traffic congestion and emissions.\nFinally, I believe that a truly effective transportation strategy must accommodate all users\u2014drivers, transit riders, and cyclists alike. Instead of moving backwards with legislation like Bill 212, we should be focusing on comprehensive, multi-modal solutions that enhance connectivity, improve safety, and foster a healthier environment.\nFor the sake of our city\u2019s future and the well-being of all its residents, I urge lawmakers to reconsider the implications of Bill 212 and to prioritize policies that promote a balanced and inclusive transportation system.\n"

These actions will not reduce traffic congestion as is well documented by extensive evidence and research that has undoubtedly been shared with the Ontario Government by a range of experts in urban planning and transportation. Specifically, the phenomenon of Induced Demand is well established to show that adding lanes just encourages more people to drive, and congestion returns to the same level. There is also ample evidence showing that improving cycling infrastructure actually reduces car traffic as people switch to cycling. Furthermore, this legislation represents significant Provincial over-reach into municipal government matters. It concerns me and many others that the proposed legislation is not supported by evidence, and in fact appears to be part of a populist agenda to appeal to car-driving voters who are not well informed on the issues and sincerely believe that these actions will actually improve traffic congestion.\n"
