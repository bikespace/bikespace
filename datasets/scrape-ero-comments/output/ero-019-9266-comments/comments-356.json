        "comment": "Data provided for basis of this policy are not accurate. This is a summary if appropriate statistics.\nPremier Doug Ford has justified the decision by claiming that \"1.2 per cent of the residents in Toronto commute to work via bicycle.\"\n\"We know that these bike lanes, where only 1.2 per cent of people use to commute to get to work, are taking away almost 50 per cent of the infrastructure on those streets from vehicles,\" Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria said on Friday morning.\nThe figure is inaccurate.\nA poll conducted for the City of Toronto a few years ago found that one-in-10 Torontonians say they bike to work. It also found a full 70 per cent identify as recreational or \"utilitarian\" cyclists who use their bikes to get where they need to go.\n1.2% figure covers entire GTA, predates bike lanes\nThe 2011 Canadian census asked how people commuted to work, and 1.2 per cent of people in the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA) said they cycled. The CMA includes most of the Greater Toronto Area \u2014 including Burlington in the west and Ajax in the east, reaching as far north as Lake Simcoe.\n\"This is in massive areas that have no cycling infrastructure whatsoever, and where it's a frightening place to cycle,\" said Albert Koehl, a founder of the Toronto Community Bikeways Coalition (TCBC).\n\"Factually, that's the wrong basis of data to use,\" said Anthony Smith, a professional planner in Toronto, noting that there was another census in 2021.\nThe 1.2 per cent figure is \"irrelevant\" to today's Toronto, which has since seen a surge in couriers, e-bikes, cargo bikes and Bike Share Toronto trips, Koehl said \u2014 not to mention infrastructure.\n\"2011 \u2014 that's before almost all the bikeways in downtown Toronto were put on the ground,\" Cycle Toronto executive director Michael Longfield said.\nThe Bloor, University and Yonge lanes were installed between 2016 and 2021.\nLarge majority of Torontonians are cyclists\nAt least five per cent of people in Old Toronto now primarily commute by bike, said Smith, who compiled data from the 2021 census, the city and the province. The share reaches 10\u201320 per cent in many core areas of the city, he found.\n\"And that's only people who commute every day and indicate cycling as their primary commute,\" he said. \"So there's probably another five times that number who bike occasionally.\"\nRecent surveys back up Smith's comments.\nA 2019 poll for the City of Toronto found 70 per cent of Torontonians rode bikes. Forty-four per cent identified as \"utilitarian\" cyclists, who bike to work, shop, visit friends, etc. Another 26 per cent said they were \"recreational\" cyclists, who bike for leisure or fitness. Just 30 per cent said they didn't bike at all. Of all respondents, 10 per cent said they ride their bike to work in good weather.\nBikes made up 37 per cent of rush-hour traffic at two spots along Bloor in the Annex, according to counts done this year by Koehl's group, the TCBC.\n\"And that accords with the city's own numbers,\" Koehl said, referring to Toronto's latest Cycling Network Plan Update in 2019. \"Cabbagetown had 34 per cent, and other central city neighbourhoods had between 26 and 33 per cent mode share.\"\nOn one October day in 2022, 38,000 people biked through an area in the downtown core between Spadina, Jarvis, Queens Quay and Bloor, according to a City of Toronto count.\nEven in 1999, eight per cent of Torontonians \u2014 and 15 per cent in Central Toronto \u2014 said they biked to work at least sometimes, according to a City of Toronto study.\nIf you build it, they will come\nAcross the world, studies have shown that bike lanes attract cyclists and have negligible impacts on traffic, including emergency vehicles.\nIn 2013, the average number of cyclists in eight hours along Richmond Street West and Adelaide Street West in downtown Toronto was 400, according to the City. In September 2018, after bike lanes were installed, the average count was 4,780 \u2014 a 1,095 per cent increase.\nBloor Street saw a 50 per cent increase in cycling after the bike lanes were installed in 2016. Spending at local businesses also increased.\nBike Share Toronto saw 665,000 trips in 2015, its first year. This year, thanks to more bikes and better cycling paths, it's projected to hit more than 6 million.\n\"Doing some shopping, going out for dinner, visiting some friends \u2014 those really are the kinds of trips that, with a connected network of bikeways, it means more people can choose not to drive,\" Longfield said. \"And I think that's what we're starting to see around Toronto.\"\nCritics, including the Ford government, often insist that they aren't against bike lanes \u2014 they just don't want them on major streets.\n\"And it's like, at the end of the day, people need to travel to where they're going. And so you can't tell people to take huge, circuitous routes on side streets. It just doesn't work,\" Smith said.\n\"The region is congested because people are driving from far away places coming into the city, and they should ultimately look at transit and other options as a way of reducing congestion. Bike lanes are not the problem.\"\n"

Our city\u2019s gridlock is ridiculous and notorious. The Bayview Ave one should go too considering there exists a bike path that runs parallel to it. Additionally, restricting the flow of traffic on Dundas St E at the DVP on-ramp due to bike lanes was poorly planned and short sighted. These lanes often put cyclists at risk rather than improving safety.\nThe bike lobby is squeaky but does not hold the majority in terms of viewpoint on this issue in my experience.\n"

If there had been separate bike lanes, I would not have broken my collar bone, been rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, had to wait in a crowded ER for hours for medical help and missed several days of work. All a great cost to the economy -- Ford's biggest concern.\nWhile cycling in Toronto I have been doored by parked cars, side swiped by car's passing me too close, spit on, called a cycling whore, told to get off the road coz I don't pay taxes and told to get on the sidewalk where I belong. (Note --  all the offenders were men between 18 and 40 years old  in vehicles, including a dump truck,  a city pick up, and a convertible where the drive had an open beer can in his cupholder.)\nSo aside from the great costs to the city and the province of tearing up infrastructure, the greater cost is borne by the cyclists and their families.\nIf I had been killed that day -- I was very fortunate to escape death -- I would have left behind a distraught husband and two young children. The fallout would have been much more costly to society and our precious economy that that of bike lanes.\n"

I have taken up cycling not only as a way to improve my health, but also to save me time and money. I recently purchased my home, strategically placed so that I can both \"Reduce Gridlock\" by not having to depend of a vehicle to conduct my day-to-day business and errands and to \"Save Time\". This proposal will now not only punish me for my decisions, but also put me at undue risk of injury.\nI live on the Danforth, an artery that this government want's to target specifically along with others that have been named. The Bloor-Danforth corridor is the single most sensible location of bicycle infrastructure as it cuts across the city in a continuous fashion east to west. While traffic gridlock is certainly an issue no one wants to see, this proposal IS NOT THE SOLUTION. We need to provide alternatives to individuals in cars. Removing these alternatives does nothing more than to promote the addition of new vehicles to the gridlock problem, all in the hope that vehicle operators save a handful of minutes.\nWith respect to the claim that bicycle lanes can go on \"side streets\", as a citizen of a neighbourhood on the Danforth, I would really like to know which side street can safely and effectively get individuals not operating a vehicle safely across sections of the Bloor-Danforth corridor (including the Bloor Viaduct, The bridge over Old Mill, and more). There simply is no alternative.\nFinally, I would like to comment the fact that while drivers desire to get out of their cars faster and cut through our neighbourhoods to do so, I actually have to live in this neighbourhood. Why are we catering our local infrastructure to citizens of the province who are simply stopping by, or cutting through? Toronto is not only a place for business and a weekend visit. People actually live here, and locals are better served by options that allow them to navigate their local areas safely.\nI implore you to reconsider this backwards proposal.\n"

You know what improves traffic flow better than \"just one more lane, bro\"? Proper mass transit. If you build out the LRT's and subway system people would be less dependant on personal vehicles and those of us that do enjoy driving can do so with fewer people who HAVE to drive out if necessity due to inadequate mass transit.\nI mean you have business coalitions tells you that their businesses are doing better since the bike lanes got brought in, you've got DECADES of research that proves induced demand is a very real thing, you've got a mayor that will fight this ridiculousness til the cows come home, and you've got actual experts in universities across the country saying this is a dumb idea. For God sakes. Stop pandering to your wealthy voter base and remember you *will* be removed for this kind of thing. Division politics is killing this country. Look at New Brunswick getting a liberal majority because instead of pandering, they actual ran with a strategy of \"this is our plan and how we'll achieve it.\"\nThis conservative administration got in due to Ontario apathy. 43% of the population is all that voted, and you're angering MASSIVE amounts of people with your display of not caring about anyone but your wealthy voter base. My lifelong conservative father already told me unless you pump billions into our healthcare, he'll never vote blue again after he spent 14 hours in the emergency room last month.

In other words, the Mayor and her policies ought to be respected out of democratic principles.\n2.\tProposal is not based on data\nThe proposal has not identified or provided any data that supports the idea that the removal of one lane of traffic in specific areas is directly correlated with increased congestion.\nThe City has stated that they are willing to share their data and studies with the province and I urge the province to make decisions based on actual data.\nThere is also no information on whether the province considered any alternative solutions. If such options were considered, there is no information on why they were not adopted.\n3.\tProposal doesn\u2019t consider the Ontario government\u2019s own Made-in-Ontario Environmental plan\nThe province has committed to \u201cImprove air quality in communities by creating unique solutions to their individual challenges\u201c in the Made-in-Ontario Environmental plan.\nThe proposal makes no reference to how this is considered.\nOn face value, encouraging people to continue driving, as opposed to having more attractive alternatives to transportation, seems contrary to the Government\u2019s own environmental plan. Further, given that this decision is unilateral without the City\u2019s input, it\u2019s difficult to see how the province is \u201cwork in partnership with municipalities\u201d.\n4.\tProposed bill creates unnecessary red tape\nThe proposed plan introduces another layer of approval where the Ministry of Transportation reviews municipal proposals. This provincial government was a strong proponent to reduce red tape and to speed up approval processes.\nIronically, the same government is proposing to increase red tape for a policy that has no data backing. This also signals a sign of distrust between the province and the municipalities. We should be working together and not against each other.\nOverall, if the proposal was based on data and was accomplished with good faith discussions with the municipalities, I would have had no concerns. However, as it stands this is clearly not the case.\nIn sum, I ask the province will retract or amend the bill so that Ministry of Transpiration can review the data that the City provides before a final decision is made.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support removing sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes. Removing the bike lanes would be a detrimental decision for several key reasons, including undermining safety, worsening circulation, and creating waste by dismantling recently installed infrastructure.\nFirst, safety is a paramount concern when discussing urban transportation. Bike lanes are designed to provide a safer space for cyclists, who are among the most vulnerable road users. Studies consistently show that protected bike lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents involving cyclists and motor vehicles. By removing these bike lanes, the city would be increasing the risk of collisions, thereby endangering the lives of cyclists and pedestrians alike. Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists would be forced to navigate through traffic, heightening their exposure to potential accidents. They may also choose to travel on sidewalks, endangering pedestrians. Moreover, the absence of bike lanes can create confusion among drivers, leading to dangerous situations. Prioritizing safety through infrastructure not only benefits cyclists but also contributes to a more secure environment for all road users, including pedestrians and motorists.\nSecond, improving the movement of all people is another critical argument against the removal of these bike lanes. Efficient urban mobility hinges on a balanced transportation system that accommodates various modes of travel, including cycling, walking, and driving. The presence of bike lanes encourages more people to cycle, alleviating congestion on public transit and roads. When cycling is made safer and more accessible, it promotes a shift toward sustainable modes of transportation, which can help reduce traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improve health. Furthermore, a well-integrated bike lane network supports local businesses by attracting customers who arrive by bike. It enhances the overall urban experience by creating a more vibrant and active streetscape. Thus, maintaining these bike lanes is essential for fostering a transportation ecosystem that supports all forms of mobility and contributes to a healthier city.\nLastly, it would be wasteful to remove the bike lanes, particularly given the investment and resources that have gone into their recent installation. These bike lanes were designed with considerable public input and funding, reflecting a commitment to modernizing Toronto\u2019s transportation infrastructure. Removing them not only undermines the time and effort spent in their planning and implementation but also sets a concerning precedent regarding future infrastructure investments. Taxpayer money should be utilized effectively, and dismantling existing bike lanes would squander public resources. Additionally, the removal process itself involves costs related to labour, materials, and logistics, further compounding the financial irresponsibility of such a decision.\nIn conclusion, removing sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes would compromise safety, undermine the movement of all people, and be an unnecessary waste of resources. Upholding and enhancing these bike lanes is essential for fostering a safer, more efficient, and sustainable urban environment in Toronto.\n"

Those who are brave enough to ride their bicycles on Bloor without a bike lane face injury or death from car drivers who are increasingly driving more aggressively, distracted, or tired.

        "comment": "This proposed bill will be absolutely disastrous. It will result in more deaths, will not accomplish its stated goals and is an irresponsible waste of taxpayer money, all in order to overturn local decisions in Toronto. Here is a detailed breakdown of all the ways in which this bill is a disaster:\n1. People will die. Bike lanes, even if they do slow down traffic (more on this later), provide cyclists with a safer option than cycling in the street. Making them harder to build or, God forbid, removing existing ones will result in more people dying or being severely injured. I cannot stress this enough. These are your constituents and you are proposing legislation that will see more human lives lost, all in the name of saving some minutes of someone's commute.\n2. It will not do what the government claims it will do. For one, the premise itself is dependent on the assumption that current cyclists will no longer feel safe enough to cycle, and will thus abandon their bikes. No one in their right mind thinks a cyclist taking the entire car lane will do less to slow down traffic than a separated bike lane. But even if cyclists do stop cycling, this will not help traffic, as many people will now choose to commute by car instead, even shorter distances where they might previously been happy to take their bikes. This means more cars on the road, which will cause more congestion, as cars are less space efficient than bikes. It has long been known by planners that the only way to reduce congestion is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Which brings us to:\n3. This is an incredibly irresponsible misuse of Ontario's tax money. Not only will the government add additional bureaucracy to what have so far been local decisions, all funded by tax payer money, they are also talking about using the tax payers' money to remove existing bike lanes, including ones that were recently completed. Not only does this make the initial money paid for the construction a complete waste, but why should taxpayers in Thunder Bay, Windsor, Ottawa or Sarnia (or any other place in the province, but you get the gist), have their money wasted to overturn local decisions in Toronto, simply because the premier live there? This proposed bill is spitting in the face of all Ontario taxpayers who live outside of the GTA, as well as anyone who voted for the OPC because they wanted a small government or fiscal responsibility. Add to that the increased strain on our healthcare system due to increases in injuries from collisions. All in all, just a baffling mismanagement of public funds.\n4. It will be disastrous for our ability to combat climate change, as people will have to go back to using their automobiles more.\nLastly I want to address a few more talking points I have seen from the government, or others that have an irrational hatred of bikes and cyclists, that have been used to justify this decision:\nThe idea of using side streets instead of main roads for bikes has been proposed. First of all, this may not be feasible at all. In Toronto, there are no good side street alternatives to Bloor/Danforth for an  east/west going route across the city. Cyclists would need to take a mismatched route of different streets that would significantly increase their commute times. But aside from this, people live on and travel to locations on major streets. Why should they not have the choice to do so, safely, on a bike?\nSome people like to point out that not everyone can bike. This is obviously true, but also not everyone can drive, and yet we still have roads. Bike lanes are not forcing anyone to bike, it's just providing a more choices for people with different individual needs and preferences.\nI have heard it said that bike lanes aren't even being used. Personally, I see plenty of use on the more recent bike lanes that are built to a higher standard, like the ones on College and on University. But generally speaking, we need to expand the network in order to see more usage. Many people don't want to bike if they know that they would end up having to enter a car lane for a big part of their commute. A lot of peole also don't feel safe in lanes that are only made of paing that cars can swerve into. Bike usage in the city has also increased a lot over the last few years as our bike lane network has grow. All this is a case for building more bike lanes, not fewer.\nIn conclusion; this proposed legislation will see more people die, will waste thr taxpayers' money and will not accomplish what it set out to do. I sincerely implore the Ontario government to reconsider this plan, as it will be an absolute disaster, and slap in the face of your constituents.\n"

Cyclists will continue to use Yonge, Bloor, and University to get to the places they need to go because our jobs, activities, schools and universities, and stores are all located along these streets. Cyclists will still use these roads, with or without bike lanes, as they are the most convenient way for people to get places. These streets have connections to transit, allowing us to link up with Line 1 or Line 2 of the TTC, connect to the Go Trains, and have access to other main thoroughfares to get to places throughout the city of Toronto. No where in the legislation does it say cyclists cannot use Bloor, Yonge, or University. So cyclists will continue to use these routes, with or without bike lanes. If the Ford led government does take these bike lanes out, traffic will get even worse for motor vehicle drivers because cyclists will continue to use these routes no matter what. In order to keep traffic going, there should be further investment into transit, speeding up construction projects, and keeping bike lanes where they are. The Province will only make more traffic while trying to rip out the lanes to put a car lane back in, impacting traffic more. This legislation is partisan wedge issue, a waste of time, and simply extreme over reach by the Provincial government.\n"
