        "comment": "I think the removal of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes is a waste of tax payer dollars. I live in the Toronto downtown core, and bike every time to work, and dedicated bike lanes are how I do so safely and quickly. By removing them you are just forcing more public transit and car driving and less safe bike travel. This just feels like Doug Ford stoking the flames of a culture war, and I think it is misguided.\n"

        "comment": "\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal favors motor vehicle users and downplays the significance of pedestrians and cyclists by presenting the need for enhanced provincial control over bicycle lane allocation and removal solely as a consequence of traffic lane reduction. Dedicated bike lane infrastructure encourages pedestrians and cyclists to decelerate and enter establishments, potentially enhancing the local economy through increased foot traffic. It also subtly encourages drivers to slow down due to the reduced number of lanes and their narrower appearance.\nRemoving existing bike lanes incurs additional financial burdens on taxpayers that should be redirected to projects aimed at reducing vehicle traffic, such as the actual arrival of the Eglinton LRT, Ontario Line, and the potential expansion of trains and transit options that encourage individuals from out of town to leave their vehicles in the suburbs. Constructing additional roads solely for vehicles only invites more vehicles, as evidenced in Texas, where adding more lanes exacerbated driving times for most drivers.\nIn my understanding of our three levels of government, all of them are subject to voting. Those who voted for the City of Toronto would expect the City of Toronto to make its own decisions regarding road design and lane prioritization. The system is designed to ensure that the residents of the City of Toronto have an opportunity to be heard and express their opinions through the council process. The council process should be respected and adhered to in order to make decisions on behalf of Toronto residents. Provincial members overriding this process instead of partnering under the leadership of the Toronto City Council would constitute a violation of the democratic process and systems. We are expected to work with local actors and civil society organizations to develop meaningful and diverse partnerships with state and non-state actors, including civil society organizations, academics, and the private sector. This framed approach does not seem to uphold this approach on the municipal level.\nThis bill needs to reframing to pivot the main audience of roads to serve in this ranked order pedestrians, cyclists, then motor vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Hi I live in Etobicoke and I'm very disappointed with this legislation as a young person (21yo) cars are extremely expensive, cost of a vehicle, insurance, fuel, maintenance. Because of this I rely on other transit to get myself around, walking, TTC, and sometimes biking. (I do drive for work btw)\nThe removal of bike lanes is only going to increase traffic and decrees safety for everyone including drivers and will most likely get people killed.\nThe new hurdles to get new bike lanes approved and built will only increase costs and add bureaucracy unnecessarily.\nToronto is not a perfect grid, side streets don't follow main roads at all. It's ridiculous to put bike lanes on side streets as a replacement for bike lanes on main roads. Bloor and Dundas (Dundas West Station) for example there's a big railway that only main roads cross. How am I gonna bike that with no bike lanes on main roads????\nIn downtown Toronto biking is the fastest way to get around. Why wouldn't you make the fastest mode of transit safe and by doing so reduce congestion by making biking more appealing and therefore reducing the number of vehicles on the roads.\nOn August 24th a 26yo female was struck on Burnhamthorpe Road close to where I live in Etobicoke, she died a week later in hospital, there are no bike lanes on Burnhamthorpe Road. I'm scared of that happening to me, now that the only protection bike lanes are going to be removed if this legislation passes.\nMany new buildings downtown are being built with only a few car parking spots but tens or hundreds of bike parking spots because of the growing network of bike lanes. Why would you remove the bike lanes when they're embraced by the people that actually live and want to live in the city?\nThese bike lanes have taken many years of study and approval after approval to be built. Ripping them up because of a rushed 3 week study and bad vibes is incredibly irresponsible and just wrong.\nRipping out bike lanes that were just installed is an incredible waste of money that could be used to finish the Eglington crosstown, a project that would actually meaningfully reduce congestion. Not to mention the Ontario Line which when completed will bring relief to Line 1, Young st, DVP, Queen st ect..\nMy sister was yelled at by a driver last week, she was riding her bike home from work but had to use the sidewalk as there are no bike lanes. At an intersection a driver stopped way to late so she had to slam on the brakes to avoid a collision, the driver yelled \"RIDE ON THE ROAD\" at her. Needles to say she was shaken up but that's what happens when you don't have bike lanes. Our hope of it being safe to ride our bikes in Etobicoke is now tarnished if this legislation goes through. :(\nPlease don't pass this terrible legislation.\n"

Motorists can park on side streets, can't they?\nSo much time, effort and money has gone into our city's bike infrastructure and this backwards bill puts lives at stake so motorists can trick themselves into thinking their commutes will be faster.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, I will gladly take up a whole lane of traffic daily on Bloor Street at my leisure pace. And encourage all cyclists to do the same for their safety.  Let's see how much that speeds up motor traffic if cars cannot get by me and anybody else on a bike.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing infrastructure that encourages a non-polluting form of transit while keeping people safe is the kind of wasteful backwards spending I have come to expect from the Ford government. Does this government really think that by eliminating bike lanes cyclists will simply disappear? Cyclists will now either occupy an entire lane or will be in a vehicle further contributing to traffic. Eliminating bike lanes does not eliminate the need to commute. All this does is make conditions less safe for Ontarians who choose to bike.\nFor a government that wants to cut red tape, trying to dictate what municipalities do with their own road infrastructure is hypocritical. Furthermore, wasting taxpayer dollars to remove already built infrastructure is scandalous. This bill is a waste of government resources, an over reach by the provincial government, and an objectively unsafe piece of legislation.\n"

        "comment": "As a former P. Eng with international experience in transportation issues, I find it fascinating that to my knowledge the Ontario government is the only one in the world, who is proposing to reduce congestion by encouraging individuals who have abandoned use of automobiles in the city, to return and get back into private cars and thus increase the number of vehicles on the roads.\nCities around the world where populations and density grow from year to year, have long ago realized that the only way to ease existing gridlock is to limit the number of cars and create alternative infrastructure that includes public transport and lanes for bicycles, scoters and small sized electric transportation vehicles.\nTo me the proposal appears to be not a solution to solve traffic congestion but rather a political maneuver to appeal to a segment of a population who believes that only private automobiles should have a use of public roads.\nThough this may be a successful gambit in the short term for the government, the citizens of Ontario will suffer the consequences. All one needs to do is to look at short sighted decisions made by previous Ontario governments who cancelled the Eglinton subway line in 1995 and spent money to refill the sites where work already started, the decision of selling Highway 407 and the decision of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford to cancel the \u2018shovel in the ground ready' light rail projects in Toronto in 2010.\nIf this proposal does become law the long-term legacy will be the same as the legacy of cancelling the projects above and the losers will be all of us who live in this province. Of course, when it comes to politics that likely makes no difference.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to Bill 212. It's incredibly disheartening to see the Provincial Government try to move Toronto backwards in regards to bike infrastructure. I remember biking everywhere as a child when there was less traffic and now seeing the city so unsafe that families can't comfortably allow their kids to bike to school or their friends houses is sad. Why do people who commute by car get so much priority over everyone else? Many people, myself included, cannot drive for medical reasons, or simply have no desire to drive. Why should we all be forced to take other less convenient and more expensive means to get to school or work or stores just to give cars one more lane, which has been proven over and over to not actually fix traffic congestion longterm? The bike lanes not only must stay, they must be improved and expanded to create a cohesive network across Toronto like many other cities around the world are doing. There are no side streets that would effectively replace all current and planned bike lanes, and there is a growing demand for safe, protected bike lanes. The more bike lanes there are, and the longer they are, the more people will bike--as seen in other cities. Bill 212 is Provincial overreach into a municipal topic that would drag Toronto even further away from modernity. The Provincial Government should focus on creating more affordable housing rather than overstepping into removing bike lane infrastructure that is fundamentally designed to keep Toronto residents safe.\n"

        "comment": "I am a bike commuter and I ride my bike from Burlington to Hamilton and back to go to work 3 times a week, all year round. Protected bike lanes and bike lanes are essential to keeping me away from car and truck traffic and whenever I get forced into a regular traffic lane I make every driver more frustrated. This frustration often leads to cars passing me and swerving dangerously into other lanes or oncoming traffic as I can\u2019t go as fast as of vehicles. On several occasions this frustration from drivers can lead to swerving very close to me out of what seems to be  anger at my speed and the fact that I slow traffic. Removing bike lanes will not only cause more car traffic to slow down, but people will likely become more likely to be hit by vehicles and more cyclist deaths. Please listen to actual evidence when making decisions about traffic and urban planning and not just focus on car centric rhetoric.\n"

Would we remove the Eglinton cross town because it creates \"traffic\" on Eglinton?\n3) Induced demand means the better the bike infrastructure the more people that would bike. I have literally seen bike traffic jams on Bloor because the lanes are soo popular and it's no wonder that this is the oldest part of the infrastructure.\n4) I am a car commuter but my wife and children bike often across Bloor and down to university to go to the hospitals there.

The provincial government has no right to dictate the way cities decide to promote cycling within their cities and should focus more on initiatives that would actually reduce congestion, such as improving public transit and by installing\u00a0HOV lanes on the Ontario Provincial Highway Network, where they actually have jurisdiction. \u00a0Too many single occupancy vehicles is the cause of congestion;  perhaps the useful and gridlock reducing HOV lanes that were installed for the\u00a0Pan-am\u00a0games (and then removed) should be reinstalled!\nMunicipal expertise is best positioned to make decisions on bike lanes and local transportation planning;  these proposed changes are an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Municipalities know their streets and traffic patterns the best, not the Province!\u00a0The City of Peterborough\u2019s new Cycling Master Plan was developed with extensive community consultation and keen attention to best practices, which are creating safe, connected and accessible routes for travelling by bicycle around the city.\nThe rationale for implementing this legislation is flawed. More people on bikes creates more livable and healthier  communities that are economically and environmentally sustainable.\nI urge you not to propose this proposed legislation!\nSincerely,\nEmily\nPeterborough, ON\n"

Whether it is cost, environmental concerns, convenience, exercise, or a combination, people should have access to protected bike lanes that take them where they want to go.\nHaving protected bike lanes also helps get more people out on to their bikes, which means less people in cars. Which helps to reduce traffic.\nProtected bike lanes have also been shown to increase sales at businesses along the route. Adding more commerce to our recovering in person stores.\nPlease reconsider this approach that risks the lives of many, and is unlikely to make a major change to most traffic patterns.\n"
