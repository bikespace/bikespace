        "comment": "Hello,\nThe proposal outlined in Bill 212 is not well thought through as to the long-term impacts which will be caused by implementation of its elements. It disturbs me that with so many well-educated specialists in the fields that this bill covers, environment, city planning, road safety, it appears the findings of these experts has not been listened to.\nThe Carolinian Zone in Southern Ontario is a hotspot for biodiversity, with more species of rare plants and animals than anywhere else in Canada. Why is this Provincial Government so set on ignoring the irreparable damage that can be done by paving over habitats found nowhere else in Canada without even giving an environmental assessment the opportunity to redirect a destructive path?\nVision Zero and the development of city streets, and signaling systems to keep them moving, have been in the works for years and are data-driven and based on international best practices. Failure to recognize the actual data by this Provincial Government is causing them to send out misinformation to the citizens of the province on the impacts that bike lanes are having on Emergency Management Services' response times. Such a campaign based on nonfactual information is not something that serves the public well. Traffic in a growing city expands. Cars are being driven more with post pandemic back-to-office mandates. Simply put, more cars means more gridlock. The presence of bike lanes is not having the significant impact that this Provincial Government blames on them when the data across the city is examined.  There are pockets, during periods of high volume, where gridlock occurs on lanes with dedicated bike lanes, however the high volume and traffic slow down occurs on similar streets without bike lanes. Car volume and not bike lanes is the culprit.\nRemoving bike lanes will only mean commuters using both kinds of vehicles, cars and bicycles, will be sharing the same lanes without consideration for the safety of the more vulnerable. It is a fact that with more or wider lanes cars go faster, often beyond posted speed limits. Going faster not only reduces reaction times but also creates more deadly results when pedestrians or cyclists are hit. So far in 2024, six cyclists and 18 pedestrians have been killed on Toronto streets by cars or trucks. How many more deaths by car is this Provincial Government willing to accept to allow car drivers to potentially go faster. What will they say when deaths rise and there is still gridlock on Toronto streets and $75 million dollars of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted because the real facts weren't listened to? The Premier needs to start checking his facts, reading the actual data and not just listen to the complaining voices of a handful of privileged motorists who likewise haven't checked the facts.\nI drive, but only when it makes sense. With the transit system in the city supporting Bloor, Yonge and University routes, more use of these options should be promoted, not making room for more cars on these routes. Why can't Toronto and Ontario be world class? Regressive actions like Bill 212 which focus on the wrong things, that's why.\n"

        "comment": "Commercial driver here with 20+ years on the road. Tearing up bike lanes is not just a waste of $, it\u2019s not going to help. It\u2019ll put cyclists back into live traffic lanes and what do you plan to do with parked cars? On main streets and side streets unless you plan to ban parking all those bikes will slow down traffic. Drivers today are either not paying full attention to the road or convinced the rules of the road do not apply to them. If you had taken the time to research this from any perspective, you\u2019d know it is a terrible and dangerous idea.\n"

        "comment": "This bill being passed just shows that our leadership is completely out of touch with the needs of its society and that they don\u2019t prioritize our wellbeing and standard of living at all. Bike lanes are crucial as one of the only reliable means of transit. Encouraging more cars on the street will not solve the traffic problem creating more delays, frustration and mental health issues. The current public transit system is undergoing improvements which I\u2019m very supportive of but it is not enough to provide reliable and timely traffic.\nCurrently cycling is one of the only ways to reliably get around the city and removing the bike lanes will increase dangers.\nIn my opinion the bike lanes help traffic flow better if not cyclists like me will end up blocking cars in the car lane and slow them down.\nOne thing I love about Toronto is the ability to use cycling as a mode of transit throughout all seasons and the removal of these bike lanes will hinder my ability to do that and also reduce safety.\nNo want wants the government to spend so much money to make the city more inaccessible, unsafe and frustrating to live in. This is honestly a ridiculous bill and I can\u2019t believe that it is even being discussed.\n"

        "comment": "Ford needs to stay in his lane - what does this have to do with running Ontario? Why is he so focused on the City of Toronto?\nPlease leave municipal affairs to the people we elected to cover the city. Bike lanes reduce gridlock, and make for a cleaner, more livable city. We should be working to reduce cars, not give them more space.\n"

        "comment": "Dedicated bike lanes enhance the safety of commuters who do not drive motorvehicles - not everyone who needs to go somewhere in Toronto necessarily drives a car. Many cannot afford one, or they are students who are too young to drive independently. Bikes are a comparatively more affordable form of transportation, accessible to people across socio-economic classes, and ages. The province needs to consider how bike lanes contribute to the safety of these people too, every day.\nSingle-passenger vehicles play a significant role in traffic congestion, and by making cycling safer and more convenient for commuters, we can help reduce the number of single-passenger vehicles on the roads. Research proves that when roads are widened, drivers make more trips, make longer trips, and choose the car more frequently. The cycle of traffic continues, despite the increase in roadway capacity. Rather than encourage more drivers, a better strategy would be to create safer, more convenient alternatives for people.\nThere is also extensive evidence to suggest that the design of our built environment is in fact a significant contributor to community health. By designing environments that are conducive to cycling and walking, we help more people fold physical activity into their daily routines. This not only eases traffic congestion, but it provides us with the opportunity to also foster our community's health and wellbeing.\nThis proposal, being put forward by the province is unlikely to reduce traffic congestion over the long term, and will have a net negative impact on community health and safety. It does not appear to be grounded in any real, documented urban planning best practices. It is a misleading and costly proposal designed to build political populism for the current provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly disagree with this Bill, speaking as someone who has lived in both larger cities (Hamilton) and smaller cities. (Welland, Beamsville) Bike lanes allow people to utilize a healthy alternative mode of transportation in a safe manner.\nI have seen bike lanes thrive in these cities and the continued use of these will reduce the amount of cars on the road, likely contributing more to eliminating gridlock in the first place. In addition, the elimination of the bike lanes will cost several million dollars, money that is almost certainly better used on struggling areas such as housing and healthcare.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this retrograde proposed regulation for the following reasons:\n1.\tRequiring municipalities to get provincial approval for bike lanes in some cases is an overreach of provincial power and increases the bureaucracy and red tape to build municipal infrastructure.\n2.\tNo evidence is provided to support the assertion that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion for drivers. It may do so for a short time, but soon those roads will clog with cars, and we will be back to congested roads but without bike lanes.\n3.\tThis proposed regulation blames cyclists for a car problem. Are cyclists not worthy of safe and efficient transportation infrastructure, or are they supposed to suck it up, get a car and go sit in traffic?\n4.\tIt is a waste of taxpayer\u2019s money to remove new and useful municipal cycling transportation infrastructure.\n5.\tThis proposed regulation embodies status quo bias; that our society should continue to be structured to best support drivers. This will continue accelerating sprawl and the development of unsustainable cities that will drain their financial resources. It would be more effective to analyze how to move people efficiently and invest in infrastructure that enables this.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this bill! Why does Ontario have such a specific say in the city planning of Toronto? Bloor St is not bringing broadbrand to the north. Safer bike lanes in cities reduce emissions by allowing commuters to feel safe enough to use bikes to get around - which reduces car traffic, but only if you leave the lanes there long enough for citizens to learn to use them! Toronto is a city that people live in, not an inconvenience sitting between industries. If you want to support businesses, support workers getting to work. Stopping trying to rip up completed infrastructure projects because you don't think the right kind of people are using them.\n"

        "comment": "Do not remove bike lanes. We know you are doing this as a political ploy to win votes from suburban commuters, and it's completely unethical. If you want specific comments for why this should not happen:\n1. Bike lanes save lives. More cyclists will die than the number that are already killed on our dangerous car-centred streets every year. Do you hear that? People will die. What if it were a person you knew and loved?\n2. This is extreme overreach by the province, which should not steal jurisdiction from the City for its petty political games.\n3. This will cost taxpayers. We paid for the bike lanes to be added - as a cyclist, I felt this was a great use of my money. Now you're saying that you will rip them out, at an added cost to taxpayers. Why are we paying twice for your ego project? Aren't you supposed to be \"stopping the gravy train\"? I thought that was the Ford Family motto.\n4. The City and all people everywhere have a responsibility to reduce our carbon emissions. This will add to carbon emissions as cyclists get into cars instead.\n5. If you remove safe biking, there will be more people getting into cars. If people think that there will be less congestion, they will drive on those streets. What does this do? It adds congestion. Where will you be? No further ahead.\nThis is wrong and you know it, and are revelling in upsetting Torontonians. Why be in politics if you just hate a huge percentage of the people you \"rule over\"?\n"

        "comment": "I live just off Yonge street between Crescent and St Clair. I have mobility issues, so walking or biking is not an option for me. I have to drive. The current situation is ridiculous. It sometimes takes as long as 20 -30 minutes to go 8 blocks because of the bike lanes which are further exacerbated by patio dining. And talk about ugly! The city has taken a once vibrant street and turned it into an ugly joke. And what on earth is the purpose of the raised platform that takes up a lane at the north east corner of Yonge and Macpherson?\nWhile in principle I do not agree with the province interfering in city affairs, I think in the situation it is justified. The city has totally bowed to the demands of the bike lobbyists. Yes there is a need for bike lanes but NOT on Toronto\u2019s busiest streets.\n"

Tearing the bike lanes up is a waste of tax payers' money, not to mention a waste of all the money (and time) spent on bike lane planning. Bike lanes do not create vehicular congestion - people in cars create congestion. Safe bike lanes allow more people to bike thus less cars on the street. Do we not want Toronto to be a leader in sustainable transportation methods?\n"

Reversing this municipal decision is not only a power overreach, it is a waste of time and money, and it disregards the best interests of the municipality. These bike lanes are not only used by commuters, but by curriers and delivery persons that the city relies on for daily transport of goods and food. Getting rid of these bike lanes will make the city less safe to navigate by bike. Any change that makes the city less accessible for bicycles will put more cars on the road and worsen congestion.\n"
