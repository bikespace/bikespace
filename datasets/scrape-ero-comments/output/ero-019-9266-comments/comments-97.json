The government should be focusing on encouraging alternative modes of transportation that are environmentally friendly and good for the health of its citizens.\nI do not support this bill and believe strongly that it should not be passed into law.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of making Toronto safe for biking around the city. The traffic congestion is only getting worse in the city, removing bike lanes will not make it better, we need to give people more options for commuting. Instead of wasting money removing the bikes lanes, use the money to fix our education and health care system. The people of Toronto want the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to r province needs to attack Toronto\u2019s or Ontario\u2019s bike lanes. There is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road).  Focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\n"

        "comment": "2 problems: first is people not within Toronto are attempting to legislate the lives of people well outside their riding, second is this will make 0 difference when the 401 is in gridlock. Bikes aren't holding up cars. Cars are holding up cars. Create cleaner, cheaper and more frequent public transit rides into the city. It's that simple.\n"

        "comment": "Downtown Toronto is growing rapidly with new condos and office buildings being built on nearly every street in the downtown core. However, it's only in its intensity that this development is unique to the city's core. Densification is a feature of the entire landscape.\nAs the population grows it's critical that the transportation capacity of the city meets this growth. This means transportation for the tens of thousands of people moving into new developments in the downtown core who need to be able to get around within the city center, and this also means transportation infrastructure for those commuting into the cities.\nWe simply cannot continue to expand streets, even if this was the best method, there isn't enough physical room. We need alternative forms of transportation, and we need more efficient forms of transportation.\nFor this reason, bike lanes are essential infrastructure for the city as it grows. Bike lanes move people more efficiently as bikes take up much less space, and there is much more room to add new bike infrastructure than there is room to add lanes for cars. While this happens, it should be expected that the need to move more people will result in car lanes that are near capacity being turned into bike lanes. The very fact that this car lane is being turned into a bike lane is a symptom of the fact that this corridor is one which should be available to more people to move.\nThe proposed legislation is incongruent with the needs of a growing and densifying city to allow for the movement of its people. By preventing new bike lanes in the cases where it requires the removal of a car lane, this legislation will prevent the new and more efficient transportations options that I have so far demonstrated are necessary. The future this legislation is creating for Toronto is one in which congestion and traffic are worse, the population has less access to safe and active transportation, and one where Toronto is markedly moving backwards in terms of environmentally sustainable forms of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "These decisions are not based on research or best practices. Bike lanes have been shown to decrease speeds on roads, making them safer for not only cyclists, but also pedestrians. And with fewer cars on the road, emissions are reduced, helping in the fight against climate change. Adding more car lanes does not help congestion.The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists should be able to have safe access to roads that they travel on, including streets where car lanes have been removed. Keeping bike lanes on main thoroughfares slows the streets down, making it safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and even vehicle drivers.\nFurthermore, removing lanes from main thoroughfares discourages cycling as a transportation option, which carries negative implications for not just road safety, but in terms of opportunities to improve health.\n"

        "comment": "The key to reducing congestion is to reduce the number of cars on the road. We can do this by incentivizing people to walk, bike, or take public transit. Furthermore, having people who engage in active transportation results in better health outcomes, and is better for the environment. Rather than eliminate bike lanes and increase road capacity for cars, our tax money should be used to promote and facilitate active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am very much against this legislation. This will take away the ability of countless municipalities to implement meaningful planning decisions that promotes pedestrian and cycling thoroughfares which make our cities more interesting. Furthermore there is no evidence that reducing bike lanes improves congestion and traffic, in fact studies show it leads to more cars on the roads.\nBike lanes, particularly those in Toronto on Bloor street SAVE lives. Numerous cyclists have been killed this year on Bloor and Avenue where bike lanes were blocked or non existent along stretches of the road. Taking away bike lanes will put more cyclists on the road with cars rather than giving them a dedicated (and protected) lane. I don\u2019t think the Ford government wants to be remembered for more deaths on the road, and believe me that is exactly how this administration will be remembered for enacting such legislation.\nI ask that before jumping to such an extreme overreach of provincial power, rather look at enacting legislation that examines the impact of improving traffic signalling in Toronto, increasing rush hour times that prevent parking on major thoroughfares (thus freeing up additional lanes), create efforts to coordinate construction efforts on major thoroughfares across toronto and finally put additional funding toward improving the TTC (and maybe start by eliminating the outdated late start times for the subway on Sundays).\nThere are many creative ways we can improve congestion in our biggest cities, attacking cyclists is not the way forward.\n"

Putting up barriers to keep people from commuting/travelling safely by bicycle, will be bad for traffic (more cars), bad for the environment, bad for the health and wellness of the populace, bad for people who cannot afford to drive, and bad overall for the people of Ontario.\n"
