        "comment": "As if a party that's supposed to represent \"small government\" meddling in city planning decisions wasn't bad enough....\nBill 212 fails to understand the difference between a street and a road. A street is an end destination in an urban environment where business takes place and community is built. The goal of building a street is to provide a common-space platform for the facets that make up a community to be located. A good street should have:\n- A speed limit of 40km/h or less dictated by more than just speed limit signs. A street should have the appropriate traffic calming features that make traveling over 40km/h feel difficult and uncomfortable.\n- A medium to high density of mixed-use buildings; small businesses, residential buildings, religious institutions, schools, libraries, community centers, etc...\n- The appropriate traffic modal filters to discourage motor vehicle traffic from using the street (start or end destination) as a road (thoroughfare)\n- Bicycle lanes, if required, can be installed directly next to the street or might not be needed if vehicular speeds are slow enough and traffic volumes are low enough.\nThis is in contrast to a road whose purpose is not to be an end-destination but rather an efficient link between places. A good road design therefore should have:\n- Minimal to no entrances to private/public buildings - these should be located on streets instead. A good road should minimize the number of places of potential traffic conflicts.\n- \"Forgiving design features\" such as wider lanes, gentle curves, and clear-zones protected by shoulder rumble strips to make driving at higher speeds safer.\n- Signalized intersections with protected turn signals and turning lanes\n- Bicycle paths should be separated from the higher speed traffic on the road\nBill 212 unfortunately makes no acknowledgement of the differences between streets and roads and presumes everything to be a \"stroad\" - a combination of a street and a road which does neither a good job of fulfilling the goals of a street nor of those of a road. Stroads:\n- Are intended to carry high volumes of motor vehicle traffic at relatively high (instantaneous) speeds\n- And provide a platform for the places that make up a community to be located.\nUnfortunately:\n- The high speed and high volume traffic on a stroad combined with the large number of entry and exit points makes the stroad dangerous - especially for those outside of a motor vehicle\n- As many feel unsafe and uncomfortable walking or cycling along a stroad, large parking lots need to be built for the businesses located along a stroad as arriving there by car is the only viable and comfortable option for a large majority of people. The large parking lots do not provide employment opportunities and only pay a fraction of the property tax that a building located on that land would. The large asphalt surface also leads to draining and flooding problems.\n- While the instantaneous speed on a stroad might be fast, due to the constant stop-and-go traffic of waiting at many intersections while driving along a stroad, the average speed can be quite slow thus the stroad does not achieve the design goal of a road - that is an efficient link between start and end destinations.\nNow, when looking at Yonge Street, Bloor Street, and University Avenue we can see how over the past few years, what once were stroads, have now been turned into streets. The protected bike lanes on these streets make cycling much safer and thus the volume of bicycles on these streets have increased year after year. Small businesses in Toronto's BIAs located along these streets (such as the Bloor Street Annex) have embraced the bike lanes as it has increased the number of people who are likely to shop at these businesses since bicycles can easily stop and park without requiring a large amount of space. Even those who do not cycle can still appreciate the protected cycle tracks as the narrowing of the street and the slowing down of the motor vehicle traffic makes for a much more pleasant experience when walking or enjoying a cafeTO patio.\nFurthermore, Bill 212 does not provide a map of the proposed relocations of the current bike routes if the cycle tracks on Bloor, Yonge, and University were to be removed. Since the city of Toronto is divided by - highways, railroads, large rivers and valleys, routing cyclists along \"secondary roads and streets\" is not a viable option. For example, I recently made a bike trip from North York to Rouge Beach in Scarborough. The shortest route would be along Sheppard Avenue and down Port Union Road for a total of about 22 km but as I wanted to avoid cycling on dangerous stroads as much as possible, my trip, deviating along secondary streets and roads was 29km - a 31% increase in distance.\nThe city of Toronto is a large employment center and many people who work in Toronto don't live in Toronto. The Ontario government should focus on:\n- Helping the cities and towns surrounding Toronto transform from being commuter towns to being their own cities capable of providing jobs for many of their residents.\n- Building efficient rail transportation into Toronto (and not just the downtown) to provide better alternatives to driving. The construction chaos of the 14 year long Eglinton LRT project needs to be sorted out and the Sheppard subway line should be extended from Port Union GO in the east to Pearson Airport in the west thus providing an efficient route for commuters on the Lakeshore East GO Train line to access North Scarborough, North York, and North Etobicoke. A light rail line similar to the one I have proposed was proposed in the 1980s under the Bill Davis government but was cancelled - I can only imagine how much less traffic there would be on Highway 401 if the project had been built.\nThere is a geometric limit to how many motor vehicles can fit into a city and therefore increasing the radius of the suburbia that surrounds Toronto will only make the problem worse - not better. Even with proper road design, bring more motor vehicles into the city along roads will eventually result in them flowing out into streets and causing more gridlock and wasting more time - something that this bill was supposed to eliminate.\nTherefore, to effectively reduce gridlock and save peoples' time we must:\n- Make cycling and walking safe and viable options for short to medium distanced trips. This includes keeping our current bike lanes and building new ones that are connected to the current ones thus building a network where complete trips can be made end-to-end without anyone ever being put in danger.\n- Fix our current transit system and build new passenger rail lines to provide viable alternatives to driving for longer distance trips.\n- Building more mixed-use neighborhoods where residents can live close to where they work, shop, etc... so as to avoid exceeding the capacity of arterial roads as everyone tries to get to the same place.\n- Realize that efficient roads and productive streets have conflicting goals.\nAs all evidence shows that Bill 212 will only endanger people's lives and well being, make traffic worse, hurt small businesses, and waste taxpayers hard-earned money, I stand in complete opposition of Bill 212.\nI live in a riding which has an MPP from the Ontario PC party and have voted for the Ontario PC party in the past but due to the damage that this bill will cause, if passed, to people's lives and the city I call home, I can no longer, in good conscience, vote for the Ontario PC party.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed legislation for several reasons.  1. As a cyclist, it will endanger my life and those of other cyclists. People won\u2019t stop biking, they\u2019ll just have to compete with cars for the same space where a bike lane used to be and cars will, presumably, still have to maintain a lawful one metre distance from bikes. All this law will do is create chaos and expose cyclists to increase risk of death and motorists to increased risk of hitting cyclists - traumatic for all parties without reducing commute times (as cars would be behind slower moving bikes now instead of beside them in their own lanes) 2. Bike lanes reduce traffic by taking cars off the road. As the city continues to grow and to densify, traffic will continue to worsen, especially if policy continues to favour cars. The province should be encouraging biking by making it safer, not more dangerous. This will take cars off the road as more people will choose biking over driving, which will improve traffic flow. 3. Local decisions should be made locally. The Province should respect local decision making processes - it\u2019s anti democratic to micro manage from Queen\u2019s Park - Ontarians did not give this government a mandate to meddle with local bike lanes. 4. This policy is not even evidence based - you can sail up University Avenue at any time of day in a car - traffic is a non problem on University - it\u2019s a vital artery for north south bike routes and the road is big enough for everyone. 5. Ripping out already installed bike lanes is a giant waste of public money for zero demonstrated, evidence based gain. It\u2019s emotion based, ideological decision making and an irresponsible use of all our money. This proposed legislation is shameful populist politicking that will cost citizens their lives.\n"

        "comment": "To the Environmental Registry of Ontario,\nAs a practicing Registered Professional Planner with almost two decades of urban and rural planning experience in both local and provincial government, I am writing to express my deep concern about the framework proposed in Bill 212. This legislation conflicts with the Provincial Planning Statement (PPS), 2024, which was authored by the Government of Ontario and sets out clear priorities for sustainable urban development, active transportation, and climate resilience.\nIn addition to my professional expertise, I am also an avid cyclist who regularly uses bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto for commuting to work, for exercise, and for shopping at local businesses. Bike lanes are critical infrastructure that keeps cyclists like me safe and ensures I can return home to my family at the end of the day. Cycling is not only the fastest way to navigate Toronto\u2019s busy streets but also allows me to rely less on a vehicle for transportation. Bike lanes protect lives, prevent accidents, and provide a safer alternative for those choosing active modes of travel, as is encouraged by the Province's own Provincial Planning Statement.\nI am deeply saddened by the prospect of the removal of key bike lanes in Toronto, including those on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, as part of this bill. These bike lanes represent not only the significant investments made in cycling infrastructure but also the collective effort to foster a safer, more sustainable transportation network for the city. The removal of such infrastructure would be a step backward in Toronto\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve urban mobility, reduce congestion, and encourage the use of sustainable transportation options.\nThe PPS, 2024, prioritizes multi-modal transportation systems and active transportation infrastructure as essential components of compact, efficient, and livable urban communities. Policies under Section 1.6 emphasize the importance of reducing reliance on private automobiles and creating integrated networks that support cycling and walking. Many bike lanes currently slated for removal in Toronto\u2014such as those on major arterial roads like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue\u2014are located within Major Transit Station Areas and other high-density urban corridors. These are precisely the areas where cycling infrastructure is most effective in reducing congestion, improving safety, and encouraging shifts toward sustainable mobility by integrating active transportation with transit-oriented development.\nSection 2.4.2.6 of the PPS, 2024, further emphasizes the need to plan Major Transit Station Areas to be transit-supportive and to achieve multimodal access to stations. This includes providing infrastructure that accommodates a range of mobility needs, such as bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and secure bicycle parking, where feasible. The removal of bike lanes from key areas in Toronto undermines these objectives and detracts from efforts to improve integration between transit and active transportation. As our urban centers continue to grow, prioritizing bike lanes as a key component of multimodal networks is essential to meeting the mobility needs of residents and ensuring the success of transit-oriented development.\nBill 212 undermines this framework by enabling the removal of critical bike lanes and centralizing decision-making away from municipalities, which have the local knowledge and expertise to make decisions that best suit their communities. This increased provincial interference in municipal planning disregards the importance of local autonomy in shaping urban mobility solutions. Municipalities have long been responsible for the planning and implementation of transportation infrastructure, as they are closest to the residents and understand the specific needs of their communities.\nThe Province's overreach in this regard weakens the ability of municipalities to manage their own transportation networks effectively and adapt to local circumstances. Furthermore, these actions not only disregard the significant public investments already made in cycling infrastructure but also counteract efforts to combat climate change. Encouraging car dependency at the expense of active transportation directly contradicts Ontario\u2019s own policy commitments to sustainability and urban resilience as articulated in the PPS, 2024.\nEffective planning relies on collaborative and evidence-based approaches that balance the needs of all transportation modes to build safer, more inclusive cities.\nI urge the Ministry to reconsider the approach outlined in Bill 212 and align future actions with the PPS, 2024, ensuring that provincial policies uphold sustainability, safety, and municipal autonomy.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is ill-informed and outright backwards.\nBike lanes keep cyclists safe and allow active transportation. If bike lanes are removed, cyclists would shift to cars and transit, further straining the already crowded system. Cyclists would bike on the road, slowing down car traffic and ending up in a dangerous situation. Cyclists, out of fear of being on the road, may also bike on the sidewalks.\nBike lanes on major roads like University, Yonge, and Bloor, allow communities better access to the shops and restaurants along these streets. They further allow cyclists to cross natural and human-made barriers like rivers and 400-series highways, for which there is often no safe way to cross on smaller side streets.\nThis legislation is borne of vindictiveness, is not based on evidence that bike lanes are slowing car traffic, and will set us back a decade.\nIf you pass this legislation, cyclists will die. But I don't think this government cares.\nIf you pass this legislation, I will bike on the road on Bloor, and take a full lane, as is my right. I will carry a sign on my back letting the angry drivers behind me know that the Doug Ford government did this.\n"

        "comment": "I recognize that traffic congestion and gridlock are significant problems in Ontario, but I contend that proposals in Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, would worsen the problem while limiting Ontarians travel options and putting vulnerable road users at higher risk of injury and death.\nThe addendum about bike lanes is proposing a layer of wasteful bureaucracy, and is a significant overreach into municipal governance.  I believe local governments are better suited to determining what works best on their streets, where the movement of vehicles is just one factor, and not always the most important.\nMy experience.\nI drive, cycle, walk and use transit in the Greater Toronto Area, living for the last three decades within 3 km of the bikeways this bill proposes to remove.  While witnessing this growing congestion, I found the bicycle my preferred and most efficient transport, though I still own a car.  I experienced the recent growth of cycling in the city and know that the statistics referenced by Ontario (i.e., 1.2% of trips ) are outdated and severely understate the current use of bicycles, especially in the central city areas.  I attribute most of the adoption of cycling to the improving connected cycling network, especially the protected bike lanes along efficient corridors, providing routes that more and more people feel are safe enough and direct enough to outweigh the inherent risks one takes riding bicycles on our streets.  Removing and refusing bike lanes will force many to return to cars or transit for those trips, worsening congestion an overcrowding transit.\nDiving not sustainable.\nApparent to all is the greatly increasing population density of cities, Toronto specifically, and we must recognize as fact that private vehicle use must decline as a percentage of transportation, as they are undeniably the least space-efficient option to move people in and out of crowded areas.  The corollary is that the increasing majority need alternatives, of which cycling and walking bring the most benefit to those participants and the city, also the most reliable and lowest cost.\nCycling as solution.\nWhile it takes years to increase transit capacity, increasing bike ridership is relatively quick and affordable, by ensuring safe, efficient bike lane networks.  Having often commuted by bicycle I continue to appreciate the physical and mental health benefits it provides and feel more productive than days I would drive.  I have visited Copenhagen where cycling works wonderfully as transportation for the masses all year because of separated cycleways on most major roadways.  Lost productivity has been stated as a reason to fight gridlock, and bicycles are inherently a more productive way to get around, proven by the growth of bicycle deliveries replacing cars in many industries.  While it's common lately to consider food delivery bikes an inconvenient scourge, imagine if many of those deliveries returned to cars, which actually do block traffic when they stop.\nOutdated mindset.\nThe Ontario Regulatory Registry document (Proposal Number: 24-MTO018, https://www.ontariocanada.com/registry/view.do?language=en&postingId=48\u2026 ) states:\n\"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\"\nThe word 'drivers' here is a problem, it should be 'people and goods'.  North American society adopted the idea of driving ourselves everywhere with the advent of suburbs and freeways long ago, which most now recognize is unsustainable, especially as populations grow.  Hanging onto this idea is, I believe, the main cause of congestion; providing alternatives is the only real solution.\nResearch and justification.\nI'm aware of no data or research that would support this bill's contention that more lanes for motor vehicles in place of bike lanes will reduce congestion, while there IS such research that more vehicle lanes induces demand (brings more drivers) and doesn't reduce gridlock for long.  The proposal seems to be based on \"gut feel\" or simplistic thinking about a very complex science, and some bike lanes \"appearing\" underused some of the time.\nExtreme waste.\nIt would be a disastrous waste of very significant taxpayer money and government time and resources, especially the removal of implemented cycle tracks or cancellation of planned projects.  The work to reimplement bike lanes will eventually be done again, and we'll have lost years getting to a real solution, much like the Eglington transit project history.  But even worse, the proposal itself is fuelling angry attitudes between drivers and vulnerable road users, which may lead to tragedy on our roads.\nPlease rescind all proposals on bike lanes in Bill 212, as amended.\n"

        "comment": "To the Ford Government,\nIn a city as large as Toronto, removing a few bike lanes on a few roads WILL NOT reduce traffic congestion. As most, it would open a few more lanes for motor vehicle traffic for a short time, only to be immediately backfilled by more motor vehicles.\nThe preponderance of evidence is that adding more lanes for motor vehicle traffic is only ever a temporary solution. Inevitably, the new lanes attract more traffic, something called induced demand, and we are back into gridlock.\nAs painful as it might be for some to admit to the obvious, the only solution to traffic congestion is to reduce the amount of motor vehicle traffic. But that means providing alternatives so that people can get around WITHOUT using them.\nThus, bicycle lanes are not the CAUSE of traffic congestion. They are the SOLUTION. As is public transit. When people take alternatives to motor vehicles, traffic congestion automatically decreases. For example, during the pandemic when people stayed home and there were fewer motor vehicles on the roads, congestion decreased.\nIn contrast, even a marked increase in bicycle use and transit use does not lead to traffic congestion as bicycles and public transit are more efficient at moving large volumes of people than personal motor vehicles.\nAfter nearly a century of building roads that favour cars, we see the result - GRIDLOCK. The bicycle infrastructure that has been built so far in Toronto is still in its infancy. If allowed to develop into a well-connected grid, a mature bicycle network would alleviate traffic congestion (and pollution). But killing the network in its infancy is just short-sighted. If people who presently move around the city on bicycles are forced to revert back to driving their cars, we end up with more traffic congestion once again.\nSo, if anything, drivers should want MORE bicycle lanes, not LESS because every person riding their bike is NOT DRIVING their car.\nAnd this is not even considering the expense of removing bike lanes that were only installed after municipalities carefully consulted all stakeholders in the first place.\nAnd for a government that touts the benefits of LESS red tape, how will the application for bike lanes from ALL MUNICIPALITIES across the province REDUCE red tape? Perhaps the government needs to stay in its OWN lane and not overreach into municipal affairs.\nAs for building Highway 413 through the Greenbelt, once again the argument that adding more highways will alleviate Gridlock is fatally flawed. Even if taken to the extreme, and every square inch of green space within a hundred kilometres of Toronto city hall was paved over, we would still have gridlock. Cities cannot pave their way out of this situation. It is going to take a more rational approach.\nAs the saying goes, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. After 70 years of highway building in the Toronto area, have we not learned anything? First, the 401 is built to bypass Toronto, then the 407 to bypass the 401, and now you want to build the 413 to bypass the 407. In other words, a bypass to bypass the bypass. This is INSANE.\nIt's not like there aren't any other solutions being implemented around the world to combat traffic congestion. The implementation of congestion charges, though not popular, has reduced traffic in the core area of London UK. Copenhagen and Amsterdam do just fine with a vast bicycle network. Greater Tokyo, with a population of 41 million, quietly and efficiently moves people around with an efficient transit system.\nSo it can be done - if there is the political will.\nTo be honest, the rest of the world must be shaking its collective head in amazement at ONTARIO. Despite the evidence that the rest of the world is acting on and implementing for the long-term good of each city (not to mention the good of the planet), Bill 212 is leading the province backward. We will not be lauded, but instead be derided. You will make us a laughing stock, the butt of jokes, and generally looked down upon by clear-thinking people everywhere.\nAnd not to be overlooked is the obvious backroom deals that benefit developers who are cozy with the Ford government, as pointed out by the Auditor General.\nSo, in conclusion, Bill 212 should not go forward.\nRushing it through just because the government has a majority doesn't make it right. In contrast, the right course of action is to pursue alternatives to motor vehicle usage. Though this might not be popular in the short run, it is the only logical solution in the LONG RUN. Only by reducing motor vehicle traffic will we truly REDUCE GRIDLOCK AND SAVE TIME.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Etobicoke, Ontario, I wish to express my opposition to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. As a motorist, I oppose the inadequacy of the proposed actions as a solution to municipal gridlock. As a cyclist, I oppose the inadequacy of this Bill in ensuring safe and equitable access for all vehicles. Furthermore, as a concerned citizen, I oppose the proposed construction of roadways, specifically Highway 413 without comprehensive planning. Altogether, I strongly believe that these measures represent, at best, a short-term, band-aid solution to gridlock that will only push greater problems onto Ontarians in the future.\nI live with my husband and small children in Etobicoke, less than 500m north of Bloor Street, and work in the downtown core, near Union Station. I am a frequent motorist, cyclist and pedestrian, and therefore have a great deal of personal experience with the infrastructure affected by Bill 212.\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is a complex and long-standing issue which significantly predates the installation of bicycle lanes on arterial roadways into the city centre. With continuing population growth within the city and surrounding area, particularly in light of imminent development in the Kipling-Bloor area, simply reallocating an additional pre-existing lane of car traffic on these roads is woefully inadequate and shortsighted. Rather, this issue calls for innovative solutions that enable and encourage alternate modes of transport, including transit use, walking and cycling.\nThis is particularly true on mixed-use main streets such Bloor Street and Yonge Street, which support a large number of local residential, commercial and institutional destinations. The greatest benefit to both residents and local businesses requires access by a multitude of users, including motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, mobility device users, transit users, delivery services and emergency services. Unlike roadways such as the Gardiner Expressway, the primary function of these mixed-use roads is not to funnel the greatest possible number of vehicles to and from the city centre. As long as such local functions exist on these streets, they will be poorly suited to serve as the quickest and most reliable access to downtown by car.\nThe Bloor Street cycling lanes have particular personal relevance to me, I have used them to cycle downtown to work and to take my daughter to and from nursery school about 3km away along Bloor St. Without the stretch of bicycle lanes from Kipling Ave. to Islington Ave., in particular, there are no viable alternative routes that avoid major roads. I also cycle my son to daycare further north on Kipling Ave. I do not feel safe cycling alongside high-speed traffic on Kipling Ave., especially with a toddler in tow, and therefore I use side roads and trails. This increases my travel time by at least 60%, and also requires me to cross four major roads at uncontrolled intersections. Not only is this slow and dangerous, but it also frequently delays motorists behind me as I wait for a gap in 2-4 lanes of traffic. Despite this, cycling remains the most practical method to reach these destinations. Purchasing and operating a second vehicle simply to get our children to school is financially absurd.\nWhile the Ministry of Transportation defines bicycles as vehicles and has broad responsibility for ensuring their safe and appropriate use, it has traditionally been left to local municipalities to decide on the most appropriate way to ensure equitable access by motor vehicles and bicycles. To adequately perform this function, municipalities have developed a great deal of resources, knowledge and infrastructure, including local consultation with residents and businesses, urban planning experts, computer modelling, and traffic studies. As such, these municipalities are currently best placed to decide if and where cycling infrastructure should be installed. The use of side roads or trails for cycling is not objectionable in and of itself, provided these side roads provide a similarly efficient route to destinations across the city, including appropriate measures to allow timely and safe crossings at any major roads. Until such time as the MTO builds out the appropriate capacity to provision the alternate routes, it is evident that it does not have sufficient capability and expertise to ensure safe and equitable access to local roads, especially as the scope of this bill does not include the responsibility to ensure the suitability and adequacy of alternate cycling infrastructure. Local mixed-use roads are funded by taxes paid by residents and businesses within the municipality, and municipal governments are most familiar with local needs and most answerable to local taxpayers. Oversight over the particulars of these local roads must therefore continue to rest with local governments.\nFinally, I must also oppose Bill 212 with respect to accelerated construction on the proposed Highway 413. In addition to significant impacts on local residents and the environment, expressways constitute a significant component of provincial transportation. As such, it is absolutely vital that these projects are thoughtfully and thoroughly considered to ensure that they serve their intended function while minimizing negative consequences. Poor planning will only increase the likelihood of greater costs to taxpayers in the future.\nI was born in Ontario, and I am greatly appreciative of my home province and have deep roots here. I grew up mainly in small towns in the Golden Horseshoe. Some of my happiest childhood memories were at my grandparents' orchard in Niagara-on-the-Lake and my other grandparents' home and cottage near Georgian Bay. As an adult, I still visit relatives and travel around the province with my own family, whenever I can. As a resident of Etobicoke, I love my local neighborhood and neighbours. I appreciate the thriving, bustling city of Toronto that provides vital employment and cultural opportunities. I take pride in the bounty of produce that comes from highly fertile Ontario agricultural land and the beauty and inherent environmental value of our pristine wilderness. It is clear to me that if Ontario is to remain \"A Place to Grow\" for existing and future residents, thoughtful, thorough planning and good faith integration of all road users must be maintained and encouraged.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycles may not be \"motor\" vehicles, but they are still vehicles, which entitles them to space on a road - just like cars. This bill is concerning because it distracts from and disrespects all other modes of transportation that are not cars - cycling, walking, and public transit. These are all transit methods used predominantly in Toronto since half the population of Toronto does not own or use a car. Cycling is healthy, does not emit fuels, and can be a more efficient way to get around - especially with the right infrastructure. I don't understand why drivers, and the government that represents them, sees cyclists as the enemy. Not only will removing bike lanes NOT eliminate traffic, it will only make it worse due to more cars on the road (an increase in gridlock) and partial road closures to remove said bikes lanes (further increasing gridlock). Additionally, the bikes are not going to just go away with this decision, it will only make these roads less safe for everyone using them.\nI worry about the ramifications of this bill, including an increase in aggression from drivers who feel like they are entitled to a faster commute but cyclists are not. I worry about why Toronto specifically is being targeted for the removal of bike lanes when other cities like Ottawa, Kingston, or Windsor are not. This legislation will cost money for everyone in this province, but it will only truly affect those in Toronto. It is a waste of money, time, and resources. These bike lines were fought for by those who need them (seniors, students, and non-drivers) and only recently completed. I do not understand the effort put into this bill when we should be spending more time, money, and resources on improving public transit - something that will reduce gridlock if better and more reliable transit options are available. We should be creating more bike lanes so there are less cars on the road, and encourage more enjoyable and sustainable modes of transit in this province (not just in Toronto).\n"

I rode my bike tonight in the pouring rain and half of Bloor street was underwater. We are living in climate change and removing the bike lanes will only make the effects of climate change worse. The facts show that providing more lanes for automobiles will only increase traffic congestion, not ease it. We need to provide numerous options for people to get around in the city, and not prioritize only one mode of transportation (i.e. automobiles). I understand that congestion is a problem, I see it first hand everyday, but I do not believe removing bike lanes is the solution. We need to increase our public transit network and provide more affordable housing so people are able to live and work in the city, and not rely on automobiles or long commutes to the surrounding greater Toronto areas. We are a 21st century city that needs to provide progressive transportation options that support children and older adults. Bike lanes are essential for delivery and gig workers, many of which are newcomers to Canada. Bike lanes reduce traffic and greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Bike lanes save lives and attract tourism. Unfortunately, if the bike lanes are removed I will be forced to cycle in the same lane as an automobile, making my ride more dangerous, and causing frustration for drivers. Neither myself nor drivers want that. Please reconsider Bill 212 and leave the bike lanes intact.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI have to strongly disagree with much of bill 212.\nI use the bike lanes to get to and from places in downtown Toronto as biking is often just the fastest way to get around downtown.\nRemoval of the lanes along Yonge St, University Ave, and Bloor St would be a huge step back for the city's growing active transportation as a part of its modal share.\nIf you remove the bike lanes, that will not only increase the danger for cyclists, it will just have cars stuck behind cyclists or put the cyclists into cars filling up the same spot you would've wanted to drive in. Or the space would then fill up with parked vehicles being us back to the same place.\nMotorists don't want to drive into cyclists to touch their vehicles nor do cyclists want to have large vehicles passing them without a protected barrier.\nAlso, the lanes along University, Adelaide, and Richmond take up 1 out of the 4 lanes in each direction, the other 3 being dedicated to space for vehicles\nTo be clear, I do drive sometimes and use rideshares and find the vehicle lanes useful but so are the bike lanes.\nLook, if each municipality decided they wanted to ban bike lanes in their city because they don't think it makes sense in their urban design, that should be up to them. But don't assume Toronto and Trenton have the same transportation infrastructure needs\nPlease do not pass this bill in its current form\nThank you,\nA concerned Toronto, Ontario resident\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212\u2014it will not save anyone time, it will make gridlock worse, and it will be a huge waste of money.\n- Bike lanes are a part of the transportation infrastructure and reduce overall wait times.\n- Bike lanes provide a basic guarantee of safety for pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists.\n- Bike lanes make driving easier by not having to share with bicycles.\n- Bike lanes support transit investments by connecting the \"last mile\" between destinations.\n- Businesses and residences have already built infrastructure to take advantage of bike lanes; removing them will kill those investments.\nBill 212 is government red tape at its worst\u2014it punishes people for choosing their mode of travel, it wastes money better put elsewhere, and to top it off, it will make things worse for everyone! Those cyclists will directly compete with drivers for space on the road.\n"

        "comment": "This is a foolish, ill-advised proposal. More lanes beget more gridlock, and while the government of Ontario can keep adding more lanes to the 401 and new highways outside the city, there is a finite amount of room they can keep expanding car lanes to within the city, where the worst of Toronto gridlock is.\nI've lived and cycled in Toronto for many years, and the bike lanes, including the one on Bloor St, were part of my daily commute, and I have, in general, felt extremely unsafe on my bike in Toronto, save for the few times I've been able to ride in separated bike lanes. As car driving culture grows increasingly hostile of bicycle users, separated bike lanes keep people safe. Invest in bike lanes, and people will use them. Take them down and you put more people in gridlock, sitting in cars. People on bikes will be hit and killed more often because of this bill.\nBeyond bike lanes, I disprove of this entire bill. The government of Ontario knows that this bill will not reduce gridlock or save anyone time, except for this government's ability to expropriate shared land faster to sell off to Doug Ford's friends. The government should not be allowed to violate environmental laws by being exempt from environmental assessments.\nLeave the municipal planning of municipal streets (which are NOT provincial highways, though the government might like to make them such) to the municipalities that govern them. Don't turn back the small bit of progress we have made. Think about the future beyond the one lane you're going to get back from endangering cyclists, and invest in real people-moving infrastructure like public transit that is the actual, proven way to reduce gridlock. For shame.\n"
