        "comment": "I am an Ontario voter and taxpayer who lives and works right along one of the bike lanes that will be impacted by this costly and unnecessary initiative from the Premier. The bike lanes on Bloor Street have been a godsend, dramatically improving business in the area* and keeping local cyclists and pedestrians safer.\nThe premier's plans will cost Ontario taxpayers an eye-watering sum of money**, increase traffic dramatically due to the massive amount of construction and teardown this plan will require and impede the construction of badly needed mid-rise housing that is slated to be built along Bloor Street and other major arteries in Toronto. I thought the Premier said he cared about solving the province's housing crisis!\nI'm so upset by this. It will do the opposite of what the Premier is saying it will do, only increasing congestion in the city.\nAnd as the Minister of Transportation's comments to the press on November 18th showed (\"We're going to look at it\")***, the Provincial Government has clearly not given this costly and disruptive initiative any thought.\nThis is cynical politics at its worst: an insult to anyone who pays taxes in this province and anyone who actually carries about reducing congestion in our cities.\n*https://x.com/alexbozikovic/status/1849158450212704511/photo/1\n**https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/report-cost-removal-bike-lanes-t\u2026\n***https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-bike-lanes-1.7386724\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212 for several reasons. Firstly, I was shocked to learn that municipal streets are considered highways and are under provincial legislation. I understand that Highway 417 is a highway but never did I think that a city's main streets and local streets would fall under the same provincial act as they serve quite different purposes. I oppose this Bill as I believe that cities should have full jurisdiction in how their main and local streets are designed, including whether a bike lane is included or not. This bill is provincial overreach.\nSecondly, I don't see any scientific data that shows that removing or not permitting bike lanes will improve car traffic. If anything, it would increase traffic congestion with having more cars on the roads that will get stuck in traffic. If traffic is really the primary concern, why isn't public transit the focus as buses and trains can move more people more efficiently then a large number of cars (with single occupants) slowing traffic movement.\nThirdly, requiring a proposed bike lane to also be reviewed at the provincial level is adding more bureaucracy and unnecessarily adding more time and resources for what purpose? I trust the city council and staff to move forward in good faith with their transportation plans, which is based on extensive public consultation and research.\nLastly, the cost to undertake this work - I do not see the cost-benefit analysis. What money will be used to undertake these reviews? For existing bike lanes that are directed to be removed, who pays for this? This is not a good use of taxpayer money and is simply spending money that does not need to be spent. As a taxpayer, I would much rather these dollars are spent in the healthcare system.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about Ontario's new proposal that would mandate provincial approval for new bicycle lanes if they require the removal of existing vehicle lanes and, more troublingly, the potential removal of existing bike lanes on major Toronto roads like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue.\nBike lanes are not just a progressive urban transportation feature but a critical component of public safety and a more efficient urban flow. When implemented effectively, bike lanes increase the number of people moving through our city in an environmentally sustainable and space-efficient way. Cyclists take up significantly less road space than cars, and protected bike lanes encourage more people to bike, reducing vehicle congestion over time rather than exacerbating it.\nToronto has witnessed far too many preventable deaths and injuries because drivers fail to respect or notice bikers. Reducing the availability of secure bike lanes would only endanger more lives. Instead of scaling back on bike infrastructure, we should expand it to create a more balanced, safe, and people-oriented transportation network.\nThe proposed framework prioritizes short-term vehicular convenience over the long-term benefits of a comprehensive, multimodal transportation system. It risks reversing hard-won progress in making Toronto more livable and environmentally conscious. Rather than returning to car-centric policies, we should be investing in solutions that promote equity and safety for all road users, especially the most vulnerable.\nI urge decision-makers to consider the value of secure bike lanes for public safety, environmental benefits, and a healthier, more vibrant city. Preserving and enhancing bike lanes is not just a matter of convenience but a crucial aspect of urban life that saves lives and promotes sustainable urban mobility.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Mississauga for 34 years. I spent much of my working life practising law downtown. I had the good fortune to live near the waterfront trail. I often skated to the Go Train and then from Union Station to work, occasionally skating home from downtown or cycling to and from downtown over 2 days. It was wonderful. The hardest thing for residents is to get in enough exercise and to manage long commutes. When my office moved up to North York, the commute became awful. Toronto and Ontario have failed to build either public transit or roads, instead constantly changing their minds.\nI strongly believe we need to reduce tolls on the 407 so that it can draw off traffic from the 401 and Gardiner. We need to invest in public transit, especially smaller more frequent electric buses. Finally, we need bike lanes and lots of them in a network that allows people to commute and exercise at the same time. The suburbs and inner city residents need to unite to achieve a system of travel that benefits both.\nFinally, as a retired driver, I feel a lot more comfortable with separated bike lanes so that cyclists, many of them commercial cyclists, are not forced to ride in and out of traffic, scaring me and endangering them. Keep the bike lanes and expand the network, invest in transit, and make the 407 affordable for bypass travellers, people living north of the City and trucks.\n"

        "comment": "I wish to hereby voice my strong opposition to Bill 212.\nI believe the arguments for the personal, community, societal and environmental benefits of cycling and safe infrastructure have been well covered made many times over.\nAs a regular cycling commuter and a recreational rider I would just like say:\n1.\tIt is deeply concerning that when we as a region are making good progress on developing multi-modal transportation the provincial government believes they can make better decisions than those who are here on the ground living the situation every day.\n2.\tThe 2018 Region of Waterloo Transportation Master Plan is a strong and robust roadmap developed by this community for this community. It builds on the 2010 version and has as it\u2019s first and most important umbrella policy \u201cBuild a Transportation Network that Supports all Modes of Travel\u201d. This includes cycling which is referenced 74 times in its 117 pages showing it is an integral and important part of moving forward. Bill 212 would undermine this community plan setting back important progress.\n3.\tThis bill which promotes cars over other transportation options is a step backward. This is especially the case now when time are tough and people are looking ways to cut costs. Not requiring a car is certainly a large financial burden that can be removed from people when there are alternatives including cycling that will get them where they need to go.  This bill unnecessarily disincentivizes people from seeking out and using alternative transportation option.\n4.\tBike lanes have made my commute easier and reduced the anxiety of riding in traffic. Living in Waterloo Region there are a number of bike lanes on larger Regional roads that are more direct routes than winding through subdivisions. Bike lanes on larger roads have encouraged me to commute and run errands regularly.\nOn Highway 413 I would also like to voice strong opposition because:\n1. The provincial government is ignoring the findings of its own studies showing Highway 413 would have only minor reductions in travel times. So it is not at all likely that the intended positive impacts will be materialize\n2. There are also a myriad of environmental reasons for scrutinizing the 413 that have been well covered elsewhere. Therefore it is imperative that an environmental assessment for this highway be undertaken.\nFor all these reasons and a multitude of others that others have also articulated I urge the Provincial Government to withdraw Bill 212.\n"

Every highway I\u2019ve ever driven on has had 2+ hour delays and there are many times where I can see people walking making it to their destination sooner. Toronto needs more bike lanes not fewer. We\u2019re so behind countries like the Netherlands, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, etc that all have such beautiful city infrastructure. Please don\u2019t take more steps backwards.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not provide relief from congestion. There are numerous studies from cities around the world proving this. By removing bike lanes, you are putting people's safety at risk. More and more people are commuting via their bike in Toronto, including myself, and by taking bike lanes away, where will we go? Surely we'll just take up an entire lane of traffic, which doesn't solve anything. It's a lose-lose situation as cyclists will lose their bike lane, and cars will have to slow down behind us. Please reject this proposal and let Toronto city planners plan our city, not the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "The recently proposed Bill 212 leaves me terrified as a commuting cyclist and as the parent of a teenager who cycles each day to school. Over the past 15 years that I have lived in Toronto, I have been happy to see an increase in bike lanes. These have allowed me to travel safely in the city, and meant that my son could learn to ride his bike without being cut off by speeding traffic. Without bike lanes, I would not have been able to safely transport my toddler to day care, or get to work, and without bike lanes now, my teenager will not be safe on his ride to school.\nMotorists are often in a rush and frustrated by construction projects that slow them down and make traversing the city a headache. Urban population increases, growing numbers of cars, endless construction, and the excessive use of food delivery apps, all contribute to congestion.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that removing bike lanes will significantly reduce anyone's commute time. Too many cyclists have already been killed. The province and the city need to stop this dangerous and misguided legislation.\n"

The province has no place in directing the affairs of municipalities and this is why we have such structure to our levels of government.\nIt also virtually guarantees that we will see an increase in cyclist / vehicle collisions given that the expressed priority is putting more cars on the road with less space for non-motorists to get where they need to go.\nI would much rather see a solution that doesn\u2019t penalize and jeopardize others at the expense of the privileged interests of motorists. Not to mention, we should be promoting non vehicle traffic for environmental reasons.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian and an Ontarian, I'm very disheartened by this bill. Although I have a drivers license, I prefer cycling to driving. In recent years, the City of Toronto has made great progress in making cycling a safer experience, and thus more accessible and appealing to the public. I truly believe having safe alternatives to driving will help congestion, not worsen it. The more people choose car alternatives, the fewer cars there will be in car lanes.\nThis bill is also an overreach by the province. Cities go to great length to study and invest in their transportation network. This government should not roll back the years of work done by the City of Toronto. This bill takes us backwards, not forwards in creating livable cities.\n"

Doug Ford\u2019s push to eliminate them ignores the countless benefits they provide: reducing traffic congestion, improving safety for cyclists and drivers alike, and promoting greener transportation. We\u2019ve seen how bike lanes encourage healthier lifestyles and lower emissions\u2014why would we want to undo that progress? Toronto deserves infrastructure that works for everyone, not just cars. Let\u2019s keep moving forward, not backward!\n"
