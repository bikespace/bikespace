While I understand bike lines help with safety for cyclists, there has been way too many major lanes of roads taken away. The gridlock causes so much unnecessary stress. I have also seen delays with emergency vehicles who no longer have a shoulder to drive on. I believe there should be a major decrease in the bike lanes we have\n"

Improving the infrastructure would make active transport doable for me. I would shift more of my activity to biking rather than driving if that mode of transport were safe and reliable.\nI feel making this shift is important because of the researched and proven improvements for climate, for health, and the economy. Having a population that bikes more will also empower people to feel more independent and mobile.\nFor the love of all that is sane do not waste money removing bike infrastructure for the sake of improving driving! Put the money into improving the biking network in Bloor west so its not a single unconnected road. We should be diversifying our transportation system and having viable alternatives to driving!\n"

Hidden within their proposed \"bike lane removal\" bill is a clause that prohibits landowners from challenging expropriation timelines under the Expropriations Act. This isn\u2019t about bike lanes\u2014it's about giving themselves unchecked power to seize land cheaply and quickly for their controversial highway projects.\nOntarians are tired of these tactics. Instead of dismantling the Greenbelt, bribing voters with $200 cheques, or focusing on selling beer in corner stores, the government should invest in what we actually need & want: healthcare, education, affordable housing, and childcare.

Removing them will create more gridlock, encourage cars to drive faster. Having a designated bike lane is critical for the viability of our city. Do not remove them please. Flip flopping back-and-forth between getting up to speed with all the world class cities and finally installing bike lanes to considering removing them is absolutely ridiculous. We need these bike lanes to remain on these major arteries in Toronto. Whoever voted for them to be removed needs to go for a bike ride in the bike lanes to see the immense advantage they provide.\n"

This is not a bad thing but it's the government's responsibility to ensure a safe commute for all. As a biker myself, it is truly terrifying biking in areas that have no bike lanes with cars speeding by and not always watching for cyclists. I deserve to start my work day with an adrenaline boost from a pleasant bike ride (which I do year round) and not stressed from trying to avoid being run over by a car. Cycling contributes to residents' health and well-being and reduces the number of cars and the crowding on public transit during peak hours. The government should be promoting more opportunities for safe bike commuting, not spending our hard earned tax dollars to tear down the whole infrastructure, costing a staggering 200M+. This is simply unacceptable. This will be blood on your hands if you remove bike lanes. Treat carefully.\n"

Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists may resort to sharing the road with cars, raising the risk of accidents. Alternatively, some may use sidewalks, which compromises the city\u2019s walkability.\nMaintaining existing bike lanes preserves commuting options and ensures inclusivity by accommodating diverse modes of mobility.\n"

With the new infrastructure in Toronto around Bloor, Yonge, and University it seemed like Toronto was on the right track and I even considered maybe moving back to Toronto in the future.\nBiking in Montreal with the infrastructure here feels very safe and I ride almost everyday (also with the kids). My family and I are in one of the upper income brackets, own a home, and are glad that our tax dollars are going towards public infrastructure such as bike lanes.\nWith proper and safe biking infrastructure in Toronto I would have happily considered living and paying taxes in Toronto - but with plans like these and ripping up newly-built biking infrastructure, this will certainly not happen.\nI will stay in Montreal and advice my professional and international network to not even waste a thought about moving to Toronto (or Ontario). Sorry to be so blunt, but it is what it is.\n"

Overall disregard for disability aspects for 1901 resident is evident by anyone visiting the site in-person (vs. just looking at photos/maps while sitting behind a desk in the office).\nOutlining specific cases that do not fit into the access points Maogosha provided:\n\u2022\tWe are not discussing the small railings that were placed many years ago to prevent newspapers from falling!\n\u2022\tWe are discussing the hostile take over of our main pickup/drop off access point for ambulance, taxi, wheel trans, cars etc.\n\u2022\tThe Balliol side, the back of the building outdoor visitor parking lot and the bus stop north of Davisville suggested by Maogosha are totally unworkable and inaccessible by our mostly seniors and mobility-challenged residents.\n\u2022\tWe frankly wonder if Maogosha and/or any of the esteemed city planners have actually taken the time to come and take a look at this location in person, and if they have, we seriously wonder if they have ever placed themselves in the place a of a person with a walker or cane who can only walk a few feet maximum with assistance (specially in rain or icy conditions) to hope on and hop off a car/ride/taxi?\n\u2022\tThe suggested access points are mainly out of question and not real access point for seniors/disabled members of our community in this building. As they are all about 100-200 feet away and specially with the surface of our sidewalk being somewhat steep and wide (which by the way many bikes and scooters still speed through it despite having their own lane now in front of the building, posing many risks!).\n\u2022\tThe residents of this building are law-abiding people who pay a lot of money in the form of various fees and mainly hefty property taxes to live in an accessible building while the bikers do not pay any tax or insurance and do not share any liability when they choose to speed against the direction of one way traffic on these lanes and choose to ride the opposite way, surprising the pedestrians.\n\u2022\tMany of these bikers and scooters are seen often going in various directions ON the sidewalk in front of 1901 and hence the hostile takeover of not just a portion of the street which is literally our driveway buy also traumatizing the pedestrians and residents alike, all which they do not share the liabilities and risk as: they do not own a license plate (can\u2019t be tracked/fined), they do not have liability or any sort of insurance, last but not least, they do not even have any sort of license demonstrating they can abide by and respect road safety and rules and for all we know many could be inexperienced bikers who just happen to be \u201cborrowing someone\u2019s bike for the day!. This whole concept of allowing they this much invasion and\u201d unshared\u201d liability when we are required to share so much with them for free is rather mind-blowing!\nWe are providing evidence below to the city that the newly placed extended bike paths and associated railings on Yonge street do not work and we feel they show a lack of regard for the 1901 residents who are for the most part either senior citizens and elderly or challenged by some form of disability impacting their movement and walking/standing for longer than a few feet to get to their ride and any vehicle for their mobility.\nBackground & Details: The blockage to comfortably mount/dismount a taxi/car/ambulance/etc. is a seirous access issue. These installed railing/flags are right in front of the main entrance at 1901 Yonge street, a corner building steps from the busy Yonge & Davisville intersection needs to be reassessed and ideally removed. When we first complained last year it was evident from the response that we got which outlined that back door as an alternative access point, we were certain that no one has really taken the time to study the unique position and place of this building and definitely no one has taken the time to consider accessibility issues.\nThe building has two other access points other than this main entrance at Younge street side which is the subject of our complain:\n1.\tUnderground parking: not everyone has a parking spot or a car. Moreover, getting to the parking requires a few minutes of walk to get to still.\n2.\tBack door (which was suggested in an earlier response by a city staff who first responded to our complaint): it\u2019s totally inaccessibly and one has to go through steep stairs and multiple little steps/hurdles to get to it! So that one is out of the question entirely.\nThese railing were placed suddenly and without any consultation with us as mentioned earlier, and we feel proper care and research has not been done to assess its impact on the residence of the 1901 building who are mainly seniors or dealing with a disability (hence the reason for them to choose this location that used to be most accessible prior to this somewhat hostile takeover by the new change in place in the form of \u201cbike lanes and rails\u201d.\n1901 residents are impacted by this takeover of their main access point to mount/dismount a car, an ambulance, hopping on a ride without having to walk half a block and specially cumbersome and somewhat impossible for those dealing with disabilities and dealing with lack of accessibility they now face.\nThose who have the luxury access and a person to assist them in accessing a car by using the underground parking (which still requires the disable or challenged person to be moved to that location and spend a few minutes more to walk to get there) are few and not everyone can get a ride from the secure private underground parking discussed above, as it is reserved for those who own a car and have access to this place - and still it is not the most accessibly way for a person who is not driving himself/herself. and many aren\u2019t!.\nOne of our residents has disability research background to inform continuous improvement of policies and programs in government and this email has  relied on her knowledge of related issues as well and summarized as such to the best of our ability here. This letter to request this bike rail implementation and reversal has been written with reliance on current trends and city/gov. obligations as such and is well supported by rights of a disabled person according to \u201dthe Ontarians with disability act\u201d and other resources related to it as well.\nThanking you in advance for any and all support you are able to provide us with.\nWarm regards,\nConcerned 1901 Residents (c/o TSE Property Management team in charge).\n/photos attached\nThank you,\nGabriel Bengino, CMRAO\nLicensed Condominium Manager\nSenior Property Manager\nT. 905. 764.9166 x 50\n  f. 905.882.0228\n  e. gabriel@tsems.com\n  30 East Beaver Creek Rd, #107, Richmond Hill, ON, L4B 1J2\n  Property Management, Financial and Consulting Services\nFrom: Councillor Saxe <Councillor_Saxe@toronto.ca>\nSent: Monday, January 9, 2023 10:20 AM\nTo: Gabriel Bengino <gabriel@tsems.com>; Edward LaRusic\n"

        "comment": "The bike lane removal addition an extreme overreach of provincial governance. This is a municipal matter and concerns should be directed to the municipality, where decisions have been made analyzing local data.\nThe information drawn on about volume of bike commuters is inappropriately applied, as it does not include bike trips that are not for work commute purposes (such as school, groceries, other travel). It also does not focus on the areas with the bike lanes, and draws on information from the entirety of Toronto, which currently does not have many protected bike lanes.\nA network of protected bike lanes across the entire city would be required to make that data relevant. And this would also be required to effectively assess the value of active transportation to the city of Toronto residents. Currently unless the person deciding to cycle is living, working, and accomplishing all of their daily activities within the few corridors with protected bike lanes, we cannot asses the decisions made without considering the effect of the lack of safety inherent to cycling without protected bike lanes. The current bike lanes are only a step in the direction of creating a stronger cycling infrastructure, and as yet not complete enough to use their use data as a reason to remove them or limit their building.\nThis bill also does not address the inherent power imbalance between pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. Protected bike lanes do exactly this - protect people. This is not about the current number of people cycling, it is about public safety. We have had way too many deaths and injuries from cars hitting cyclists and pedestrians, and making people safe to choose other means of transportation instead of car travel is a massive step in reducing Toronto's congestion issues. Objectively - pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users take up much less physical space than individual vehicles. This is necessary in dense urban centres, which Toronto is increasingly becoming. Encouraging these modes through infrastructure that promotes safety and prevents the deaths and injuries that make it unsafe to cycle in mixed traffic is the only way to work on truly reducing gridlock.\nRemoving bike lanes or limiting their continued building will only continue to remove the safety afforded to people choosing active transportation. It will result in more people choosing the safety of a large vehicle when they have the option to do so, causing there to be more cars on the street and an increase in traffic. It will result in more injuries and deaths from car-bicycle collisions from those who attempt to continue to cycle.\nAs a pedestrian, I also regularly experience the risk of bicycles driving on the sidewalks - which is technically illegal - but cyclists are currently thrust between the lack of safety of sharing the road with cars, or the illegal space of sidewalks. The function of protected bike lanes is to appropriately divide the space into the different modes and speeds of those using our streets so all can move safely. Unless we want to reduce speed limits to the maximum speed of a non-electronic bicycle, cyclists and motorists sharing roads is not a reasonable expectation on dense city streets or \"arterial\" roadways, from public safety or traffic congestions perspectives.\nWhy are protected bike lanes considered controversial? We don't expect pedestrians to walk in car traffic, as we cannot move at the same speed as a car - and neither can cyclists. And yet it would be ridiculous to suggest removing sidewalks because of car traffic - sidewalks are essential infrastructure. So are protected bike lanes!\nThe only way to truly reduce gridlock in a dense urban environment with a high volume of people is reducing the number of individual vehicles by providing the infrastructure safe, affordable, and efficient alternatives - like walking, taking transit, and cycling.\n"

If you want to remove gridlock, the province would do better if it actually contributed money towards the public transit (building new routes and their operation). Most importantly, make a better link in public transit between individual municipalities (e.g. Toronto - Mississauga, build a subway or surface train directly to Square one at least). If the province is forcing the municipalities to remove the bike lanes, it should cover the full cost of their installment and removal.\n"
