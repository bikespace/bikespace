        "comment": "This bill is not only counter-productive to fighting gridlock, it is actively harmful toward the pedestrian and bicycle-using population of Ontario. The improvement and addition of bicycle lanes in the province is a gradual but important process of moving more people away from feeling that motor vehicles are their only means of transportation, as well as increasing the total amount of safe and accesible travel options for the populace. Restricting new lanes from being built and especially ripping out existing lanes is taking our province backwards in an already incredibly slow start to try and catch up to the much more progressive cities designed around the world.\n"

        "comment": "It is well proven that building bigger roads that make space for more cars does not \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\" in the long term. As an abundance of studies have shown, the opposite is true. Providing a variety of modes of transportation is the key to easing gridlock as people have the freedom to choose: Safe bike lanes, public transport and yes, cars.\nThis is not a \"war on cars.\" Safe bike lanes enable more people to travel by bike, more public transport enables people to ride the bus/subway/streetcar and make space for the people who absolutely have to travel by car. This is well proven. Bigger roads will just lead to more cars and more gridlock. Again, well proven.\nBike lanes make for lively, thriving neighbourhoods that benefit small businesses. They lower the carbon footprint and help create healthier cities and they ultimately make driving by car less stressful.\nIt would serve the province of Ontario well to consult experts on this and not just plow ahead misguidedly.\nHere in Toronto we need our bike lanes. Do not waste tax payers' money by ripping up bike lanes. Install more to ease gridlock.\nEven New York City is installing more bike lanes, let's be a world class city and do the same.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to everything about this bill for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it is an outrageous overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro-managing municipalities, especially given the state of its own affairs, such as the crumbling health care system?\nSecond, the prospect of avoiding environmental assessment to build a new highway in our current state of climate change and environmental catastrophes is grotesquely irresponsible. Did the government fail to notice to dangerous flooding this summer? There is only more to come.\nThird, ripping out existing bike lines is a terrible waste of money that is especially insulting when the Ford government has already wasted countless millions undermining other existing systems, like with alcohol sales.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That is the only way to do so. There is endless data and evidence locally and internationally demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with taking away bike lanes, building a new highway, or wasting years and billions on a tunnel.\nThe stated vague objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input. This move is undemocratic and undermining local citizens' needs and voices.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed everywhere in the world. If this government were serious about reducing gridlock it would be making significant investments to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money, and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

Removing a lane of traffic for vehicles reduces the number of sideswipe collisions as vehicles no longer can make those lane changes.

Taking the bicycle lanes away will not reduce congestion. The only way to reduce congestion is to get people out of cars and into alternative forms of transportation.\n"

We must share the roads.\nIf monies are put into transit (like maybe the Eglinton Crosstown could get working), and bike lanes, then some people will use those means, and there'll be fewer drivers, hence less congestion.\nI witnessed the aftermath of a car/bike collision today: if there had been a bike lane, perhaps that accident wouldn't have occurred:  who knows? But we must share our roads, SAFELY.\nWe have to acknowledge the climate change crisis, and get people out of their gas-powered cars, and into alternate modes.\n"

It also feels much safer to have physical separation from cars\nAs a Civil Engineer who works in municipal road reconstruction, I implore you to reconsider this legislation. It is our duty as engineers to design safe roadways for all users, and this legislation directly impacts our ability to design safe streets, which will have effects that long outlive the current administration. If this bill passes, there will be increased injuries and deaths of cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "Any major metropolitan city is effectively designed to accommodate foot traffic and cyclists along with vehicles. Toronto currently doesn\u2019t operate that way. For a \u201cyoung\u201d city, our infrastructure and planning is poorly designed focusing too much on motor vehicles. A modern city plans for the people who live in that city and their daily needs - not accommodating visiting traffic.\nEliminating bike lanes is not the solution to traffic and grid lock. It just allows for more vehicles, more irrational and impatient drivers, more noise pollution, and pollution in general. Anyone who actually lives in the city, doesn\u2019t want more traffic lanes. I moved to Toronto 15 years ago and have lived in different neighborhoods and the best areas are the ones that have scaled back on motor vehicles (changing lanes, turning them into one-way streets, etc) and they operate as a community more effectively. The provincial government should be focusing on more accessible public transit to easily enter and exit the city for commuters, rather than disrupting Toronto residents. Those who don\u2019t live in the city shouldn\u2019t be making decisions on how we operate. Take the GO train from Etobicoke, Doug.\n"

        "comment": "Your proposal states that you are \"looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\" by removing cycle lanes that caused the removal of a traffic lane, and preventing such cycle lanes from being built in the future. I disagree with your stance of privileging drivers, I disagree with your premise that more cycle lanes means less traffic, and I disagree with the removal of cycle lanes from a moral standpoint as it relates to the climate crisis.\nBill 212 privileges drivers without considering the many other ways that Ontarians get around our province. There are many people who are not able to drive, or who choose not to. By only considering the experience of drivers, your Bill leaves out the most vulnerable road users (e.g., children, the elderly, people who cannot afford a car). What considerations have you made for their safety and convenience as they move around?\nYour premise that more cycle lanes means more traffic has also been proven to be false time and again. In a CBC article published October 22, 2024 titled, \"Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion? Here's what the research says,\" Paris and Copenhagen are cited as cities where research found that despite an increase in cycle lanes, driver travel times decreased. While cycle lanes can be frustrating to drivers, Ontario needs to make policy decisions based on science and research, not based on drivers' gut feelings.\nLastly, I write this comment as someone concerned about the climate crisis. As our government, you have a moral responsibility to do all in your power to support Ontarians in the face of climate change. One easy thing your government can do is encourage people to drive less, as fossil fuels (including those from driving) are a major cause of climate change (see UN website link). Adding cycle lanes in a city encourages more people to cycle to get around. This reduces the use of fossil fuels, and actually reduces the number of people driving, thus reducing car traffic. But even if it didn't, this government has a moral imperative to encourage and support its citizens in using modes of transportation that do not rely on fossil fuels.\nI fundamentally disagree with Bill 212. Not only does it privilege drivers, it is based on the faulty premise that more cycle lanes means more traffic (when research shows the opposite is true), and it flies in the face of a society facing a climate crisis. Rather than focussing on drivers' feelings, this government should focus on increasing access to sustainable transportation. This includes a connected, safe cycle lane network, as well as well-funded public transportation within and between cities. With these sustainable options in place, those who are forced to drive would ultimately find less traffic on the road, which is your government's stated goal.\n"

It is unreliable and UNSAFE.\nThe people who ride bikes are just trying to get to work or where they need to go without having to endure our awful gridlock on the roads or the safety and reliability issues of the ttc. Your obvious hate of your fellow neighours who are just trying to live our lives and get to work is obvious and totally disgusting.\nWhy have we not invested in our transit or our roads? We just keep ripping them up and putting them back together with no improvement on traffic flow. Can we not make a smart long-term investment in our future roads? What the hell is the problem??\nJust one example of poor road planning is the Eglinton line that has taken years of construction impeding traffic across multiple areas and it is still not usable. If it were working and felt safe I would be able to take transit to work. As it stands now I would have to take three different buses, which would not work because buses are entirely unreliable. SO I DRIVE. I would cycle if it didn't feel like a death sentence.\nI live in the east end of the beach area of the city and went for dinner at my son's place in Hamilton a few weeks ago. It took THREE HOURS to get there and there was not ONE bike lane to be seen. The constant construction on the lakeshore, and Gardiner were the problem.\nI grew up in Toronto and am discouraged to see such a bad state on our roads. People are angry, and are behaving with carelessness and there is a real disregard for human life on our roads each time I set out. Ripping up the bike lanes will only intensify that attitude.\n- Lifelong Torontonian who is sickened by the negativity towards cyclists\n"

This reduction of lanes for cars has worked well, in my opinion as a school bus driver, car driver, and occasional cyclist. Cars are less likely to exceed the speed limit, bicycles have a safe space, and no increase has been noted in slowdowns.\nI believe the creation of bike lanes should be a municipal matter, much better decided by local councillors than by mandates from the province. If the provincial government feels a need to be involved in local city matters, it should create a forum for communication and consultation rather than a set of rules and regulations. Surely the provincial government should be spending time and energy on matters that interest the citizens of Ontario, not just the citizens of Toronto.\n"

I bicycle commute from Dundas West to Spadina along Bloor every weekday, and especially during rush hour, the bike lanes are packed with cyclists. Removing the lanes would not only put these many cyclists at severe risk of negative traffic interactions, injury, and death, but likely add to congestion by re-integrating slow moving vehicles (bikes, e-bikes, etc.) into the traffic flow. This will put my life at risk during my daily commute.\nCountless studies world-wide have shown that bike lanes effectively reduce traffic congestion. This move to reduce bike lanes in Toronto with a stated objective of reducing congestion is not supported by evidence. Creating healthy, live-able cities is widely agreed upon by experts to include public transit networks and bike lanes. Increasing the presence of idling, polluting vehicles in the city, driving up air pollution and increasing rates of the multitude of diseases that have been linking to air pollution, while removing safe and effective ways to get people moving (bike lanes) is a seriously bad public health decision and will end up costing Canadian taxpayers more.\n"
