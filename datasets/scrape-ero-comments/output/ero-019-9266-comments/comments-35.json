        "comment": "This is by far the most misguided proposal on the table. Bike lanes have been proven in effect to reduce traffic by providing alternative safe options. I had never once biked as an alternate to a car until a comprehensive bike lane system was in place in Toronto. This is both a life saver, a cost savings and a right step forward in a world facing climate change.\nThe overreach and tone deaf nature of this bill continues to amaze me. Please stay in your lane and focus on more important issues like LRT delays which will also only improve city traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this proposal. Most cars have only one person in them. Why does that one person get more entitlement to the road just because they have a giant metal box around them? A medium sized car takes up as much space as 5 bicycles. More people on bikes means less people in cars, which means less congestion on the roads. The legistration should be the other way around: all new roads MUST be constructed with bike lanes built in from the beginning. Don't pass this ridiculous and backwards thinking bill. I thought you were supposed to be the \"Progressive\" conservatives. How about living up to that sometime?\n"

        "comment": "We must transform our congested cities into livable, walkable, bikeable, greener, safer places for everyone. Cycling reduces pollution, reduces traffic congestion by getting people out of their cars, promotes a healthy lifestyle and increases local economic activity as it is vastly easier to do multiple local errands/appointments, etc. by bike than by car. It also encourages people to eat out, particularly if the evening includes alcoholic beverages (this part should interest Mr. Ford, obsessed as he is with alcohol). These improvements to urban dwelling have been proven in almost every city in the world (Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Barcelona, New York, Washington, Portland, Seattle) which has INCREASED the number of bike lanes. This government\u2019s obsession with cars and highways has to stop. It is literally killing us. I am a taxpayer and a cyclist and I object to this pointless government over-reach in the strongest possible terms.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will increase traffic. We need more options for people to get around. I bike to work for 10 months of the year because I feel safe in a bike lane on Richmond or Adelaide st in downtown Toronto. Without one, I would be driving. I can think of thousands of others who do so, and likely more if we built a proper, connected bike network. That would reduce traffic in downtown Toronto.\nBike lanes are also way cheaper than building more transit. The bang for buck is much higher.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of our infrastructure. The province should not have a say as to where municipalities choose to have bike lanes as the province is not local. We should be working to improve alternative means of transportation rather than relying on cars to get us places. Perhaps if people had reliable and safe alternatives, more people would commute via bicycles which would reduce grid lock for those who drive. Forcing municipalities to get approval from the province is creating unnecessary redtape and putting a band aid on the problem. It will also only make roads less safe for cyclists. This is a horrible idea.\n"

I believe municipalities would be best suited to do their own urban planning, unless it impacts a provincially owned road (e.g. bike lane on a 400 series highway).\nThe province should also be focused on finishing provincially owned transit projects, which would have biggest commute times (including significantly delayed transit projects, where construction is slowing down car traffic).\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is not backed by science or logic, and will only serve to degrade the wellness and environment of those in and around Toronto.\nI use my bike to transit almost everywhere in this city, year-round. Six cyclists have already been killed on Toronto roads in 2024. Losing bike lanes means losing more lives.\nIf you look at the situations surrounding their deaths, they can be linked almost directly to poor infrastructure and compliance to the laws (both by cyclists and drivers)\nMr. Ford seems perfectly content to cut off Toronto's nose to spite its face, despite research from around the world indicating that his \"solution\" will only exacerbate traffic and kill more people.\nMy partner and I are looking to start my family in Toronto, but if bike lanes are removed, my life - as well as those of thousands of other cyclists - will be put in danger.\nFor example, I cycle down Yonge from Eglinton to Bloor daily. I am a safe cyclist. I signal, wear highly visible clothing, and keep as far to the right as is reasonable. On the stretches of Yonge where there are no bike lanes, I have had so many near misses where negligent drivers swerve to take a right turn, cutting me off and nearly hitting me. This -obviously - does not happen when there are protected bike lanes.\nFurthermore, intentionally degrading the cycling infrastructure in favor of more car infrastructure will ultimately increase the number of cars on our roads, increasing emissions and further polluting our province.\nFinally, the logic of this proposal is unbalanced and unfair to those who wish to introduce new bike lanes. The proposal could \"compel municipalities to collect and provide information to the province on existing bike lanes where a lane of traffic was removed.\"\nWhy is Mr. Ford not held to the same standard? Why can we not also compel HIM to collect and provide information to his constituents on existing car lanes where a lane of cyclist traffic was removed?\nI believe it is because he is well aware that his proposal has no scientific, environmental, nor moral foundation.\nThe proposal itself admits that it has not analysed the impacts to the environment: \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new cycling lanes.\" How can we allow this to pass without any analysis being conducted?\nIf we want to achieve our climate goals, we cannot aim to increase car use. This is completely counterproductive.\n"

        "comment": "I use bike lanes to get to and from work, and to my kids school for pickup. Today I used Toronto Bike Share to get to work after walking my children to school, and same on return trip. Bike lanes help keep me and my family safe.\nOn top of this, many studies shows better designed roads (including bike lanes) help reduce aggregate travel times including people on bikes. Plus, there is improved safety for people on bikes as well as pedestrians.\nAs a former riding executive for the PC party, this will cause me to vote against the party. It just will negatively impact my life to a very high degree.\n"

I think one of the biggest improvements we\u2019ve made in the city recently is the expansion of the bike lane network. I feel safer when cyclists have their own lane separate from traffic. I believe that giving people a safe way to bike around the city encourages more people to get out of their cars and improves traffic flow for everyone. That\u2019s why I believe this act is not only a waste of taxpayer money but will also make congestion much worse.

That's what keeps traffic moving. Besides, where else will someone in a big car or truck stop to make a delivery? They'll definitely hold up traffic.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, remove governments that want to remove bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are incredibly important to getting around Ontario. As a resident, I rely on them on a daily basis, as bicycles are my main mode of transportation. I do not own a car, nor am I currently in a position to buy one. The bike lanes help keep me safe, and removing them will only force me to bike in the road, which most certainly will not help congestion, safety, or anyone's happiness.\nBeyond that, this act is a gross overreach of the provincial government. This is the very definition of adding red tape to getting things done, and it's incredibly disappointing to see a government that touts decreasing red tape and strong mayor powers propose this.\nGiven that hypocrisy, we can only conclude that this is either a power grab, lines someones pockets, or is an attempt to incentivize anti-cycling voters to vote for you. None of these are acceptable of a government meant to be looking after its citizens and it most certainly won't be forgotten if passed.\n"
