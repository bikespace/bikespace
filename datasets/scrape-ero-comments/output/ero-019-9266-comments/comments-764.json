        "comment": "I have previously submitted a comment about how:\n- the removal of bike lanes is making municipalities dangerous for the public,\n- businesses from around Ontario (and specifically in Toronto) are against the removal of bike lanes, which allow for a lot more customers to frequent them\n- focusing on cars in dense municipalities is detrimental to the quality of life of everyone involved through congestion, pollution, noise, physical health, and mental health\nToday however, I would like to address the specific parts of Bill 212 that have to do with the expediting of highway 413 and future highways.\nFor one, it is frankly appalling that the current PC government is looking to make highway construction projects exempt from environmental assessments. In a day and age where we are seeing the very real effects of climate change like warm winters and increased rainfall, I cannot fathom why projects that increase our carbon footprint and destroy natural habitats are being considered to be allowed without any restriction.\nI also oppose the portion that allows the government to extradite land from individuals for the creation of highways. While I know that acquiring land for public services can be difficult, I would be much less against this portion of the proposed Bill 212 if it made reference to public transit projects instead of highways. We do not need any more highways in an area as dense as the GTA - the province should focus on delivering transit projects that it has already promised years ago and look forward to new ones like high speed commuter rail to alleviate currently congested highways.\n"

Bloor St. West from Islington to the South Kingsway is often jammed with vehicles while the bike lanes are, for the most part empty.  I support removing the bike lanes at least on Bloor West.\nWith the Gardiner construction already extending my commute, these unnecessary bike lanes have added even more wasted time.\nIt takes at least 45 minutes now to drive from my home to my office at Carlton & Church, and longer in the afternoon.\nI can drive during rush hour to Scarborough faster as I often visit a building at McCowan and Ellesmere that I manage.\nAfter these frustrating commutes, I avoid going downtown on weekends.\n"

(Incidentally, I am also a car owner.) To this I add that, in addition to Toronto, my experience in commuting by bicycle has included several years of living and working in the Netherlands, France, Spain, and Japan.  In all of those other countries, extensive networks of bike paths is the norm, rather than the exception.\nWhat I want to convey is that there are no simple \u201ccommon sense\u201d solutions to the complex problem of traffic gridlock.  In particular, not only is it unlikely that blindly removing bicycle lanes will reduce traffic gridlock over the medium to long term, but many existing scientific studies provide evidence that installing additional properly designed bike lanes will in fact eventually reduce gridlock \u2026 in addition, critically, to increasing health and safety of our population.\nThe City of Toronto has invested heavily in carrying out responsible evidenced-based research to support the design of the bicycle lanes that have been installed over the past few years.  The City of Toronto has also stated that it is willing to carry out any improvements that may be revealed in the design of existing bike paths, in addition to any necessary improvements in any future bike lanes.  To remove existing bike lanes, and prohibit future bike lanes, rather than improving them \u2026 especially in the absence of any hard evidence that removing them would produce improvements in traffic flow \u2026 would be not only irrational, but also potentially dangerous to present and future cyclists whose lives those bike paths are protecting.

        "comment": "This legislation - among other things - is a huge step backwards for simply equalizing and sharing public space in Toronto between cars, cyclists, transit, pedestrians, and all users. I moved here ten years ago, and since then, dedicated city planners have gradually improved the public realm by giving people more options to get around, whether that's by bike, walking, wheelchair, public transit, etc. It's shameful that the premier and those enabling him refuse to acknowledge that simply sharing public road space, which is what this is about, is good public policy. It gives people options. It promotes active transportation. It reduces peoples fear of biking, which is why so many people do not. And it still makes space for people who drive.\nAll provisions of this legislation that usurp the city's democratic authority to make decisions about its use of space should be struck from the legislation. Myself and many others will organize around this overreach and you will not succeed. Mark my words: you will not succeed. Allocating public space equally makes all the sense in the world, that's what great livable cities do. Doug Ford is holding us back. I oppose this legislation, and I will do everything in my power to vote the PC's out of office next cycle, and going forward forever.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Ontario - but not Toronto. I did live in Toronto for 5 years. During that 5 years I never once rode a bike or drove a car on any of Bloor, Yonge or University. I did ride the subway in to these places daily. Toronto is a large city, and Ontario is an even larger province. Transportation matters pertaining to individual streets in a particular city is a municipal matter, not a provincial one. Creating new red tape and regulation that hinders municipalities from making decisions in their best interest, in the way described in this Bill, is a clear case of government overreach.\nI no longer live in Toronto, and I did not pay for the construction of the bike lanes on these streets. If Torontonians decide that these bike lanes aren't working for them, they can decide to have them removed at their own expense. Why should I have to pay for their removal through my provincial taxes?\nThere was gridlock before the bike lanes, and there will be gridlock after they are removed. Gridlock is caused by excessive levels of vehicle traffic. The solution to traffic is higher capacity forms of transportation such as walking, cycling and especially public transit. Optimize for the number of *people* using a roadway (not the number of vehicles) and you'll be able to move more people. Cars are an incredibly space inefficient, low-capacity way to move people around the the downtown of our largest and most important city. Please pick a way of reducing gridlock that will actually work.\n"

        "comment": "For the record, I am both a motorist and a cyclist. The proposed removal of bike lanes in downtown Toronto is one of the most backward looking, anti-evidence, wasteful, and small minded policies I have ever seen. I have been supportive of how Premier Ford has managed a number of tough issues, but if this policy proceeds I cannot in good conscious continue to support his government or vote for it in future elections.\nThe bike lanes make the road safer for all road users and reduce the opportunity for potentially tragic car-bike-pedestrian interactions. Premier Ford used to support this perspective when he was part of city council. What changed? Evidence from around the world is clear: bike lanes help reduce congestion, lower carbon emissions, provide valuable low cost transportation alternatives, increases healthy behaviours like cycling, and save lives.\nMy tax dollars have paid for the expansion of the cycling infrastructure, and right as we are finally able to enjoy the fruits of this endeavor, the province is planning to waste my tax dollars to remove them,  creating further construction delays in areas of the city that have been plagued by projects over the past decade.\nThe rhetoric on this issue is also causing real harm to people on the street. Some motorists have taken this anti bike lane sentiment to signal open season on dangerous driving around the bike lanes or aggressive behaviour towards cyclists. It is not hyperbole to say that lives are at stake here. This has to stop.\nFinally, when the proposal was updated recently I had been under the impression that the rules required that the ERO posting window would be extended. However, I see that it has not. While potentially appearing insignificant, this is an abuse of process which gives me great concern.  Instead of providing the proper opportunity to consult with those impacted the province seems set on this destructive course no matter what it hears. For shame.\n"

        "comment": "I feel that this bill is being maliciously put forward to intentionally harm the very idea of modes of transportation alternative to individual motor vehicles, which not only financially benefits the Premier and his immediate friends, but would be monetarily detrimental to the average person, and ecologically damaging to the natural environment that we all rely on. A competent government would be trying to expand alternative transit to alleviate road traffic, rather than unseriously doubling down on modes that actively pollute the air we breathe and reinforce the bottom lines of corporations trying to instill complete reliance on their products and services on ordinary people.\nIn addition, the proposals made for the expropriation of land for various purposes without the need of providing adequate notice to whoever is currently living on that land will overwhelmingly likely be used to further racist outcomes by seizing land disproportionately being utilized by non-whites, and for the benefit of the Premier's land developer friends. This is reprehensible and another mark against this bill.\nThe proposals related to highway 413 are of a similar nature. Giving an exemption ecological impact assessments to the Premier's pet project and direct line from his driveway to the rest of the province is frankly offensive and makes this government look like a joke.\n"

The fastest route is along the Bloor Street bicycle lane from High Park Avenue to St. George Street and then along the St. George Street bicycle lane south until I finally reach my destination at Queen Street West and University Avenue. I would take the University Avenue bike lane which would have me avoiding riding in traffic along Dundas Street but they have been closed due to construction. If the Bloor Street bicycle lane is removed it will take me longer to get to work and home, thus spending less time with my family. Many if not most of the side streets are not direct routes due to a lack of city planning two centuries ago which is the reason for longer travel times on this route.\nStudies have shown that the contribution of bicycle lanes to automobile congestion is negligible. If the lanes are removed, there will be the same congestion, just with more cars.\nInstead of removing bicycle lanes, the province should focus on encouraging more people to commute to work by promoting public transit and cycling, not going back to the idea that the city is made for cars at the expense of pedestrians and bicycles with little thought for health and safety.\n"

Removing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue prioritizes motor vehicle traffic over the lives of cyclists and the environmental health of our communities. These bike lanes are essential lifelines for riders, creating safer commuting options and reducing reliance on cars. Stripping away existing infrastructure will force cyclists into unsafe conditions, directly increasing the risk of accidents and fatalities while discouraging sustainable transportation choices.\nMoreover, granting the province sweeping authority over municipal decisions erodes local autonomy and disregards the expertise of city planners who understand the unique transportation needs of Toronto. Bike lanes have proven environmental and economic benefits, reducing emissions, alleviating congestion, and fostering vibrant, livable neighbourhoods. This proposal is not about alleviating gridlock\u2014it\u2019s about rolling back progress on safe, multimodal transit solutions. Instead of tearing down bike infrastructure, the government should focus on expanding it to meet the needs of a growing population while committing to the safety of all road users, not just auto drivers.\n"

I participated in the public consultations regarding the bike lanes introduced along Royal York Road, which were true public consultations where the city and the Counselor sought community input.\nThe 'public consultations' held by the city prior to bike lanes being installed along Bloor Street W, and after the installation, were not consultations. The City continues to provide false information on the impact of the bike lanes along Bloor Street on the community. The data provided at the second meeting was rediculous. Residents know that during peak times, the traffic in the area is dramatically impacted by the bike lanes. We continue to see ambulances stuck on Bloor, or diverted along Glenroy and other residential streets that do not have sidewalks.\nAdvocates for the bike lanes are generally not from our neighbourhood. They are from other areas of the city.\nThank you to the provincial government for stepping in to address this rediculous situation.

More accidents means less safety, more time stuck in traffic and therefore more congestion - not less. It also means lives lost needlessly, when our current system with bike lanes as part of it does so much to prevent this and keep drivers, cyclists and pedestrians safe and moving.\nI ask the government to reconsider this bill, and do what is best for us all for our safety, ease of access and prosperity - and keep existing bike lanes on Toronto and Ontario\u2019s streets, allowing municipalities the freedom to choose what transport setup is best for their citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill as it will have the following negative consequences:\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"
