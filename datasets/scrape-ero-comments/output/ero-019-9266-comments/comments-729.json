        "comment": "What kind of roads would you want your grandkids to bike on?\nI grew up in small town Ontario where biking as a child was fun. Adults seldom ride but for the odd hardcore health buff.\nMoving to downtown Toronto 30 years ago I discovered over time that cycling is one kind the few reliable ways to get to work. Transit is slow and less reliable, although great to have when it\u2019s raining - looking forward to more of it. As a careful cyclist I\u2019ve still had many close calls - we live in a busy and distracted City.\nI truly learned the value of bike lanes when my son started biking to high school to cut his transit commute time by more than half. Bloor near High Park was a key part of his path, and as a parent I was relieved to know he had a relatively safe path to and from school.\nCity life, where a 7km transit commute takes an hour on average, can be much ameliorated by the ability to safely cycle to work, giving my family more time together and not having to add yet another car to our roads and congested parking.\n"

        "comment": "Put simply: removing bike lanes will not improve congestion in Toronto or anywhere else. The true causes of traffic are 1) too many people choosing cars as their transportation mode; 2) underfunded and inadequate public transit; 3) eternal construction on such projects as the Eglinton and Ontario lines; 4) frequent car crashes which block roadways; 5) legal and illegal street parking. If you truly want to reduce congestion, work on these problems.\nBike lanes make roads safer not only for cyclists but for pedestrians, people using public transit, and even drivers. Having bikes and cars separated from each other, and reducing lane-switching and other aggressive behaviour by drivers, makes crashes between motor vehicles less frequent and less severe. Please do not endanger ALL road users with this ineffective and uninformed policy.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Ontario, I am appalled by the clear overreach of Bill 212. Municipalities know their streets best and should be in charge of how they\u2019re designed and used.\nI drive in Toronto and throughout the Province and traffic is absolutely a problem; however, the research is very clear that providing safe alternative modes of transportation like bike lanes can actually reduce congestion and save lives.\nThe statistics being used to tout this bill are skewed. The data shows that more people cycle when there are bike lanes. Additionally, cyclists won\u2019t disappear if there aren\u2019t bike lanes but they will have to bike in the street, slowing traffic and risking their safety.\nWe should be planning cities using reliable and accurate data and expert opinions, not based on politics and power plays.\nInvesting more in public transportation and supporting municipalities' efforts to encourage active transportation would be more effective at reducing traffic.\nFurther, bike lanes have been shown to support the local economy as cyclists (and pedestrians) are more likely to stop and shop and often spend more than those who drive.\nThe premier of a Province has no business telling a municipality whether they can put bike lanes in or not.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212. Our roads should be safe and accessible to all people, not just those in cars.\u00a0This shouldn\u2019t be divisive. A variety of transportation options should be available to everyone.\n"

It is incredibly backwards to make cycling, a more accessible, greener alternative mode of transportation, harder and more dangerous to try to ease congestion in the city. Perhaps fining contractors that under-projected construction deadlines, really reinvesting the increased TTC fares back into the system and promoting public alternatives could help keep streets safe, flowing and all of the green P lots filled.\n"

        "comment": "To pass Bill 212 would be to legislate the same unethical and development-driven goals seen in the sitting government's attempt to destroy the Greenbelt. The \"Progressive\" Conservative party touts this act as the solution to Toronto's bronze metal in the worlds most gridlocked cities. However, it could not be more transparent that the outrageous oversight of bike lanes is a distraction from the other 4 profit-seeking schedules contained herein.\nEric Miller, the Director of the University of Toronto's Transportation Research institute has referred to this bill as \"a development play\". It is unacceptable that we are exploring solutions that any undergraduate student pursuing a civil engineering or social sciences degree at one of our province's criminally underfunded public higher education institutions could tell you just how damaging this \"investment\" will be.\nThe broadband easements described in schedule 1 clearly imply the planned use of tolls on proposed highways. This is already a barrier to entry for the 407, a highway that many Ontarians would benefit from using but cannot afford. It's laughable that this \"fiscally responsible\" government eliminated widely accepted sources of income for the province to maintain our roads only to resort to methodology that exploits the working class who are forced to use car-centric infrastructure.\nSchedule 2 gives an unprecedented right to the Ministry of Transportation to take property away from the working class who live in lower socioeconomic neighbourhoods bordering on highways. Countless examples of expropriating land in such neighbourhoods across North America disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Expropriation should be reserved for projects like Berlin's housing expropriation from private corporations for the purpose of providing affordable housing to the city's majority renter population.\nSchedule 3 is an abomination in the environmental protection of Ontario's delicate wetland ecosystems and productive farmland. Unfettered sprawl has reduced wildlife habitats to the detriment of them and us. It is the recipe for the spread of zoonotic diseases and ecological disaster. Car-centric infrastructure is detrimental to our communities when there are better alternatives like high-speed rail and other accessible, affordable public transit solutions.\nIt took 14 years to complete the 407 and it was privatized before it was completed. The 413 is a bypass of a bypass! Building more highways does NOT reduce traffic and, instead, creates induced demand. The only people who stand to gain from this highway are developers and corporate land investors. It is a sick and twisted ploy to waste taxpayer dollars on lining the pockets of the capitalist elite instead of improving the material conditions of constituents.\nSchedule 4 is a transparent distraction to shield the rest of this act from public scrutiny.\nSchedule 5 is, perhaps, the only good part of this bill. As a female-presenting person, I feel unsafe at the idea of predatory tow truck companies (including those backed by local mafia in and around the Hamilton area) preying on me in my time of greatest need.\nThe capitalist and oligarchical elite in the Conservative Party should be laughed at for proposing such a transparent attempt to placate developers who were denied access to protected areas in the Greenbelt. I refuse to stand for the absurdity and cruelty of their corporatist policies that have an immediate benefit to them and them alone while ignoring the deleterious effects it will have on future generations of Ontarians.\nWhat alternatives are there, they may ask? Invest. In. Public. Transit. Moving more people from point A to point B with less space is surprisingly effective at reducing gridlock!\n"

        "comment": "I am completely appalled and dismayed at this completely backwards and dangerous proposal. Evidence clearly states that encouraging people to use alternatives to cars for transportation, makes car transportation more efficient by removing cars from the road. It\u2019s a simple fact, proven with research. I guarantee this plan will backfire horrendously when you have cyclists taking the entire roadway instead of staying in their designated lane, which you\u2019re proposing to remove. Complete nonsense. I know the Ford family has a chronic contempt for anyone who doesn\u2019t drive a car, with the late rob ford telling Toronto city council that cyclists deserve to be run over for using our roads. While entitled, violent and murderous motorists exist all over this province, this creates more potential for criminal road rage conflicts on our roads, putting non-motorists in grave danger. On the other hand there are many drivers who simply aren\u2019t filled with such selfish entitled rage, traffic for cars will get much worse since they will be trailing behind the cyclists who are now forced to take the whole road at 10 km/h. This proposal and this government are downright idiotic, contemptuous, reactive, dangerous, and unproductive. NOT TO MENTION A WASTE OF TAXPAYERS MONEY AND INCONVENIENCE TO BE REMOVING EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT AFTER IT WAS BUILT. This is in no doubt motivated by the only thing that motivates this disgraceful government: misappropriating public funds and resources to put it in the pockets of your elite friends. You disgust me to the core.\n"

Or more cycling deaths - you choose.  Are the gridlocks not due to the short sightedness of the government, deciding to do construction on almost every artery in Toronto and the surrounding area at the same time? And you think removing a few bike lanes is going to solve it?  Wait - sorry - I forgot the long term intention is to ultimately remove all the bike lanes. Wow. You Go Toronto. The rest of the world\u2019s top cities are are adding bike lanes, but Toronto is doing the opposite. Talk about progressive.  Oops - sorry - I almost forgot - this is all about 905 votes and making Doug Ford\u2019s drive into the city supposedly more tolerable.  It is certainly not about making Toronto a world class city.  Wait - why exactly does Doug Ford have a say in our city again??? I missed that part.  Sigh.  I am so tired of this individual, selfish mindset that it\u2019s everyone out for themselves.

It will increase the amount of bike accidents and deaths. It will also negatively affect the local economy as bike lanes drive shopping. Moving forward with this bill would be a step in the wrong direction and I urge you to deny it. Think about whether you would want your loved ones or children to bike within the lanes of traffic on these streets.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill would both put lives in danger and be ineffective in achieving its goal.\nAs one of many commuters in Toronto that travels by bike, this proposal is extremely concerning to me. The City of Toronto staff have worked tirelessly to develop protected bike lanes and expand the Cycling Network. This proposal risks removing sections of protected bike lanes, thereby putting cyclists at even greater risk than they already are. This goes directly against the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Plan.\nThis plan disadvantages residents of Toronto who do not have the means to commute via motorized vehicle, puts the lives of cyclists at risk, and peels back years of hard work on the behalf of the City of Toronto staff, and cyclist advocacy groups like Advocacy for Respect for Cyclists.\nRather than clearing congestion downtown, this proposal would force more cyclists to take up space in one-person vehicles on the road, effectively worsening gridlock.\nRather than putting money into removing bike lanes, Ontario should be funding the creation of more protected bike lanes, reinforcing laws that will make it safer for cyclists to commute, and improving the network and accessibility of other modes of transportation. Encouraging the people of Toronto to use these alternative means of transportation will clear up congestion in the long term far more effectively than another lane (this is a well known phenomenon that has been proven over and over again: https://www.nrdc.org/bio/carter-rubin/new-calculator-shows-bigger-highw\u2026).\n"

Reduction of traffic: especially with people and public service returning to work, traffic is getting out of hand. More people commuting by bike to work means less traffic!\n2. Safety: I personally have been hit by cars twice and injured in Toronto due to a lack of bike lanes and irresponsible driving. There has been an increase in deaths of cyclists even here in Ottawa. The lives and safety of our people depend on bike lanes being put in place.\n3. Even with bike lanes installed, this wouldn\u2019t be enough width on a road to add another car lane, so I don\u2019t see a reason for this ban!\n4. Climate change is getting worse and an increasingly worrying rate. It would be so backwards to put more people in cars and less people on bikes. We need to take preventative measures to change the way we are living and protect people and our planet!\n5.
