        "comment": "this proposed bill is moving the province backwards in several ways.\nfirst and foremost, there is a clear bias being shown by the Minister.  Without laying out the specifics on what would constitute acceptable criteria to install multi-use active transportation infrastructure amounts to a poison pill.  Bills and regulations need to be based on data and reasoning, not feelings and personal opinions.\nsecond, removal of current infrastructure will decrease safety for the people who use the infrastructure and increase the conflict points between drivers and cyclists.\nthird,  the proposal to exempt the proposed highways from environmental assessment to increase project speeds is bordering on criminal.  the processes are in place to ensure all major infrastructure is conducted in a manner to protect the rights of our people and the land which we are stewarts of.\nfourth,  removing land owners ability to appeal a judge to delay an expropriation date is not looking out for the people of our province.  these rules are put in place to protect our rights, not to improve the timeline of elections promises.\n"

One I  sold fairly recently. By the time I left, we had 50 employees. We had 6 parking spots. These were free to use by anyone, without any kind of reservation system. In the 6 years I formed and then operated the company, we never had a conflict.\nWhy?\nThe next generation, including of conservatives, wants to live without a car. Many don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses. The budding bike infrastructure is a recruiting highlight I show to people I\u2019m trying to get to move to Toronto. Scrapping it would be a disaster.\nFurther: it won\u2019t reduce congestion. Please, someone, teach the minister and his staff about \u201cinduced demand\u201d. The only way you can reduce congestion is by giving people safe, reliable, convenient alternatives. The cycling network is not widely used yet, of course, because it\u2019s so small. Please, please, please let it reach critical mass and bring Toronto into the 21st century. Our ability to recruit and retain top talent in the software industry depends on it.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who primarily traverses Toronto as a pedestrian, the addition of bike lanes made me feel safer along Eglinton Avenue, Bloor Street, and University Avenue. Beyond the safety considerations of cyclists, the extra space and raised roadway puts distance between me and traffic on these busy roadways.\nI also find it funny that Doug Ford said this from 2017: \"One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" I can't find the source from 2017 but saw it from this petition below.\nProtected bike lanes save lives. That's the reason they were installed in the first place and often they are added after accidents happen. I don't like the idea of removing them for the convenience of drivers because I consider them to be important safety infrastructure for both cyclists and pedestrians alike.\n"

The bike lanes were studies for years before implementation and every study shows that they do not add much to a driver travel time. But more important than traffic, is safety which bike lanes have shown to prevent deaths on our streets. 6 cyclist have dies this year because most streets are far from safe, why make the most popular cycle routes were cyclist makeup up to 42% of the traffic on these routes also unsafe.\n"

This is the worst idea I have heard coming out of a provincial government in a long time.\nThese lanes serve thousands of people daily who would otherwise be 1) clogging the roads by driving 2) adding to the already crowded TTC or 3) biking on the street and taking the full lane, as is their right, and slowing down traffic.\nI urge the government to focus on the things that are actually within their jurisdiction and work to solve the healthcare and housing crises plaguing this province.\nWhere is your minister of red tape reduction in all of this? It sure seems like the province is inserting itself into municipal matters and adding red tape to the process of getting roads built.\n"

        "comment": "To the Environmental Policy Office,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which seeks to remove crucial bike infrastructure in Toronto and halt the development of new bike lanes. As a future educator studying at OISE with the goal of teaching in the Toronto District School Board, I see cycling infrastructure as vital to Toronto's sustainable growth, response to climate change, and the mobility and safety of its residents.\nCycling is an essential part of our city\u2019s transportation ecosystem, offering an environmentally friendly, affordable, and healthy alternative to car-based transit. Removing bike lanes, as proposed in Bill 212, would discourage cycling and intensify gridlock by forcing more residents back into cars. Studies repeatedly show that increased cycling infrastructure can alleviate traffic congestion rather than worsen it. For example, a 2016 study conducted by the FLOW Project found that New York bike lanes had minimal impacts on congestion and even improved travel times in some corridors. In the 2019 City of Toronto Cycling Study, the vast majority of those surveyed (including residents of North York, Scarborough, and Etobicoke) stated that they want to travel more by bicycle. Residents are continually pushed into car travel due to concerns over cycling safety, which will almost certainly be exacerbated by removing essential and safe cycling infrastructure on Bloor, Yonge, and University.\nMoreover, Toronto has committed to ambitious climate action goals through its TransformTO Net Zero Strategy, targeting net-zero emissions by 2040. Expanding bike infrastructure is essential to achieving these goals. Active transportation reduces reliance on fossil fuels, directly supporting Toronto\u2019s climate action strategy. Limiting or removing bike lanes runs counter to these commitments and undermines the city\u2019s environmental leadership.\nFurthermore, the lack of bike lanes disproportionately affects lower-income residents and young people, who may rely on cycling as an affordable and accessible mode of transportation. Cutting down bike lanes limits their mobility, amplifies inequalities, and creates further dependence on costly and sometimes unreliable public transit options.\nBill 212 threatens Toronto\u2019s progress toward a sustainable, resilient future. Investing in safe, efficient cycling infrastructure is not merely a financial expense but an essential commitment to public health, equity, and environmental stewardship. Access to safe transportation should be a universal right, not a partisan issue. This bill is a blatant attempt to serve the premier\u2019s political ambitions rather than the best interests of Toronto\u2019s residents. I urge the committee to consider the long-term impact of this legislation and advocate for expanding\u2014not dismantling\u2014Toronto\u2019s cycling infrastructure.\nSincerely,\nA Concerned Toronto Resident\nFLOW Project (2016).

Lord knows we have enough idiots on the road already.\nMy uncle is a perpetual drunk who regularly drunk drove. How fortunate they finally took his license before he killed someone, but he told me the other day the only reason he hasn't bothered to get it back is that he gets along just fine on his bike. GOOD. To this day he still drinks but at least he's riding around in something that won't kill anyone.\nThe second you take away those lanes he's getting right back in a car, license or not according to him.\n"

This includes the Yonge, University, and Bloor bike paths. These paths have chnaged my life for the better and greatly improved my community. I cannot understand why the governent would overreach like this and introduce more red tape to destroy and prevent measures that promote safety and public health. Bike paths also support my transit use as it makes it easier to get to and from transit stops. When I do drive, I am much more comfortable knowing where to expect cyclists to be instead of them weaving in and out of car lanes.\nRemoving and preventing bike lanes destroys infrastructure that is essential to my life style.\n"

        "comment": "Our provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy that will slow down efforts by local governments to make changes desired by their voters. If locals want more transportation options in their area, the province shouldn't be getting in the way. This bill proposes changes that would reduce our freedom of choice, putting further pressure for people to use cars as their exclusive means of transportation and commuting.\nBikes are an essential component of our transportation infrastructure that helps reduce road traffic while being cheaper to implements and maintain. They help connect other transit options by making trains and buses more accessible, without requiring massive carparks. It's a great option that supports safe, family friendly communities and improves the riders physical health. The main roadblock to increasing ridership is the fact that we don't have very much bike infrastructure. Incomparably less than car infrastructure. This bill to further restrict the already lacking bike infrastructure will have an effect opposite to it's stated goal. Remove bikes will increase gridlock and waste time. On top of that, it will cost tax payers to rip up existing bike infrastructure, in some cases replacing it with expensive car infrastructure.\nSay NO to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "The city of Toronto should not be burdened by the bureaucracy of the province in what its citizens decide is the best for themselves. Anecdotally, I count more bicycles in the bike lanes during rush hour than there are cars. There are record bike share numbers reported by each year. Removing the bike lanes will completely hinder or halt the countless people I see taking their kids to school in cargo bikes, getting groceries, and lending their patronage to businesses on a whim (something cars cannot easily do because of their size and cumbersome nature). This number of cyclists is 44% by the way, 70% of us ride bikes, 44% of us use them for utility, and yet theres only a sparse number of bike lanes compared to the cars which are catered to when those able bodied could leave their cars at home and take public transit/bike like the rest of us.\nMy girlfriend and I shop every 2 weeks using our bikes, transporting nearly 100 pounds of groceries on them, and this is only possible because we have an uninterrupted bicycle lane network from our apartment at Church and Wellesley to T&T Supermarket on College. The province run by people held up in the suburbs using Toronto as their playground should not be meddling in the business of inner city dwellers. This decision will kill thousands of people and make 0 difference in traffic once all the cars decide to park in the newly opened lane.\n"

They provide health benefits (saving on healthcare), road maintenance, and improves foot-traffic of local businesses. Nearly every single large city in the world progressively transitions *away* from car transport to public transport, walking, and bicycling.\nThere's many other problems in this province that can be focused on. Let Toronto deal with their own problems and come up with their own solutions.\n"
