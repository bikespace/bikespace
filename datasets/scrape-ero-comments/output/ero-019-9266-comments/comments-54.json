What the provincial government is proposing is called overreach, that thing that this government is supposed to be against.\nWe need better, and better funded, transit options so that people don't feel that driving is their only option. Providing cycling routes, and not tucking them into side streets, claiming they're safer, isn't the answer.\nI'm not sure what mentioning building highways or broadband has to do with the Province inserting its nose in the business of municipalities where it doesn't belong.\nAlso, I just want to point out the irony of mentioning environmental concerns and highway 413 when the former is anathema to this government.\n"

It is not wise to banish cyclists to confusing side streets away from major amenities. Ontario's major cities must be preparing for the future of urban transportation (complete streets) and not going back to the old ways of thinking about city transport (a focus on cars). I have always been an independent voter. This legislation shows me that Doug Ford's conservatives are not wise city builders.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is the best thing I have seen by the provincial government in a long time. Why? Because it is bringing common sense to the municipal government of the City of Toronto where lately there is very little. I want bike lanes. I am a cyclist. However, removing lanes of traffic to create under-used bike lanes it is idiotic. Put bike lanes where they add to the movement of citizens not where they hinder people.\nThank you Government of Ontario for bringing this common sense approach to an issue that has been missing some common sense.\n"

        "comment": "This bill as proposed is an unjustified, cruel, and fruitless approach to traffic management which will endanger the lives of cyclists and pedestrians across the province. Not only are bike lanes proven to reduce congestion, they are incredible for accessing main street businesses, public health, and air quality, among other things. Removing existing, popular bike routes in Toronto will simply force cyclists into mixed traffic with cars on the main road, which will increase points of conflict and further slow down traffic - something that neither drivers nor cyclists want. There isn't a single point of data the province has put forward to show conclusively that bike lanes have caused congestion to build up in this city, and tearing them off of Bloor and University will only induce more car traffic and worsen congestion in the core. At a time when most advanced metropolitan centres are moving towards expanding rapid transit, walkability and cycling routes (see Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London etc.), Ontario cannot afford to move in the wrong direction and double down on inefficient car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "In a city with finite space, not everyone can drive and alternatives to driving are crucial to allow movement within the city. When we place moving *people* as the important metric to track (instead of cars), it becomes clear that a focus on cars is counterproductive. Instead, the focus should be on the most efficient means of transportation: transit, walking, and cycling.\nCountless studies illustrate that bike lanes calm traffic, reduce congestion, and are even a boon for businesses. After all, when one is riding a bike, they are intimately connected to their surroundings and can easily stop at a shop that catches their eye. Further to this point, studies have shown that in urban areas, people driving to shops amount to under 10%, whereas 70+% arrived by walking, cycling, and transit.\nStudies also show that in the neighborhood of 50% of all car trips in a city are under 5km. This is a distance that is easily bikeable for a majority of people. Yet, removing bike lanes will have the effect of dissuading cycling for these trips. In other words, the lost potential of removing up to 50% of all local car traffic.\nFollowing the idea of induced demand, removing bike lanes dissuades people from cycling, and at least some of these people will now drive instead. I think we can all agree that a car occupies a lot more space than a bike. So, we counterintuitively find ourselves in the situation where we have added car traffic to fight congestion - not a winning strategy.\nFurthermore, the idea of putting significant money into the removal of bike lanes is an affront to all transit users in this city. The TTC is underfunded and not meeting the needs of people. The Eglinton Crosstown is *still* not open. Funding towards these ends will move a profoundly larger group of people than catering to the car.\nOn a personal level, I use bike lanes every day - for going to work, going shopping, and meeting up with friends at restaurants. If bike lanes are removed, my health will be endangered as I ride along Bloor to work. Merely going shopping may cost me my life. Socializing will occur less frequently (I.e. less business for local restaurants and shops). I implore you to leave management of bike lanes to the local government. I also implore you to focus on provincial priorities, such as getting the Eglinton LRT open, properly funding and supporting health care, and addressing the housing shortage by allowing increased density and dissuading sprawl.\n"

        "comment": "This is an over reach of the province into municipal jurisdiction. Municipalities build road/cycling/multi-use pathway infrastructure around Transportation Master Plans that integrate many elements of moving people effectively. To remove one element of a plan, without understanding the long-term implication is ineffective and costly.\nI expect the Province to focus on the 401 corridor and high speed rail to move people efficiently instead of micro-managing bike lanes. Action in this regard is far to slow and staff could be better used putting the pedal to the metal on getting high speed rail done.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal from this government is nothing short of astounding!\nBike lanes are an important part of MUNICIPAL infrastructure and local decision making. If the provincial government would like to control bike lane decisions on municipal streets, then it should upload the cost of roads and sidewalks to the provincial level!\nIn addition, bike lanes encourage healthier ways of moving around a city that is congested (and no, removing bike lanes will not improve congestion). We need to be encouraging more efficient modes that utilize less space per PERSON (not trying to move the most VEHICLES).\nFlawed policy that I will be speaking about with all my friends (including suburban ones - asking why the premier is obsessed with controlling municipal bike lanes while ignoring the very real needs of healthcare, education and the economy).\nShame on you!\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is such an egregious and disrespectful use of provincial power - that alone should prohibit it from being passed. On its merits, it is an awful and dishonest policy that will do nothing except increase congestion. Each cyclist on a bike is a vehicle that is off of the road, and out of your way. The fact is that Doug Ford cannot or will not understand this is to the detriment to all communters. In the interest of building a reliable and efficient transportation system, cyclists and walkers should be wholly embraced as a relief from vehicle traffic. The high efficiency of pedestrians and cyclists cannot compete with large and wasteful vehicles in the center of a dense city. Banning them will do little to relieve congestion. It feels pointless living in this province when everything is slipping backwards. I don't even have a Dr.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill at all. I understand the intent is to improve traffic. However, bike lanes did not cause traffic. Traffic is caused by single occupant cars. As the city keeps growing, we can't just encourage everyone and their mother to drive a car. I understand that bike lanes aren't meant to solve traffic but they give people a reliable option to not be forced to drive.\nI get it too. Not everyone can bike and that's fine. Not everyone wants to take public transit and that's fine. But a city should not be built so everyone and their mother has to drive a car. When a city is built for cars and it encourages people to drive, traffic worsens.\nA car takes up a lot more space than a bike. It's not even close. Cars are spatially inefficient. It's not a problem when there's low density. However, when there's a lot of population density in places like Toronto, we need to encourage people to use other modes of transportation. That's why the concept of Induced Demand comes into play. By building more roads, you encourage more people to drive. By building fewer roads but improving other modes of transportation, you encourage people to use other modes of transportation.\nThere is no short term solution traffic. Building bike lanes is a pro-active solution. If we don't build now, nobody will be moving an inch in their cars. We should be building for the future. Traffic might be bad at first because it takes time for people to adjust lifestyles but as more people make the switch, there are fewer total cars.\n"

These were recently completed for millions of taxpayer dollars\u2014 to rip them out now will be a colossal waste of money.\nBike lanes are also used by younger people (children, tweens and teens) on bikes, scooters, skateboards, folks using motorized mobility devices, ebikes and escooters.\nThe change is very short-sighted and should be rethought.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes works against all the environmental goals of the province and will be ineffective and expensive according to the majority or research on the subject. The government has provided no actual basis for their claims that it will improve traffic time where as there have been numerous pieces of research around similar projects in large cities all over the world which consistently show that bike lanes increase traffic flow, decrease the number of collisions (not only with cyclists but with all users of the road) and provide increased economic activity in the corridor they are installed in.\nBy removing the bike lanes, you are making it more difficult for people to make the decision to use cycling as their primary mode of transportation. It forces more people back into cars which pushes us away from our climate goals. It also adds more cars to the road which increase congestion. Additionally, adding lanes does not ease congestion in most cases unless you are also addressing the intersections. In fact, in some cases adding lanes cause more issue due to vehicles moving between lanes unpredictably.\nA third documented impact of adding additional lanes is that it increase the cases of speeding in off peak times which again make it more dangerous for all users of the road. This increase in danger is felt most by pedestrians and cyclists who do not have any form of protection from cars and the increase in speed makes these collisions highly likely to be deadly to those outside the vehicle.\nIn summary this measure,\n- will make it more dangerous for all road users\n- will reduce the number of people who choose active transport\n- is unlikely to reduce travel times based on the vast majority of scholarly research\n- will increase the carbon emissions due to the increase of motor vehicles\n- will cost us money both in the short term to do the work and long term for maintenance.\n"

Bike lanes save lives -- fewer cyclists getting hit by cars and going to the hospital ER's means less strain on the healthcare sector. Bike lanes ease congestions and reduce emissions. Further, Bike lanes are necessary because of the severe deficit of transit options Ontarians have and the explosive growth in population over the past 5 years.\nPlease start focusing on actual important intiatives and stop wasting taxpayers time and money.\n"

        "comment": "I am a person who has used most modes of transportation from walking, cycling, transit and the automobile.  I currently use a multi-modal approach to get to where I'm going (car -> train -> walk).\nI'd like to keep this very succinct and based on a single core principle: people need to move their bodies to stay healthy and we should strongly encourage/support an environment where people are able to get where they need to go by human power first (if possible).\nThe best people to organize how that could work should be the people closest to the issue (ie: municipality) but that can be unreliable depending on the person to whom you may be speaking.  I believe the core principle should be used as the measure of how to proceed.  If the municipality can support the core principle then the province should not have to interfere.\nPerhaps the province (if not the nation) should adopt a set of principles that can be discussed and agreed upon.  What do we mean when we say we want to improve traffic flow.  Why aren't we prioritizing how we organize ourselves so people can walk/bike (assuming general good health) to their place of work.  It truly confounds me why we would make life harder for people trying to be healthier with their commutes.  We should be begging people to walk/ride more often as the alternative modes are so much more expensive to provide and the health benefits of moving ones body more could introduce greater savings to the health system in general.  Most environments are downright hostile to people who cycle from where they can/can't store their bikes to not having anywhere to get changed once they do arrive.\nI'm far from anti-car.  One of the best ways to improve my time traveling by car would be to remove cars from our roads.  If people don't have to drive then we don't have to spend billions on roads and the volume of traffic can reduce naturally.\nI'm also a person who had spent years riding to work (15-18 km plus an escarpment climb) all year round.  I'm not a small person and I'm not a young person.  If I can do it, many people can. The one thing that really made that possible to achieve was the availability of a proper bike lockup and changing facilities at the office.  Something that was only present because a senior person at the organization demanded it.  This is a rarity though.\nThe gridlock problem is multifaceted.  There are people who need to drive but there are other people who may be able (if supported/encouraged) to use alternative locomotion that simply involves moving their bodies.  Before we can enforce any strategy, I'd like to see Canadians support organizing ourselves around a set of principles that facilitate healthier locomotion first.  Then spend money on the more expensive solutions, second.  We need to leverage and optimize the cheaper, healthier options first.\n"
