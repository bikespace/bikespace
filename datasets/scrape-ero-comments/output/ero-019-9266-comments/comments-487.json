The current traffic challenges this city faces will not be resolved by bike lane removal. Money would be more wisely spent on the betterment of public transit and expansion of bike lanes.\nThe lanes are also something that my family and children feel safe using. The removal of them will only endanger the lives of city residents.\nDenying their use and importance to the city and our environment is simply short-sighted and negligent.\n"

        "comment": "If we take out bike lanes that will mean more people in cars, which will add congestion to the car traffic. It doesn't make any sense. All the delivery people will have to get cars, so even more car congestion. The best way to reduce gridlock is make cyclists feel safe (bike lanes) and improve transit. If a 10 min bus takes instead 15-30 min to get to you 90% of the time, you are going to feel like buying a car. (This \"10 mi bus that's not 10 min bus\" is the main bus from my neighbourhood to the subway. This is why I generally walk or cycle.) If you look to see how many people generally are in each car, in Toronto it's often 1 person. This is also a problem.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed piece of legislation is short-sighted and a gross overstep onto the juristiction of municipalities.\nBike lanes, particularly those that run along major arteries, are life-saving infrastructures. Cycling allows those who can't drive to get around their cities independently, and allows those who can drive to make an alternative choice that reduces gridlock, congestion, and air pollution for everyone else. As a cyclist, bike lanes along major arteries ensure I can safely access important destinations like public transit connections, buisnesses, and services. These destinations are usually located along major arteries. It is especially important that bike lanes be along clear, direct, and continuous routes as cyclists are not able to safely use GPS devices while riding. Many cyclists will continue to ride on major arteries, whether or not they have bike lanes.\nAs a driver, bike lanes allow me to better see cyclists and ensure we have enough space to share the road. When driving, I appreciate those who choose to cycle rather than add a car to the traffic on my route. Removing bike lanes will not reduce the number of cyclists present on major arteries, but rather increase their death rate. Removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic, but rather increase the number of cars on the road and the number of delays caused by cyclist fatalities.\nWhere to install bike lanes should be solely up to municipalities and their residents.\n"

        "comment": "What a waste of taxpayer money. Why is the provincial government meddling in municipal matters? Why are you going to undo progress in a city and why should the taxpayers of Sudbury or Newcastle or Windsor or Ottawa pay for the removal of bike lanes in Toronto? And who is going to compensate the municipal taxpayers of Toronto for the money their city already spent putting in these bike lanes and conducting studies on these bike lanes? I mean, it's pure stupidity to say \"oh, we'll pay to remove the bike lanes\" and think that's good enough to compensate for the loss. We've already spent millions of dollars to put them in. How are you going to get rid of gridlock by returning those areas to a construction zone AGAIN? They've already dealt with the construction of the bike lanes, and now you want to put the businesses and residents of that area through more construction? Do you not have better things to do and spend money on? Housing? Highways? Healthcare? Buck a beer?\nAnd that's just the financial considerations. What about the safety? What side street should Toronto choose to replace the Yonge St bike lane? There's no north/south street that meets the requirement. So cyclists will just have to bike down Yonge anyway, just like they did before, but now they'll be in traffic. Dangerous. And slow. I'm a cyclist, and I can tell you, cars don't like it when we take the lane, even when we have the right to do so for our own safety. Wouldn't it help with gridlock if the slow cyclists were off to the side, in their safe bike lane? Why do you want them in the street? Have we not had enough cyclists die this year? Are you aware that cyclists are taxpayers? A dead cyclist doesn't pay taxes or contribute to the economy. Even if the cyclist isn't killed and is just injured, they may not be able to work, and they're going to burden the already overburdened health care system. I thought Conservatives were supposed to be good with money. We don't care if Doug Ford has to sit in traffic for an extra two minutes. His inconvenience is not worth a cyclist's life.\nAnd since this bill is supposedly about the environmental impacts of gridlock - you do know that bicycles are human powered, right? Like, they don't create pollution. If more people felt safer to bike, fewer cars would be on the road. So there'd be less car pollution. When I commute to work, biking in the bike lane, blowing by all the cars lining up - I think to myself, \"boy, I'm glad I'm not a car in this line\". And if I wasn't biking, I would be a car in that line. Creating pollution and not getting exercise. Then I get to the intersection and see why there's such a long line of cars. It's drivers, blocking the box. Not bike related delays - just stupid driver delays. Removing the bike lanes won't fix stupid drivers.\nHave you looked at places where the cycling network is better than ours? Shouldn't we be aiming to improve cycling infrastructure so more people feel safe to bike? Bike lanes are essential to that. If there aren't bike lanes to bike in, people are going to have to take the lane for their own safety. And driving behind a slow cyclist going up a hill isn't going to reduce gridlock. It will probably just create road rage and more dead cyclists. There are going to be dead cyclists on the routes the province has either prevented bike lanes from going into, or ripped already built bike lanes out of as a result of this stupid, ill-informed bill. And to anyone who votes to pass this bill - I hope you can't sleep at night. I hope the guilt of their blood on your hands keeps you awake. Shame on you.\n"

        "comment": "Concerns Over Bike Lane Removals\nI am reaching out to express my concerns regarding the recent allocation of taxpayer funds toward the installation of bike lanes, only for these lanes to be removed shortly afterward. This cycle of installation and removal not only raises questions about the efficient use of public funds but also impacts the daily commute of all drivers including cyclists.\nIn my opinion ongoing  construction projects, the LRT line , the Ontario Line on major roads like University Avenue, Bathurst  and the millions of dump trucks parked in the bike lanes and tons of plastic cones cordoning off parts of the road for condo developments are the culprits to the congestion not the bike lanes.\nToronto has stated its commitment to being a greener city with more accessible public transit and fewer drivers. Are these bike lane decisions aligning with that vision? Not to mention the health benefits of being active.\nCould you provide clarity on the city\u2019s strategy regarding these bike lane installations and removals? It would be helpful to understand how decisions are being made to balance the needs of all commuters while considering the financial impact on taxpayers or should I say the ridiculous waste of taxpayers money.\nToronto has stated its commitment to being a greener city with more accessible public transit and fewer drivers. Are these bike lane decisions aligning with that vision? Could you share more about the city\u2019s strategy for achieving these goals while balancing the needs of all commuters?\nAs an aside ;\nI chose to start riding my bike daily as everyday I encountered a problem with the ttc and at weekends I have to take a shuttle bus . By cycling I can be comfortably at work within 40mins . On average if I relied on TTC it would take me 80 mins !\nIt isn\u2019t rocket science to why I cycle.!\nIf Doug Ford wants to spend our money ripping out exsisting bike lanes why doesn\u2019t he spend it on making the TTC more efficient .\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with bill 212. Bike lanes are an essential part of modern urban infrastructure.\nWhen I was young, I lived on a road that did not have sidewalks. Instead, there was a bike lane that often was shared between pedestrians and bicycles. Walking in these bike lanes was my only option to get to the nearby bus stop, mailbox, and friends homes. Without this lane, I would be trapped in my home, relying on two working parents for rides, or walking on the narrow curb of vehicle traffic moving at speeds of 70 km/h. The bike lanes around my home were essential for my freedom of movement as a young person.\nAs someone who now primarily drives, I find bike lanes are a safer and more comfortable option for all road users. It keeps traffic separated, which allows us all to travel without worry about collision. When there are no bike lanes, or the lanes are in poor condition, I and many drivers often have to move over to allow room for the bicycle. Occasionally, this involves  either slowing down or crossing into the lane for traffic in the opposite direction. It's the very dangerous alternative to separate lanes. I would hate to see disappear.\nLastly, in areas where we have already invested in robust bicycle infrastructure, tearing them out will be massive increased cost for very little to no benefit. I don't want my tax money spent on making the quality of life worse for residents of Ontario's largest city and every other community across the province. Traffic relief within a city is not a matter for the provincial government, but for the municipal government. Let Toronto govern Toronto streets.\nBicycles are going to exist on the road regardless. It is an environmentally friendly, affordable and healthy mode of transportation that is only going to increase in popularity in the coming years. This bill will set Ontario back decades and quite frankly it is embarrassing this is up for debate.\n"

I have a car and I regularly use the Bloor, University, Richmond, and Adelaide bike lanes. I've never been better able to safely get to and from home, work, groceries, and social activities without using my car like I can now. This has been a game changer for my health and wellbeing. Having more physical activity in my day helps me manage chronic pain without prescription medications or the need for regular visits to my family doctor.\nI am concerned that:\n1) If cyclists do not have their fair share of space on roadways, we are going to see more people driving (thus contributing to traffic) and more accidents involving vehicles and cyclists (thus contributing to healthcare costs);\n2) The government is not behaving in a fiscally responsible, sensible, or conservative manner if requiring municipalities to tear up bike lanes or creating red tape for those seeking to enhance access to bike lanes;\n3) This act would help politicians across Ontario justify not pursuing investment in active transport infrastructure (this could have major negative population health and environmental impacts).\nI do not support Bill 212.

        "comment": "I oppose this framework for the following reasons:\n1.\tLocal Authority: Bike lanes fall under municipal responsibility. Cities like Toronto carry out thorough consultations, data analysis, and continuous assessments on bike lane implementation. Provincial involvement does not add value and disregards local expertise.\n\t2.\tIdeology Over Data: Statements from the Premier and Minister suggest this initiative is ideologically driven rather than evidence-based. Research within Ontario and abroad shows that bike lanes have minimal impact on car travel times. The framework\u2019s stated goal of reducing congestion lacks support from actual, well-documented data.\n\t3.\tMisleading or Outdated Data: Officials reference data that is either outdated or irrelevant. For example, the cited figure that only 1.2% of \u201cToronto\u201d commuters bike is 13 years old and covers an expansive area, including regions without cycling infrastructure. Recent studies show high urban cycling rates in Toronto, with many residents using bikes for commuting and daily activities. This selective use of data reflects a political stance, not an informed one.\n\t4.\tMissed Opportunities: This framework diverts attention from actions that would genuinely address congestion, such as expanding public transit and promoting active, environmentally beneficial transportation options. This government should be partnering with municipalities to support bike lanes which would help reduce gridlock.\n\t5.\tCost Implications for Municipalities: The framework fails to specify the costs municipalities will incur to comply, raising transparency concerns. This omission implies that the financial burden will fall on local governments without adequate provincial support.\nOverall, the proposed framework within Bill 212 would hinder municipalities\u2019 efforts to improve cycling infrastructure and does little to achieve its stated objective of reducing gridlock. I am opposed to its implementation.\n"

        "comment": "This is the worst bill to come out for reducing gridlock I've ever heard of. If 100 bicycles pass you on your daily commute, you'll think it's not that many but you'll definitely notice 70-80 extra cars on the road when these bike lanes are removed. The people who bike in Toronto are already a vulnerable part of society who probably can't afford to drive with the price of parking and the cost of insurance. This bill pleases the rich and 1% who already have the luxury of driving. I thought this government was about small government. Adding additional provincial oversight to municipalities goes against conservative values. Additional red tape discourages development and improvements to local economies. Each municipality should continue to be able to make their own decisions on their own roads. Removing protected bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University will not only increase traffic but also place undo harm to the lower class bike riders who already struggle with access to transportation. You are proposing something that will move us backwards as a society.\n"

I commute by bike to work using bike lanes along the waterfront trail, Simcoe, Richmond/Adelaide everyday, and use the bike lanes on bloor and university to run errands regularly. Bike lanes are a vital part of our city infrastructure and important to pedestrian safety. If bike lanes did not exist on my commute route, I would not be biking to work as I have had several dangerous incidents biking on regular streets where no bike lanes exist. The unreliability of the ttc network and it\u2019s ongoing repairs and rerouting of the street cars have made public transit unreliable as a means of getting around the city. Hence, bike lanes are vital for providing choice and access in a city that is rapidly growing. Removing this choice will force more vehicles onto the road, and force cyclists into unsafe situations. We should be expanding and improving our bike network, not taking it away. Bill 211 is regressive and harmful to the city. I strongly oppose Doug Ford\u2019s anti-cyclist stance.\n"
