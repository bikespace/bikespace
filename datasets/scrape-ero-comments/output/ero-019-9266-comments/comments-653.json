It makes no sense that the province should have final say over this; let our cities plan for their futures without this needless, harmful, and expensive red tape.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom it May Concern,\nI use the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes all the time.  I've been biking (as a form of work commuting) for almost 20 years.  When I first moved to the city, there was no bike lane infrastructure and the city was a very dangerous place to cycle, also there were only a hand full of biking commuters then.   Now there are so many bikers within Toronto, bikes lanes seem essential.  For me, these bike lanes provide a safety and security while I'm commuting.  They are an essential part of why I love living in this city.\nBikers have just as much right to road safety as drivers.  Also, I do not believe that bike lanes are causing congestion in the city, I think and the data supports it, that bike lanes take drivers off the road.   What will happen to the 8000 bikers daily that use the Bloor bike lanes?  Likely a portion of them will revert back to driving causing more congestion.  We need a different solution to congestion, possibly a congestion tax for non residents.\nI do not believe the Province has provided sufficient evidence for bike lane removal.  Feels like an emotional decision.   Torontonians know our city better than the province and we want these bikes lanes.  Stay out of municipal decision making.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Ontario, I am against Bill 212 and I ask the Government of Ontario not pass this Bill as it will be ineffective in easing congestion in cities in Ontario. While there are several methods that can help with congestion in city centers, reduce travel times, save businesses money, and spur economic activity, removing bike lanes is not one of them. Rather, this Bill will make congestion worse.\nRemoving bike lanes without due process will not only be ineffective, but it will also increase the risk of injury and death for all road users: pedestrians, cyclists and people driving motor vehicles. Drivers will not arrive to their destination quicker with more accidents on the road - which is what will result from this Bill. The real-world outcome of this Bill will be Ontarians riding bikes being forced into traffic with motor vehicles. This will put everyone at greater risk and slow traffic. Separated bike lanes work not only to protect people who are riding bikes, but they also provide greater safety to pedestrians and drivers, as separating all modes of transportation reduces the risks related to interactions between modes. Many people riding bikes know that the best way they can stay safe without protected bike lanes is by \"taking the lane\": riding in the middle of the lane to prevent people in vehicles attempting dangerous passing maneuvers. As someone who rides a bike, I do not like taking the lane, but I know it is safer than leaving it up to the driver behind me to keep me safe. Whether taking the lane or staying as close to the right side as possible, having people riding bikes in the same lanes as cars will slow everyone down and increase accidents.\nBike lanes are an effective measure to reduce congestion in the city, and therefore their removal will work against the outcome claimed within the Bill. Bike lanes, alongside sidewalks, public transit, and slower speed limits work together to decrease car use in cities. This is because when people have the choice to walk, bike or take public transit, they will do so instead of driving. In a city like Toronto, we need to encourage this as much as possible, especially given our projected population growth, as the alternative is inconceivable: more and more people driving in the city and causing worse congestion. Toronto cannot afford to ignore the power of increasing peoples transportation choices and the impact that it will have on congestion. Imagine if, through more bike lanes, better public transit, and streets that people feel comfortable walking down, 10% of people who currently drive to work chose to take another mode of transportation. The results would be positive for everyone - especially other drivers, who would face less cars on the road and quicker driving times. I know many people in the city who bike every day and some of these people will switch to driving if there were not safe bike lanes for them to take - and the congestion caused by them switching to using a car will be due to this Bill, if passed. Other people who bike will choose to continue but will be put in danger and slow down traffic more without their designated and separated space on the road. When there is an accident due to these unsafe conditions for cyclists, all road users will be at a standstill.\nIt is incredibly disappointing to see something like bike lanes being used to try to score political points, though I know that people are not this easily fooled. My family lives across Ontario, mostly in more rural areas without bike lanes. They have no personal attachment to bike lanes and the advantages that they give to people in cities, but they have myself and others as family members and they want us to be safe when we go to work, visit friends, and support local businesses. Every person who rides a bike in a city has a family and friends who wants them to be safe and will vote for politicians who will work to balance the interests of all road users. Furthermore, when all Ontarians understand that the Ontario government is willing to spend their tax dollars to rip up practically new bikes lanes, wasting millions of dollars, they will be disgusted by the political stunts.\nWe may soon have a great example of a policy to decrease congestion in a city center with the implementation of congestion pricing in Manhattan, New York. While many may be wary of a toll, we know that congestion pricing is effective in reducing congestion in cities, and that the funds collected through this practice can be used to improve public transit in the city center, to ensure that everyone has convenient and equitable access to transportation. These are the kind of policies that the Ontario government should be looking at if it is serious about reducing congestion in cities in Ontario. If a toll is not attractive, some of the least controversial policies for decreasing congestion are building more bike lanes, reducing inner-city sped limits and supporting public transit. These are measures that cities like Toronto are working on, because they are effective and because they are the right level of government to make these decisions. The best way that the Government of Ontario can support less congestion in the city is to support municipalities with funding for bike lanes and public transportation, or at an absolute minimum to not pass Bill 212.\nIf this Bill passes, this government will be long remembered for wasting millions in taxpayer money to make everyone less safe, congestion worse, and businesses less successful. Not only will the signage recently passed by the City of Toronto make sure of this, but residents will remember and will continue to talk about this outrageous overreach and ineffective policy whenever possible. If the Government of Ontario only cares about scoring political points with this Bill, the risk to reelection should be the greatest consideration in your risk analysis of going forward with this Bill.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor Street West, between Runnymede Rd. and Islington Ave. ( and beyond), in the city of Toronto need to be removed.  Taking away lanes of eastbound and westbound traffic in this area has proved disastrous.  They are causing congestion that never existed before their implementation.  This is a backfire in regards to their intended environmental benefit as thousands of cars are now idling  in places they never had to be stopped before.  This is also very dangerous for ambulance emergencies making it almost impossible for these vehicles to get through these restricted stretches of road.  Furthermore, businesses and shoppers alike have lost the convenience of many street parking spots.  The intended consequence of increased bike traffic has not materialized; Bloor is used for subway and car traffic, not biking.  There aren't many ways to cross the Humber river between Toronto and Etobicoke.  It is irresponsible and ideologically delusional to try and restrict traffic flow here.\n"

Before bike lanes, I had many terrifying near-misses with bikes weaving in and out of traffic lanes as they had nowhere else to go. I was constantly worried someone would be harmed. The bike lanes allow more people to commute and to carry out deliveries - the demand for which has increased exponentially since Covid - safely without cars, reducing rush hour strain on traffic and TTC. An entire industry has grown up in bike and e-bike delivery -- if bike lanes are removed, it is not just intrepid commuters who will be put at risk of death and disability, but WORKERS, and the BUSINESSES (restaurants, grocery especially) that employ them. All of our commutes will be negatively affected, and PEOPLE WILL DIE without the layer of safety between bikes and cars. Furthermore, any lengthening of driving times we've experienced has been due to endless construction and highway lane closures - namely the Gardiner exit onto Lakeshore - not bike lanes.\n"

I can say with confidence that added bike lanes DID NOT hinder my travel time noticably, having used University and Bloor Street almost daily. Construction and illegal parking were far more disruptive than any bike lane. Additionally the safety provided by having a dedicated bike lane allowed me to bike more often, leaving my car at home and eliminating it from the road. The government should be trying to encourage cycling and leaving the car at home instead of trying to cram more cars on the road.\nRemoving bike lanes will put bikers safety at risk and cost lives at the cost of the illusion of saving time.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers, negatively impact Toronto\u2019s small business, and have adverse impacts on our climate.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Halifax, Saskatoon, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behavior. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why? These environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more. . Great case studies are cities like\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

The Toronto municipality and the people of Toronto deserve the right to jurisdiction over planning and infrastructure decisions. Doug Ford and the PCs are not qualified to dictate best practices in urban roadway design. The process of Urban Planning ought to be carried out under the expertise of qualified urban planning officials, urban designers, as well as community members within the city of Toronto. We as a municipality, should not have to seek approval of the Province for planning matters such as bicycle lanes. With the proposed removal of bike lanes, planned highways, and destruction of natural public space, The Province is demonstrating a deeply misguided and unsustainable understanding of urban planning, and a total lack of informed decision making. Bill 212 will certainly fail to tackle the urban issues we are facing.\nThere is ample evidence that increasing lanes on roadways leads to an increase of traffic. It is an occurrence called induced demand and it has been historically observed when new lanes are built. Are Doug Ford and the PC\u2019s consulting with professionals in Urban Planning in their infrastructural decisions? Bill 212 is corrupt and deeply misinformed. Bicycle lanes are needed in order to incentivize cycling which will in turn reduce traffic. The central reason there is too mach gridlock is because there are too many cars and a car-culture perpetuating it.\nAs a contributing member of the city of Toronto, I do not feel represented in this decision to remove bicycle lanes and relinquish control of planning decisions to the Province. Cyclists will be killed as a result, and Traffic will continue to worsen. The premier and his team need to urgently give their heads a shake.\nSincerely,\nConcerned Citizen\n"
