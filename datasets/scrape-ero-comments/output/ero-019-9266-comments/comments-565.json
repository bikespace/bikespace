Here is a quote from the bill:\n\"A provision prohibits registered owners form applying under the expopriations act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land that was expropriated by the Ministor for the purposes of priority highway project.\"\nThat means, the government can take your land for a highway and you can't appeal it in court. What does that have to do with bike lanes?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to share my concerns about Bill 212, The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, and its implications for municipal control over bike lane infrastructure. Although I understand the bill\u2019s goal of improving traffic flow, I believe that placing control of bike lanes in the hands of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation would be counterproductive, especially for communities outside of Toronto's downtown core.\nLocal Decisions for Local Needs\nBike infrastructure decisions should be made by municipalities, which have the knowledge to address their unique community needs. The issues surrounding bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue are specific to downtown Toronto. Extending the scope of Bill 212 across the entire province is an unfair response to issues limited to a few streets. Other municipalities that have successfully implemented bike lanes\u2014or are working to do so\u2014shouldn\u2019t be limited by decisions driven by the conditions in one concentrated area.\nEasing Congestion by Offering Real Transit and Cycling Alternatives\nMany Ontarians, especially those visiting or working in Toronto, would prefer not to drive downtown if there were viable alternatives. However, transit options, especially for people coming from regions like Kitchener, often don\u2019t provide sufficient flexibility. For instance, the lack of weekend GO Train service means that a resident of Kitchener wishing to attend a Saturday event in Toronto has no train option, forcing them into a car. Even when GO Train service is available, its frequency and speed are often limited.\nExpanding all-day, two-way GO Train service would significantly reduce the number of cars entering Toronto, benefiting all travelers while easing road congestion. This improvement would align with the broader goal of reducing gridlock by making public transit a more practical choice for those currently dependent on driving.\nPrioritizing Safe and Sustainable Infrastructure\nInvesting in safe bike lanes and reliable transit is essential for making Toronto\u2014and other Ontario cities\u2014more accessible and sustainable. By offering alternatives to car travel, we can move more people with less congestion. Effective bike lanes and improved GO Train service both help create a more balanced, multi-modal transportation system that benefits drivers, cyclists, and transit riders alike. Removing or restricting bike lanes would undermine this goal and likely increase car dependency in downtown Toronto and other areas, contrary to the bill\u2019s intent of easing gridlock.\nI urge you to consider a more balanced approach that allows municipalities to control their bike lane infrastructure and directs provincial resources towards enhancing the GO Transit system. Supporting accessible, dependable, and frequent transit is a more effective path to reduce gridlock than eliminating bike lanes, which would only discourage sustainable transportation options.\n"

The environment comes first, people\u2019s homes come first, health care and educational infrastructure comes first, PUBLIC TRANSIT AND BIKE LANES come first. Do not destroy your land and your province by giving highways priority over just about every thing else that makes our lives better!\n"

There are just disjointed sections and the sections in between them are scary. Motorists get impatient and create life threatening scenarios on the daily.\nWe had 8 cycling fatalities in Ontario this past year. Citizens of our cities are dying on unsafe streets, trying to commute and navigate our cities.\nThe attack on bike lanes is unwarranted and is not the business of the provincial government. Development of biking infrastructure should be left to the municipalities discretion\n"

        "comment": "As a driver in the downtown Toronto core, I am opposed to the provincial government\u2019s proposal to return bike lines on sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue to motor vehicle lanes. The safety of cyclists far outweighs the minimal time that will be saved. As a driver, I feel much safer when bikers have their own lane compared to when they share the lanes with cars. Bikes get far too close to cars and there is always the risk of not seeing a biker coming up quickly right next to the car and either turning or accidentally changing lanes and ending up in a collision. Driving downtown is challenging enough due to traffic and pedestrians. Bike lanes at least show drivers where to look for cyclists and makes them much more obvious. It also keeps the bikes separate from the cars so they don\u2019t get too close - I\u2019ve seen many bikers squeeze past cars and then slap the hood or the side in anger because they don\u2019t think the car gave enough space. Any plan for urban planning needs to take into account safety and comfort for all transportation modes used in Toronto - not just cars. The proposal takes into account only a suburban view of things where the car is king. Toronto needs to be able to support all its people, most of whom take other modes of transport.\n"

Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario\nSubject: Opposition to Provincial Overreach on Bike Lane Decisions\nDear Premier Ford,\nI am writing to express my disappointment with the Ontario government\u2019s decision, through Bill 212, to override municipal authority on bike lane design. This overreach undermines Toronto\u2019s elected officials and disregards the City\u2019s needs for sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nThe decision lacks transparent, data-driven justification and detracts from addressing genuine sources of traffic congestion\u2014namely the delays in the Ontario Line construction overseen by Metrolinx. If the government is concerned with congestion in Toronto, it would be more effective to ensure Metrolinx adheres to its timeline.\nI urge you to reconsider this amendment, respect municipal jurisdiction, and prioritize evidence-based policies.\nSincerely,\nToronto Resident\n"

In tandem with decentivising single occupancy car usage.\nSo, if the main purpose of this bill is to reduce gridlock, it's going against the bulk of publically accessable studies on transit optimization.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly am against this proposal as it does not accomplish its intended goal of reducing traffic but rather creates more need to use a car instead of alternative forms of transport. It is a reductive policy which will only further traffic in the future, while removing other transportation options such as cycling.\nAs a cyclist, I rely on proper infrastructure to get where I need to go safely. I pay the same taxes as those who use cars on the road and yet my form of transportation and my use of the road is continuously underfunded and attacked.\nTo create a policy like this is also an overstep of provincial jurisdiction. It should be up to the municipalities and their citizens how they choose to plan their communities. If cycling is a popular form of transport and there is interest from the community to have more infrastructure to support it, they should be able to make those choices. And they should be able to make progressive infrastructure decisions such as creating divided bike lanes which have been proven to reduce cycling fatalities and increase interest in cycling as an alternative form of transport.\nThis policy will do nothing to reduce traffic congestion. At best, its a poorly veiled attempt by the Ford Government to overstep their power and line their pockets by increasing unnecessary, costly and time consuming road work projects, while trying to appeal to their \"no more bike lanes\" voting demographic. I hope this is shut down. And if its not, I look forward to protesting it.\n"
