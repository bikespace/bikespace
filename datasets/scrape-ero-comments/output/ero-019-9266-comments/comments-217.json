Taking away the bike lane opens up more pedestrians to get harmed. If we're not going to police bikes, enforce rules, safety and training, don't take away the bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not rip up the bike lines. Too many people have already died trying to bike in this city from the lack of good biking infrastructure. A government should not be trying to make it harder and more dangerous for people to get around via a mode of transit that is both affordable and quick. If you want to address gridlock in downtown Toronto, give funding to help quicken construction times so thay roads can open up, put cameras at intersections to ticket people that block the box at key intersections, get rid of street parking on key streets, convert more roads to one-way grids so that cars can make turns quicker/more frequently preventing back up and congestion in turn lanes. Getting rid of bike lines will barely give you one additional lane - the amount of congestion relief you would get from it is miniscule and would come at the cost of the safety of others and eliminating a viable way for people to get around that takes up waaay less space than a car (meaning it actually helps to reduce congestion)\n"

To solve congestion, we need attractive alternatives that include a functioning public transit system, better enforcement of traffic rules, less/faster construction on main roads and incentives to not use a car when it\u2019s not needed. This bill would be a huge step back, making Toronto unsafe and harming the environment.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes have improved my life in the city of Toronto. They have help reduce grid lock by providing safe transportation alternatives. With the new bike lanes I've now become a bike share member. It helps me get through the city in a quick and safe manner. As a young adult I would ride my bike through the city on Bloor and would be terrified. The constant dodging of pot holes and riding next to both moving and parked cars made me constantly uneasy. Worring someone would open their door and cause an unintended accident in a live rode. I would ride in fear. Especially after I flipped over my handle bars after breaking to a car that idled half in and out of a parking position. I fell into a live lane of traffic and was deeply shaken up. I eventually stopped riding all together for over 5 years. With the introduction of the Bloor bike lanes I began trying to ride. I am able to ride along the city with ease and affordability. These bike lanes bring a lot of safety to riders. Please please do not impede the development of new bike lanes. As this infrastructure was something we had been asking for for years and now that we finally got it the provincial government wants to tear it down. It's an essential piece to creating affordable infrastructure and reducing grid lock. Transit infrastructure needs to incorporate new elements to evolve and not focus relying on old ways. There are multiple studies done in major cities like NYC showing that bike lanes move more people and don\u2019t impact traffic times significantly. I will also say walking as a pedestrian on bloor street easier with the bike lanes introduced. The side walks feel less cramped. If something happens we can step into a bike lane for a moment and not be at risk of being hit by a car. It\u2019s made bloor so much safer.\n- Toronto resident\n"

        "comment": "Please do not require municipalities to request approval for new bike lanes, or  request municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed. This is absurd. The province should be more worried about improving our healthcare and education systems. Having bike lanes keeps cyclists safe, reduces traffic (imagine if each of those cyclists were in a car?!), is better for the environment and the promotion of cycling as a way to commute promotes physical and mental well-being. Adding more lanes for cars is not going to help the issue of traffic/congestion. Maybe focus on helping our municipalities improve public transit.\n"

        "comment": "This is a gross overstep from the provincial government. Research shows that providing more room for cars only results in more demand from cars, and therefore increases gridlock. As someone living downtown Toronto who does not regularly cycle, I support protecting existing bike routes planned by the municipality because it results in less environmental pollution and is safer for everyone. The Premier of Ontario should be investigated by an ethics committee.\n"
