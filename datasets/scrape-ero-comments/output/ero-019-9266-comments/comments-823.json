        "comment": "While Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, proposes measures to address traffic issues, it is criticized for not fully solving traffic congestion in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) due to the following reasons:\n1. Focus on Highways Over Sustainable Alternatives\n\u2022\tThe bill prioritizes highway projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, which aim to improve vehicle flow. However, research consistently shows that expanding highways often leads to induced demand\u2014an increase in traffic as more drivers use the new roads over time \ufffc \ufffc.\n\t\u2022\tBy limiting the creation or preservation of cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes, the bill misses an opportunity to encourage alternative, more sustainable modes of transportation that could reduce car dependency \ufffc.\n2. Underinvestment in Public Transit\n\u2022\tWhile the bill accelerates highway development, it does not significantly address public transit expansion, which is crucial for reducing congestion. Highways alone do not meet the needs of a growing population in a dense urban area like the GTA, where integrated transit solutions are key to reducing car reliance \ufffc \ufffc.\n3. Failure to Address Root Causes of Congestion\n\u2022\tCongestion in the GTA is largely driven by car dependency, urban sprawl, and inadequate infrastructure for alternative transportation. The bill does not tackle land-use planning issues or promote mixed-use development that could reduce commuting distances \ufffc.\n\t\u2022\tBy emphasizing faster construction rather than comprehensive transportation planning, it risks perpetuating the same patterns that have caused congestion in the first place \ufffc \ufffc.\n4. Neglect of Cycling and Pedestrian Needs\n\u2022\tBy proposing restrictions on bike lanes, the bill could undermine efforts to create a multimodal transportation network. Cycling infrastructure is essential for short-distance trips and can ease pressure on roadways, but Bill 212 frames bike lanes as obstacles to traffic rather than part of the solution \ufffc \ufffc.\n5. Environmental and Community Concerns\n\u2022\tBuilding more highways often leads to urban sprawl, which increases car dependency and emissions, counteracting goals for sustainable urban growth. It also may disrupt communities and ecosystems in areas targeted for highway expansion \ufffc.\nConclusion\nWhile Bill 212 aims to address traffic by improving vehicle flow and expediting infrastructure projects, its heavy emphasis on highways and restrictions on cycling infrastructure overlook more effective and sustainable solutions. A balanced approach prioritizing public transit, active transportation, and urban planning is necessary for long-term congestion relief in the GTA.\nAll this is from ChatGPT an AI that somehow knows more than this government currently in power.\n"

        "comment": "RE: Bill 212 \u2013 An Act to enact two Acts and amend various Acts with respect to highways,\nbroadband-related expropriation, and other transportation-related matters (\u201cReducing\nGridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d)\nI am writing to request the reconsideration of Bill 212. My concerns relate to the provincial\noversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure (i.e., bike lanes). There are\nfive areas of benefit that bike lanes provide: (1) improved safety for all road users 1 (including\ndecreased dooring collisions, sideswipe, and rear end collisions) 2 , (2) increased economic\noutcomes for local businesses 3 and governments 4 , (3) reduced greenhouse gas emissions 5 , (4)\ndecreased access gap for equity-seeking populations 6 , and (5) improved physical and mental\nhealth. 7 I will now focus on the health, equity, and safety implications of providing protected\nbike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is a key factor in reducing numerous chronic health conditions and\nimproving individuals\u2019 mental wellbeing. 8 , 9 Physical activity, such as through active\ntransportation \u2013 walking, cycling, or other active modes of travel \u2013 is an effective way to meet\nthe 24-hour movement guidelines that show increases to health, well-being, and fitness.\nSpecifically, bike lanes can increase the total distance traveled by cyclists and the overall\nridership of residents. 10 By replacing some car trips with cycling, research indicates that people\ncan gain an additional nine life-years. 11 Moreover, by not incorporating physical activity into\nCanadians\u2019 lifestyles, the healthcare system is estimated to spend $6.8 billion per year due to\nthe impact physical inactivity has on chronic diseases. 7\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately impacts equity-deserving populations\nsuch as racialized persons, people living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and\nIndigenous peoples. For example, lower income neighbourhoods have historically been poorly\ndesigned with increased safety and health risks. However, when active transportation is\nincluded into the neighbourhood design (i.e., sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit, roadways)\nsocial and health inequities are reduced. 6 Given transportation options, individuals can select\nthe affordable and safe travel mode to participate in the workforce, access grocery stores,\nrecreational facilities, and healthcare services. 12 This research is not unique as researchers and\ngovernments globally have identified that high-quality multi-modal infrastructure increases the\nuse of active transportation, and its\u2019 associated social and health benefits. 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 Additionally,\nwhen individuals have affordable transportation options, they have more money to spend on\nnecessities such as food and rent, or extras such as goods from local business. 7\nThird, safety of all roadway users increases with the installation of bike lanes. As outlined by the\nCanadian Paediatric Society 17 , cycling infrastructure that is well-connected (\u2018cycle tracks\u2019) has a\nhalo effect where collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists decreased in a 500m\nsurrounding area. Additionally, protected bike lanes are the safest option for all roadway users\ncompared to painted lines, protected right of ways, and elevated lanes. 18\nHigh-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more people walking and cycling.\nActive travel has many proven physical and mental health benefits and impacts chronic disease\nprevalence. These investments need to be distributed equitably so that every community\nmember can enjoy the benefits of active transportation.\nIt is important to know that:\n-Mayor Chow and Toronto City Council formally expressed their opposition to Bill 212, and asked the province to withdraw the proposed amendments and work collaboratively with cities to address congestion and road safety.\n-Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council have all come out against Bill 212?\n120 physicians and researchers wrote a joint letter opposing Bill 212.\n-The words \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d do not appear anywhere in the bike lane sections of Bill 212, and the only consideration to approve or remove bike lanes would be \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\"\n-It is false that only 1.2% of people bike to work in Toronto, and according to the province\u2019s still confidential data nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility vehicle.\nFor bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, there are no feasible parallel alternate routes that wouldn\u2019t also result in the conversion of motor vehicle lanes.\n-The estimated financial impact is $48 million in additional costs to provincial taxpayers for the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge.\nPlease, for the sake of financial, environmental, health and equity well-being of Ontarians, abolish this bill.\n1 Ministry of Transportation Ontario.

        "comment": "Cycling has been my main mode of transportation in Toronto for 13 years. I love biking; it's cost effective, good exercise, environmentally friendly, time saving, and fun. I commute to work everyday using the Bloor Street bike lane. Cyclists are road users and deserve direct, efficient and safe routes. The safety provided by bike lanes is especially critical because I am 6 months pregnant. In countries with a respectful attitude toward cycling, people bike for their whole pregnancy. Sadly, I will not be able to do this because of the risks of being hit by a car, etc. The Ford government's scapegoating of cyclists for congestion has only served to further polarize people and increase animosity toward cyclists. Lack of infrastructure and animosity toward cyclists is a deadly combination.\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong Ontario resident, I strongly oppose any policies to eliminate existing bike lanes or limit the creation of new bike lanes. Evidence demonstrates that the availability of bike lanes as an alternative to driving substantially reduces congestion since bikes are smaller and more mobile than cars. Conversely, adding 1 extra car lane has little to no observable effect on traffic on already-busy roads in downtown areas. The marginal benefit of additional car lanes is negligible in the downtown car, and would only incentivize more driving. Please do not approve this proposal and thank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the removal of existing bike lanes Multiple bike lanes in Toronto have made it easier and safer for me and my kids to get to work, school, and to do errands without using either of our two cars. Royal York, Bloor Street, (I live in Mimico and use the Royal York and Bloor Street bike lanes a lot), University Avenue, Wellington, Richmond Street and Adelaide Street are all bike lanes we use from time to time. I still drive a fair bit, and I use both the TTC and GoTrain as well, and the separated bike lanes  mean I can use any type of transportation that fits my usage at that time. Having bike lanes on parallel streets makes sense where it's possible (such as Richmond, Wellington and Adelaide). However, there are no parallel side street options that make sense near Bloor, Yonge, or University, without forcing cyclists to zig-zag out of their way.....something vehicle drivers are not asked to do. For example, the zig-zagging (not to mention the cycling down into a ravine and back up a big hill again) a cyclist would need to do just to get from Islington to Runnymede without ever touching Bloor would add at least 5 minutes to what should be a 15 minute bike ride.\nResearch shows that properly connected bike lanes solve congestion. The majority of people who cycle also own vehicles and drive, and if cycling connections are removed, people will simply drive instead and that's what causes congestion. Governments should be looking for ways to increase the number of bike lanes that travel in straight lines which is proven to encourage people to get out of their cars. Not everyone is going to cycle.....but straight, connected bike lanes have proven repeatedly to successfully get more people doing so.\n"

        "comment": "We are fully supportive of Bill 212 and commend our Province for taking the necessary leadership regarding this issue. We have witnessed firsthand how the introduction of intrusive bike lanes on Bloor St W have negatively impacted not only the vehicle flow in this area, but also the connected neighbourhood roads that are subjected to traffic overflow. This idea of considering the impact on vehicular traffic of new bike lanes is not only common sense not evidenced by the non-sensical decisions of Toronto, but IS in fact environmentally advantageous by minimizing the amount of traffic idle time. Tight roads with extensive retail and an underused subway line are not the place to construct new bike lanes used by few and usable only seasonally.\n"

        "comment": "I would hope the environmental review encompasses not just the direct traffic impacts of the bike lanes, but the broader negative community impacts beyond Bloor. The installation of bike lanes has become ideologically driven, without a rigorous assessment of their consequences. It has also become an ageism attack: if you are not able to ride a bicycle, you are not a part of the population. Despite the reality that the >65 yrs cohort is one of the fastest growing. At 88, I am part of a small minority still riding a bicycle, no longer on the roadways, but on the park trails.\nBut even in the parks, the cycling lobby is having adverse effects, especially for the elderly:\ne.g. Restricted vehicle access to High Park has now made it difficult to transport my bike to the park. Similarily for young families wanting to use the park trails as a safe learning environment for young cyclists. Meanwhile, once within the park, road bikes,  electrified bikes and scooters drive at high speeds, endangering casual bikers, pedestrians, and dog walkers, and broadly ignore the rules of the road, as they also do when driving in the bike lanes\nDespite the extensive Bloor West bike lanes, and especially in inclement weather, the bikers and gig deliverers migrate to the subway transit. They are often the cause of queuing at the elevators intended for the disabled, aged and child strollers. Generally, a single bike takes over the total capacity of an elevator. Once on the train they congregate adjacent to the doors, causing a further obstruction for pedestrians and family strollers.\nThe Bloor West bike lane extension has cut the vehicle throughput capacity in half, 4 vehicle lanes are now reduced to 2. The aritmetic is fairly simple. Why is bumper to bumper congestion a surprise? It would seem to be a deliberate tactic to discourage people from driving, in effect to force them out of their cars.\nBeyond the direct local impact,  which includes difficulties in accessing Bloor from the intersecting residential streets, ie getting into the grid-locked stream, the Bloor bike lanes impediment has, again quite predictably, diverted cars onto the narrower residential streets from the arterial road. It is hard to see this being a community safety advantage.\nAs a result of the bike lane installations on Bloor, traffic is also rerouting from Bloor St W to the next arterials that cross the Humber River: The Queensway to the south and to Dundas St. W. to the north.\nThe resulting bumper-to bumper congestion on Dundas West from Royal York Road/Prince Edward Drive east to Scarlett Road is especially slow in the eastbound evening traffic. Having driven and inspected that spectacle several times, it has become clear a major contributing factor is the traffic queing to turn left on Dundas and go north at Scarlett Road. Looking futher, that flow is being blocked by the bike lanes installed on Scarlett Road, now reduced to  2 lanes from 4. Surely the simplest of computer models would have predicted this, let alone common sense.\nFinally, I would refer to a direct personal impact on us: the removal of the Bloor bus stop (Prince Edward Dr South route) at Kingsmill Road. With one vehicle lane removed for bike lanes, and no bus bays, a bus stopping would have halted all traffic. We previously used that bus to travel from Old Mill Station along Bloor to within 2 blocks of our home. It is now ~ 0.9 km between the two nearest Bloor bus stops ( at The Kingsway and at Prince Edward Drive, respectively). To add to the absurdity, the former resting bench at Kingsmill has been removed, and a large rack of commercial rental bikes installed in its place. The suggestion seems to be that when westbound we rent a bike at Old Mill Station, and ride up the Humber Valley/Bloor hill to Kingsmill. I doubt that ours is a unique consequence. Your study should examine how many other pedestrian/transit-friendly bus stops have been removed.  When I raised this issue with a biking activist, the reply was, \"Tough, not everybody wins.\" Ageism!\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock is not a coincident with Toronto's absurdity of building bike lanes. Not only bike lanes should be removed from arteries, they should also be removed from residential streets. Residential streets with bike lanes now have cars parked permanently only on one side of the street, where residents have no relief on calling in service vehicles, moving vehicles, contactor for repairs and ambulances, moreover, the city since stopped cleaning that street side, roadside garbage are now packed at the curbs behind the parked vehicles, drink bottles, cans, food waste, leafs and even syringes are spilling around the curbs, rats emerge at night, posing serious health and safety to young children and the surrounding neighborhood, curbs even start to grow wild grass! This is not the Toronto we used to have, the residents pay tax and they deserve a basic hygiene environment for basic everyday living, this is caused by bike lanes.

        "comment": "The ministry proposes to remove existing bike lanes on three streets in downtown Toronto that form the core of the cycling network, linking the downtown to midtown, East York and Etobicoke. They will also require a redundant review process that would create an unnecessary bureaucracy to delay new bike lanes.\nTreating bike lanes as a wedge issue instead of part of a complete congestion & safety plan is insulting and dangerous. This is a life and death matter. This proposal will result in more deaths and injuries on Toronto's roads. These physically separated lanes have reduced injuries for all road users while increasing active transportation options in a clogged and growing city.  But we need to do more, not less! Six people were killed on their bicycles this year in Toronto - including on Avenue Road, where the city has finally taken steps to make the road safer for everyone.\nThis proposal will also waste tens of millions of dollars, hurt local businesses, and fail to meet the supposed objective of reducing gridlock. Downtown Toronto will never fit the cars of everyone who works and lives there, and no amount of roads will fix that. T The province should focus on accelerating and opening new transit lines that can move more people, improve travel options, and leave space for those who really need to drive. Lessons could be learned from the Gardiner to get those projects in service faster so more people will have transit as an option to get to work and other destinations.\nAnd please don't forget, not everyone who bikes chooses to bike - for some people it is their livelihood or the only way they can afford to get around. I think Premier Ford's said it best after biking in the city: \"You're nervous when there's no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\"\nThe government should withdraw this bill and instead focus on how to increase safety and mobility for everyone across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Those who bike in the City of Toronto understand how perilous it can be. On many streets, arterial or residential, bikers have to compete with drivers from neighbouring municipalities who are unfamiliar with Toronto\u2019s unspoken yet well-understood ways of the road. Many times this creates hazardous situations for commuters. Drivers, impatient, tend to honk, or aggressively tail cyclists, looking for the slightest gap to swerve past them \u2013 often nearly side-swiping cyclists. Then there are the cars which block the side of the road, park or idle creating a hazard all bikers fear \u2013 being doored. This is when drivers or passengers swing their door open while parked on the street and an oncoming biker slams into it because they have no time to react.\nBiking can be a dangerous form of commuting but it is also an amazing way to get around the downtown core. It promotes a healthy lifestyle, and the exploration of neighbourhoods, while being sustainable and cost-effective. Dedicated bike lanes reduce the risk to cyclists while continuing to positively promote this form of transit to community members who are nervous about their safety.\nOn arterial roads like Bloor Street West, Yonge, and University bike lanes serve the same purpose as cars, they provide an efficient route for riders to get to and from their destinations. Bloor Street West for example is home to the longest dedicated bike path going west to east in the city. This is extremely important in the downtown core for residents to move around efficiently. Parallel streets with bike lanes like Harbord, Wellesley, College, Richmond, and Adelaide do not provide nearly the same amount of utility as the Bloor Street West lanes as they stop short of length and in some cases end abruptly and force riders to merge into one lane traffic. Without the Bloor Street West bike lanes, it is impossible to go from Yonge Street, let alone Greenwood to High Park, one of the most beautiful parks in our cities that all citizens deserve the right to visit. Similarly for North-South corridors University and Yonge bike lanes serve similar purposes.\nIf we want to continue to have Toronto develop into a first-class city, we must continue to promote multiple forms of commuting. This includes bikes, walking, transit, and cars. The Ford government has been heavily investing in transit and at the same new development permits have promoted density which is a necessity for a walkable city. Cars are a necessity for those with mobility issues and shouldn\u2019t be overlooked but they are an inefficient form of transportation that is no longer suitable for the needs of a city the size of Toronto. Large vehicles add to the noise and air pollution of the neighbourhoods they pass through. These vehicles are likely occupied by a single person and at max can hold up to 5-7 which is absimbley low compared to what a bus or train can hold. To truly reduce the level of congestion in the city we must continue to invest in other forms of transit that are consistent with our growth levels. Bike lanes, like transit, serve this purpose.\nLastly, Municipalities should have autonomy over where bike lanes are constructed as this reflects the will of the citizens who live there not of the tourists who visit.\nThus, Bill 212 should be dismissed.\n"

Decisions about bike lanes on municipal street should be made by the municipal government. Should the province wish to be involved in such decisions, it should be as a partner with the municipality - and not as a government imposing  its will on a 'lower' tier of government. Decisions about bike lanes should also be made based on recent relevant data and assessments of transportation flow at various times of day and year.   The province's decision to focus on part of Bloor St and on Yonge St. and Avenue Rd appears to be somewhat random or perhaps based on some individuals reaching out to the premier's office.  I have lived in the  vicinity of  Bloor St and Bathurst for about 40 years. I drive a car, ride a bike, take transit and walk. Oh, and the occasion Uber too. I agree that traffic has gotten worse, but there are many factors. Construction seems to have a large negative impact with many lanes blocked off often for months or even a year due to new builds (condos and apartments). Road construction also creates bottlenecks. And there's been a proliferation of lane changes to right or left turn only lanes that seem to slow things down. Please rethink this Bill and take a more thoughtful, collaborative approach to easing gridlock problems.\n"

Is there not a realization or understanding that you can remove the bike lanes but us cyclists will still be here? This makes NO sense. Do you really think that removing the lanes will help reduce traffic? Has Doug Ford ever even been on Bloor during rush hour when there\u2019s just as many cyclists on the road as cars? How are we supposed to maintain the legal distance between cars and cyclists with no bike lanes? Taking these lanes out will seriously damage our ability to get ourselves around safely without having to dodge vehicle that already don\u2019t want us on the road. Who is this benefiting? Why would we use more tax dollars to take these lanes out when so many of them are relatively new. The entire city of Toronto relies on these lanes-not just us cyclists. People in cars on the road ALSO need these lanes so we can all navigate the terrible infrastructure of this city. There\u2019s already enough traffic. Imagine rush hour on Bloor where all the cyclists are in the same lanes as cars-it would be madness. KEEP US SAFE, KEEP THESE LANES!!! They are an integral part of the infrastructure of our city.

        "comment": "This bill is a misguided attempt by the provincial government to exert unearned and targeted power over municipalities and will produce outcomes in total opposition to their stated goals. It should not be enacted.\nBike lanes serve several important roles in the functioning of cities and towns of all sizes. Clearly, they facilitate the safer usage of bicycles within a municipality and encourage a variety of associated benefits, including the promotion of healthy lifestyles, economic stimulation through the closer exposure to street-side businesses, an easing of the load on other modes of transportation, a reduction of atmospheric emissions, a reduction of consumer fuel expenditures, and, by extension, a reduction in carbon taxation. All noble goals indeed.\nNot only this, bike lanes encourage safer and more pleasant streets for local residents. Motor vehicles tend to generate noises far louder than any other surface vehicle. Horns are one obvious example, but let's not forget the sounds of both the engines driving them and the tires carrying them, both of which make a din that you might take for granted in a city. Bikes fail to reach the heights of the noise of personal vehicles, which leads to far more pleasant experiences for all of those in the area. This is, in part, the point that I wish to make here. We have become normalized to the sounds of motor vehicles in our cities and towns only because we have let them. It is not natural, our cities were destroyed and redesigned that way. Only recently have municipalities tried to make way for other modes of transportation that are eminently viable, only to face roadblock after roadblock in their enactment. You should not have to expect the unpleasantness of car-choked city streets. It does not need to be this way.\nPersonal vehicles also cause an undue level of wear and tear on our roadways. Damage to roads tends to be a function of the weight of the vehicle travelling over it and increases at an incredible pace with this variable, so reducing the weight of the average vehicle travelling over these highways is paramount to preserving them season after season. I know that road maintenance continues to be a large share of the expenditure of many layers of government, and I would like to make sure that my tax dollars go towards repairing damages that could otherwise not be prevented. Not only that, but the long-term benefits of improved health outcomes from bikes unburdens our healthcare system that is in such desperate need of financial relief. Bikes prevent these bad consequences, so I support bikes. They are the fiscally responsible, cost-cutting, Conservative option.\nI would also like to note that the stretches of streets named in this bill all have heavy-rail subways running underneath or near-underneath for a great part of their length. This is an exceedingly convenient option for all those travelling along these corridors in a personal motor vehicle and in most cases meets their needs completely. The addition of another lane of such traffic to these routes is unlikely to ease congestion when such alternatives exist. Instead, this lane will further lower the density of road users passing along the route and will slash the throughput of these streets. Maximizing throughput is, funnily enough, the underlying goal of this proposal, yet its methods will do the exact opposite.\nI will conclude by noting that this kind of measure is wholly inappropriate for a provincial government. The decision on including a bike lane on a certain stretch of road ought to be completely in the realm of municipal-level decision makers. Of course, provincial rules about highways continue to apply, but the requirement of municipalities to consult with the provincial government about road use in their jurisdiction\u2014especially when targeting specific streets in one specific city\u2014is completely unacceptable. When contrasted with this government's flippant willingness to spend billions of dollars not just on highway upkeep but on entirely new highways, the addition of bike lane death panels defies the principles of this government on many levels. I hope that the powers that be make the right decision and reject this misguided and mean-spirited proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Doug Ford\u2019s bill 212.\nI don\u2019t think that Doug Ford\u2019s bill is in the best interest of anyone in Ontario, nor does it represent what people in Ontario want.\nDoug Ford aims to take away the control that local municipalities have over designing their own roadways. He aims to put that control into provincial hands where he will have the divine authority to approve or disapprove proposed roadway variances. Nobody knows the needs/wants of locals, and the best use of their road space, better than their local governments. The province doesn\u2019t know what is best for the individual needs of local municipalities. Municipalities should have the right to govern their own streets and make changes without approval from the provincial government.\nDoug Ford wants to pass this bill to benefit himself. He wants to be able to forgo having to do any environmental assessments, and he wants to be able to expropriate land easier from land owners. All so he can build his highway through the green belt more quickly and easily. This only benefits his own interests since he and his buddies will personally gain and profit from building this highway.\nThe greenbelt is crucial land that should not be Ontario\u2019s \u201cplace to grow\u201d its sprawling industry and roadways.\nDoug Ford is using Ontarians frustration with traffic congestion to rally support for his personal agenda. Look at the title of this bill \u201cReducing Gridlock: Saving You Time Act\u201d What a charged name that is deliberately raising an emotional response from frustrated commuters. So that they will support a deceptive bill that won\u2019t deliver what it promises. This bill is a vehicle for Doug Ford to get his way. The traffic congestion in the GTA is a more systemic issue in city planning and road design. It is not caused by bike lanes, nor will it be fixed by removing them and building highways through protected green spaces.\nRemoving the bike lanes will cost $75 million dollars and take 9 months to remove. I don\u2019t want my tax dollars going towards something that will actively make my city a worse place to live in. Removing the bike lanes will grind traffic to a halt for the duration of the removal process. This will greatly increase the congestion that the bike lane removal is intending to lessen. And the end result won\u2019t be 2 lanes each way of easily flowing traffic. Instead it will only create parking on both sides of the road like it was before, and one lane of car traffic each way that will be shared by cyclists. This is a much more dangerous situation for both cyclists and drivers.\nAs someone who both drives a car and cycles along the same streets of Toronto. I prefer bike lanes in both cases.\nWhen I\u2019m driving I\u2019m less worried of cyclists coming out of nowhere because I can predict where they will be- in their own lane! Also where there are dividers and parked cars between my car and the cyclists it\u2019s even better. This creates an even safer environment because the cyclists can\u2019t dart out of the bike lane into car traffic.\nWhen I\u2019m on my bike I prefer bike lanes because it feels safe. I'm not constantly scared that a car will hit me on my left or a parked car will door me on my right. A lot of roads have aggressive drivers that don\u2019t give way and I am forced to hug the curb where there are often terrible potholes that are a real hazard.\nWhen there aren\u2019t bike lanes as a driver, I can\u2019t pass cyclists with a 1 meter clearance unless I cross partially into the oncoming lane, which is a hazard in itself and also disrupts the flow of traffic.\nWhen I am a cyclist without bike lanes I can\u2019t drive 1 meter away from the curb or parked cars as written in the law, because cars will constantly honk at me and driving 1 meter away from parked cars puts me in the lane of traffic. So there is really just one lane shared by both cars and bikes.\nMany streets in Toronto feel so unsafe that I either choose to avoid them or I choose to bike on the sidewalk, which is illegal. Cycling on the streets of Toronto feels so dangerous without bike lanes that sometimes I have to break the law in order to feel safe and not be injured. That is simply wrong.\nI am just one voice of many, and I know that many other voices oppose this bill. Please do what is in the interest of Ontarians, and Torontonians, and not pass a bill that will make their daily commute more congested and less safe.\n"
