Using a bike instead of a car offers residents the opportunity to make a commute enjoyable, environmentally friendly and a source of individual exercise. Often, a bike is an alternative to using a car and if we remove bike lanes, we put more cars on the street. Please contribute to the livability of this city by giving prospective bikers the opportunity to commute in a designated lane that is safe and efficient.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this bill. As someone who lives just off Bloor Street and uses both a car and a bicycle for transportation I LOVE the Bloor bikes lanes. I feel a thousand percent safer riding my bike on Bloor then when there wasn't bike lanes. The city does not have that many east-west bike lane routes so I was thrilled when the Bloor bike lanes were put in as I did not have to detour down to Harbord to feel safe (and Harbord only goes so far). As a motorist I don't think the bike lanes have affected traffic much. The main cause of traffic on Bloor is usually construction - there has been construction around the train tracks for years - and just the fact that there are too many cars on the road. How many are cars are delivery vehicles or Ubers?  There are massive condo developments currently under construction on and near Bloor and we need those people to ride bikes or take transit because if they all get in cars the traffic will not move at all. If they don't feel safe, they aren't going to ride. Removing bike lanes is a giant step backwards. It puts cyclists lives at risk and it is also a huge waste of money and will result in more construction and more traffic delays. I'm not sure why the bike lanes on University are so wide and same with a stretch of Bloor east of Spadina. While luxurious for cyclists we don't need a full car lane width. So feel free to narrow them if that helps but don't remove them! My other comment is - the province should stay out of municipal issues. Just because Doug Ford doesn't like the traffic on his morning commute doesn't mean he can walk all over Toronto City Council. Stay in your lane Doug!\n"

Bill 212 hurts everyone except a few lazy, polluting drivers  whose cars get bigger and bigger every year on the few roads that have bike lanes.\nThe next generation will depend more and more on bikes. Removing bike lanes will reduce options for people without cars (more and more of us every day) in Etobicoke\nPLus its a waste of money to remove bike lanes. There are other options including making existing intersections more efficient. The lanes have only existed for a short time and will become used more in the near future.\nBill 212 is just a political move by a conservative government looking to build on right wing sympathizers by burning down liberal-leaning urban areas\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important because they make roads safer for cyclists and drivers, improve the environment, and promote sustainable transportation.  As a driver I find it really important to share the road with bikes in a safer manner which would be having an independent lane for the persons riding the bikes. Bike lanes create a separate space for cyclists, which can reduce the risk of crashes and injuries.  This will also reduce serious injuries which will be also much better for our health care system and help reduce wait times in emergency.  Roads that include bike lanes can actually increase traffic flow by reducing the number of left-turning cars that back up traffic. It allows in general for better flow of traffic. In areas where there are proper bike lanes I am happy to ride my bike and feel safer there by getting a workout while I get somewhere I need to go and knowing I am helping the environment in the process.  Thank you for building the amazing bike lanes on University avenue in Toronto. My commute to work has never been better. Thank you for bike lanes. When we build bike lanes it shows that we acutely care for our community.\n"

Removing bike lanes will not help ease congestion. There is congestion all over the city, and there aren't bike lanes all over the city. The problem is too many people driving. This will not go away if you remove bike lanes. All that will happen is our roads will get more dangerous, and more people will die.\nA just-released City report tallies the initial total cost to taxpayers of removing these bike lanes at $75 million in direct and sunk costs, and notes increased ridership of up to 600% in some of the lanes planned for removal, with minimal impact on car travel times.\nWe need this money to help our schools and hospitals. Let our city make its own decisions about our infrastructure.\n"

Increasing traffic by increasing lanes will reduce safety.\nGovernments should be looking at funding transit and encouraging other modes of transportation rather than focusing on cars. Funding transit would reduce gridlock.\nI am a taxpayer and a cyclist. Spending millions of dollars removing infrastructure is a complete waste of money and will also contribute to more gridlock. Please use the studies that already have been done to show that bike lanes do not increase gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I am a citizen living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe and a doctoral student in Urban Planning. I have significant concerns about this legislation as it seeks to limit options for active transportation and instead prioritizes automobile traffic. Our cycling infrastructure is already lacking in many areas due to limited past actions (like adding sharrows instead of proper lanes) and incomplete networks, which limit utility and prevent greater uptake of active transportation.\nThis legislation is also an unnecessary intrusion into municipal affairs, as municipalities are more than capable of managing these affairs themselves. Such a decision is unconscionable based on the Province's stated reluctance to address housing pressures on the grounds that the municipalities know best how to manage their own growth. I instead encourage the Province to give municipalities the liberty to decide their own futures.\nWe should be investing in a range of transportation options to encourage personal choice in how we commute and get around. The proposed legislation is authoritarian and contrary to personal freedom. Prioritizing active transportation and new investments in public transit\u2014rather than removing bike lanes and constructing the 413 (as noted in the listing)\u2014can reduce the need to expand highways by diverting commuters/travellers into other modes and can help us create more complete, livable communities. Please reconsider this piece of legislation and its impacts on our lives.\nThank you for taking the time to read this comment.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed regulation to restrict and remove bike lanes in Toronto and across Ontario. While the goal of ensuring safe and accessible roadways for all users is commendable, the removal of bike lanes could have significant negative consequences for our communities, our environment, and our public health.\nBike lanes serve a critical function in urban mobility. They promote safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation options, reduce traffic congestion, and encourage physical activity. The existence of dedicated cycling infrastructure not only enhances the safety of cyclists by reducing accidents but also supports Ontario\u2019s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Furthermore, bike lanes can alleviate pressure on public transportation systems, creating more balanced, multimodal urban transportation networks.\nMany cities around the world have found that robust cycling infrastructure benefits everyone, including drivers, by improving overall traffic flow and making streets safer. The potential removal of bike lanes might discourage people from choosing active transportation, reversing the progress made in making Ontario\u2019s cities more liveable and environmentally conscious.\nRather than reducing bike lane infrastructure, we encourage the government to work with municipal partners to identify solutions that improve the coexistence of all road users. This might include education campaigns, improved lane design, and community engagement to understand the diverse needs of Ontario residents.\n"

        "comment": "Before the bike lanes were installed, I had been concerned that they would cause congestion and slow my travel time.  In 2016 I was driving my three children between Bloor West Village and the University of Toronto where they swam competitively.  I feared that this would have a deleterious effect on my movement along Bloor Street.   Given my reservations, I had quite a few conversations in 2016 with the Manager, Cycling Infrastructure & Programs.  The conversations left me with an appreciation that a large amount of thinking and planning had gone into to the project.  So, I was carefully optimistic.\nFour years later, I was so pleased with the effect of the bike lanes on my ability to drive a car along that route that I sent a follow-up e-mail to the Transportation Services manager to say that my fears had been misplaced and to thank them for their time and effort efficiently getting this project through to completion.  The bike lanes had two positive effects on driving along Bloor Street:  (1) Bicycles were no longer weaving in/out of motor vehicle traffic and when making a right-hand turn I knew exactly where bicycles would be, and (2) the variability of my travel time to/from UofT had actually decreased.\nThe bike lanes have made my use of Bloor St W by car much much better.  I feel as if all the users of Bloor St W are safer and my travel time is more consistent.  Please maintain or expand the use of bicycle lanes on Toronto roads!!  Please continue to support the cycling infrastructure.\n"

One of my daughters was hit a few years back when stopped on her bike at stop light. Fortunately not seriously, but  her bike was destroyed. The car driver, very apologetic, but did not come to a stop and had cut the corner. With proper bike lanes and infrastructure this would not happen.\nIf we cannot use our bikes then we will be using our car more often for inner city trips (we do use TTC a fair bit).  This will make the city more congested than it is.\nA agree some improvements in design might be made, but please leave the bike lanes.\nWe have lived in the west end of the city for over 40 years.\n"

Instead this proposal focuses on the problem which is in fact cars and instead is promoting the growth of cars and emissions.\nBiking and bike lanes are not only important for our environment and reducing emissions, but for the health and safety of our communities. Biking supports healthy living habits. Bike lanes enable bikers to feel comfortable and confident in their ability to bike. Removing bike lanes in congested areas will only support the increase in frequency of bike accidents due to cars and also act as a  disincentive  to bikers.\nLastly, biking is accessible and in a city where accessibility is a critical challenge, removing the access to a fair low cost transportation mode in support of favouring cars only adds to the inequality of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to your proposed legislation (Bill 212) to restrict the\ninstallation of bicycle lanes where motor vehicle lanes would be removed, as well as the removal\nof several protected bicycle lanes in Toronto.\nPlease leave decisions about transit infrastructure to the city, and do not implement laws that will needlessly cost Ontario taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars, while not even achieving the stated goal of increasing traffic speeds in Toronto. Decisions about local transit infrastructure should be based on science and evidence, and should be made with the best interests of citizens and taxpayers in mind.\nIt is well known in the field of urban planning that increasing road capacity does not\nimprove congestion due to induced demand (1). The most effective way to reduce congestion and to speed up travel speeds for drivers is to provide viable alternatives to driving, such as cycling or public transit. By removing and limiting protected bicycle infrastructure on main streets that provide direct routes and easy access to destinations, the Ontario government will fail to improve traffic flow by reducing the viability of cycling as a mode of transport.\nPlacing bicycle infrastructure on secondary streets will limit access to local businesses located\nalong main streets, depriving these businesses of the economic benefits of cycling activity.\nStudies have found that visitors to Bloor St. spent more money following the installation of bike\nlanes in 2016, and that individuals in North American cities (including Toronto) spend more\nmoney in commercial areas when they arrive by foot or bicycle than by car (2,3). In New York\nCity, retail sales increased along commercial corridors after the installation of bike lanes (4).\nAdditionally, placing bicycle routes on secondary streets results in less direct routes and limited\naccess to destinations, reducing convenience for individuals travelling by bicycle. Therefore,\nindividuals travelling by bicycle will likely continue to use main streets \u2013 only without the\nseparation and protection provided by bicycle lanes. As a result of this, cyclists will travel\namong motor vehicles and will be at an increased risk of injury and death, while potentially\nslowing motor vehicle traffic. In Canada, 73% of deaths by cycling collisions involve a collision\nwith a motor vehicle (5). By removing bicycle infrastructure on major corridors, the Ontario\ngovernment will be directly responsible for increased injuries and fatalities on these routes.\nI urge the government to reconsider this legislation and to allow municipalities to decide\nthemselves where bicycle infrastructure is needed.\nReferences\n1.

        "comment": "I am vehemently against the proposal for Bill 212.  It is a concerning overreach by the provincial government into municipalities' jurisdictions. And more importantly, bike lanes are vital for communities - they increase rider and pedestrian safety, promote fitness, reduce harmful vehicle emissions. And contrary to popular belief, studies prove bicycle and foot traffic are actually better for local businesses than vehicle traffic. The kind of thinking behind Bill 212 is old fashioned and short sighted, and would cost society more than just exorbitant amounts of money. Doug Ford continues to push us backwards into the 1950s with his irrational preoccupation with highways, urban sprawl and white picket fences. We need future-focused solutions. Now.\n"
