        "comment": "I am strongly against Bill 212, this proposal to remove existing bike lanes  and require provincial approval to add a bike lane if car traffic is affected. I am a pedestrian and cyclist who has travelled in cities across Europe, North America and Asia. Infrastructure for active transportation is very important to encourage people to walk and ride their bikes, and to keep them safe when they do. Far more people can travel by bike or public transit in the same space that a few cars, usually with only one occupant, take up on the road.  Forcing cyclists and walkers into shared paths, or forcing bikes to ride on busy city streets will result in more injuries and deaths.  I visited Toronto by bicycle during COVID days while the pilot Active TO  bike lanes were open on University Ave and it was an amazing experience.\nEncouraging and facilitating getting people out of their cars is what will reduce traffic congestion.  Ontario should be basing its decisions on data, and data does NOT back up this proposal.  Data from New York City also showed that adding bike lanes, even if it means reducing motor vehicle lanes, are a net benefit to downtown businesses.\nMost bike lanes end up reducing on-street parking rather than lanes that move traffic anyway.  We have dedicated far too much of our cities to cars and parking for cars.\nCities around the world  are moving in the other direction, Ontario! Don\u2019t go back in time!  Other jurisdictions have seen that getting people out of their cars is the best approach.  Building more lanes for cars only induces more people to drive, and the lanes fill up again quickly.  We need more ways to travel, especially more non-emitting ways- not fewer! We need to reduce traffic by vehicles that emit air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and this proposal will only increase emissions.\nLeave these decisions to the municipalities who know their spaces and transit needs better than Queens Park.\n"

        "comment": "To the Ford Government,\nI urge you to reconsider the decision to remove essential bike lanes in Toronto. This move takes us backward, especially at a time when cities worldwide are championing sustainable transportation. Removing these bike lanes will only increase vehicle congestion, as studies consistently show that expanding road space leads to more drivers on the road, not fewer.\nBy keeping bike lanes, we encourage people to choose active transportation, reduce reliance on cars, and ease traffic, not to mention lower emissions and support a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle. If we want a future with less congestion, cleaner air, and a healthier population, we need to invest in infrastructure that aligns with those goals. Let\u2019s prioritize sustainability, mobility choices, and the long-term future of Ontario.\nThank you for considering this crucial perspective.\n"

        "comment": "This provincial government\u2019s actions, exemplified by Bill 212, pose a serious threat to our democracy. The 'cancel culture' and 'get out of the way' mentality undermine the values of the majority of Ontarians seeking affordable, cleaner lifestyles.\nMunicipal authorities must maintain the lead on bike lane development without provincial oversight, as they are more attuned to community needs. Research from cities like New York, Paris, Copenhagen, and Montreal reveals that bike lanes can dramatically reduce car commuter times. Supporting municipalities in expanding bike infrastructure aligns with efforts to lower emissions; for example, Toronto saw a remarkable increase of 4 million bike trips over eight years. More cyclists mean less congestion and fewer vehicles on the road, which is essential for reducing our carbon footprint, and also means bike lanes are necessary to meet the demand.\nThe concept of induced demand should be utilized here for transit and alternative wheeled vehicle/cycle lanes instead of inciting more gridlock with cars. Cycling is not only a sustainable lifestyle choice but also a practical one, with a much smaller environmental impact than cars. The carbon footprint of bike manufacturing is typically offset within just a year of use.\nAdditionally, it's hypocritical for the Premier to spend millions fighting federal overreach while simultaneously infringing on municipal rights regarding bike lanes\u2014contradicting the Cutting Red Tape Act meant to expedite infrastructure improvements; seems only highways get expedited. Moreover, instead of investing in transit, millions are wasted on highway construction ad campaigns.\nExpropriating Greenbelt lands for highways is unacceptable and relocating utility infrastructure \u2018in the way\u2019 of these potential highways risks the expropriation of even more vital agricultural and Greenbelt lands. In 2023, Ontarians clearly expressed that the Greenbelt should remain untouched. Viable alternatives exist to address housing shortages and traffic, yet this government dismisses these options in favor of more sprawl development, the 413 and the Bradford Bypass, which threaten our food and water security, climate efforts, health and overall well being, benefiting only developers and taking construction companies away from more critical infrastructure improvements.\nFurthermore, we must insist on thorough environmental impact assessments for Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass projects and intervene to protect Species At Risk legislation, hopefully before the Premier downgrades the rating for the many species in question like the Redside dace, the Red-headed woodpecker, the Blanding's turtle. Moreover, a regional environmental impact review is warranted given the ongoing loss of agricultural land,  green space and wetlands since this government took office, Oak Ridges Moraine Headwaters area is an example.\nFinally, transferring regulatory powers for towing zones from the Lieutenant Governor General to the Minister of Transportation is not really about improving the current towing zone structures. It is about removing provincial accountability and limiting another independent body from holding this government accountable. As it did with the Ontario Energy Board, the Greenbelt Council, Conservation Authorities and an additional hit to municipalities -  a troubling trend that erodes municipal oversight and accountability of this government while lending itself more power.\nAs it stands, I am opposed to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is so ridiculous that it sounds like an April Fools joke.\nHow can the Ford government be so totally out to lunch on this topic? I get that this is totally ideological and about getting suburban votes for the next election, but come on.\nYou should be investing in people getting around faster by bike and public transit. People without reliable public transit create congestion. If people have affordable and efficient alternatives to cars, they don\u2019t use cars, which means fewer cars on the road, which means less congestion.\nAnd in urban areas, cycling infrastructure also means fewer cars. I am proof of this. When my car died, I got an electric cargo bike instead of a new car. My child and I go all over the city with it. I use bike lanes. One less car = less congestion.\nIt\u2019s the 21st century. Come and join it.\n"

While I can get around the city of Ottawa on many trails, I need to often go on streets to get to the businesses I want to patronize. I go to the Glebe sometimes from the Merivale Rd area. I do not have gears, just leg power. I am not fast. Riding in the same lane as cars is terrifying so I ride on the sidewalk and give way to the few pedestrians I pass. Where there is a separated bike lane I feel much safer. I am not the only recreational rider; we are not all fast  commuter riders. I would go to more businesses if there were more safe ways to access them. Westboro is particularly scary. I wish there was no parking lane, and that lane was converted to a separated bike lane. Build a parking garage and increase the frequency of the bus service. Same in the Glebe and Old Ottawa South. Maybe other areas on the east side of Ottawa. But DO NOT remove any existing bike lanes. Widening roads only increases cars when we need to get cars off the roads to reduce our auto emissions. E-cars will not reduce congestion.\n"

        "comment": "There's no statistical or scientific evidence to support this proposal. In fact, I can argue the opposite if you normalize with the size of the infrastructure, there's more people using bike lanes per km than people driving per km of infrastructure in cities (perhaps not in Toronto due to density).\nA few other reasons why we should invest more in bike lanes and not the opposite:\n- Cheaper infrastructure: it's cheaper to build and maintain bike lanes than to build new infrastructure for cars (or transit) for the same amount of people using it. The cost of commuting by car is 10x more expensive compared to biking including the costs of infra and public sector costs.\n- Safer for bikers and drivers: Drivers will also be safer and drives won't be delayed if bikes have their own infrastructure. I bike to work and bike lanes are essential for me the way sidewalks are for pedestrians.\n- Public Health costs: I am an example of someone that was riding on the road (no proper bike infrastructure) and had an accident, spent 2 days in Grand River Hospital, had surgery that cost thousands of dollars to Ontario and 1 year later I'm still not 100%.\n- Improved Health: when the society has better health, public health costs less too. Alleviate the pressure that our health system is going through right now.\n- Environmental reasons: obviously less cars equals to less carbon emission, less fossil fuels.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the bill for the following reasons:\n- This bill does not take into consideration of the safety of cyclists. Networks are established to provide safety for the cyclist and provide access to shops and amenities throughout city corridors. Research shows that it increases foot traffic to downtown shops when proper cycling infrastructure is in place.\n- It should not be the provinces decision to interfere with municipal matters. The infrastructure was established after public consultation and studies in the area. Removing the bike lanes does for one is a colossal waste of money but it will not help with the grid lock in Toronto and other cities. Adding more lanes will just cause more traffic (induced demand). The focus should be for better public transportation to reduce the reliance on vehicles and investment into public projects (i.e. subways, high frequency trains, bike paths, etc)\n- Cyclists should have there own bike lane to prevent irritation to drivers but also for speed, mobility, and general safety. If the option of safe cycling infrastructure is established, people will use it. This is displayed in countless countries even with cold climates.\n"

There's is no way I would have a child ride on Danforth/Bloor without protected bike infrastructure. Danforth/Bloor has been a key addition to the bike network in Toronto allowing safer east/west travel. It gives people more transportation option to go to school, grocery shopping, stores, classes, parks ect... Why do MPPs that live 20 hours away want to rip out vital bike infrastructure that Torontonians want and deserve. I am upset that the government against red tape has added more red tape and is proposing to rip out brand new bike infrastructure. Truly disgusting and lives will be lost.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Ottawa, ON, I respectfully disagree with Doug Ford's proposed Bill 212, for at least the following reasons:\nNot only do bike lanes support the reduced greenhouse gas emissions that follow a commuter shift from cars to bicycles, but quality domestic and international data* on bike lanes shows that they decrease car congestion and even commute times, rather than increasing them, e.g. by providing a safe alternative mode of transportation. Indeed research shows that more lanes for cars ultimately shifts more drivers to the roadway ('induced demand'), which undermines the proposed supposedly anti-congestion strategy, and adds to emissions.\nImportantly, protected bicycle lanes reduce cyclist injuries and fatalities, and effectively calm motor vehicle driving. Additionally, as car traffic shifts to bicycle traffic, there is increased cyclist shopping at area businesses, with tangible benefits to the local economy.\n* References: For example, please see the CBC news article of 22-October-2024, and references therein.\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

Why is the provincial government meddling in a municipal matter? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n"

        "comment": "I am adamantly opposed to expanding any road or building Highway 413 for the purpose of allowing more cars on our roads. I believe that trucks should be using 407 instead of 401 to pass through Toronto, with fees paid by the government rather than destroying precious wetland and farmland to enable people to access their cottages.\nAs e-cargo bikes are a viable way to move goods short distances, safe separated cycle lanes need to be provided to enable these emissions-free vehicles to support local businesses. Many people now commute to work in most weather conditions. Again having safe separated lanes for them to avoid the deaths which too frequently occur now when trucks and cars collide with bikes. Drivers must watch for more and varied forms of personal mobility, making roads unsafe. Many more people can occupy the space now taken up by cars with one occupant if they are on bikes or in buses. Reduce congestion by making it more convenient and affordable by making these environmentally-friendly modes of moving people. HOV lanes should be utilized more often to encourage more people per vehicle, than each having their own vehicle. Buses and multi-occupant cars can use the faster lanes so no road widening needs to be done. No parking in congested areas (use the parking lane for bikes) increases visibility of small businesses and their income while cars just pass by. We are in a climate crisis, and getting more cars off the roads while making public transit easy, frequent, affordable and going where people need to go at the times they need to get somewhere (like shift workers) should be the goal of every municipality in this province. Driving is a privilege and should not assume to be the only way to get places.\n"

        "comment": "Building bikes lanes (and maintaining the ones that we already paid to build) provides more transportation choices to Ontarians - getting people out of cars and reducing the total number of cars on the road. Cars cause congestions, not bikes lanes so removing these lanes does nothing to address automobile congestion. Further, the position and design of these laneways have been carefully studied and planned to maximize benefit for all road users. Undoing all of this effort is a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.\nFrom a safety perspective, removing bike lanes will also decrease emergency vehicle response times, increase safety for cyclists and reduce collision rates by separating various road users which also contributes to the smoother flow of traffic.\nFinally, it is a gross jurisdictional overreach to control how cities manage their streets.  They know their communities best so let them manage their infrastructure with the care and expertise that will best serve their respective jurisdictions.\n"
