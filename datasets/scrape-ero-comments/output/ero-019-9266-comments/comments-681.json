        "comment": "I am a professional architect and longtime Toronto resident, car owner, regular driver and a commuting cyclist. I value the ability to get around the City efficiently when I am driving. However, I will accept increased travel time if it means that I have not contributed to the death of a person.\nBill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 will result in avoidable cyclist deaths every year if existing bicycle lanes are removed (or not constructed) as a result of it. The Bill is contrary to the objectives of the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, which seeks to reduce traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on Toronto\u2019s streets.\nIn some jurisdictions such as Sweden, the responsibility for designing transportation infrastructure that prevents fatalities has been made law.\nIn contrast, by passing this bill, the Ontario government will be actively and knowingly legislating cyclist fatalities for the stated purpose of reducing gridlock and saving time.\nSeparated bike lanes with multi-modal transportation infrastructure that accommodates many alternative options for getting around the city can be very successful formula as has been demonstrated in the Netherlands and in other places. Increasing transportation options reduces gridlock. Fostering walkable and bikeable neighborhoods reduces gridlock. Neither one increases fatalities.\nThe government of Ontario should support Vision Zero initiatives and not expend taxpayer resources to actively work against them.\nSeveral related links provided below.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are crucial to short-distance commute in downtown. Removing them will add load to the already crowded and burdened TTC network. Many students or low-income individuals who couldn't afford transportation costs and chooses to bike would also be affected.\nGridlock has been long existed prior to the initial addition of bike lanes. Removing bike lanes will not solve the traffic issue. Make public transit more reliable and cost-attractive.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. As both a driver and cyclist on Bloor Street, I've witnessed firsthand how bike lanes have created a SAFER, more PREDICTABLE environment for all road users. The traffic calming effect of the bike lanes has made driving LESS STRESSFUL, while removing them would NOT DETER cyclists who rely on these essential routes \u2013 it would only make their journeys MORE DANGEROUS and create new LIABILITY RISKS for the city. The SUBSTANTIAL COSTS of removing existing infrastructure, only to likely REINSTALL it in the future as cycling continues to grow, would be an IRRESPONSIBLE USE of taxpayer money. The evidence is clear: properly designed bike lanes REDUCE COLLISIONS, improve traffic flow through predictability, and support local businesses.\n"

Stop testing our patience, we've had enough. It's moves like this that prove that Ford is for HIS people, not THE people. Leave the existing (and brand new!) bike lanes - they help save lives, save time, save money.\n"

If I can't do that safely then I will just start driving everywhere, which will increase CO2 emissions and create more traffic in places not only where bike lanes have been removed but on other streets.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes should not be removed for the following reasons:\n1. Promotes Sustainability and Reduces Traffic Congestion\nBike lanes encourage environmentally friendly transportation, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate traffic congestion. Removing bike lanes could force more people into cars, increasing pollution and commute times.\n2. Enhances Safety for Cyclists and Drivers\nDedicated bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists by separating them from motor vehicles. Without bike lanes, cyclists may need to ride on busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and conflicts between drivers and cyclists.\n3. Supports Public Health and Community Well-being\nBike lanes promote active transportation, which improves physical health and mental well-being. They also make cities more livable by encouraging outdoor activity and fostering a sense of community. Removing bike lanes could discourage cycling, negatively affecting public health and urban quality of life.\nAlso the overreach of provincial powers should not be enacted because:\n1. Local Context and Expertise\nCity governments and local councils have a deeper understanding of the specific needs, challenges, and priorities of their communities. Decisions about traffic lanes are often tied to local infrastructure, commuting patterns, and resident feedback, which provincial governments may not be as equipped to address.\n2. Erosion of Municipal Autonomy\nAllowing provincial governments to override local decisions undermines municipal autonomy and weakens the ability of city councils and mayors to govern effectively. Traffic lane management directly impacts urban planning, which is traditionally within the jurisdiction of local authorities. This overreach sets a precedent that could hinder cities from addressing their unique transportation needs.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes in our city is not just shortsighted\u2014it\u2019s outright dangerous, wasteful, and counterproductive to solving the broader challenges we face as a growing urban center. This decision ignores the increased risk to cyclists, squanders taxpayer dollars, and does nothing to address the fundamental issue of traffic congestion.\nFirst and foremost, removing bike lanes forces cyclists back into traffic, endangering lives. Bike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents. Without them, cyclists are left vulnerable to cars in a city already plagued by unsafe road conditions. Encouraging active transportation, like cycling, should be a priority\u2014not penalized.\nFrom a fiscal perspective, the removal of bike lanes is a monumental waste of taxpayer money. These lanes were installed at significant cost, and tearing them out will only burden taxpayers further. This money could be better spent improving public transit or expanding bike lane infrastructure, both of which are critical to alleviating congestion.\nFinally, traffic is and will remain a reality in a city that has failed to invest adequately in public transit, even as it welcomes unprecedented population growth. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t magically solve traffic woes\u2014it will make them worse by pushing more people into cars and discouraging alternative modes of transportation.\nRemoving bike lanes represents a regressive, costly, and dangerous decision. Our city deserves leadership that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and solutions\u2014not quick fixes that move us backward.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto, near Casa Loma. I own a home, but have never owned a car. I use the cycling lanes/infrastructure for exercise and commuting.  I used the Bloor between Jane and Royal York corridor frequently this summer and fall. It is much safer than it used to be. I had to find routes to get west of Jane that were convoluted and difficult for many cyclists to do so safely previously.\nThe cost to remove them, the cost sunk in setting them up, the cost in excess traffic while doing so is wasteful and shouldn't be incurred.\nThe representatives of the city on its counsel voted against this/voted to preserve the infrastructure.\nPreserve the will of the people (not the will of the few neighbours of the Premier that complained to him) and keep the existing infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not proceed with this Bill. It has many unintended consequences and as City of Toronto taxpayer, I cannot fathom the amount of unnecessary energy and cost it will take to do this on Bloor, Yonge and University Ave. Not only is the Province is meddling in local planning issues, I fear it is distracting from other more important provincial issues that need to be addressed or that are hidden in other sections of this Bill.\nFrom a planning perspective, less bike lanes do not equate to less congestion. There are countless Torontonians that use the dedicated bike lanes to transport their families and travel to work, and they should be allowed to continue to do this safely. The issue of congestion has resulted from the combination of not making important infrastructure upgrades to the Gardiner and countless other places in the City earlier. The bike lanes are a (municipal) symptom of a much larger (provincial) problem.\nThe fact that the Bill would, if passed, require the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes is perhaps the worst overreach and must be reconsidered at a minimum. Efforts should instead be placed on accelerating highway projects that are already underway and would actually help congestion (401, Gardiner, etc.) than 3 main streets.\n"

        "comment": "First and foremost, you should understand that by removing bike lanes you are increasing the risk of danger, injury, and death to Torontonians who choose to bike. This demonstrates your lack of compassion and empathy toward citizens of the city.\nMoreover, there is a basic misunderstanding of how traffic operates. By removing bike lanes, you will not be decreasing the amount of cars on the road. In fact, you may even increase the amount of cars on the road as people find it too dangerous to bike and go back to driving. Thus, the overall amount of traffic will not decrease. The only real way to improve traffic conditions in Toronto is to invest money in more and better public transit, which reduces the amount of cars on the road.\nFinally, this bill shows an utter disregard for what is best for the environment, while simultaneously showing a disregard for the individuals of Toronto as well as the city as a whole, as stated above.\nIf you care for the safety, quality of life, and environment of Toronto, then you will not pass this bill.\n"

If the government is serious about reducing gridlock, they should invest in plentiful, easy-to-use bike lanes on both major and minor routes, which will allow more would-be motorists to instead cycle to get around, reducing the amount of traffic which is causing gridlock. Spending a frankly stupid amount of money on tearing up existing bike infrastructure and hamstringing local governments' ability to make decisions that best fit their communities is a stunning example of government overreach and fiscal irresponsibility.\n"
