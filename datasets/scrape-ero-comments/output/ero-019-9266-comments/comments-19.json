        "comment": "As someone who works downtown, I see the need for bike lanes. People ride to work and bike couriers move from business to business to deliver important documents in a timely manner. Add more cars to the road by expanding into bike lanes will make our streets less safe and if the government looked at any study worth its weight, they would see that there is only a short term gain in terms of traffic flow before added cars on the road slow the commute again. We need to think about the long term and the government only seems to care about the short term in order to get political gain. This like the 401 tunnel plan is very short sighted.\n"

It will result in more driving and more congestion, worse air quality, and worse road safety. Cyclists will die because of this policy. Due to this alone, I can never vote for a Ford government again.\n"

        "comment": "Given the actions taken against Toronto already (e.g., electoral interference when he reduced the number of councillor seats during the city election before last), provincial premiers resentful of their loss in a municipal election may take revenge on lower levels of government.\nInterfering in city politics by removing bike lanes is completely ridiculous micromanagement from the Province. The bike lane debate has always been handled between the residents of Toronto and their city government, and that's how it should remain.\n"

As a driver, I appreciate the separation bike lanes provide to ensure the cyclists\u2019 safety and to help me avoid a preventable accident. Toronto\u2019s Fire Chief is on the record as saying there has not been any degradation in emergency vehicle response times due to bike lane infrastructure. We need evidence-based solutions to gridlock, and all evidence points to bike lanes being safe and effective for traffic management!\n"

It\u2019s asinine based on environmental science and transportation science. This is a clear sign that Doug Ford is unfit for office and should step down, as he has already done enough damage to the province\n"

        "comment": "This proposal would bring more provincial \"big government\" control to local municipalities, impeding their ability to decide what works for their communities. The focus on \"Ontario Drivers\" should be on Ontarians at large. Studies have proven the bike lanes increase business to communities and create infrastructure to move people (both drivers and cyclists) more safely. But more importantly, municipalities should be free to make these choices on their own.  Allowing the province to meddle with the needs of municipalities will impede their ability to make their own decisions and bog the province down with more bureaucracy  (throwing them into issues they don't have the capacity to understand the full scope of), taking their focus away from critical provincial issues.\n"

The most likely outcome of removing bike lanes is increased mortality and increased congestion.\nThe government's willingness to kill cyclists in order to pander to misinformed drivers knowing full well that these changes won't even make things better for drivers in the long run is deeply, deeply cyncial and immoral.\n"

The province of Ontario is supposed to be moving forward with initiatives that protect our natural environment, and bike lanes encourage a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. The only way to reduce gridlock and congestion is to have fewer cars on our roads. Shame on you, Premier Ford.\n"

        "comment": "If the province is going to interfere in municipal business, it should be on housing, which is a far bigger priority. In fact, if we're putting in bike lanes, that's probably a decent indicator of somewhere that needs more housing (decent amount of destinations within bikeable distance). Just as we're starting to have transit-oriented development, we need bike lane-oriented development. Look at Bloor-Danforth in Toronto as a perfect example why - both bike lanes and a subway to help combat congestion, and yet there's barely any development there, pushing people out to where driving starts to make more sense.\n"

I want cities and towns to be able to establish bike lanes without requiring input or consultation with the province.\nI rely on bike paths/trails/lanes for my daily commute and for navigating the city. With millions of people moving into Toronto, we need more flexibility for cities and their neighborhoods to implement bike lanes which move more people, faster, than cars.\nJust this morning I narrowly avoided being sideswiped by a car. We need more bike lanes and better protections for cyclists and pedestrians. Especially northbound from Bloor to Lawrence!\n"

Can this government at least admit to the people that they are governing based on feelings and that they are doing this only as an attempt to get re-elected and not for the betterment of the Province\nDisgusting waste of tax payers money\nI hope cities inundate them with more requests than they know what to do with\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation for bike lane approval and action to remove existing lanes is an overreach into municipal affairs. No other forms of road design are administered this way and adds a punitive layer of red tape and approvals that is not informed by fact. Municipalities have the mandate, budgetary responsibility, and expertise to make these decisions.\nThere is no objective evidence that bike lanes are a significant cause of gridlock in Ontario. There is no evidence in the proposed law or public comments by the minister that any fact based decision making and use of best practices to reduce road congestion have gone or will go into this decision making.\nFuther, commitments to expedite highway expansion and support suburban sprawl to bedroom/commuter communities without a credible plan to create new urban centres is the actual source of congestion in urban roads. Without viable transit alternatives, such as high frequency regional rail service, light rail, and bus networks, Ontarians are forced to select car travel funnelled into already congested urban networks.\nThe law will contribute to Ontario's continued stagnation and is a misallocation of government resources and overreach into municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are NOT the problem, they are the solution.  The population of Ontario is going up.  Without more public transport and more bike lanes, people will have to keep using cars.  Can the number of lanes on the streets and highways keep increasing with the increase in population?  Of course not.  Eventually, space to put in extra car lanes and and extra highway lanes will run out.  Every other major state on the planet has already figured out that you can not infinity increase car and highway lanes to keep up with population growth.  It is simple common sense that alternative modes of transportation must be built to keep up with population growth.  Bike lanes and public transport are the solution.\nTo put a single cyclist life at risk for the sake of a car driver saving  3 minutes on their commute is not ethical or rational.\nIf you DO limit the number of bike lanes and make it more dangerous for me to bike to work, I will just get in my car and start driving to work and the car congestion will just get worse.\nBill 212 is likely the most regressive bill to be past by any government on the planet.  You will put Ontario on the global map as the most backward province.\n"
