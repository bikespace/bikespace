        "comment": "None of this will actually reduce gridlock. Gridlock is not caused by \"number of lanes\", but rather user behaviour.\nBanning \"right turn on red\" would help much, much more. This would stop people from feeling they have to enter an intersection on green when the lane ahead is backed up in order to stop a right turner from cutting in front of them (which is illegal, but not enforced).\nFurthermore it's been well established that putting in more, faster lanes just means that people drive further, more often and with less planning.\n407 should never have been privatized and is highly underutilized.\nTaking away valuable farmland to make more roads is extremely short-sighted and doesn't belong in this bill.\n"

And when the lanes aren't properly up kept (particularly in winter months) then they become all but useless.\nI say all this as a person who drives a car. I rely on my car to get around because I acknowledge that as it stands it's impossible to do otherwise.\nWe need high speed rail transit in this province to facilitate movement between large cities. And high quality buses, subways, and trains within cities or else we'll just keep building highways until the province is nothing but pavement.

The reason why I feel comfortable doing it because there are bike lanes that made sure bikers have sufficient space to travel safely. Removing bike lanes is a total step back from promoting diverse travelling options.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a pathetic attempt for the corrupt Ford administration to bypass environmental laws and line the pockets of wealthy developers and donors via the 413. This legislation does nothing to actually address traffic concerns and reduce gridlock, as it will 1) put more vehicles on the roadways, rather than encouraging and incentivizing people to commute using alternative forms of transportation, 2) does nothing to reduce the number of vehicles on roadways by providing safe, reliable, and affordable alternatives to driving, and 3) will lead to more motorist-bicyclist collisions, posing a significant public safety risk. Shame on the Ford government for this atrocious misuse of public funds and lack of evidence-based decision-making. If this legislation goes forward, expect more cyclist deaths and increased gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This whole bill is backwards and the opposite of being progressive.   Bike lanes reduce vehicular traffic on the road and at the same time, protect cyclists and e-scooters.  Every time I ride my bike or scooter somewhere that's one less vehicle on the road and less traffic.  I commute to work this way when the weather is good and it takes vehicles off the road.   I can actually get around faster on a bike or PEV quicker than my car in my city and don't need to worry about parking.  There also seems to be an epidemic of vehicles in collisions with cyclists as well, as people in heavy vehicles aren't paying attention to driving.  Removing bike lanes that help protect cyclists and give more room for them is absolutely morally corrupt with the number of accidents being seen and severity of injuries involving large vehicles colliding with cyclists.\nOn top of the objections above, allowing expedited expropriation of property that this bill is allowing/enabling which has nothing to do with cyclists is the real reason this is trying to be pushed through and divide people on the cyclist issue is also very corrupt.  Omnibus bills should be disallowed, as corrupt politicians continue to use this avenue to sneak through and hide changes to the law .  If this is that important, this issue should absolutely be split out as it's own bill and voted on separately.\n"

These lanes provide a safe and eco-friendly transportation option for thousands of residents, reduce traffic congestion, and promote healthier lifestyles. Removing them contradicts the push for sustainability and urban modernization that our cities desperately need. Instead of eliminating bike lanes, we should be expanding and improving them to create more inclusive, multimodal infrastructure that benefits everyone, not just drivers.

        "comment": "This is a complete and utter waste of government resources and funds. If you look at any city larger than our Canadian cities the way to reduce car traffic the most is to create a developed network of bike paths that allows users to get to and from high traffic areas without the use of a car. Making more lanes of traffic incentivises people to use cars rather than bike which adds more cars into the equation making traffic worse. If we want to actually reduce traffic we should look at the strategy of European cities that do not cater to cars and have developed and connected cycling infrastructure.\n"

Removing bike lanes won't stop Toronto bikers from biking on that particular street, it will just endanger everyone involved. Please don't make the complaints of drivers overrule the safety of bikers. It's a driver's fault for continuing to drive in a traffic congested city when there are other options of getting around. The city should be promoting and investing in public transit to make it more convenient and more enticing to leave your car at home.\n"

        "comment": "We need to look at this as a whole. Private vehicles take up a lot of space in our cities. Unfortunately, trying to solve traffic congestion from only the view of cars will not work. As cities continue to grow and more cars end up on roads, any new infrastructure (new roads, more lanes etc.) will reach capacity and we'll be back at square one. You can only provide so much new infrastructure before there is no room or resources left. Instead, improvements to active and public transportation methods should be made to encourage more people to make trips without a private vehicle. Many trips that people make are a very short distance that could be easily walked, biked, or by taking public transit (City of Toronto, Page23-24, 2012). We can also connect our cities through higher order transit for those longer intercity trips. No one likes being stuck in traffic, sitting behind a wheel. In a bus or train, they at least have the capacity to do something else while they wait to reach their destination, and you don't get massive congestion with people or bikes like you do cars. Removing the ability of municipalities to implement bike lanes where a car lane would be removed is giving the Provincial Government to much power over municipalities who understand their cities better than anyone else. As well, money was spent on implementing existing bike lanes, and now for more money to be spent to remove them, is not right as that money would be much more valuable if used elsewhere (such as our struggling healthcare system), especially when future parties will likely want to re-implement these bike lanes, which would cost even more. There are no benefits to anyone other than the government trying to win some votes because they claim they can help eliminate traffic by allowing more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "As a regular bike commuter in the province, I strongly disagree with this proposal to allow the Government to remove bike lanes as they so choose. I commute to work 3x a week (and often to other places as well, such as the gym and social activities) via cycling as it saves me both time and money compared to driving or taking the bus. If I didn't have as many safe, separated bike lanes to take on my commute, I would certainly think twice about cycling, especially in the early mornings and evenings when it is darker outside, as I would start to be concerned about my own safety as a cyclist. According to StatsCan, an average of 74 Canadians die each year from cycling collisions, 73% of which were collisions with cars. Areas where cycling is more prevalent, and therefore with better cycling infrastructure, tend to have lower rates of bicycle-related fatalities. The proposal to remove bike lanes on busy roads throughout the province to \"improve traffic\" shows no consideration for the safety of cyclists and active commuters and will almost certainly result in higher bicycle-related collisions. Are the safety and lives of active commuters less important to your government than the amount of time it takes drivers to reach their destination?\nAccording to a poll by CAA, 40% of Canadians say that they would be more motivated to cycle more if bike lanes are separated by a physical barrier. In this period of time where many people are concerned about climate change and are actively looking for ways to go green, the government should be encouraging active transportation, not discouraging it by removing infrastructure that makes it safer and more convenient for the public. This proposal is extremely shortsighted and serves only to address an immediate concern that commuters such as the Premier have to sit in their cars for a few minutes longer on their drive into downtown Toronto. It does not show consideration to the fact that active commuting is on the rise: between 1996 and 2016, the number of Canadians using bicycles as their main method of commuting doubled (The Globe and Mail). It additionally does not show consideration to the taxpayers; this proposal will result in millions of dollars being spent to undo work that already cost millions of dollars. I don't see any way that taxpayers should be happy with your government spending double the initial cost with nothing to show for it at the end, not to mention that EVERY commuter will now be inconvenienced by construction road closures yet again while the bike lanes that were just recently installed get ripped up.\nIn conclusion, I strongly urge the government to reconsider this shortsighted proposal, which shows no consideration for the safety of active commuters, no consideration for the environmental benefits of active commuting, and no consideration for the cost and inconvenience to taxpayers for pointless construction work on their roads.\n"
