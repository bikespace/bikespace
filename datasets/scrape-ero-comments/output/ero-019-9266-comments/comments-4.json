I expect the Ontario Government to focus on building public transit; something that is in their purview and will help with traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This change leading to the removal of, or prevention of new, bike lanes would force me to buy and use a car to get to work and around the city. I currently use a combination of walking, cycling, transit, and driving our one shared car to get me and my family around. If any bike lanes are removed, it would make it too dangerous to ride. I won't allow my kids to ride on a street without safe bike lanes. There have been too many kids and adults injured or killed by drivers on streets without bike lanes. Protecting my family would force us to drive more, which is going to add to congestion and take up a parking space at the GO station. This truly worries me and is the wrong direction for our province.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal puts cyclists, drivers and pedestrians at great risk of injury/death and liability. I bike everyday, including in the winter, with my family (2 small kids) as does my partner. I know at least 5 families that do the same. I cross the city daily from Regent Park to Liberty Village and back. I go to all our family activities in the city by bike. If I take the train, I take a bike to the train station. We even go up from Regent Park to Don Mills/Eglinton on the regular for classes. And we bike up to Markham/Richmond hill a few times a year. Please don't remove the bike lanes that make this a safer activity for us. Please don't make us loop around to find safe roads and bike lanes. Cyclists need direct routes that are protected/safe to make cycling feasible. It is not a hobby for many and is a way of commuting.\nBike lanes keep many people out of ubers, cars and transit. The more high quality, protected bike lanes we have, the more people will cycle to help with congestion. Otherwise, you will definitely have more people in Ubers and cars to add to congestion on the road, and more cars parked on the road, which will defeat the purpose of removing bike lanes since these lanes will still be blocked by parked cars.\n"

        "comment": "I take the Bloor and University bike lanes daily from my home in the West end of Toronto to my office downtown. I also use them (and many other bike lanes) with my children regularly.\nThe bike lanes helped me make a decision to stop driving as often and participate in a healthy, environmentally friendly mode of transportation and be one less car on the road to create gridlock. I hope to continue to be able to do that safely and efficiently.\nThe government has not provided any statistics or data that illustrate how removing bike lanes would positively impact congestion, especially on a street like Bloor where the lanes closest to the sidewalk were almost always clogged with parked cars or construction vehicles.\nMy life and my children's lives would be far less safe if bike lanes are removed.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a cyclist who lives in Downtown Toronto and uses these lanes every day to get to work and go shopping, visit friends etc. One of the things that I think is most overlooked about this bike lane debate is the fact that many of the most controversial lanes are on roads that are directly above subways that have been there for decades.\nAren't subways built to encourage people to use them as an alternative to the car? Hasn't this been their main purpose since the Yonge line was built in 1954? Why are we now turning our backs on that concept and making it as easy as possible to drive above a subway?\nWhen I talk to residents of Ontario outside of Toronto most of them have no idea that the most controversial roads with bike lanes are above subways, and when I explain that they become incredulous. A person from Chatham doesn't want their tax dollars to be used to remove bike lanes that are directly above a mass transit system.\nWe need to encourage the use of our transit infrastructure, not encourage people to bypass it.\n"

        "comment": "My commute to work (6km one way) via car is 45 minutes. My commute to work via transit is 60 minutes. My commute to work via bike is 20 minutes. 80% of it is in safe protected bike lanes. Almost all of which required removal of a lane of parking for cars.\nThis law may require me to take 50 to 80 mins extra time per day away from my family. That's over 2 full weeks of my year - away from my family. Are you kidding me? And it will be put me in harms way if I continue to bike. For what? So Doug can not see a bike on his drive to work? Studies have shown drive times increased by 1-3 mins and emergency vehicles are not impeded. There's a subway under Bloor that Doug can take to work.\nI may still bike if I can find the right route and sure as hell I will take the whole driving lane to protect my safety.\nThis is a ridiculous over reach and petty spiteful politics. Do not do this. It is completely misaligned with any actual need or data.  Focus on health care and transit. You are failing as a government there.\n"

        "comment": "To limit what a big city like toronto can do with respect to installing bike lanes is not a wise move. The reality is that 5-10 years from now when thousands would have moved here, traffic will be worse. Transit won\u2019t yet be completed. Telling new residents that they only have one choice to commute (the car) is sending a wrong message. You need safer infrastructure for more people to consider cycling and it\u2019s starting to show. The riding numbers are at the highest they\u2019ve ever been. Do not go through with this.\n"

Safe cycling infrastructure is proven to increase cycling rates, which means less people driving and less congestion. This legisllation is clearly aimed at reducing the amount of safe cycling infrastructure accessible to Ontarians.\nFurthermore, the proposed legislation will place an undue amount of \"red tape\" around municiplaties, making it harder and slower for local transportation decisions to be made locally. It will as well most certainly at extra cost to making and implementing transportation infrastructure changes and will be an added burden to Ontario taxpayers.\n"

        "comment": "This is interfering in municipal dealings after the government says it trusts municipalities.\nThis will kill bike riders and not ease congestion.\nThe province's offer to pay for removal of bike lanes is fiscally irresponsible and the misplaced priorities is gross negligence.\nThe province has greatly reduced revenue through unconsented stealth privatization by cancelling beer store contracts early (and paying for it), unecessarily moving the science centre, despite it being unavailable, reduced, and costing more than just repairing, paying for privatized healthcare and agencies & fighting for bill 124 rather than paying nurses fairly. Wasting huge amounts of money on Therme /Ontario Place development undertaken with questionable practices. And bribing voters with 200$ payout that will do nothing for most individfuals, but would represent significant grouped spending. With crumbling healthcare after years & billions of austerity, after receiving billiions in transfers federal for a purpose that was not used to the intended purpose, it is inappropriate to spend money on frivolous things like interfering in municipal land use.\nIt is grossly negligent, because it foreseeably increases risk of death and lifelong disability on 2 counts - increasing mix of bikes and cars (after rushing through a license backlog, and covid drelated cognitive decline and effect on driver ability - there is a widely circulating study on the effects) which will lead to increased collisions. And on the back end, where hospitals are underfundedd and collapsing. All in debt except Vaughan. So acute care for injury is affected. Millions of residents do not have a primary care practitioner - projected to 25% in a few years. Disability supports are insufficient to live on. This spells a total disaster, and clearly infringes on numerous rights. No effective government would consider  doing this.\n"

No one in Ontario voted for a provincial party that was committed to removing bike lanes as it wasn't a part of the current government's mandate.

Last year I rode my bike to work all but one day when the snow/ice/cold made it too uncomfortable to ride.\n"

        "comment": "This whole plan is flawed in so many ways, and a giant waste to taxpayers. More evidence that Doug Ford's goals do not align with those of the citizens of Ontario.\nBike Lanes\nThey are critical infrastructure to reduce gridlock and increase rider safety. Everyone on a bicycle is one less car in our city streets. That's a win. Using taxpayer money to tear them up, or requiring the gov't to approve of new lanes being built is a huge overstep in their powers.\nHighway 413\nThis highway is completely unnecessary, given that it largely twins the 407. Buy back that highway, or work out a deal with them to move truck traffic to the 407 and immediately traffic flow on the 401 and 403 improve. The fact that this government is spending our money to heavily advertise this highway while it's not been fully planned or costed is again absurd, and more proof that this government has no interest in respecting the taxpayers in this province.\nFurther, this line shows a continued lack of transparency - by design - from this gov't:\nInformation maintained in confidence\n(3) The Minister and every person employed in the Ministry that has access to information supplied under this section shall maintain it in confidence.\nI note that there appears to be no section describing the tender or costing process of the work itself.\nChanges to The Towing and Storage Safety and Enforcement Act, 2021\nRemoving the need for tow drivers to display their names and/or certified names can lead to abuse, as enforcement of certifications is not improved in this act. The public needs to know who is towing vehicles, and be able to verify their standing in the province with respect to certification.\nAll this to say, this act and the plans therein are wholly in the interest of the gov't and their benefactors, not the people of Ontario. No studies suggesting this course of action over others are mentioned, and no attempts to save the province money through these plans are detailed.\n"

It is not the provincial governments responsibility to address transportation decisions within municipalities and is simply a waste of taxpayer money.\nAdditionally, if the reason for this is to reduce congestion, then it's simply the wrong approach anyways. Every bike you take off the road by reducing safe bike lanes adds another vehicle, this increasing congestion. Municipalities should have the right to create multi-modal transit options within their region as they see fit to reduce congestion but also increase the safety and enjoyment of the City. Those who travel by vehicle are not the only priority and are catered to more than any mode of transportation already. This is coming from a person who solely commutes by vehicle.\n"

        "comment": "I highly disagree with Doug Fords proposed legislation that would force municipalities to get permission from the office of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Transportation before putting in bike lanes which take up a lane of traffic. This is backward thinking legislation designed to put even more cars on the road when we are in a climate emergency which requires progressive policies designed to reduce burning of fossil fuels. Progressive thinking would put research and money into efficient, easy to access public transit, as well as lanes and pathways to accommodate the safe travel for more bicycles and pedestrians. I urge the Premier to look at the wealth of research that clearly debunks the idea that more lanes and roads for cars is the answer to traffic congestion. The CBC article from this morning (\u201cDo Bike Lanes Really Cause More Traffic Congestion? Here\u2019s What the Research Shows\u201d) is one case in point.\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nI ask Doug Ford\u2026Where is your research? I hope the Ontario Conservative Party does the right thing and takes this bad idea off the table.\n"
