Pay attention to the changed principles of building urban infrastructure. It's not worth waiting for quick changes from new bike paths, but the end result is absolutely worth it, and it's a crime to reduce it.\nApparently, the law is promoted by a citizen who is not particularly at ease with sports and is overweight?\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong resident of Toronto who has lived all over the city (including the area where Doug Ford resides), I find it completely ridiculous to remove bike lanes on primary routes. I personally witness countless people using these lanes daily, myself included. The removal or relocation of these lanes will not only increase city traffic but also create hazardous conditions for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\nLet\u2019s look at the facts: since the introduction of protected bike lanes on routes like Bloor, cycling in Toronto has increased by 36% in certain areas, and the number of vehicle-cyclist collisions has decreased significantly. These lanes are critical for reducing congestion as they offer a safe, efficient alternative to driving and allow for more people to travel through high-traffic areas without adding to car volume.\nFurthermore, many of the stats reported by the government against cycling infrastructure are either inaccurate or misleading, with some citing incomplete routes, such as Eglinton Avenue, which is still under construction. Using such skewed data as justification for removing bike lanes, along with the premier\u2019s personal anecdotal evidence on his morning commute in his SUV, is not only disingenuous but fails to acknowledge the proven benefits of completed bike corridors across Toronto.\nStudies from cities worldwide confirm that dedicated cycling infrastructure improves traffic flow and reduces commute times. Toronto, with its already high volume of commuters, benefits immensely from this. Removing bike lanes from major arteries is a regressive move that ignores modern urban planning and environmental priorities, while costing taxpayers more in traffic, accidents, and pollution.\nWith the climate crisis and an increased demand for sustainable, active transportation, dismantling these bike lanes is a move backward. It disregards Toronto\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions and meeting sustainability goals. We need better cycling infrastructure, not less, and dismantling it ignores the needs and safety of thousands who rely on these routes.\nI personally knew a woman whose sister passed away after being struck by a driver; she was not on a bike path, and if she had been, this tragedy might have been prevented. Safe, dedicated infrastructure saves lives. Removing these lanes puts lives at risk and undermines the vision of a safer, more accessible Toronto for all. People who bike down these routes will continue too and it will just cause more congestion as well as more fatalities.\nAs person who loves the city of Toronto, I kindly ask you to reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous overreach by the province. You need to allow the cities to plan and build the infrastructure they need. Ontario's biking infrastructure is in its infancy stages and just like transit, it is infrastructure that needs to be built before the demand gets too high. If you build it they will come. Alternate forms of transit other than car need to be invested in now not blocked. Especially in more urban environments.\n"

        "comment": "I fully disagree with this bill and will leave Ontario for Quebec if it were to be passed. This is more than just some bill removing a few blocks of paint. It is actively infringing on the people's right to choose how they get around. It is also wasting taxpayer money on removing pre-existing infrastructure that have shown to improve the local economy. The unnecessary construction will not only negatively impact businesses, but also drivers as it will simply cause more traffic. This bill has almost no positive qualities and will make getting around within Ontario cities worse for both drivers and cyclists. As someone that both cycles and drives, this has such a massive impact on my day-to-day activities, that I need to start considering moving elsewhere. While driving, there is going to be a lot more gridlock from the construction and cyclists now going onto the road. While cycling, I now have to take longer, more dangerous routes that are farther from my local grocery store. This bill will benefit no one, and only seeks to turn transportation into a childish political issue, purposely ignoring what works. Our cities will be worse for everyone if the bill were to pass, and will drive most of your highest-paying taxpayers to other provinces that actually care about making life better for their residents.\n"

This allowed straight-forward and no-hassle access to so much of the city without having to bring a personal vehicle.\nArriving by train (Amtrak from New York), the protected bicycle routes made travel to my hotel easy and safe.  In the days after, the bicycle routes made access to shops, cafes, and transit wonderfully safe and easy.\nIt is extremely worrying to hear that the mayor of Toronto is considering removing any bike lanes.  While Montreal's were extensive, they were not comprehensive and deserve to be expanded.  I hope Toronto's government will take similar steps as Montreal, making access to the city for tourists not be dependent on bringing an automobile to your lovely cities.\nPlease preserve your bicycle routes and continue to expand them.\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment.\n"

        "comment": "I support the protection of bike lanes in the province of Ontario, even at the cost of extra car lanes. I used to commute to work via bicycle years ago just outside of Toronto, but a big reason I stopped included a lack of protected bike lanes in my area leading to dangerous close calls with drivers (even in side streets). They did not respect my space or even understood what bike signals meant (most just thought I was waving to someone). I moved to sidewalks for safety, but had confrontations with pedestrians demanding I go back to the roads despite always dismounting when I saw people or crossed the street. There was literally nowhere to go un-threatened, and I had to rely on public transportation (several dollars per day, both ways, for 5-6 days per week, unreliably) in fair weather for a trip of only a few kilometers. If cyclists are not able to use the road safely, and it is technically illegal to use sidewalks, where should cyclists go? Freedom of transportation is important for those that need options, and it is short sighted to think everyone should drive and contribute to an already absurd amount of traffic when investment can make other ways attractive. More people will bike if the network allowed for it through proper/safe infrastructure that is interconnected. As is, side streets are often unable to accommodate trips practically, so there will be less adoption of cycling overall if their trip will be made several times longer than if going straight on a main route. Cars are necessary, but drivers are not the only people that exist in this province, and having too many of them is the reason why traffic exists. Eventually there will be no space in Toronto to put \"just one more lane\" unless you destroy homes, businesses, and parks.\n"

Not only is this a huge waste of tax-payer money, but as a driver myself, I sympathize with those that commute primarily by bike. It\u2019s much safer for cyclists to have a dedicated lane and important for the city to provide alternate methods of transportation outside of cars. In addition, I use the University and Bloor bike lanes daily to complete small shopping trips as well as recreationally (the connection between University and the lake is especially valuable in the summer months). This is disgusting overreach on behalf of the province and I am disappointed in the priorities of the current government.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal seeks to remove bike lanes from Bloor, Yonge, and University and redesignate them to vehicles. The purported justification for this is that \u201cRecognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\u201d Note that the justification says that lane closures (to vehicles) can worsen traffic congestion. This is a conceptual possibility. But the fact that worsening traffic congestion is a conceptual possibility does not show that bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University do in fact worsen traffic congestion.\nThe main reason to doubt this is that opening bike lanes gives an incentive for people to not use cars. All else being equal, this would improve traffic conditions, not worsen them. So, just because lane closures to vehicles can worsen traffic congestion does not mean that they will worsen traffic congestion. This is because bike lanes can improve traffic conditions by providing an incentive for people to bike rather than drive.\nOf course, this does not mean that we must have bike lanes (we must look carefully at the actual data). However, this does mean that this proposal\u2019s reasons are not good, and should thus be rejected.\n"

I use bike lanes every day and consider them essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks. We need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users, instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road. When I drive I would much rather cyclists be out of the way in their own bike lanes. Bike lanes support transit investments by making it easier to get to stations. Public spaces should help facilitate safe human-scale transportation for all taxpayers. Removing existing infrastructure is terribly wasteful. We need more bike lanes not fewer.\n"

Just because you don't see 10 cars sitting still clogging the massive lanes doesn't mean cyclists aren't using the cycling infrastructure and quickly and efficiently moving across the city using a fraction of the space. Not to mention the large gaps in the cycling infrastructure in the city, it seems like a very foolish argument against improving the city that cyclists don't make a bigger portion of the traffic.

        "comment": "This proposal is a complete reversal of any progress towards a more equitable, sustainable or smart society.\nThe idea that bikes lanes should be removed in favor of \"just one more lane\" of car traffic is absurd.\nTo start with the actual logic of the change, it is well known that adding another lane will do nothing to make lasting long term reductions in traffic build up, a problem that can only be solved with large scale elegant city planning and careful thought.\nIn regards to the bike lanes themselves, these lanes are clear and obvious ways to actually and immediately reduce congestion. One person on a bike takes up a fraction of the space of a person in a car, for the entire duration of the trip, including parking at the destination. Bikes lanes can handle thousands of cyclists a day with the minimal space. The most effective use of resources should be spent building SAFE, efficient and usable bike infrastructure so we can make up for the decades of progress we have missed in this area.\nPast all of the tangible travel time and congestion points above, one cannot possibly overstate the importance of bike travel on the overall wellbeing society and the environment. Personal health and economic gain can be had instantly from every single trip made by bike no matter how short.\nIn summary, the plan to remove cycling infrastructure in favor of wider roads is a antiquated and short sighted decision, clearly driven by those without the right intentions. Please seriously consider the public resistance to this plan and use our tax dollars to improve our cities and towns transportation infrastructure in a responsible way, not keep them in them a car dependent state which has trapped people in an unhealthy cycle which they cannot opt out of.\n"

I find this an overreach and extremely unnecessary.\nIn practical terms, academic research (not talking about opinion pieces, but actual scientific research) clearly debunks that bike lanes cause worse traffic. In a city like Toronto, there are very few alternatives, so when cycling is unsafe, people will turn back to cars.\nI drive and cycle in Toronto. When I do either of these at places without proper biking infrastructure, I feel unsafe. On a bike, it feels like a death trap to find space next to cars. And similarly, I am terrified for the life of cyclists when I happen to be behind the steering wheel. Without proper bike lanes they move less predictably, they are less visible, and closer to car traffic. Removing and limiting bike lanes goes directly against Vision Zero goals. Some people's convenience should not be prioritized over people's safety.\nAnd lastly, keep catering for cars primarily is just not sustainable. In dense areas there is just no space for everyone to drive. There must be safe and efficient alternatives - public transit and cycling.\n"
