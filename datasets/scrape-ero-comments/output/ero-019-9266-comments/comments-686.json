        "comment": "This is an incredible overreach of provincial government. Why should the province control where a city puts its bike lanes? How is that provincial responsibility? This smacks of corruption and pettiness, that bureaucracy and red tape and government overreach would be put in place because Doug Ford is mad about something on his commute. And instead of working with the city, he's trying to institute a childish power grab.\nI am absolutely, fundamentally opposed to this proposal. All it does it make it harder for cities to plan and increases bureaucracy and government involvement. Keep the province OUT of municipal affairs!\n"

        "comment": "I am frankly baffled by Bill 212, which makes no sense to me on a practical level.\nIt will cost millions of dollars to dig up the bike lanes that have been installed (additionally wasting the money the city has already spent on their installation), and create months or years of construction mess - adding to traffic gridlock in the city.\nI also think the Bill is an example of provincial overreach. Municipalities are in the best position, and have the legal right and responsibility, to oversee infrastructure projects in the interest of their citizens.\nThirdly, the Bill is an example of backwards thinking on the part of the province.  World class cities all around the world are investing in cycling infrastructure, with excellent results in terms of safety, quality of life and last but not least, traffic gridlock.\nFourthly, the rationale underlying the proposal is not borne out by the facts. Traffic congestion in our cities has been created by poor planning, provincial interference and unrestrained development over the past decades (and in particular over the past 5 years). While running roughshod over the city's ability to reign in speculators and big developers who throw up massive condo towers throughout the city core, the province then blames the resulting congestion and traffic chaos on bike lanes.\nFinally, separated bike lanes actually work! They encourage more people to cycle as a form of commuting - not just young fit men, but women, youth and older people who are at present more fearful of hazarding a biking commute in the traffic nightmare that is Toronto. Separated, safe bike lanes are part of the solution to traffic congestion, not a cause.\nThank you in advance for taking my comments into consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I've lived in the city for about 8 years and started biking as a means of transportation in 2023. Previously I had been intimidated by biking as I was concerned about my safety. However, I noticed that the city had improved bike lanes significantly. Which many roads having protected lanes and biking infrastructure.\nThe presence of this infrastructure encouraged me to start biking. Since then I have loved riding my bike around the city. It gives me a sense of independence, it's fun, and allows me to travel anywhere I need to go in the city. I frequently utilize the bloor street bike lanes, university bike lanes, Adelaide and Richmond bike lanes, Spadina bike lanes and others as I move through the city.\nOccasionally, I've ridden on roads with no bike lanes such as some parts of queen street and it feels significantly unsafe compared to where bike lanes exist. However I am rarely the only biker on those roads either.\nI encourage everyone around me to bike if they are able to. And when people take me up on it, they always mention how there's more bike lanes than they thought and how much easier it is to get to their destination because of it.\nIt has also been incredible for my physical and mental health. Bike lanes save lives and it is important that the city protects all forms of transportation in the city. Like drivers, I am simply trying to get to and fro safely. The city has been doing a great job of improving biking infrastructure and I believe it is of the utmost importance to move forward and not backwards.\n"

        "comment": "This is not forward thinking at all. The population density of Toronto is increasing. Bikes keep cars off roads. We will have to move to more walking/biking which is safer in higher density areas. Health, Safety, efficiency. Bikes are the future for Toronto.\nIt should be the citizens of Toronto who make decisions regarding their transit system, not the MPP\u2019s of the 905.\nThis legislation is short sighted and will cause deaths.\nPlease support safer transportation by supporting bike lanes and the autonomy of city hall to make the right decisions for its citizens\n"

        "comment": "Safe cycling infrastructure is so important to all Torontonians. So many of the people I talk to in my life will only cycle on Toronto's streets that have designated bike lanes, because it's often just too dangerous to bike among the cars. 6 cyclists have died this year from accidents with vehicles, not too mention the many more non-fatal accidents that rarely get reported on, how many more lives before the safety of cyclists AND pedestrians is taken seriously? Not only from studies right here in Toronto, but also with all the stats from other cities worldwide it's clear to see that building and extending safe cycling infrastructure is a healthier and cost efficient option for people to travel around our city. And it also helps us towards achieving climate goals, as it's a whole lot better for the environment as well. If you take away our bike lanes and stop future bike lanes from being built, then expect cyclists to start being more aggressive on Toronto's roads, taking up more of the vehicle lanes and slowing traffic. Stop Bill 212 and Ford from taking away our current bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This whole plan will only make things worse.  The problem is not the lack of roads but too many cars which simply can\u2019t fit inside the city of Toronto.  Doug Ford is spreading a false narrative and should stay out of urban planning because he\u2019s not qualified and should let those professionals who do this for living figure out how to solve congestion.  Urban sprawl into the green belt will simply create more traffic and enrage commuters and waste billions in taxpayers money.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential part of this city. I drive, cycle, and take transit and when I cycle, my commute to downtown is the fastest. I know that when I bicycle I am helping decrease congestion and pollution. Bike lanes create a safe and quick mode of commuting.\nI think that bike lanes should be on less travelled or one way streets. I think that bike traffic lights are so helpful, and I think that posting laws about right of way would also be helpful. I do believe that having a bike lane on University was a mistake. Large commuter routes should be reserved for cars.\nBike lanes have to work in conjunction with other traffic systems, too. The bike lane and traffic light on Duoro at Staughan st for example is not set up for success. Cars turning right onto Straughan are constantly being held up waiting for bikes. The lights should allow a period of time for cars to turn, after the bikes are stopped.\n"

        "comment": "I have two major concerns. The premier appears to be basing his views and making decisions on personal observations of his travel and not based on facts or an open debate and on the pros and cons of active transportation in a large city. He seems too have once again adopted the bully tactics we see so often to the south of us. A kind of \"I know what's best for everyone\" solution.\nMy second concern is has to do with the need for better education for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians on sharing urban transportation infrastructure.\nPersonally, as a cyclist using roads, bike paths, multi use pathways and bike lanes (some with curbs or flex poles to give a sense of false security and safety) I prefer to ride in a lane used by both cyclists and drivers who are know the rules of the road, how to share the road and allow sufficient time to reach their destination at safe speeds.\nI believe the final decision should reside with the municipality and proper funding provided from all levels of government.\n"

Despite scientific evidence showing that bike lanes improve congestion, safety, health, transit time, business, accessibility, to name only a handful of benefits, he\u2019d rather think he\u2019s saving ten minutes on his commute. I cycle to work every day as do many Torontonians, and he speaks for none of us. I\u2019m ashamed he\u2019s our premier and hope his dangerous stream of incompetency and crony-pleasing acts are put to an end. I already lament what Ontario place once was, please don\u2019t let him do the same to other beloved and important pieces of our city.\n"

        "comment": "I believe prioritizing cars will lead to more harm to cyclists. Many services like Uber Eats and other delivery services depend on cyclists, putting riders at greater risk of being injured in confrontations with larger vehicles. Let\u2019s get the crosstown transit happening to ease pressure on roadways from motorists who\nmight otherwise use transit.\nFor the past two years I used to ride my bike to and from work until a cyclist was killed earlier this year on Bayview extension south near the Brickworks. As a cyclist, it isn\u2019t always safe to not have dedicated bike lanes. Cyclists don\u2019t feel safe competing with bigger vehicles who exceed the speed limit and whip past bikes on roadways.\nI also question the actual cause of gridlock. It isn\u2019t necessarily due to bicycle lanes. Prior to bike lanes, there were parking lanes, which reduced traffic to one lane.  How is this any different from a bike lane reducing traffic?\nI still see delivery vehicles parking in bike lanes and cars nosing into intersections as the traffic lights turn red, blocking traffic in all directions and vehicles turning left through intersections after the light is red.  Better enforcement of these practices might ease these behaviours. Ultimately there need to be fewer vehicles on the road. Excellent and affordable transit is a start. Educating drivers is next. Other municipalities have come up with creative ways to ease gridlock. I think this city can too. Please, no more dead cyclists. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not solve congestion and will put lives at risk. It breaks my heart every time I hear about another tragic cyclist's death. Every time there is news of a cyclist dying, my mother will check in on me, worried that it is me.\nWhenever I bike by the site where 5-year old Xavier Morgan died off of Lakeshore Road, I think of all the young people who ride bikes whom I love and cherish. This city, this province, needs to prevent loss of life on the road wherever and whenever possible.\nI regularly bike to work and it is a big source of joy in my life. Please, please continue to build a network of safe and connected bikeways in this city. It is one of the parts of the city that makes me proud to live here. Thank you.\n"

Our lives matter just as much as a person who decides to drive a vehicle. This bill is a short term solution to satisfy the needs of people who could use public transit (GO Trains) to get into the city but decide to drive for convenience. Other cities around the world have this problems and have been able to keep their bike lanes. We should be looking at their example to follow instead of regressing the progress we have made so far.\n"
