        "comment": "Cars, too many of them are the real problem with gridlock. If we now add bicycles back into traffic lanes, everything will probably slow down even further and it will be unsafer for cyclists bc they are not encased in a 2 ton hunk of metal and will have to resort back to using a car. Cycling ridership is increasing even during winter months bc it is not as cold anymore and riding clothing has gotten better. Bike lanes have given more people access to cycling because it is not easy to ride in traffic with cars. People who don't have a lot of money can afford to ride a bike much easier than a car.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes and other non-automobile modes of transportation are vital for a city. Cars in Toronto alone cause over 38,000 accidents a year (1), kill dozens (2), cost billions of dollars annually (3), take up enormous amounts of space, transportation emits over 30% of the gas emissions of the city (4), and create constant noise which affects the health of citizens (5). Provincially they kill over 400 (6), cause over 36 thousand accidents (7), cost billions in infrastructure (8), and emitt around 50 MT (9). By removing bike lanes and adding restrictions you are going to make cities worse. Adding more car lanes has proven again and again to make congestion worse, as induced demand from more drivers using the road counteracts the extra space provided (10). So if this were to go through you would spend an estimate 48 million, removing bike lanes to intsall the deadly, ineffective, polluting car infrastructure to make traffic worse, congratulations (11).\nWith bike lanes businesses see more customers as has been proven by the bike lanes on Bloor Street (12), which is one of the targets of this bill. They also make cycling safer, reduce pollution, make citizens healthier, and biking is more accessible to those who can\u2019t drive do to any number of reasons. They also take cars off the road which helps reduce congestion, which is the entire goal of this bill. The reason the percentage of cyclists is so low compared to cars is because there is significantly less investment in bikes (11) than in cars (3), and the solution isn\u2019t to pump more money into cars (14).\nWhen you don\u2019t provide any meaningful alternative to driving, you force everyone to use one of the worst and least efficient modes of transportation that uses the most space per individual, costs tens of thousands to purchase, over a thousand per year in insurance, over a hundred per month in maintenance, over 300 per month in gas, and accelerates climate change which is actively killing hundreds of thousands per year (13) along with untold numbers of species and crippling economies. It is inaccessible to the visually impaired, deaf, neurodivergent, elderly, young, and actively makes their lives worse by forcing them to either find someone who can drive them places, take public transportation which is underfunded and slowed down extensively by cars, or forced to walk or bike with dangerous automobiles which could easily kill them BY ACCIDENT. Cars reduce the quality of life significantly for everyone (14). If we make it harder to transition away from cars we will spend decades dealing with the consequences. Investing in cars is among the worst possible thing Ontario could spend its taxpayers\u2019 money on. Why are we vilifying bike lanes (15) when there are actual problems that need to be tackled like the housing crisis. You don\u2019t need to make up a perceived problem and then spend millions fixing it. I\u2019d rather you spend your energy throwing the money that would need to be spent replacing the bike lanes into a fire because that at least wouldn\u2019t make life worse for Ontarians.\nReferences\n1.

        "comment": "Cycling the streets of Toronto is a scary proposition, when you have to share the street with all manner of vehicles whizzing by; cars, buses, trucks of all sizes, and even transport trucks. Where I ride most is the Yonge Street bike lane which takes me very close to work and even though I can work an 8+ hour shift on my feet, cycling to and from work is still my preferred method of transportation. Endorphin rush.... yes, it's a real thing - and what a way to start my work day! Oh, and how do I get to the Yonge Street bike lane.... via the Kay Gardner Trail (what a brilliant visionary idea that was!)\nWhat will removing bike lanes do? TBH it'll force cyclists out into a traffic lane. Will that be safe? Will that help traffic move faster? Will it not cause more accidents, and heaven help us all, more fatalities?\nWhy take away something that's already there, and that offers many proven\u00a0health benefits\u00a0as well as helping reduce our carbon footprint? Cities are for people, not just for cars. Please do not let Toronto go backwards, with a single minded\u00a0car-centric focus.\u00a0Comparing to other countries would be inaccurate, so take a look at what\u00a0Montreal\u00a0offers for its cyclists.\nI've cycled to work for a 6 a.m. start. I've cycled home from a 2 a.m. finish. I cycle to food\u00a0shop. To do errands. To meet friends for coffee, or a meal. I cycle for fun, and I'm happier and healthier for doing so.\nThanks for your time and attention to this most serious matter.\nps advised not to give name or address, I will just say that I'm a 60+ year female and I believe that Toronto should be adding bike lanes, not taking them away.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the province's undemocratic, unnecessary, and unwanted Bill 212. As a resident of Ontario, and a citizen of Toronto, I believe the contents of the legislation to be founded on shaky logic and magical thinking, when it comes to understanding how to effectively manage traffic gridlock and deliver Ontarians reliable, safe, and sustainable options for getting around.\nTime and time again, this provincial government has demonstrated that they are incapable of making sound decisions, when it comes to the management of the road infrastructure of Toronto. As Canada's most populous city, Torontonians require a complete, multi-pronged approach to moving people around, and in a worsening global environmental crisis, spurred on by greenhouse gas base climate change, this city needs to move away from prioritizing infrastructure that favours single-occupant cars (a wildly inefficient method for transportation), and instead prioritize public transportation options like rail transit and bicycle infrastructure. Our public systems are buckling under the pressure of population increase, and prioritizing \"solutions\" that prioritize the car will not ease the burden for any of us.\nFor a government that brands itself as fiscally responsible, its remarkable how comfortable it is with wasting taxpayer's money, as the act of forcibly removing the bike lanes will be an expensive waste to the careful investment the City Toronto made. According to the City Manager (source linked), the provincial taxpayer will be responsible for $48 million for removal of a $27 million investment. I don't think that sounds like a reasonable thing for a supposedly fiscally responsible thing for a government to do.\nAlso cited in the City Manager's report is documentation about increased cyclist safety that has tracked alongside the growth of the city's bike lane infrastructure. The take-away is simple: bike lanes save lives. By removing them from the proposed streets, the provincial government is sending a message that they are comfortable with increasing injury and death rates for cyclists... all to favour drivers. This is also inconsistent with sentiments Premier Ford has made himself on the matter: In 2017, Ford was quoted by TVO on a tv segment about bike safety in Toronto:\n\"You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\"\nOn November 14th, Toronto's City Council voted 21-4 in favour of presenting an opposed position to Bill 212. The province CAN NOT ignore the will of the Toronto and its elected officials, when it comes to managing city infrastructure.  I demand this government recognize this significant overreach, and step down from tabling Bill 212.\n"

Cars cause traffic, giving cars more space will increase the amount of cars on the road. Cyclists will also be riding in front of cars instead of in their own lane making this an awful choice for alleviating traffic in Toronto. 4 cars parked in front of a restaurant on Bloor do not make more money than the hundreds of people that pass by on foot or by bike or even by transit\n"

        "comment": "To the Government of Ontario:\nI am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212. Traffic is a problem in Toronto, however, the powers granted under this bill will not reduce gridlock in the city. As with most things, people will choose the path of least resistance when comes to transportation. People choose to drive in Toronto because people feel driving is the quickest and most convenient way to get to their destination. Removing bike lanes and limiting their construction is incredibly short-sighted because without providing viable alternatives to driving people will continue turning to cars and gridlock will continue. By supporting the infrastructure required for people to feel safe and efficient while biking, more people will choose this option over driving.\nPublic transit is another critical alternative to driving which will help to reduce traffic in the long-term and I sincerely appreciate the investments being made across Toronto (i.e. Ontario Line, Eglinton Cross Town), however the temporary impacts of these construction projects are also a source of traffic congestion. Blaming bike lanes for congestion and failing to acknowledge other sources is disingenuous and intentionally obtuse.\nI personally use the recently constructed Bloor St. W bike lanes in Etobicoke multiple times per week. I biked regularly on this section of Bloor before the bike lanes were constructed and feel so much safer now with the separated bike lanes. I regularly see people with cargo bikes and children using these bike lanes which was previously much less common. Removing the bike lanes will not prevent bikes from using these roads. If the bike lanes are removed, I will continue to bike on Bloor St. West because it is the most efficient east-west route across the city. In my experience side streets are not viable alternatives as they are less direct, often have poor visibility and introduce additional hazards, particularly when there are cars parked on most side streets.\nMy conclusion from personal experience as a cyclist in Toronto is that bike lanes are immensely positive overall.  This is supported by evidence from sources such as:\n(1) City of Toronto data presented at a public meeting organized by Etobicoke Lakeshore Councillor Amber Morley's in Oct 2024 showing a 60% increase in bike volume and continued improvements in response time for fire services before and after the lanes were installed\n(2) Economic benefits (described in research published here: https://tcat.ca/resources/bloor-street-economic-impact-studies/)\nTherefore, evidence supporting Bill 212 is lacking and the provided justification of \"common sense\" is unconvincing and clearly false.\n"
