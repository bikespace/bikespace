Canada and Ontario are no exception, despite their size and despite their weather. This proposal creates unnecessary barriers to the construction of those bike lanes. The Province should be supporting municipalities in their creation of effective and efficient bike lanes.\n"

Bike lanes help reduce gridlock so this is clearly about something else, specifically about bypassing environmental regulations when building roads. This is obvious corruption and if this passes it'll be my goal in life to ensure Doug Ford is not elected ever again. Doug, stop using your office to enrich your friends.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this is a foolish, short-term thinking proposal that will only funnel more resources away from things that should really be handled by the province like health care or protecting the environment as according to our national obligations. This needlessly disrupts biking initiatives, which are proven to lower environmental impact, improve local fitness, and actually reduce traffic in the areas in which they are implemented. I believe this proposal is a vague attempt at both trying to overreach from a provincial government whose leadership is increasingly out of control, as well as a distraction from other provincial matters and unpopular actions.\n"

        "comment": "I am so disappointed and frustrated by this Bill. Bike lanes have made my city more accessible for work, school, accessing heath care, restaurants, shopping, exercise, social activity, and everything in between. Municipalities are the best level of government to assess where and when bike lanes should be built without the added layer of bureaucracy and control from the province. In particular, urban areas of Ontario are very different from rural areas, and one single provincial body is not capable of understanding the needs of every municipality. This additional level of regulation is a waste of tax payer resources and will delay necessary projects.\nWhen the bike lanes on Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St. opened in Toronto, I started using my bike to commute to weekend brunch with friends, to go to work, to visit my family in mid-town. I felt like opportunities for exercise and exploration opened up to me. I was no longer restricted by fear of being hit by a car, and the limited operating hours of transit and unreliable estimated travel times by car.\nI have lived in this city for over 40 years and I have never been so active. If it wasn't for the bike lanes, I would not venture to many parts of the city so easily. These bike lanes make me feel safe enough to navigate our roads which are often dangerously shared with other motorized vehicles. The additional bike lane barriers allow drivers to see that bikes and pedestrians are in the area and to be aware and alert while driving. Bikes also create a safety barrier between pedestrians and cyclists, which when nonexistent, becomes more risky for everyone on a sidewalk.\nIn many world-class cities around the world, bikes are the standard mode of travel and it is because of bike lanes that they are easily embraced. I urge our government to consider the benefits of bike lanes that it brings to our communities. Whether this is to improve overall accessibility, improve the health of residents living in our neighbourhoods, create a welcoming place for travellers, or even to reduce the gridlock that this bill is meant to improve.\nThe Ontario government can build our highways and improve gridlock together without restricting bike lanes at the municipal level.\nPlease recognize the need to build priority bike lanes faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, and businesses time and money.\nPlease recognize that accidents and lane closures due to ongoing construction related to delayed transit projects and unmonitored condo construction spilling into roads can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\nBuilding Highway 413 can still be achieved ethically without controlling the municipal level.\nI firmly oppose the Bill 212 proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important part of cities. I and many people I know rely on bike lanes to safely navigate streets. Biking on the street is not a viable option for many people, and as I'm sure you're aware biking on the sidewalk is illegal and often ticketed. Removal of bike lanes will only serve to increase car traffic as many people who currently choose to bike will no longer bike if it is made markedly less safe and will instead further clog roads with cars. Additionally, some people can not afford options other than biking with the ever increasing costs of cars, car insurance, gas, and even public transit in many cities across Ontario.\nPlease think critically about how removal of bike lanes will impact the people you are meant to serve. It will hurt many of us.\n"

        "comment": "The government has its own reports stating that more lanes, roads and highways do not reduce congestion. It has been proven again and again, so it's misrepresenting real facts to say that it will somehow magically work this time. Only alternatives to driving reduce congestion. Furthermore, most people in the city support bike lanes, they help businesses despite baseless arguments to the contrary, and many would never cycle without safe routes. This includes children going to school, women, and older people. Removing them puts lives at risk and threatens more pressure on our already overburdened health care system, not even counting the effects of extra pollution on general health or that suburban areas in Toronto and elsewhere have higher heart disease rates because people spend too much time sitting. Bike lines do not cause congestion. You know this and yet you lie to the public about it to play politics and get votes. You have a responsibility to protect the lives of everyone in this province and this kind of legislation goes against that.\n"

        "comment": "As a constituent of Simcoe-Grey, I strongly oppose this legislation. As a resident of Wasaga Beach, I often rely on a bicycle for transportation, and lately I have noticed many of my neighbours doing the same. With electric bikes getting better and better, I often see people, including retirees and children, commuting along Beachwood Road, or zipping from town to town along the train trail. I also bring my bike into Toronto when visiting my aging parents, where I enjoy getting exercise and fresh air while running errands for them.\nEvery one of these people, in choosing to ride a bike, is taking a car off the road and reducing traffic. Studies and data bear this out: adding lanes to roads makes traffic worse in the long run, while bicycle lanes bring business to their communities while reducing congestion. Bike lanes also make the streets safer, not only for cyclists, but also for pedestrians and children.\nThis may seem like an urban issue, but with increasing numbers of cyclists in towns like Collingwood and Wasaga Beach, this legislation threatens to hold us back too. I look forward to a future in Simcoe county with even more bike infrastructure, where families can bike from town to town more safely and without fear of fast-moving cars. Adding more red tape will only make this sort of future more difficult to achieve.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford claims that his intent is to encourage bike routes to be installed on side streets rather than main streets. However, as currently written, this act would also prevent the installation of bike routes along side streets, and would enable the Province to cancel any qualifying cycling project without justification.\nTo enable quiet street bicycle routes to be implemented without creating an unreasonable burden on Ontario Taxpayers, the act should be adjusted such that review is only required on roadways with more than 5000 cars per day.\nTo ensure that cycling projects are only cancelled if the Province has actually reviewed the information provided by municipalities, the act should be amended to provide a maximum response time following the receipt of documents from a municipality. If the Province fails to provide a response within that timeframe, the municipality may consider the project to be approved.\n"

There is no evidence that a reduction in lanes on certain streets has impact on the overall congestion of the road network. In fact - and I will use a quote from an article written in by Sheffi (1985) when traffic control measures were just being put in place in many jurisdictions - \"not every addition in capacity can bring about the anticipated benefits and in some cases may be worsened... ...traffic engineers have known for a long time that restrictions to travel choices and reductions in capacity may lead to better overall flow distribution patterns.\"\nBut, politics is politics I guess, forget about the experts!

It is effectively subsidized.\nMore highways and more lanes will not fix anything. We need robust public transit, walkable communities, and bicycle infrastructure.

Especially with the explosion of delivery drivers on bikes and the surging popularity of e-bikes and other electronically assisted personal transportation bike lanes are providing a space and environmentally efficient way to get around that quite likely can sustain more traffic than single-occupancy slow-moving cars.\n3.

        "comment": "Good afternoon,\nFor years, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario has stood for personal freedom and saving taxpayers money. Unfortunately, BIll 212's provisions for provincial review of new bike lanes flies in the face of this proud history.\nOver the past several decades, more and more people have been exercising their personal choice to cycle for their daily transportation needs. There are many reasons for this, but speaking personally, I cycle because it saves me money and is much more enjoyable than driving from place to place.\nI have been able to make this choice because the City of Toronto has been steadily expanding the bike lane network in the city. Such bike lanes are essential to allowing folks to make the choice to cycle, since riding in mixed traffic can be deadly.\nBlocking new bike lanes (and indeed, removing existing lanes) takes away my personal choice to cycle, something that a PC government should be embarrased to do. Furthermore, forcing me into a car for daily life will potentially cost me thousands of dollars yearly, undoing all of the steps the government has taken to make life more affordable.\nFor these reasons, I am calling for the bike lane provisions of Bill 212 to be removed, and for your government to allow municipalities to continue their bike lane expansions in the interests of saving taxpayer money and personal freedom.\nThank you,\n"
