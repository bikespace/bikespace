        "comment": "As a Toronto citizen who drives, bikes, walks, and takes public transit, I think the removal of bike lanes as a solution to Toronto traffic is dangerous nonsense. Having recently been to Berlin, I have experienced a city not dedicated to the car. What a wonderful experience. Every world-class European city has prioritized cycling and transit infrastructure as part of what makes the city livable and attracts tourists. Prioritizing cars is short sited and does not serve the city well. Toronto is not a zone to pass through from one suburb to the next. Toronto should be prioritizing the livability of the city for the people who live here. The Province should have no part in those decisions. What a profoundly disappointing backwards step. Welcome to America.\n"

For long years, I wished our city would have a safer system for cycling - something closer to what they have in Montreal, for example. Even parts of New York City feel safer than here.\nThe aggression and distraction of drivers in this city make it sometimes terrifying to ride. It made a huge difference to my commute when the bike lanes were put in along Bloor, Yonge, and University.\nWhen I was 26, my partner was killed on his bike by a truck at the corner of Dupont and Dundas. Since his death, a bike lane has been put in under the bridge.\nIt's clear that cycling is better for our health, for traffic (less cars on the road means less traffic), and for the environment.\nIt is shocking that the government would even be considering such a massive step backwards as taking out the bike lanes. And it is obscene that they would consider spending $48 million to do it.\nWe are in a climate crisis. And the streets are not safe. We need to fight to keep the progress that has been so hard-won, and keep the bike lanes we have.\n"

        "comment": "I fully support the Province getting involved and removing and controlling the installation of new bike lanes because Toronto Council has demonstrated they are not capable of logical decision making. They host community consult meetings but ignore the feedback they are given. They move forward from pressure from large advocacy groups despite residents investing considerable time presenting factual data to the contrary. They spent money installing bike lanes on Brimley Road, then spent even more money removing them after it was proven the residents facts were indeed factual.  This city council have convinced themselves of an alternative reality of what the future Toronto is going to look like. It is an unrealistic vision that they can't be moved away from. I normally wouldn't support the Province getting involved in city decision making, but on bike lanes, I am 100% behind what the Province is proposing and look forward to seeing improvements in the current traffic congestion I deal with daily.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m strongly opposed to removal of bike lanes. This seems to unnecessarily put people on bicycles at higher risk of injury. Protected lanes save lives. I would be more likely to become a driver contributing to gridlock if there were fewer bike lanes to help me reach my destinations by bike. Cyclists and drivers aren\u2019t two different groups who should have different rights to get where they are going. I am both a driver and cyclist, as are many many people. When I am driving I really hate having to worry about cyclists sharing my lane - it increases the stress of driving.\nI am also a parent of two children who ride bicycles. I want them to be able to bike to their destinations safely too. Cycling is good for their health, and for their independence. But they shouldn\u2019t have to share the road with drivers or be pushed onto very indirect routes on side streets that make it hard to actually get where you are going.\nPlease trust cities to make traffic planning.\n"

        "comment": "My wife and I are both cyclists and (less frequently) drivers in Toronto.  We use our bikes for work, for food shopping and for daily travel in Toronto.  We use bike paths when we can because they are generally much safer than having drivers passing literally within inches of one's arms and shoulders.\nWe are alarmed that the Province of Ontario, armed with faulty data, has concluded that bike paths are little used and cause gridlock for drivers, when in fact, those in Toronto are often very well used. We are alarmed that the Province of Ontario is willing to ignore the advice of world-class traffic engineers and city planners.\nIf you remove the bike lanes, the gridlock will not disappear.  However, there will be depletion of large sums of public money to remove the paths and their infrastructure, and an inevitable increase in deaths and serious injury to cyclists.  Removal will make Toronto a less civilized city, and a less interesting place to live, visit, and shop.  Removal will also cement Ontario's reputation as a hide-bound jurisdiction that is now 20 or 30 years behind the lead of more sophisticated cities and jurisdictions such as Copenhagen, Paris, Seville, New York, Portland, Montreal, Tokyo, Melbourne, and Seoul (all famed for their excellent biking infrastructure).\nToronto's gridlock stems from excessive suburban sprawl, insufficient public transit, rapid population growth, and aging infrastructure.  Removal of bike lanes in Toronto will not reverse these problems and will only set Toronto even further behind in solving them.\n"

        "comment": "The webpage states:  \"In alignment with these objectives, Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\"\nActually, you need to \"get PEOPLE where they need to go faster.\"  Cyclists are people too, and in removing bike-lanes without enhanced public transit, many of the displaced cyclists are simply going to get into their cars, adding to further gridlock and using up scarce car-parking spots.  Those who don't, and continue to ride in shared traffic lanes, will be forced to occupy those lanes, slowing things down for cars, creating uncertainty and stress for drivers, and risking life and limb, almost certainly leading to an increase in accidents and traffic-related deaths.\nIt has been demonstrated that the Province's reported numbers on bike lane usage are based on flawed logic, grossly underestimating actual use of bike lanes in the relevant areas - such as by recreational cyclists, and not capturing those whose commutes/trips involve bicycles as a part of the overall commute (cycling to the transit station, for example).\nFrom a Cost/Benefit perspective, the waste of money in removal of the existing lanes is utterly incomprehensible given the almost imperceptible increase it might ultimately create (after a period of even greater gridlock and lane closures during the removal work).\nThe parallels to the shortsighted expenditures of the Ford administration ripping out EV charging infrastructure after coming to government, and now scrambling to catch up on that same infrastructure, given the entirely foreseeable growth in EV usage, are obvious...  Even if you see the previous expenditures as \"bad,\" the government will only have to spend even more taxpayer money getting back to the status quo further down the road.  So don't throw good money after \"bad\"...\nIn the name of common sense - DON'T DO THIS!!!\n"

In order to counter climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the province needs to support personal modes of transportation ie. bicycles, mopeds, scooters et al., ensure municipalities have sufficient funding for sidewalk installations/maintenance so the public can walk safely and generously fund public transportation throughout the province.\n"

        "comment": "This is not a good idea. It refuses to appeal to data and research, or the urban planning of great livable cities, in order to garner votes from a base that refuses to shift habits. Congestion is bad in the city - because the city has catered to cars and there are just too many people driving. This will not change meaningfully until there are feasible alternatives. These bike lanes were a great step in the right direction, and people depend on them. They have been gaining popularity - it takes time for people to shift habits as they see a more feasible option than a car.\nThis is just a bad way to politicize an issue, and alienate voters. Especially voters who would've probably voted for Doug in the next provincials but now will reconsider.\nCycling is the best way around the city; it is sustainable and affordable. It gives people independence and let's them enjoy the city to its fullest. Cars plug things up and make cities less accessible. Doug, why not leave a better legacy, and keep working to make Toronto more liveable.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nBill 212 introduces needless red tape and bureaucracy and is misguided in its approach to its stated goals. Further, it increases the likelihood of accidents.\n1. The provincial government should not be adding additional barriers to city planning. This is a gross overstep of the provincial government's mandate. Adding a provincial review process will only hinder the planning process and creates additional red tape and bureaucracy. I thought this government wanted to reduce red tape.\n2. The provincial government should be considering the safety of all residents in their policies. Removing bike lanes not only puts cyclists at risk, but drivers as well. Bike lanes serve to make roads safer for cars (isn't it easier to drive without worrying about a cyclist passing in your blind spot?).\n3. Bike lanes support transit investment. Data shows that bike lanes are particularly effective when places next to transit hubs to allow commuters to access transit by bike. Ontario is investing a lot in transit projects and it only make sense to make these stations accessible by all means of transportation.\nI live in an urban neighbourhood where I cycle often. I am very safe, have lights, reflective strips, a bright coloured helmet. I signal my turns and my stops. Yet, car drivers often behave aggressively towards me. My bike will not win if an aggressive driver takes their behaviour too far. Bike lanes are extremely important in demonstrating that many types of transportation are welcome in cities.\nYou may be familiar with the concept of induced demand. This is when the availability of infrastructure correlates to how well it is used. Consider a city where most roads are narrow, bumpy, dirt lanes. There are a few paved sections here and there stretching a few blocks. Many people here ride horses. It is unlikely that we will see many cars drive in this city, because the infrastructure does not make it easy or safe to do so. Now please understand that this concept also applies to bike lanes. Saying that only a small fraction of commuters use bike lanes when these bike lanes only offer an incomplete network actually suggests that by improving and expanding bike infrastructure, it would be used more, thus removing traffic.\nAs we have seen with many cities around the world (Paris, as a recent example), reducing traffic and improving bike infrastructure go hand in hand. Ontario's cities are well behind other parts of the world and this bill would only set us back even more.\nIf the Premier is upset by congestion on Bloor Street on his way to the office, perhaps he should driving on the \"side streets\".\nThank you.\n"

Biking is a quick and eco-friendly way to get around Toronto and the removal of bike lanes will not prevent people from biking, it will just make it far more unsafe for cars and cyclists alike. This is such an overstep of the provincial government, and one which will backfire in loosing the votes of Torontonians at least.\n"
