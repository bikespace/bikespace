        "comment": "I own Sweet Pete\u2019s, a bicycle shop on Bloor Street near the corner of Brock Avenue. I am troubled by the proposal in Bill 212, The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, to remove bike lanes on major thoroughfares, including Bloor Street. Minister Sarkaria\u2019s statements that bike lanes are bad for small businesses are especially disappointing. Bike lanes help my business thrive.\nMy business benefits directly from the Bloor bike lane. We sell bicycles, related accessories and cycling apparel, and we offer maintenance and repair services. During COVID, ridership shot up. We had an unexpected boost in sales of bicycles for everyday family use, like cargo bikes and electric bikes. This coincided with the installation of the Bloor bike lanes. My customers kept asking if the lanes would be permanent. If they were going to leave the station wagon at home and move their families around the city by bicycle, they wanted to be sure they would be safe.\nThe people who bought bicycles during COVID have kept riding them, many year-round. It is not unusual for a mother to drop in with her children on the way home from school to pick up cycling mittens so they can stay warm in colder weather. I keep four mechanics employed all year. While business is slower in the winter, there are still a lot of people riding and a lot of bikes to fix. Bikes lanes have influenced this. With safe bike infrastructure, people are much more willing to ride in every season.\nWe have been at this location since 1997. Before the bike lanes were installed, we got less drop-in traffic. Drivers are just not as engaged with the neighborhood. They cannot see in shop windows as readily. They cannot stop as easily. A customer on a bicycle is much more likely to stop and shop on a whim. This will only happen if bike lanes are on major thoroughfares like Bloor Street.\nThe rise of cycling in the city is inevitable. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t stop this; it will only make it more dangerous. With more and more people, we need different and more efficient ways to get around. This should not be a divisive issue. Cyclists are like everyone else. My customers and I drink Tim Horton\u2019s coffee. We watch the Maple Leafs. We ride our bicycles to work. Just like everyone else, there should be a place for us on the road.\n"

        "comment": "If the government were actually serious about addressing traffic flow, it would encourage higher density residential development, invest heavily in public transit infrastructure and increase subsidies for public transit to internationally comparable levels, allow for congestion pricing and road tolls, and encourage development of a better cycling system to support people who leave their cars at home. Getting rid of bike lanes will divert funding from uses that might actually help, will do nothing about traffic congestion and will put cyclists literally at risk for their lives. Getting rid of bike lanes won\u2019t get cyclists off the road, it will just force them to mix with traffic. The result will be slower traffic and more dead cyclists. I ride my bike every day when weather permits, exclusively on streets with bike lanes. I will stop riding if bike lanes are removed. Side streets are not the answer. In Toronto, there are no viable side street routes, either east-west or north-south. And riding a bike on side streets is more dangerous than using a bike lane and still competes with car traffic. I also ride a tandem tricycle with my adult disabled son, a form of recreation for him that is possible only because of protected bike lanes. At the very least, force the government to get some actual facts. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse me with facts\u201d policy that offers the mirage of faster commuting and puts road users that don\u2019t drive cars at risk for their lives is simply not good enough.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is short sighted due to the comparisons that are being made between the driving and cycling infrastructure and their respective use levels, when both the amount of time and money invested in these two aspects of infrastructure vary wildly. The driving and road infrastructure has had billions of dollars worth of investment, over multiple decades, into developing a system and network of routes that residents find useful and effective in getting around; drivers did not immediately exist to fully utilize these roads and routes, and instead the presence of this convenient mode of transport led to more drivers using this infrastructure. The same must be allowed for cycling to develop.\nIn order to compare cycling and driving in an even remotely fair way, fully fledged cycling networks need to be built and developed, so that residents may actually be able to see the utility and convenience that a connected network that does not rely on the automobile may have. It is not surprising that many more people drive in these areas than bike; these areas have well developed roads, but no bike networks. I am confident that if road networks were only paved in certain areas, and made up of dirt and gravel in other areas, that far fewer people would find driving convenient.\nIt is disingenuous and ignorant to suggest that bike lanes are worsening traffic, when it is widely studied and shown that for the same number of people trying to get around, cyclists take up far less room and are more efficiently using the space available.\nPractically speaking, if any percentage of drivers are converted to cyclists due to the increased convenience and safety of a well built cycling network, this increase in cyclists directly corresponds to a reduction of drivers in cars, and an overall reduction in traffic volume. In this situation, the development and investment in cycling infrastructure actually serves to improve the experience of the drivers who have no other option than to drive, and reduce traffic. In no way is cycling infrastructure an attack on cars, if anything it will serve to make driving more convenient for those who have to drive. What is really does is provide a viable option for those reluctant drivers, who see driving as the only practical option due to infrastructure limitations.\nIt is also valuable to look at this from the perspective of access to safety. This dedicate cycling infrastructure serves to dramatically improve the safety of those who use it. It is ethically questionable to value the convenience of some drivers more than the safety of cyclists. Imagine a situation where one of the many safety features that drivers rely on simply wouldn't be there, such as a traffic light. In some ways, one could say that traffic lights create congestion and traffic because they stop the flow of traffic and lower overall average speed of drivers, and yet we would not consider the removal of traffic lights in intersections due to their invaluable contribution to safety. Imagine a situation where you no longer feel safe in your car due to the potential of a speeding vehicle not stopping in an intersection and potentially colliding with you; this is the reality of many cyclists every day when they cannot rely on safe infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Requiring municipalities to get approval for installing bike lanes that would remove a lane of traffic is going to slow down their already slow process and is an overstep of the provincial government to control municipal responsibilities. Bike lanes are good and will move many more people more efficiently than oversized and underfilled cars. Cars are big and cause much more traffic within downtown areas due to a variety of reasons, like illegal parking or irresponsible driving.\n"

My concerns relate to the provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure. As someone who uses cycling infrastructure, there are significant risks for me and my family when there are no bike lanes available. Additionally, many people currently do not bike because it is unsafe to do so, and this kind of policy will continue putting individuals at risk instead of encouraging very beneficial infrastructure.\nPlease see additional commentary attached.\n"

        "comment": "It's so painfully obvious how much more motivated Dougie is to quickly overhaul things that are minor inconveniences to him. LCBO more than 1km away? Beer available on every corner! Driving on a road built above a massive subway line? Better remove the bike lanes! God forbid our fearless leader, or his gaggle of corrupt little imps, get to Queens Park 20 minutes later on the 5 days a year they actually make in into the office.\nThis trend leaves me no choice but to WISH Doug and all his cabinet members have to endure the inconvenience of searching for a new General Practitioner, waiting for an elective surgery, daily commutes on the Eglinton bus, and sitting in an over crowded and underfunded classroom (cause, let's face it, they will probably need they help of an underpaid Educational Assistant in order to pass).\nMaybe then, if they had ANY of the actual problems facing Ontarians, they'd show a little more hustle pulling the province out of the nosedive adventure they've sent us all on.\nBut you know, at least the reservists can take the GO train. Happy Remembrance Day!\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike infrastructure will increase the risk of harm and death to people who choose to or must bike to get around. Given how much space is already given to supporting vehicular traffic, we need more bike infrastructure not less.\nNot everyone can afford to drive everywhere, and some people are not eligible to get drivers licenses. We should enable people who want or need to utilize bikes as a transportation option, not subject them to additional hazards.\n"

        "comment": "Please remove these bike lanes as quickly as possible.  What idiot thought that putting bike lanes on a major street was a good idea? Better yet let's put them where the subway runs so if it goes down, the buses are also stuck in the traffic, complete stupidity.  The traffic along bloor has become horrendous.  These bike lanes make no sense, get rid of them and increase the speed limit back to 60.  Traffic will be much better.  Also please look into removing the no turning on red at six points which is bloor, Dundas and Kipling.  This no turning on red makes no sense.  You're waiting on the light and there is no traffic but because of those stupid signs you need to wait.  Again please rip them up as soon as possible, they are useless and create more traffic.  Also get rid on Cafe T.O., causes more traffic in the summer.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is short-sighted in its thinking and backwards in its philosophy.  Bike lanes were conceived of and installed in order to provide alternatives for commuters so that they could SAFELY choose an alternative to driving.  I am one of those commuters.  After the completion of a network of bike lanes between the area where I live (Leslieville) and my workplace (College and Bathurst) I bought a new bike and began cycling to work on a daily basis.  Using the bike lanes on Dundas St., Gerrard St. and College st. I am able to get to work in a consistent amount of time and I finally feel safe doing so, after years of being pinched by cars on those same roads.\nDrivers, however well intentioned, have a lot to focus on and many have difficulty remembering to check their blind spot or to look for cyclists when they are changing lanes or turning.  When you combine that risk with the risks posed by sewer grates that often force cyclists to mover further away from the curb the result is that there are many people, like myself, who won't risk being a cycling commuter.  I am a father with two young children and I won't put my life at risk for the sake of getting some exercise or helping the environment.  With the updated cycling lanes on many downtown streets I have been able to balance my need for a safe commute with my desire to help the environment and my cardiovascular health by cycling to work.\nIn the past three years I have witnessed a sharp increase in the number of people cycling to work on the same lanes that I am using.  I regularly wait at stop lights behind a row of 6-10 other cyclists.  I am dismayed by the proposal by the Ontario government to rip out existing bike lanes and to make it more difficult for newly proposed bike lanes to go forward.  This feels like the same kind of thinking that stalled the development of public transit for decades and resulted in the painful re-development of existing commercial areas (such as for the Eglinton line) that we have recently witnessed to try to make up for lost time.  People need alternatives to driving that allow them to meet their commuting needs.  As more and more people adopt cycling or public transit as a viable alternative the demand for car lanes will naturally balance itself out.  Toronto is a world class city and it needs to look forward towards a greener and more progressive future, not backwards towards a narrow-minded perspective that cars are the only solution.  Invest in the alternatives, and keep our bike lane networks intact.\n"

        "comment": "I am one of many young Torontonians who commute to work and school by bike. I have recently finished a graduate degree in engineering and I have been determined to remain in Toronto, despite the higher pay in engineering in the United States. I want to stay in Toronto both so that I can support the economy here and because I love living in Toronto, where I can commute safely while also getting my daily exercise. I use the Yonge, Bloor, and University bike lanes on my commute. Removing the bike lanes that allow me to get to work would increase my risk and worsen my commute every single day. If I am driving or taking the subway to work, I would also no longer have an easy way to stop at the local businesses that I currently pass by daily. I cannot overstate how much the changes proposed in this bill would negatively impact me every day. Quite frankly, if I am no longer able to get to work safely, I will start to look at leaving the country to work for American engineering firms---because at least California cities have safe bike lanes. Removing bike lanes by force would be a mistake, and it is clear to everyone I know that the provincial government is motivated to push this bill by political reasons rather than by the good of the province. Please, for the sake of everyone who uses Toronto bike lanes to commute, get some exercise, or sightsee, don't remove our bike lanes.\n"
