        "comment": "I have read the proposal and understand the stated objectives. However, there is a disconnect between the two that significantly weakens the province's argument and raises questions about the efficacy of this proposal.\nBike lanes enable safe and efficient local travel by providing dedicated lanes to move more people through local roads.  Taking them away will put cyclists into car lanes, increasing the potential for accidents (and deaths) which will burden the healthcare system, and increase gridlock as bikes compete with cars on the road in an inefficient way.\nBike lanes on city roads do not add to nor impact highway gridlock in anyway, which is mentioned as a serious concern behind this proposal. Cars and trucks traveling across or in/out of the city do. I implore the province to look at the numerous studies that evaluate different options to address non-local traffic impacts.\nFurthermore, this proposal runs counter to what I understand the province's goals are to reduce red tape . This is a significant interference with municipalities' ability to determine local needs and solutions, based on their communities' input.\nPlease reconsider and kill this proposal.\n"

They have been proven to reduce congestion in the long run, by encouraging people to get out of cars and get onto space and energy efficient vehicles - bikes! By providing cyclists with safe ways of moving through the city, motor vehicle congestion will be alleviated. Ripping out existing bike lanes is a retrogressive step that will cost taxpayers needlessly and result in the death and injury of cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

Biking is essential to both the health of individuals in your community (mental health and physical health) as well as health of the environment. Allowing bike lanes make transport, physical activity, and getting outside safer and more accessible for everyone, including \"kids these days\". Look to Europe and how they support bike lanes and the efficiency in their transport systems, not to the past in North American where issues have been chronically bad and begun to improve with implementation of alternative transport options including biking.\nPlease reconsider as this will cause greatly negative consequences for the community as a whole for a very long time.\n"

They encourage an alternate form of transportation and provide a safe way for cyclist to get around. As Toronto sees many non-resident drivers within it's boundaries, they often don't know to look for or navigate around cyclists. Hence why many cyclist find it can be dangerous to ride their bikes. As a cyclist myself, I have experienced this fear and I always feel better when there is a dedicated bike lane available. I typically map my route out based on these.

These bike lanes are essential for my daily commute, allowing me and many others to safely and efficiently reach public transit hubs. Removing them would only increase car dependency, worsening gridlock and emissions.\nThis plan would not only impact residents but also place a financial burden on the City of Toronto, which would need to reallocate funds to dismantle already-effective infrastructure. Additionally, the loss of these lanes would make roads more dangerous for cyclists, potentially leading to more accidents and higher healthcare costs.\nThe bike lanes represent a commitment to a more sustainable, accessible Toronto.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Progressive Conservative government's proposed Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane) to close bike lanes in our community. Moreover, it aims to facilitate the closure of existing bike lanes going forward with exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act in an effort to \"get drivers where they need to go faster\" (Ministry of Transportation, 2024). As a concerned citizen, physician, and an advocate for preventative health and sustainable transportation, I believe that removing these essential infrastructure components would significantly undermine our progress toward safer and healthier cities.\nIt is frighteningly common for me to care for patients after they have sustained injuries in a collision while biking. \"Cyclist struck by car\", \"bike vs bus\": who do you think wins? These injuries can be life threatening- multi organ system trauma injuries, broken bones requiring surgical repair, and hospitalization with subsequent rehabilitation- or result in the walking wounded, who may still be left with long lasting impacts from their injuries. This could look like a disruption of the intricate ligament scaffold that allows our hands to function after getting hit by a car door blindly opening or a concussion, which can result in persistent symptoms in about 15% of patients (Leddy et al. 2016; Theadom et al. 2016).\nKnowing this, I still bike to work at hospitals across the city. I wear my helmet and bright colors, use lights on my bike, and signal to those around me.\nIn a city where the cost of living (never mind parking) is expensive, where it can take more time to drive than to cycle or take public transit, and in a world struggling environmentally, this remains the best option. I opt for roads with bike lanes where possible because if I ride on a road without a bike lane, invariably I will have cars yelling at me to ride on the side walk (illegal), or they will nearly take me along with them as they pass me too closely. When there is no bike lane, I ride in fear, thinking, at least if I get hit, I am on my way to a hospital.\nI ask you to consider the following relevant information:\n\t1. Injury prevention is essential in our strained health care system- In 2023, Toronto Police Service reports 33 collisions resulting in major injuries and 1 fatal collision (TPS). Though this is already 34 too many, it is likely an underrepresentation based off the work by Macpherson and colleagues (2024), who noted police reporting of collisions captured only 8% of all cycling injuries when comparing data from 2016 to 2021 in administrative health services databases (Macpherson et al., 2024). In 2021, there were an estimated 5344 emergency department visits and 431 hospitalizations related to cyclist injuries. Bike lanes in Germany have been associated with less severe cyclist injuries, and reduced use of sidewalks for cycling which can prevent pedestrian-cyclist injuries (FLOW Project, 2016). In an already strained system, the provincial and municipal governments must do everything to prevent injuries.\n\t2. Bike lanes can reduce traffic related congestion- When we examine the bike lanes installed in 2020 on University Avenue, the city of Toronto has noted \"data analysis during a 12-month evaluation period following the street configuration changes shows limited to no impacts on motor vehicle travel times\" (Jones 2024). Moreover, with this lane including Hospital Row, \"Emergency services have not raised any issues about traffic.\" Evaluation of bike lane systems across several European studies suggested no significant increase in travel times, with the Netherlands even showing a reduction in travel times for cars and bikes (FLOW Project, 2016).\n\t3. Adding more traffic lanes contributes to traffic.- As more traffic lanes are added, an induced demand develops, where people who may have not chosen to drive initially opt to drive, contributing to traffic (Department of Transport, 2018).\n\t4. Our government needs to create opportunities for safe physical activity- In a country where only 18% of adults and <12% children meet the recommended physical activity targets, our province needs to create opportunities for safe physical activity (Statistic Canada, 2017). Insufficient physical activity is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death (World Health Organization, 2018). Cycle commuting has been associated with  lower risk of cardiovascular disease and hospitalizations, cancer related death and hospitalizations, lower mental health related disease burden and overall lower all cause mortality (Friel et al. 2024).These health benefits translate into lower healthcare costs for our communities, which is particularly relevant given our overwhelmed  healthcare system.\n\t5. Our government needs to factor environmental impacts into decisions-  I am also deeply concerned about the power given to the provincial government to remove lanes, \" including an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act.\" At a time where our country is already struggling with climate change, forgoing environmental assessments is unacceptable. $564 million could be saved annually in reduced greenhouse gas emissions if just 1% of people living in Canada switched from private car use to active transportation (CFLRI & CPRA, 2023).\n\t6. Bike lanes can benefit our local economy- Locally, after bike lanes were installed on Bloor, some areas experienced a 30% increase in sales for nearby shops and cafes, as cyclists tend to stop more frequently and spend money in their local communities (Smith Lea et al., 2017).\nIn light of these compelling statistics and the numerous benefits that bike lanes provide\u2014enhanced safety, improved public health, and economic growth\u2014I urge you to reconsider the proposed legislation. We should be investing in and expanding cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\nOur commitment to sustainable transportation and the health of our communities should be at the forefront of our decision-making processes. I encourage you to stand with your constituents in support of keeping our bike lanes open and accessible.\nThank you for your attention to this crucial matter. I look forward to your response and to seeing action towards a safer and healthier community. References can be found as an attached file.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212's proposal to remove bike lanes in the hope of easing traffic. Removing bike lanes is a short-sighted solution that ignores the broader benefits of a bike-friendly infrastructure. If our cities made biking safer and more accessible, we would likely see more people choose biking over driving, effectively reducing traffic rather than adding to it.\nBike lanes also provide an essential alternative for individuals who either cannot or prefer not to rely on cars, supporting both their health and financial well-being. Furthermore, encouraging biking and walking aligns with sustainable practices, promoting lower emissions and fostering healthier urban living environments.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, Ontario should prioritize walkability and expand bike-friendly options, much like leading European cities such as Amsterdam. Building a more accessible, eco-friendly transportation network isn\u2019t just beneficial for reducing traffic\u2014it\u2019s a critical step in creating a resilient, people-focused urban future.\n"

To suggest the removal of the targeted bike lanes would be an unnecessary step backwards and would no doubt pose serious safety risk for bike users who rely on the existing bike network. I myself rely on the Bloor street bike network to get around the city and to access and support small businesses along the network - for which I'm sure it would have a negative impact. I believe this should be stopped and that the province shouexplore other options, such as diverting funds to support (and actually complete) the development of public transit infrastructure; which would get people out of cars and actually reduce congestion. This bill makes no sense- especially given the absence of concrete and relevant empirical data for which to support this proposed legislation. I hope the provincial government reconsiders.\n"

        "comment": "I wish to express my extreme opposition to the legislation to restrict municipalities' ability to implement bike lanes as they see fit, and even moreso the addendum to remove existing lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge. I am a near daily user of the Bloor bike lanes and they are the only thing that make me feel safe enough to do so. I ask, why is my time and safety less important than someone in a car?\nRipping out brand new bike lanes is not only a terrible decision for road safety, but a complete waste of money. Taxpayer money paid for them to be installed, and taxpayer money will be used to remove them. Taxpayer money that should be going to our severely underfunded health care system, or finishing the Eglinton LRT.\nThis legislation is clearly not based in fact, as study after study has shown that bike lanes are beneficial to reducing car traffic and attract more cyclists. The only way to reduce traffic is to provide VIABLE ALTERNATIVES to driving. The statistics being thrown around by the transportation minister are woefully out of date. The number of 1.2% is from 2011, 13 years ago, when most cycling infrastructure did not exist in Toronto. It is also for the entire CMA, encompassing Burlington to Ajax. Further, this only looks at commuting cyclists. Not all travel is commuting, and vulnerable road users should have a safe means of moving around regardless of the time of day. The explosion in Toronto Bike Share should be an indication of the desire of residents to bike.\nThe common \"solution\" of putting bike lanes on \"side streets\" is not a viable alternative for the same reason it is not for driving. These corridors are fragmented, requiring out-of-direction travel. The places we need to go are typically on arterial roads, so no matter what, a cyclist will end up off the side streets for at least part of their journey.\nWe are in a climate crisis. We should be doing everything in our power to encourage people to travel by modes other than car. Increase GO service, finish building rapid transit lines, build more bike lanes. Removing and restricting bike lanes contradicts some of the simplest means of averting further climate disasters.\nThis is an extreme overstep by the province and clearly targeted at Toronto, although it will negatively impact all municipalities hoping to shift people to green modes of transportation. Toronto has its own municipally elected officials that work with city staff to determine what is best for the city. The whims of the premier and his friends should not dictate our well thought out city policies.\n"

        "comment": "While the proposal to remove sections of the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto may be framed as a solution to reduce traffic congestion, it fails to address the broader issues of urban mobility and sustainability. The decision to prioritize lanes for motor vehicles over safe cycling infrastructure is a step backward in the fight for cleaner, greener, and more livable cities.\nFirst, reducing bike lanes in favor of additional vehicle lanes runs counter to the growing global consensus on the importance of expanding cycling infrastructure as part of a strategy to reduce traffic congestion, improve public health, and address climate change. Ontario\u2019s urban areas, particularly Toronto, face significant air quality issues and gridlock. Encouraging more people to shift from private cars to alternative forms of transportation\u2014like cycling\u2014is a proven method for reducing carbon emissions and alleviating congestion. Taking away bike lanes undermines efforts to create a sustainable, future-focused transportation system.\nSecond, the province\u2019s approach to requiring municipal approval for bike lanes and establishing a review process for existing lanes creates unnecessary barriers to the implementation and continuation of bike infrastructure. The added layer of provincial oversight may delay or even block critical investments in safe cycling spaces, making it harder for cities to meet the needs of their growing populations. With more people using active transportation, removing bike lanes only serves to reduce options and access to safer, healthier travel choices.\nThird, the proposed criteria for assessing bike lanes, including environmental implications, appears vague and could lead to subjective decision-making. This could allow for political motivations to influence infrastructure choices, rather than prioritizing data-driven, evidence-based policies that focus on public health, safety, and long-term urban planning. A more robust and transparent process would be necessary to ensure that any changes to cycling infrastructure are made with a clear focus on enhancing mobility and improving public life, rather than bowing to pressures from drivers who may feel inconvenienced by alternative transportation options.\nFinally, the proposed exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for these changes raises significant concerns. The Environmental Assessment process is a crucial tool in ensuring that infrastructure changes are made with consideration for long-term environmental, social, and economic impacts. Removing this safeguard creates an alarming precedent, where decisions about public space and urban mobility could be made without proper public consultation or accountability.\nIn conclusion, while traffic congestion and gridlock are important issues to address, removing bike lanes in favor of more lanes for motor vehicles is not the answer. Ontario should be investing in making cycling safer, more accessible, and more attractive to people of all ages and abilities\u2014not rolling back the progress that has been made in creating a sustainable, multi-modal transportation network.\nThe government should prioritize expanding and improving cycling infrastructure to help build a more resilient, livable, and environmentally conscious city for all residents.\n"
