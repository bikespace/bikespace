This is also an overstep to municipal governance and I am completely opposed.\n"

        "comment": "Let's be honest, the proposal to gatekeep municipalities from installing new bikelanes -- and particularly to remove bikelanes from Bloor W, Yonge, and University in Toronto -- isn't based on data or evidence. This is populist electioneering, pure and simple, and reeks of desperation.\nEven if those 3 bikelanes get removed and multiple others are prevented from being installed or designed, there will still be congestion. So long as you continue to having growing numbers of personal motor vehicles on the roads congestion will continue to grow.\nThe government can build it's 413 highways (the aspects of which, coincidentally, the bike lane issue in Bill 212 helps to distract from), and do its infeasibility studies for the tunnel under the 401. But the simple truth is that more cars will lead to more congestion so long as the sinks and sources are still there and there aren't alternatives to private automobiles: mass transit; enablers of active transport; walkable neighbourhoods.\nBuy back the 407 if necessary, but stay in your lane and stop interjecting into municipal level detail. If you really have that urge, push through the recommendations for your own Housing Affordability Task Force.\n"

Additionally, studies have shown that bike lanes help businesses on streets that have them.\nBike lanes help everyone and hurt no one.\n"

To require provincial approval for installing new bike lanes and the province removing existing bike lanes is an act of adding red tape to municipal affairs and damaging municipal assets of bike lanes and complete streets that are built in response to calls by local communities and funded by taxpayers in the community.\nMany studies have shown bike lanes do not increase gridlock and I urge the Ontario government to learn more about the latest studies and facts on gridlock solutions and make a new proposal.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is regressive - the opposite direction that world class cities are moving toward, where bike lanes are growing exponentially. I live in North Toronto and am primarily a driver and transit rider, but fully support the existence and expansion of bike lanes on arterial roads. Traffic on parallel routes such as Mount Pleasant and Bayview is virtually unaffected and driving remains the fastest mode when traveling in the neighbourhood - just avoid Yonge for commuting purposes. The bike lanes promote safety and when I do ride a bike, I plan my trip around Toronto's terrific bike lane infrastructure.\nRemoving these bike lanes will not solve congestion on the 401, DVP or Gardiner. Nor will it increase road capacity given the curb lanes would otherwise be occupied by parked cars. But bike lanes do help local residents move around safely and quickly.\nPlease don't take us backwards by removing these bike lanes or blocking others. Doing so would be bad planning, a waste of money, and will not solve traffic. The Province needs to take a lesson on the concept of induced demand and focus on other priorities.\n"

We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

Many cyclists would drive without safe bike lanes, which would actually increase traffic and car congestion. Bike lanes are safer for cyclists, especially children. Protected bike lanes save Iives. In addition, it's been shown that local business benefit from bike lanes, which is why the Annex BIA supports the Bloor bike lanes. Without these bike lanes, cyclists will die unnecessarily and the responsibility for those deaths will fall on the politicians that chose to remove them or prevent the installation of new ones. Any attempt to remove bike lanes will be met with strong civil disobedience and will tarnish the reputation of a Ontario as a good place to do business.\n"

        "comment": "Before writing legislature to remove infrastructure that saves lives, the provincial government should speak to experts in city planning and focus on more than simply the number of cars moving on a road per hour. The evaluation of a bicycle lane MUST include the number of deaths reduced. Many studies have demonstrated that the addition of bicycle lanes do not cause congestion and that their removal does not solve congestion anyway. In fact, it can be argued that the presence of on-street parking uses more road space, benefits fewer citizens, and causes more congestion than bicycle lanes ever do, so it would be hypocritical to leave those in place while removing bicycle lanes. You are welcome to review the benefits of bike lanes, but do not remove anything before you've studied them appropriately.\nHaving said that, Ontarios voted in the current provincial government so that it could address provincial issues such as health care. Please use that mandate to address those provincial issues instead of focusing on issues that are under the purview of municipalities. My vote for municipal politicians was based on their strengths in addressing municipal issues, and my vote for provincial MPs is because of their views on provincial issues. Introducing laws that interfere with municipal affairs essentially dilutes the value of my democratic vote.\nIf you insist on removing municipal infrastructure, the provincial government should first install the alternative option, then repay the municipality for the costs it incurred in building the original infrastructure, and finally pay for its removal, in that order.\n"

In my view, bending over backwards to allow each person to have over a ton of metal to drive to the downtown and park is backward thinking.\nWorld class cities all come to the understanding that cars just take up too much space.

Just because you - the provincial government - have the right to do something doesn't mean you should.\nWe should be making the city safer for cyclists, not more dangerous by removing bike lanes.  It is already perilous to cycle on Toronto's roads. And, from the environmentalist perspective, we should be trying to get gasoline powered cars off the roads, not making it easier.\nIf you want to reduce congestion, why not put a price on driving into Toronto - like London or Singapore? answer: because although this would be a just move (user pays), Premier Ford's core constituencies would scream bloody murder.\nI also feel this is a blatant electioneering move by Premier Ford to suck up to his 905 suburban constituency. I'm gonna spend my $200 election gift in a donation to Environmental Defence to help fight these backwards, pro-car policies.\nBy the way can we please have bike lanes in the tunnel under the 401?\n"
