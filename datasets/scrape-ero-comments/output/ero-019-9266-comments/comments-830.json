        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, specifically the provisions related to the Highway 413 Act, 2024, and the proposed restrictions on municipal authority to implement bike lanes. As a legal professional, I find this legislation deeply troubling on several grounds, including its disregard for environmental protections, public health, and local governance.\n**Environmental and Climate Impacts**\nThe Highway 413 Act exempts the project from the Environmental Assessment Act, allowing construction to proceed without the rigorous scrutiny typically required for developments of this magnitude. This exemption sets a dangerous precedent and directly contravenes Ontario\u2019s obligations under the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR), which guarantees residents the right to a healthful environment. The Greenbelt lands affected by Highway 413 serve as vital carbon sinks, flood control systems, and habitats for endangered species. Paving over these lands will result in irreversible environmental damage.\nMoreover, transportation is Ontario\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and Highway 413 will exacerbate this by increasing car dependency and sprawl. Studies on induced demand demonstrate that new highways do not alleviate congestion but instead lead to greater traffic volumes and emissions.\n**Public Health Risks**\nThe removal of bike lanes under Bill 212 will negatively impact public health. Active transportation infrastructure reduces vehicle traffic, improves air quality, and encourages physical activity, which helps prevent chronic diseases. According to the Ontario Medical Association, air pollution contributes to thousands of premature deaths annually in the province. By prioritising car traffic, Bill 212 undermines these health benefits and exposes more Ontarians to pollution-related illnesses.\n**Misallocation of Public Funds**\nHighway 413 represents a misuse of public funds, with a projected cost exceeding $8 billion. These resources could be better invested in public transit and active transportation, which provide higher economic returns. For example, the American Public Transportation Association found that every dollar spent on public transit generates over four dollars in economic benefits. Given Ontario\u2019s urgent needs in healthcare, education, and housing, prioritizing Highway 413 is fiscally irresponsible.\n**Undermining Local Governance**\nBill 212\u2019s requirement for provincial approval of municipal bike lanes constitutes an overreach of provincial authority under the Municipal Act. Local governments, through extensive public consultation and planning, are best positioned to address their unique transportation needs. By centralizing this decision-making, the province undermines municipal autonomy and disrupts local democratic processes.\n**Economic and Social Equity**\nBike lanes are not only essential for reducing congestion but also for promoting economic and social equity. Research shows that businesses along bike corridors see increased foot and cycling traffic, resulting in higher sales. Additionally, cycling provides an affordable transportation option for individuals who cannot afford the high costs of vehicle ownership. Removing this infrastructure disproportionately harms low-income residents, limiting their mobility and economic opportunities.\n**Legal and Policy Recommendations**\nBill 212 fails to meet Ontario\u2019s commitments to sustainable development and climate action as outlined in the Ministry of Transportation\u2019s Statement of Environmental Values (SEV). I urge the government to reconsider this bill and focus on evidence-based solutions:\n1. Withdraw the Highway 413 Act and reinstate full environmental assessment requirements.\n2. Invest in public transit and cycling infrastructure to reduce congestion and emissions.\n3. Respect municipal autonomy in transportation planning, aligning with the principles of the Municipal Act.\n4. Enhance environmental protections to safeguard Ontario\u2019s natural heritage and uphold the EBR\u2019s guarantees.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 is a regressive piece of legislation that will harm Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and public health. I urge the government to abandon this bill and pursue sustainable, equitable transportation policies that benefit all Ontarians.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\nTracy\n"

I would bike more if there was more infrastructure surrounding biking, and I would feel much safer having access to bike lanes.\nDowntown Toronto is very dense; by keeping the existing bike lanes and introducing new ones, it will encourage people to bike more, thus reducing gridlock. I believe Cities should have full authority making any decisions regarding bike lanes, as they have the data to make educated decisions.\nStripping away existing bike lanes on Yonge, bikers will instead bike on the road, posing greater danger to the public (for both bikers and drivers). The money and time proposed to be spent on removing the existing bike lanes should be used to support additional bike lanes and other aspects of public transportation.\nBy stripping away existing bike lanes and adding more procedures to approve new bike lanes, it will discourage the public from biking, thus increasing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not interfere with the jurisdiction of municipalities to specify their infrastructure. They know best what is locally desired and appropriate. This includes the desire of the province to remove bike lanes and increase motor vehicle capacity.\nMost cities do not have the congestion problem that Toronto has. Furthermore, bike infrastructure reduces congestion. It also is proven to make streets safer for all users, for all modalities.\nAs for expressways, the 413 is another boondoggle project. There are clear and cheaper ways to improve travel.\nFirstly, Ontario needs high speed rail, on electrified and autonomous lines. This could reduce the traffic on major highways (401, 400, 404, 403) by 10-30% while making the trip 3 to 6x faster.\nThe second way to reduce congestion on major Toronto sections is to use tolls, especially at peak usage times. Not only would this help pay for the huge deficits this infrastructure causes, it would help make other modes more competitive. It is simple economics of supply and demand elasticity.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident, been living here almost 20 years, and I am writing in opposition to this proposal.\nIf the Province wants to reduce gridlock - encourage more people to choose biking or public transit, especially for short inner-city trips.\nRemoving bike lanes will negatively impact health, quality of life, and, notably, the economy.\nTop concerns with removing bike lanes and stalling new bike lanes:\n1. Gridlock - Encouraging more cars will increase traffic and lead to worse gridlock. Highways are a perfect examples of this. There are no bike lines on Lakeshore, Gardiner or 401, yet traffic moves extremely slowly during peak times. On the contrary, diversifying model of travel by having bike lanes actually balances traffic, thus reducing gridlock. Like good monetary strategies, good traffic management also requires diversifying.\n2. Safety - Cars switching lanes on narrow or local roads (like Bloor St. and Yonge St.) can lead to collisions, fatalities, and gridlock. On the contrary, dedicated properly installed bike lanes reduce chances of car collisions, thus reducing gridlock for those travelling by car.\n3. Housing Affordability - More housing options and taming the housing affordability crisis will require building homes that have safe access to bike lanes - to move people to stores, schools, and work without adding cars and thus adding congestion.\n4. Air Quality and Public Health - More cars means more congestion, more idling engines, and poorer air quality for Ontarians, leading to negative health impacts.\n5. Economic Consequences for Businesses - Bike trips increase customers to businesses - especially along Bloor St. and Yonge St. Having bike lanes on prominent inner-city streets supports retail, restaurants, and services, providing frequent, repeat customers. Cars cannot as quickly support businesses, or, in doing so, would block traffic lanes, causing gridlock and congestion.\n6. Loss of Competitiveness as a Global City (for Toronto, therefore impacting Ontario too) - Successful safe bike lanes gain attention on the world stage, and bring in tourism and money. Making it harder for residents and visitors to use active transportation to travel within the city will make Toronto less desirable to visit, spend money, and live. This will negatively impact Toronto's and Ontario's economy.\nRegarding Bloor St., Yonge St. and University Ave. - these are near high frequency major transit (TTC subway lines). Cars should not use these local roads. Cars should use roads that go around cities, not through them.\nIn summary, the legislation as proposed legislation will do the opposite of what it claims to promote. Less diversion of car traffic [to bike lanes] will actually create more gridlock. Moreover, the analysis of where to install bike lanes, to support safe, healthy, and mobile cities, is most appropriately dealt with at the local level.\nPlease roll back this proposed change and leave bike lane decision-making to municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "November 20, 2024\nBILL #212: MCN! submission to Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO #019-9266)\nNOTE: This document with all *hyperlinks* is ATTACHED (3p PDF)\nAlso published on our website at: https://misscyclingnow.ca/bike_lanes/#bill_212_ERO\nText of the submission by Mississauga Cycling Now! to the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO #019-9266) concerning Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nWHO ARE WE?  We are former members of the Mississauga Cycling Advisory Committee (MCAC) for the 2015-2019 term, since then collaborating on advocacy as Mississauga Cycling Now!  Our objective is to create the digital infrastructure necessary to support and promote citizen cycling advocacy and provide a reference/archive for cycling issues in Mississauga.  We are presently providing input to the 2024 Mississauga Cycling Master Plan Update.\nWe submit the following comments regarding Bill 212:\nINTRODUCTION:  Mississauga, Ontario's third-largest city, is a city of significant barriers, the legacy of being planned and designed around cars.  Segmented by seven (7) major highways plus wide and fast arterials and railway lines, as well as the Credit River and myriad creeks and streams, Active Transportation retrofits are needed to connect the City's historic communities and meet the City's ambitious targets for 50% sustainable mode share for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit-users by 2041.  Meanwhile, whole neighbourhoods are isolated without car use.\n1. MAIN ROADS:  Mississauga is largely suburban in design with winding streets and disjointed connections.  Only the main roads, such as Bloor Street which is used as an example in this document, provide direct north-south or east-west connections.  There are no parallel \"secondary roads\" or side streets that could be meaningfully considered for designated bike routes.  Like drivers, people on bikes look for the direct route and when these are available, can reduce the ever increasing number of cars on the roads.  Mississauga's Changing Lanes project is reclassifying the streets, roads and major arteries in the City, to ensure our streets are safe and more convenient for all users.\n2. INTEGRATED ROAD PROJECTS:  Increasingly in Mississauga, street design changes in accordance with the City's Vision Zero program are planned when roads come up for repair, thereby saving tax dollars.  These projects include a more extensive public consultation process as seen with the Bloor Street Redesign project.  The intention is to improve Road Safety for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and transit riders; one result is lower traffic speeds.  Speeding is a huge source of concern in Mississauga, especially on the main roads where safe cycling infrastructure is most needed.  By segregating people on bikes travelling on main roads with safe bike lanes, traffic moves more smoothly.  Restricting or removing cycling infrastructure on main (high speed) roads only serves to endanger people on bikes and disrupt traffic flow.\n3. BIKES MEAN BUSINESS:  It's a proven fact, as the Bloor Annex BIA in Etobicoke advocated at the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy (Hearing re Bill 212) on November 18, 2024: \"after bike lanes were put in, spending went up and road conflicts went down.\"  This fact has been proven in countless studies around the world.  The Centre for Active Transportation (TCAT) has recently published Bike Lanes Save Lives, Boost Business, and Can Relieve Congestion (November 4, 2024). Here\u2019s the Evidence (November 4, 2024).\n4. CYCLING TOURISM:  It's an economic driver, and Visit Mississauga ties in with cycling events when possible (e.g. Tour de Carassauga 2024).  Because of the disconnected nature of cycling infrastructure in Mississauga presently, opportunities are limited, but completion of main routes will enable safe access to feature destinations from anywhere in the City.\n5. CLIMATE CHANGE:  Mississauga's Climate Change Action Plan has ambitious goals to reduce emissions: Cut carbon/GHG emissions 40% by 2030; 80% by 2050.  Achievement of these goals will require completion of a logical cycling network to enable a safe and efficient alternative to car travel and promote a greater, greener modal split.  In fact, the City has just announced it is setting more ambitious targets aligned with the international goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n6. HEALTHY CITY STRATEGY:  Diabetes is virtually an epidemic in Mississauga and our City has developed a Healthy City Strategy per the ~Cities for Better Health (CBH) Program~ which includes \"Implementing the Cycling Master Plan ... building new multi-use trails and protected cycling infrastructure.\"  But this infrastructure must also be where people need or want to ride, and in our City that often means the main roads in order to traverse barriers.\n7. MISSISSAUGA CYCLING MASTER PLAN (CMP):  Public engagement was to begin this Fall on the 2024 CMP update, but is now delayed to the new year due to the uncertainty of what will be allowed by the province.  Without full control over the location and format of cycling infrastructure using local municipal knowledge, the CMP Update process will be stymied and development of optimal active transportation solutions to mitigate traffic congestion will be delayed.\n8. E-SCOOTER PILOT PROJECT:  Mississauga is conducting a shared e-scooters pilot project per Ontario\u2019s e-scooter pilot program running until November 27, 2029.  The expectation is that cycling infrastructure will expand and support the safe use of micro-mobility devices anywhere in the City.  Eliminating or restricting bike lanes on main roads can only result in collisions as destination-oriented micro-mobility usage grows.\n9. POPULATION GROWTH:  There will never be enough traffic lanes to accommodate cars for all the people coming.  Ontario's *own* demographic projections in the document Ontario's Long-term Report on the Economy 2024-46 (146p PDF) highlight a continued rapid rise in population and concentration of this growth in urban areas, where the brunt of Bill 212 will be most harmful in limiting mobility options and actually compounding congestion.  See Chapter 1 (p5): Demographic Trends and Projections.\n10. DEVELOPMENT AND DENSITY:  Like many cities, Mississauga has lowered its parking standards (17p PDF; Appendix 1: zoning amendments at Item 5.5 on PDC Agenda) to both reduce the cost of a new condominium for first time buyers and optimize the densification of Major Transit Station Areas (MTSAs) as required by the province, per the new Provincial Planning Statement, 2024.  Less parking near transit stations makes sense.  But without a car, new condo owners face a mobility challenge if cycling infrastructure is not installed to their door.  On Bloor Street in Mississauga, for instance, several new condo buildings are planned even as the Bloor Street Redesign project is now \"paused\" due to the uncertainty about Bill 212.\n11. CITY BUILDING:  Urban mobility is a vital component of planning and developing liveable sustainable cities.  Cycling is integral to solving Mississauga's conjoined issues of rapid densification and growing traffic congestion due to too many cars, especially on main roads.  Successful cities around the world (2024 Top 10 most bicycle-friendly cities includes Montreal, PQ) promote cycling to benefit not only mobility but also road safety, social equity, air quality, public health, economic activity and tourism.  More than 80% of Ontarians live in urban areas (including Mississauga), where municipal governments can best decide how to configure and optimize their own transportation infrastructure.  See Mississauga's Transit and Road Infrastructure Plan.\n12. AFFORDABLE LIVING:  When owning a car (or using transit) is too expensive, a safe cycling network enables access to affordable grocery stores (or food banks) which may be further away; the opportunity for non-local employment; and more money available for housing costs.  The province and the City are in the midst of both a food insecurity and a housing crisis.  A balanced transportation system allowing for equitable personal mobility needs to be supported by the province, not thwarted.\n13. FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY:  With affordability an issue of great concern in Ontario, it is irresponsible to spend more taxpayer money to undo municipal investments already made in safe cycling infrastructure.  We note the framework of Bill 212 mandates provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads requiring removal of a traffic lane and for existing ones, where a traffic lane was removed.  The framework goes even further, naming specific Toronto bike lanes which are to be removed absent any quantitative justification, at the expense of all taxpayers in the province.  In Mississauga, the Bloor Street Integrated Road Project, now known as the Bloor Street Redesign project, has been \"paused\" (Mississauga News, November 1, 2024) pending a better understanding of the proposed legislation and any clarifying regulations.  Staff has documented that over $800k was spent on public engagement and several design iterations to arrive at the chosen design (Alternative 6 - 4p PDF) involving a 4-to-3 traffic lane conversion and protected cycle tracks.  Procurement has already taken place.\n14. PROVINCIAL OVERREACH AND INTERFERENCE:  For a government with the catch phrase \"Get it Done\" it is strange to see a Bill 'getting it undone'.  For a government touting a Ministry of Red Tape Reduction it is strange to see a Bill layering on the red tape yet to be specified in regulations.  For a government that has stated (Premier - April 3, 2024) \"I believe in letting municipalities determine what is good for their communities and what is not good for their communities,\" it is strange to see a Bill committing the Province to micro-manage an entirely local issue and interfere with democratic municipal process.  Such overreach into municipal affairs when primary provincial responsibilities such as Health, Education, the Courts system (and social services in Peel Region) are being underfunded is strange indeed.  The Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) expressed this in their submission (4p PDF) to the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy (Hearing re Bill 212) on November 18, 2024: \"The proposed bike lane framework is a very troubling overreach into municipal planning.\"\n15. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT:  The content of Bill 212 and its ramifications for Ontario's largest cities are being noticed by the rest of the world.  Disbelief and mockery are the reactions of cities preparing for the 21st century by installing safe cycling infrastructure.  Urbanists, city planners and transportation engineers have spoken out.  Uniquely in Ontario, ideology and anecdotes have supplanted data-based evidence and international best practices in the creation of Bill 212.

        "comment": "I'm very concerned about this plan to override municipal expertise, local decision-making, and local democracy, specifically in the case of bike lanes. Only a small percentage of urban roads in Ontario have bike lanes, and traffic is congested in countless areas where there are no bike lanes. Many factors impact motor vehicle traffic in all urban areas, in particular parking and construction. Yet the province wants to centrally control, limit or remove only bike lanes. On the streets specifically targeted by this proposal (Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave.), far more people travel in the bike lanes than park along these streets in the affected areas. Why does the province specifically want to discriminate against and endanger cyclists by removing or restricting their dedicated lanes? Why not centrally control or ban construction or parking which removes a lane of traffic, and which has a far greater overall impact on urban traffic flow throughout the whole province? It is particularly outrageous that a proposal which will disadvantage environmentally friendly modes of transportation includes an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for making such changes.\nMany cities around the world have shown that cycling can be greatly promoted by providing safe, continuous cycling facilities. Toronto and other Ontario cities were slow to start, and are just at the beginning of this process. The potential advantages are huge, including improved safety, improved health (as people get out of their cars and cycle more), major environmental benefits, supporting local business (as cyclists are far more likely to stop and shop locally than car drivers -- as seen on Bloor St. West in Toronto), and even improved traffic throughput, as a well-used a bike lane can have a MUCH higher capacity than a vehicle lane, even though the bike lane takes up less space.\nHowever, all the above requires a long-term commitment to change and improvement. Cycling facilities have to be provided where they are needed: along major roads, where most of the origins and destinations are. They have to be safe, direct, fast, and continuous, which is often only possible along major roads. For example, secondary roads don't cross most of the rivers, ravines, highways, and railway tracks which crisscross Toronto and other Ontario cities. It takes time and patience for people to become aware of improved cycling facilities, and to feel safe and comfortable to use them more often. \"Build it and they will come!\"\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024). This legislation\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\nToronto\u2019s own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city\u2019s own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic\u2014precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options and it instead promotes a highway. Many cities globally have provided evidence that \"adding more lanes\" doesn't decrease traffic. Adding another highway is not the answer here. Not only that -- constructing a highway without going through the proper environmental channels is irresponsible and just goes to show that the current Ontario government will cut corners if it serves their personal goals. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\nRather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than the ideas proposed by this Bill that is not aimed at benefiting all Ontarians, only the wealthiest and drivers.\nConclusion: A Step Backward for Ontario\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, and spending money on public transportation that should be up and running already, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\nThis Bill is one among many that has caused me to question Mr. Doug Ford's role. I question a capacity for leadership, and there is clearly a lack of ethics and morals coming from Mr. Ford and his government. Should this Bill pass, my vote in the next election will certainly not be going to the Conservatives.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto, Ontario, and I oppose Bill 212.\nRe: SCHEDULE 4 - HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT\nI support the bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Bicycles are a vital form of transportation for many people in the city who cannot afford a car \u2013 cycling is not just a cute hobby. Bicycle lanes also make it possible for people to learn about local businesses and make quick stops compared to taking the Bloor street or Yonge street subway lines. Many residents make trips of less than 5km that could easily be taken by bicycle instead of by car, reducing the number of cars on the road and improving circulation.\nWhen I worked on University Avenue and commuted 30min by bicycle, the Bloor Street bike lane made me safer every single day. I continue to use this lane to go grocery shopping, visit friends, and otherwise travel across the city. When I talk to people about why they do not ride their bicycles in Toronto, the concerns are usually safety.  Making cycling and public transit more affordable, safer, and easier so there are fewer cars on the road will improve traffic for the cars that are left. Also, these vehicle lanes transformed into bike lanes had a lot of parking beforehand, so reinstating them will not improve circulation. To address congestion, it might be more helpful to review the increasing numbers of ride share drivers and users who frequently block traffic lanes, as well as deliveries being made during peak commuting hours.\nFurthermore, the review process for municipal submissions adds an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and delay by paying the provincial public service to do work that municipal planners already do before bike lanes are installed, with the benefit of local expertise and context. In the case of the Toronto bike lanes, the work has already been finished, and removing the lanes will be costly and lead to additional car lane closures during the removal. No timelines are provided for developing the criteria for evaluating bike lanes, nor are specific details given regarding the stakeholders targeted.\nRe: SCHEDULE 2 - BUILDING HIGHWAYS FASTER ACT, 2024\nThis section of the act inappropriately overrides municipalities\u2019 local by-laws in favour of giving the provincial government more power.\nRe: SCHEDULE 3 - HIGHWAY 413 ACT, 2024\nThe exemption from environmental assessment of the highway 413 project will have devastating impacts on local ecosystems, as well as potentially on the highway itself. Summer 2024 was rainy, causing flooding and damage in Toronto due to building roadways without adequate drainage, leading to water building up on roadways and making them dangerous and impassable. Exempting highway 413 from these considerations risks repeating past mistakes.\n"

The city should have to present fact based evidence on how many people use bike lanes & whether the cost is justified.\nToronto facing a $1.5 billion deficit still voted to extend the bike lanes on Bloor Street West without a cost benefit analysis to provide evidence to justify this expenditure.\nThe bike lobby has the ear of city council & city council does their bidding while ignoring the will of the majority of residents who are property owners & tax payers who drive cars. There are over 1.3 million car owners registered in Toronto whose taxes actually pay for these bike lanes & city council consistently ignores their wishes. The majority of taxpayers see bike lanes as a waste of money catering to a small elite of privileged entitled activists and their supporters in the media and throughout city hall.\nMoney wasted on bike lanes which are empty most of the year especially in winter and on bad weather days could be better spent on Toronto food banks, housing, public transit & healthcare. Every body needs to eat but nobody needs to ride a bike. Those who don\u2019t drive could take the TTC that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for.\n"

If you remove the bike lanes on the major streets like Yonge and Bloor then those spots will just be occupied by delivery trucks with their four way flashers on.  Also, the majority of gridlock traffic is caused by construction projects in the city that are never ending.  You have the major condo construction on Bloor and Yonge that requires traffic to be stopped throughout the day for several dump trucks to come in and out, there is the accessibility construction of Museum station that is causing the issues on Queen's Parkway, and in general along other major roads there are more condos going up or improvements to the city.  Secondly the part of the bill that wants to make it easier for Doug Ford to expropriate farmer's land easier and remove environmental protections in order to build highways so his developer friends can build more condos.  Shame on you.  What legacy do you want to leave to our future living in Ontario where we rip up good farm land for roads and buildings making us more reliant on importing food from other countries.  Do you think that will get cheaper with the rising costs?  We need to protect the farm land in Ontario.  We also need to protect our wildlife in Ontario because the more unique species that become extinct the greater loss we have to our overall ecosystem.\n"
