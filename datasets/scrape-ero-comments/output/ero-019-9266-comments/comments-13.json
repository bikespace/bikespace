If the government is interested in efficiency then they should be interested in tracking the impact of removal of bike lanes on congestion.\n"

It would waste more tax payer dollars to add to congestion and making the roads more unsafe. An incredibly backwards decision that I will be protesting against at every avenue. If you review bike data you find that bike lanes provide safe and reliable routes in heavy densified areas.\n"

        "comment": "It has been studied and proven that giving people safe, alternative modes of transportation rather than cars helps those who need to drive be able to with less congestion. The government should be incentivizing people to use more efficient modes of transportation. Public transit investment and safe and connected cycling routes give people this incentive and allows road space to be cleared up for people who do not have the option of using the alternatives.\nI believe dictating what cities can and cannot do is also jurisdictional overreach. Your government claims that municipalities know best when it comes to housing, the shame should apply to their own transportation needs. Please consider this.\n"

If the goal is reducing congestion then reducing car ownership and the need to drive should be the goal. Eliminating parking minimums / tolling highways / improving public transit aggressively / adding cycling infrastructure should be considered instead.\nThe intrusion of the provincial government into what should be a municipal responsibility is concerning to me.\n"

I can attest to traffics being easier and safer with bike lanes, both for the driver and cyclist.  Most of the gridlock in the city is caused primarily by construction, drivers not following rules of the road, parking in bike lanes to name a few.\nIt would be a costly and environmental mistake to remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and a cyclist, this legislation gives me pause.  Adding separated bike lanes is not only safer for cyclists, but it improves traffic flow by moving cyclists out of the curb lane, allowing cars to travel at speed. There are already enough municipal government oversights to ensure that new bike lanes that reduce the number of lanes on the road are not detrimentally affecting gridlock.  Adding ministerial approval is an overreach and sends the message that the ministry and government do not want more bike lanes.  Improving cycling infrastructure WILL reduce gridlock, because with more safe bike lanes more people will choose to travel this way.  Our roads are full enough with cars.  Focus on encouraging people to get out of their cars and into public transit and cycling.  Follow London's example and introduce congestion charges to travel into city downtowns, which will at least encourage car pooling.  These are actions that reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I'm concerned about this proposal for a few reasons:\n1. Ontario has a building problem. Several major transit projects in Toronto and the GTA have been stagnant for years. If the province has additional time and resources, I'd like to see them focus those on improving regional transit in addition to repairing highways. Instead, requiring the minister of transportation--who is neither an expert in nor properly informed on municipal affairs--to approve every bike lane decision will add unecessary red tape and hamstring every other project in the process.\n2. As a taxpayer, I don't want to see my money go to tearing up existing infrastructure, now or ever. Again, I want to see my cities build themselves up. I want to see modern streets that reflect modern research and values.\n3. In Toronto, one lane of driving is almost always taken up by parking. I can't see how tearing out a bike lane on Bloor will effectively add any extra driving lanes.\n4. This plan is very obviously being implemented without any consideration for the facts. I have yet to hear from a politician what the evidence is for removing or hamstringing bike lanes. As a voter who considers himself a centrist and would be willing to vote PC, I simply couldn't support a party that uses taxpayer money to fund needless projects that clearly only benefit the commutes of the premier and minister involved.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible plan. Bike lanes are an incredibly important part of our reducing traffic congestion. For bike lanes to be effective, they may sometimes need take space away from private motor vehicles. Not allowing this will create indirect, slow routes, which few people will use or benefit from. Ultimately, municipalities understand their community best, and it makes no sense for the province to be dictating where a city may or may not put a bike lane. This is also a massive waste of money on behalf of the province.\nI can hardly afford rent. I can barely afford groceries. I certainly cannot afford a car. Public transit is slow and unreliable.\nPlease for the love of God do not take away the bike lanes. I have had too many near-death experiences biking on roads without bike lanes. Biking is the one mode of transportation which I can afford, which is reliable, which keeps me healthy, and which brings me joy.\nLegislation like this is pushing Canadian youth out of this province. Why would anyone want to live in such a stupid province?\nDo not ban the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and commute one hour by bike to my place of work. I also own a car and sometimes drive to work. And of course I also ride transit when that makes most sense. The best system is one that enables all three. People who need to drive can drive, but there need to be options for every mode. I am very careful when I ride my bike and always obey traffic laws. On roads without separated bike lanes, I\u2019ve been hit by cars twice. The new lanes in Toronto on Bloor and College and earlier on Queens Quay have likely saved my life. They\u2019re also packed during commuting hours. I and many others park our bikes on main streets and spend money in those establishments.  Alternatives to removing bike lanes, which are live traffic lanes? Could we look at removing parking from main streets? Or adding turning lanes to avoid one car blocking a bus or streetcar full of people? Also, more investment in transit would help. What won\u2019t help is taking away a safe, efficient travel option for people trying to get to work and get home to our families. That just puts more cars on the road and creates worse gridlock. Also, I ride my bike year round. There are really only a few stormy days when I can\u2019t. Many others do the same.\n"

        "comment": "This is the least thought out legislation the Ontario PCs have come up with yet. How can you present this blatant overstep into the Municipal realm when it is not the Province's jurisdiction? There have been countless studies on how bike lanes do not cause an increase in congestion, and actually result in the exact opposite! The problem for congestion in cities (let's be serious this is just a battle on Toronto) is not bike lanes, it is constant development, the OL shutting down main thoroughfares through the city, the Gardiner works, and other Provincial works that have impacted the streets of Toronto. The Province needs to focus on things that really matter, not taking away something that keep people safe. I will refer you all to the TVO 'blind date' that our Premier took part in with Singh where he blatantly says that you are not safe when you are not in a bike lane. Just because none of Ford's conservative voters ride bikes in the city of Toronto, it does not mean that people won't get hurt or killed without proper bike infrastructure. I am so against this legislation and I know for a fact any educated person is too. Keep to your provincial mandate, Ford.\n"

        "comment": "After years and years of advocacy, Toronto is finally building some decent infrastructure for bicycles and it\u2019s long overdue; I believe that restricting the growth of infrastructure for active transportation is a mistake. Why? It's the economy silly! electric cargo bikes deliver goods and services in Toronto 60% faster than a van or car, cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90%, provide income for the riders, and ensure businesses get their product delivered quickly. Studies have found that up to 51% of all freight journeys in urban centres could be replaced by cargo bikes - just think of that number and what it does for gridlock. Following me so far? How about safety, convenience as well as the economy? Toronto\u2019s Bike Share program currently boasts 9,000 bikes at 700 bike stations across the city and it is adapting quickly to allow all types of people to use it\u2019s service, from low-income to high usage riders to holiday-makers. It is equitable and flexible but only thrives because of the city\u2019s push to install more and better protected bike lanes. The month of May alone saw 682,000 trips taken with Bike Share bikes. Just think what our roads would be like if all those travellers used a car! Car ownership in Toronto is declining because people simply can't afford to buy and run one, so many people have chosen to be multi-modal - that is, use transit (such as it is), walk and ride a bike. Removing and restricting bike infrastructure will impact most on the poor and those who are unable to drive a car. It boggles my mind that you believe bikes cause gridlock and when you really think about, it makes no sense at all. Restricting bike lanes will almost certainly make gridlock worse, leave cyclists very vulnerable, remove mobility choices for everyone, and remove important eyes from our streets. So Ontario Government, get your hands off our bike lanes!\n"

The slower traffic is part of the process of adjusting to a future where the city be ones more enjoyable as an urban platform and not a suburban drive thru.\nI rather pay the price of driving and not set this city behind much farther by eliminating bike lanes.\nLook at places like NYC or Barcelona. Plenty of public transportation options and amazing bike lanes.\nEliminating bike lanes on you te and Bloor is a bad idea.\n"
