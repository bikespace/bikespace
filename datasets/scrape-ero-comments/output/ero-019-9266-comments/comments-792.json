        "comment": "It is very unfortunate our provincial government is taking overreaching steps to remove bike infrastructure and promoting car ownership and use. Commuting by bicycle is environmentally friendly, does not damage infrastructure, and does not cause congestion. Some of members of communities use this method of transportation for financial reasons and others for health reasons ( I have a family member who cannot drive for this reason ).\nMunicipalities should be left to determine the needs of their community members and need not have provincial interference.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor street have been poorly thought through and planned right from the start. Not only are they rarely used (even during summer and spring) but they have created tremendous congestion and gridlock, disrupted local businesses, and made parking a safety hazard for anyone brave enough to try to fit into the narrow parking lanes. Accurate data has not been used when making these decisions and I applaud the provincial government for trying to resolve this issue!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern with Bill 212. As someone who drives downtown to work daily, bike lanes have never been a source of traffic or grid lock. In fact, much more traffic and slow downs are created when there are no bike lanes, and cars must trail behind cyclists sharing the same road.\nI personally feel much safer driving on roads with bike lanes than ones without; the separation of bikes and vehicles keeps everyone safe. As someone whose partner cycles as a primary form of transportation, I also feel much better knowing that they are in bike lanes and not interweaving with vehicles.\nAdditionally, the proposed exemption from environmental assessment sets a dangerous precedent. These assessments are in place so that governments cannot build and develop at will and ignore impacts on the environment. Trying to legislate a loophole instead of undergoing assessments points to a concerning problem: they would not be trying to skirt around it if they thought that they could pass the assessments. We should not allow this blatant disregard of environmental protections.\n"

        "comment": "The worst place to put bike lanes is on major roads like Bloor University and Yonge st. where they reduce vehicular traffic to one lane resulting in vehicular traffic backed up in stop and go traffic while bicycles are few to be seen. Most of available parking spots are lost resulting in lower incomes for the city and stores located on those streets. These bike lanes are expensive to install and maintain. They are always dangerous no matter how much money is spent to make them safe. Where ever bike lanes cross perpendicular streets there will be accidents and conflict with pedestrians and vehicular traffic. On Babypoint Road at Jane street two concrete pads were placed on the Road for a future bike lane. This is an accident waiting to happen. At night they are difficult to see. In the winter they will be buried in snow.They are dangerous, its just a matter of time before a car runs into the concreate pads and someone is hurt. The gridlock bicycle lanes cause has a negative effect on our economy. It results in higher prices on everything when cars sit idling. The above mentioned streets have subways below them. We spend a lot of money subsidizing these subways. There is no need for bike lanes there. People should use the subway instead. Bike lanes are an inefficient use of the road. For most of the winter bike lanes sit empty but are still wastefully maintained. Vehicular motorists are diverting to side streets to avoid the gridlock caused by Bike lanes. This results in more vehicular traffic on side streets. This upsets homeowners as the streets become unsafe for pedestrians. The city's solution is then to reduce speed limits and install more speed bumps. More costs more upset people and more bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who uses this bike lane, and bike lanes across the city as a safe and environmentally conscious way of getting around, I strongly urge and beg you not to go through with this. The bloor bike lane allows for safe biking and efficiency when getting around the city.\nThe downtown core of the city should be for walkers, bikers and those using transit. If someone chooses to own a vehicle and drive while living downtown, then they must understand they are the problem creating the traffic that they're frustrated sitting in.\nThis is such a huge move in the wrong direction for a forward thinking and modern city. For the normal human being who is living, working, and spending time downtown Toronto, biking is often the affordable and thoughtful way of getting around and its so incredibly disappointing to remove such a valuable lane that keeps bikers safe. please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "There is no reason for the province to get involved in municipal manners. It is up to the city to ensure adequate city design, and the removal of bike lanes is a massive waste of money. There are much more important things that this money could be spent on, like healthcare and education. We should be promoting more forms of alternative transportation as our population grows - if everyone gets a car to get around, we will have much worse traffic!\nThe removal of bike lanes doesn\u2019t mean less bikers - there will just be more in car traffic, rather than separated in their own place. This will cause more congestion, and will make it more dangerous for bikers to get around.\n"

        "comment": "This is a colossal waste of time and money. Removing bike lanes will cost taxpayers more than was spent putting them in the first place.\nBike lanes reduce traffic over time. They give people more options for the trips they are making. This reduces cars on the road. Less cars on the road means less congestion. If gridlock really is the problem we are solving, where is the focus on reducing the amount of cars on our roads?\nSafety is a huge concern with bike lane removal. This bill does not account for the increased risk to people who will now be trying to use the same space as vehicle traffic. When Cyclists die, its more likely when they are competing for the same infrastructure (roads) as vehicles.\nIf this bill is really in favour of reducing gridlock to save time, it should be unacceptable that citizens be put in danger to save anyone even a single second of time. Convenience can\u2019t win out over people\u2019s lives.\n"

I use Spadina(where I\u2019d like a dedicated bike lane) to get down to Richmond. I use Collage to get to the medical complex along University, and I use the Bloor bike lane daily, to get to the JCC for exercise, and to shop at the many small and large stores that line the Bloor corridor. Toronto\u2019s downtown bicycle infrastructure are part of what makes the city so \u2018livable,\u2019 and accessible and thus a good place for me as I move into my retirement years.\n"

        "comment": "For the past three and a half decades I have resided in Bloor west and taught at the UofT St. George campus.  The most convenient commuting in earlier times was via car but was fraught with erratic traffic due in large part to haphazard travel patterns and varying non-conforming speeds resulting from traffic occupying two lanes in each direction.  Bicycle commuting on these routes was simply dangerous.  Too often and regularly, motorists would speed in the curb lanes in an attempt to get the advantage of a mere car length on another vehicle.  During this time I was involved in two not-at-fault collisions on the Dupont/Annette route and once, while cycling on Bloor, won the \u201cdoor prize\u201d due to the inattention of a motorist.\nRecent traffic improvements, doubtlessly informed by concerns for the welfare of all roadway users among other criteria, have created safe passage for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.  These positive changes include an increase in parking opportunities subsequent to the dissolution of morning and afternoon rush hour(s) parking restrictions.   Storefront shopping experiences have improved in the various business areas.  Gone too are the inevitable tow trucks and enforcement officers that contributed to traffic slow downs at the same time they were trying to ensure clear passage.  Indeed these changes have taken the rush out of rush hour.  Traffic of all sorts now flow in organised and predictable patterns.  Users have proven to be remarkably adaptable.  The re-design of these roads throughout Ontario has not emerged from whimsy and certainly not from spite but rather from a consultative, deliberate process.  Results demonstrate high degrees of successful integration among all users indicating general public acceptance.\nHowever, the provincial administration, particularly by identifying roads and specific areas of the city, seems to have taken inordinate interest in the civic matters of Metro Toronto.  The use of skewed data is duplicitous and while it may temporarily sway some opinion, ultimately it will be unmasked as political opportunism rather than practical concern.  The government\u2019s urgency to prioritise private vehicles in our public spaces is both exclusionary and decidedly myopic.  Threatening to rip up and destroy already proven safe and successful multi-use roadways \u2013 in addition to the monumental and unnecessary waste of precious community resources \u2013 reeks of a parochial paternalism pandering to a very small but obviously vocal section of the population.  Such senselessness would disenfranchise more than it could possibly help, and mocks the idea of community where we, as neighbours, commit to common rather than self-serving goals.  Indeed, if Toronto is the real target of the proposed legislation, then it is well to remember that the idea of neighbourhoods is integral to the multi-cultural communities imbuing Toronto with its unique identity.  The main purpose of our roads is to connect our communities and neighbourhoods, not transit them in the fastest time possible.\nNow retired, I do more cycling than driving in the city.  Recently I cycled from home to a Danforth caf\u00e9 and back (a distance of approximately 26 km) with virtually the entire route serviced by multi-use roadways.  The following day in a similar manner, I travelled to a business at Ossington and Bloor.  All traffic flowed readily and easily during these two cycling days, marred only by a food delivery car stopped in a bike lane.  My most recent driving experience, from home to the UofT campus, was also uneventful except for a car (not unlikely from a ride service) doing a U-turn against oncoming traffic.  These are personal accounts yet they demonstrate the efficacy and safety of intelligent innovation.  Multiuse and safe efficiency are not mutually exclusive.  Safe efficiency (or efficient safety, if you prefer) for all constituents must undeniably be the goal and can only be derived from fact based analysis.\nFor another constituency \u2013 much larger, more populous, and certainly more traffic challenged than Toronto \u2013 it should not go without mention that in the interest of safer and more efficient traffic flow the iconic Brooklyn Bridge has just opened a completely re-imagined multi-use thoroughfare to the delight of its thousands of daily users as well as the city\u2019s traffic commissioner.  It appears we\u2019re in good, progressive company.\nThe apparent overreach and intrusion and inequity underlying the proposed legislation is as disturbing as it is disappointing.  I am opposed to the implementation of Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Government policy should be based on evidence. To date, no evidence has been provided, referenced, or published which supports the Ontario Government\u2019s assertion that bike lanes are the cause of traffic congestion.\nTraffic congestion is caused by many factors; alternative modes of transportation (e.g., bikes) are not one of those factors. Over-reliance on vehicles, a lack of transit alternatives, and road repair work all contribute. It is relevant to note that Toronto, specifically, is currently in the midst of a huge amount of road infrastructure repair work construction after a decade of municipal and provincial government spending cuts to large infrastructure projects. Road and infrastructure construction, while necessary, contributes to congestion.\nIf the province truly wished to reduce the traffic congestion facing Toronto and the GTA, we would see an investment in public transit infrastructure including completing the Eglinton LTR (currently in its 15th year of construction), the Ontario Line and other long-running TTC projects, enhancing Go Transit infrastructure, and, yes, creating a safe physical space for cyclists. The more alternative transit options that exist, the fewer cars on the road and the less traffic congestion. This is common-sense.\nShould the Ontario Government choose to move forward, the unnecessary construction, road closures, and lane reductions required to remove the already built (and paid for) bike lanes will cause further congestion. The estimated 48-million-dollar price tag for the removal of bike lanes would be far better spent on our defunded health and public education systems.\nThis proposal also creates a worrying precedent for provincial overstep into municipal matters. It is not the role of the provincial government to micromanage the zoning considerations of the municipality. Especially when this province is being faced with far more important issues.\nIt appears as though the Ontario Government has based their policy decision on the feelings of wealthy donors and business interests, personal preferences of the elected officials, and personal/political grudges against the province\u2019s most populous city.\nAt best, this proposal is rushed, short-sighted, and poorly researched. At worst, it is a blatant attempt by the Provincial Government to encroach on the municipal responsibilities and distract the Ontario public from the land expropriation sections of Bill 212, which would have a far greater impact on those outside of Toronto (coincidentally, the voter base of the current government).\n"

Blocking that progress -or worse, undoing the progress already made- for the perceived convenience of a few drivers is the kind of decision-making that will cause real economic harm to many and get some people killed.\nInstead of interfering with local roads, the Ontario government should be fixing the 401 and other highways. They're a mess of endless trucks, endless traffic jams, endless construction, and all too many destructive and deadly crashes. That's the province's jurisdiction and responsibility, and what the people of Ontario are counting on our provisional government to do.\n"
