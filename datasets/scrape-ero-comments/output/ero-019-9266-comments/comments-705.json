        "comment": "I use the bike lanes on Bloor Street and University Avenue nearly every day to commute to and from work and school. There are almost always many other people riding in the bike lanes, with more than half of them usually being food delivery workers. Removing bike lanes will result in dangerous conditions for people trying to do their jobs or get to them. It will also increase the number of cars on the road at rush hour because people who would usually bike to their destination will start driving due to safety concerns. I will be very disappointed if this bill is passed.\n"

        "comment": "Good evening,\nThis bill is an absurd waste of money. I pass the University bike lanes every day on my way to work, and even as a pedestrian they make me feel safer, as an additional barrier between me and all the cars. The bike lanes took time and money to install. They are popular, and many of the people who use them would continue to bike on these roads even without separate lanes, they would just weave in and out of car traffic. Removing existing bike lanes would make these streets more dangerous and stressful for all road users, and there is no evidence travel times would improve. This bill represents the opposite of fiscal responsibility. Wasting millions of dollars for no real reason is not what taxpayers want from the Progressive Conservative party. Please do not pass Bill 212- Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act 2024  (ERO Number 019-9266). Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am highly concerned by the framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. This is outside the jurisdiction of the provincial government, and takes away power unnecessarily from the municipalities.\nSecond of all, I truly believe that \"if you build it, they will come.\" Toronto is only becoming more densely populated, and biking is the quickest way to get around and separated bike lanes are the safest way to do this. In my neighbourhood of Mimico, several years ago we had a cyclist named John Offutt who died after being crushed by a cement truck. While there were bike lanes on Royal York, they were not separated, and having this separation could have prevented his unnecessary death.\nThird: cars take up a lot more room, and as long as they are burning gas, contribute to poor air quality. Globally, air quality is worsening, and air pollution is a leading cause of death. Particulate matter is particularly harmful and linked to heart and respiratory problems.\nAnd tied to that - fourth: with our health crisis, biking offers another opportunity for people to get active.\nLastly, I am also a driver, and I often drive on Bloor between Islington and Royal York, which is one of the contentious zones for traffic that have spurred the passionate debate on bike lanes. I have not experienced any traffic while I've driven on these streets.\nIn conclusion: please keep the bike lanes so we can be ready for the future, and for our health and safety, and to respect the jurisdiction of local government.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is going in the wrong direction. I do not support the removal of bicycle infrastructure.  We need to encourage more active transportation and public transit in order to make our towns and cities more livable for everyone and safe for vulnerable road users. Increased bicycle use will reduce car traffic and help address climate change.\nAlso, infrastructure for bicycles and pedestrians should be a municipal government concern. The provincial government should be focused on concerns health care...and leave the bike lanes alone.\n"

We should be adding to this system rather than reducing for the sake of cyclist safety, encouraging cycling and reducing CO2 emissions. Cycling is also a huge health benefit and helps to keep my diabetes in check.\n"

Bike lanes with barricades and solid lines give cyclists and drivers with enough room, not a problem. Maybe if more people biked to work there wouldn\u2019t be so much traffic. Adding a few inches to the road isn\u2019t going to help traffic go any faster.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Ottawa and I am a driver, cyclist, transit rider, and pedestrian. I am writing in opposition to Bill 212, for the following reasons:\nFirst, the bill is an insult to municipalities that have used their resources to build bike lanes. Ottawa has spent a small amount of money in recent years improving bike infrastructure, including some lanes that the province may consider to \"remove\" a lane of traffic. This bill essentially proposes to steal that investment from Ottawa taxpayers by confiscating infrastructure that the city chose to spend its own revenues installing. This flies in the face of good fiscal management and smacks of overreach by the provincial government.\nSecondly, this bill would not reduce traffic. Instead, it would contribute to locking Ontarians into a cycle of induced demand, encouraging the perpetual building more and more roads for more and more cars. Bikes are smaller than cars. Not every trip needs to be a car trip. On the contrary, it is essential that we cut the share of car trips in our transportation mix, for many reasons, including the need to cut our transportation emissions to help address the urgent, civilizational challenge of responding to climate change.\nThird, the bill is being proposed despite evidence that it is unnecessary and unwise. Ontario businesses have noted that bike lanes, even on busy streets like Bloor, improve their sales and make their customers safer because there are more eyes on the street and because the cyclists who are among their clientele are not getting maimed outside their shop doors. CBC has reported that the City of Toronto collected data over a 12 month period since the Bloor lanes were installed. It showed limited to no impacts on motor vehicle travel times and no issues for emergency services were reported. Instead, construction and cars were blocking intersections.\nFinally and essentially, this bill would make our roads less safe for cyclists, who are (I feel this bears reinforcing) legitimate users of the road and not just gadflies seeking to create inconvenience for motorists by having the temerity to request some basic consideration in the design of our roads. In September, my friend's beloved dad was killed: an experienced cyclist, he was struck and left for dead by an unknown motorist while riding along a street with no bike lane. He was only 50 years old and has two young grandchildren. This bill is an insult to his memory. The motorist has not had the decency to present themself to give my friend's family closure, but I can imagine that they may wish that they had had the benefit of a separated bike lane to prevent the tragedy they caused.\nThere is a lot left to do to improve safety for cyclists: just this morning my city councillor confirmed that another Ottawa cyclist has died from injuries sustained in a cycling accident. All I ask is that the province butt out.\nThank you for your attention to this comment.\n"

This sets a dangerous precedent which must not be allowed to go forward.\nThis bill is a bad idea, not only because of the huge costs involved to remove bike lanes, which will be paid by City of Toronto taxpayers, but also because it may cost the safety & lives of bike lane users.\nLimiting construction chaos, improving TTC service so it is reliable, expanding transit options as an alternative to clogging our roads with more traffic and air pollution are the sustainable answers.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in the City of Toronto without any supporting data that would demonstrate their removal would have any positive impact on alleviating congestion is contrary to the public interest and completely misguided.\nWhy is it against the public interest?\nThe proposed legislation removes a transportation option for people who cannot afford to drive or to depend on notoriously unreliable public transit. For people who have chosen to cycle to help reduce congestion, as congestion is clearly caused by too many cars on the road.\nIt completely overturns the will of people who have elected the representatives on municipal City Council - the representatives who deal with local issues day in and day out and know the City best. It will increase emissions and reduce the City's ability to reach its climate goals.\nIt will remove a healthy choice of activity for many who cycle not only to get to work or to conduct errands but also as form of exercise at the same time.\nIt will needlessly put people's lives at risk who cycle - do cyclists not have a right to a safe commute? Will the province be liable when cyclists are inevitably injured while cycling on roads that previously had a protected bike lane?\nIt is a complete waste of money for taxpayers. There is no doubt that the City will need to install new bike lanes again in 10 years or so since the population is only growing, meaning we need to make other transportation options viable to facilitate the growing population. There will never be enough space for everyone to drive. We need options and protected bike lanes are one way of encouraging people to get out of their cars, even if it's for a limited number of a person's trips. It's about providing citizens with a variety of options and making them viable ie. safe and direct routes.\nThe public interest does not only consist of the interests of the constituency who drive so they can potentially save a minute or two in their commute while they add to the congestion problem in their personal vehicle.\nIf the province has data that shows that removing bike lanes will alleviate congestion, improve health, improve air quality, make commuting cheaper, save costs in the long run, provide a variety of transportation options etc. then by all means, remove the bike lanes. In only considering the commute times of drivers (and even here without adequate data), the government is abdicating their responsibility to its citizens by ignoring all these other critical factors that must be taken into account.\n"
