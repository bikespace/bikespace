        "comment": "I am a previous biker and current driver in the city. I both work and live in Toronto. Bike lanes make sense for both drivers and bikers alike. Removing bike lanes makes the streets more dangerous. I do not want to hit a biker while driving. Furthermore, removing the bike lanes will not help with congestion and moving people quickly. On downtown streets without bike lanes traffic moves slowly because bikers take up a full street lane. The decision to remove bike lanes should not be within the provincial governments purview. This decision is removed from the reality of the city. In addition, in order to be an \u201cinternational\u201d city that people want to live work and visit, you need to have all methods of transportation working well and integrated - walking, cycling, driving, and public transit. I am disappointed in this selfish decision the Ontario government has made. Not everyone can afford to drive downtown.\n"

It will make our streets less safe for everyone and you have absolutely no data to back up your claims that removing bike lanes will improve vehicular traffic flow. Leave Ontario\u2019s cities alone and focus on improving our access to healthcare and education. Things that are actually in your mandate. Again, you aren\u2019t making decisions based on data, just vibes. It\u2019s shameful.\n"

        "comment": "The traffic lights for bicycles near Old Mill Station were unveiled literally days ago, in later October. Dismantling the infrastructure that isn't even fully finished yet is an unbelievable waste of my, taxpayer's, money.\nLiving in the west end, I was finally able this year to bike on Bloor Street without the fear for being hit by a car or doored.\nIf the premier is so concerned about depriving Torontonians of safe cycling spaces, where was he when the infrastructure was being planned and built?\nPerhaps the premier could learn to ride a bicycle and gain a smidge of empathy for people who actually live in Toronto and use the bike lanes.\n"

Cars do. Do something about all the cars on the road, fine. Otherwise give bikes and cyclists the space they deserve and have earned from years of neglect and abuse.\nI DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WILL NOT VOTE CONSERVATIVE IN THE NEXT FEDERAL OR PROVINCIAL ELECTION BECAUSE OF THIS.\n"

The Toronto Star article (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/do-cycling-corridors-really-slow-traff\u2026) shows that there\u2019s essentially zero evidence supporting this initiative. So why aren't you focusing on things like the TTC, which is unreliable, unsafe and expensive or Uber that too expensive. Biking keeps one healthy and less cars means better air quality. Also world class cities have bike lanes so why are we going backwards here?\nHello?\n"

        "comment": "Congestion on roadways is a known issue, and the issue will only get worse as the population continues to grow and travel demand continues to rise. At the same time, there is only so much space available within an existing right-of-way, and widening right-of-ways is often difficult.\nCommon sense dictates that the way we increase people-per-hour capacity on our limited right-of-ways is by reallocating space from the least space-efficient uses to other, more efficient uses. At a time when congestion is a widely agreed upon issue, it is both counterproductive, and in opposition to common sense, to reduce a roadway's capacity and its ability to move people, by reallocating from a more efficient use of space, to a general traffic lane which is the least efficient possible use of that space.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who sometimes drives in downtown Toronto, what I hate about the congestion is not the bike lanes - if anything, they help me feel safer about sharing the road with cyclists if there is a proper bike lane, especially when there are physical barriers. The worst thing about the congestion are the cars/trucks stopped at the side of the road in the lane because they're unloading something or waiting for someone (the large trucks unloading their shipments are the worst at this).\nPlease keep the bike lanes; they're not the problem, and in fact, they're helping to keep the roads from being a chaotic free-for-all. If you remove the bike lanes, you're not only not solving the problem, you're actually removing part of the solution.\n"

Bikes are safe, fast, healthy and add to climate change goals, prosperity and the health of.our province. Meddling in this from Doug Ford's conservatives gives me a taste of what insidious plans the Conservatives have for Ontario and the country.

This provincial interference in city matters is completely unneeded and frankly, quite petty.
