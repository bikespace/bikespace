Biking helps congestion and we want more people on bikes and we want to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Also, more highways and roads do not help traffic but actually increase it. Environmental regulations must be followed. We need to invest in more public transit and trains.\n"

        "comment": "Not only will you be wasting taxpayer money with bike lane removals, but you will be adding to congestion as cyclists come back onto the road and putting their lives in danger. I lost a friend and colleague in November 2012 to be road cycling accident, and I think this is irresponsible to even consider. One last note: can you let the city decide how to deal with this infrastructure instead of meddling in without any evidence to back your claims? Most of us living in the city are tired of having you justify these ridiculous ideas because of the suburban sprawl and lack of transit for those living outside the city wanting to come in. Hurry up on the LRT lines and literally stay out of these lanes.\n"

Bike lanes save lives, move people through the city faster, promote a healthier and happier populous. We are in the midst of a climate crisis and cannot fathom why priority would be given to vehicle transit. The city could use the money to remove the bike lanes in so many better ways.\nIt would be an absolute shame for bike lanes to be reduced in Toronto.\n"

My team and clients come by foot, bike, car, TTC, GO/UP, or shared rides like Uber.\nSafe options for walking, cycling, and transit are essential\u2014not just for my business, but for the well-being of my staff.\nFor the most part, we haven\u2019t had major issues driving within the city. The main problem is the increasing traffic volume, especially along the Lakeshore, QEW, and 401, plus all the ramps leading to the highways. Our clients often mention longer commutes and gridlock frustrations.\nThe surge in construction and roadwork can be overwhelming, and it\u2019s definitely adding to the congestion.\nFor those in Toronto who don\u2019t have cars, fair and accessible mobility options are crucial. Separated bike lanes are a big part of this\u2014and they\u2019re key to our city\u2019s economic growth.\nThe environmental benefits of cycling and dedicated bike lanes are huge. Most obviously, they help cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Plus, biking, walking, and transit are more environmentally-friendly choices for Ontario, and they come with mental health and well-being benefits.\nLet\u2019s keep Ontario moving with smart, multimodal transit options\u2014including safe, separated bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Please consider keeping bike lanes and not worrying about municipal affairs.\nBike lanes keep cyclists safe, but removing them will not reduce the number of cyclists on the road. Consider the many construction projects through the city and how when those disrupt bike lanes, cars now get stuck behind bikes. Bike lanes remove cyclists from the road so cars are able to move freely.\nFurthermore, please spend your efforts on things that are important. Removing existing infrastructure will just make congestion worse. Please consider using the money for this to advance the opening of the lanes on the Gardiner, or opening the LRT, or helping cities outside Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "More bike lanes are fundamental in big cities where traffic is busy and hostile. I used to ride up and down Yonge street between Bloor and Eglinton before the bike lane was there. It is an uphill where the cyclist's speed gets reduced and phisycal effort is increased, making the trajectory super dangerous. Gladly, a bike lane was built and provided relief and safety. Unfortunately, this is one out of many bike lanes at risk of being removed/ never built if this bill gets passed.\nHaving more lanes for cars have been proven to encourage more people to drive, causing more congestion due to bottlenecks, wether due to traffic engineering issues, construcion closures or accidents.\nOn the other hand, having more bike lanes encourages more people to ride bicycles too, becuase they feel safe. A person who would otherwise never try riding to work , may feel encouraged to try it and possibly adhere to that commuting option. That is could contibute to improve traffic, minimize emissions and optimize one's health.\n"

        "comment": "Increasing the length of roadways that bikes and cars share is less safe for bikers and directly slows down car traffic by collapsing different moves of transportation to a single lane. Removing bike lanes  also encourages people to drive more given the reduced safety of biking, which then increases the volume of cars on the road and worsens congestion.\nImproving the safety and convenience of biking for those who can feasibly do it is accomplished in part by retaining and growing the network of dedicated bike lanes. If sustained, this network will continue to reduce the number of cars on the road and improve the driving experience for those who need to drive to their destination. Growing the dedicated bike lane network improves the driving experience.\nThis bill should not be passed.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI urge you to keep the system we have in place. Municipalities are already spending tax dollars to ensure they are taking appropriate measures to create bike lanes and withold their creation, depending on the needs of their local community. If a community finds their local goverment is not applying bike lanes correctly, they can vote differently and make the change on that level. Adding the province's involvement means more red tape.\nBike lanes have their place and importance. They serve their community both in reducing the number of locals driving and in promoting healthy lifestyles, which reduces the burden on our already overburdened healthcare system. It also severely reduces the number of bike deaths and removes bikes from already busy car lanes (which slows down traffic).\nBike lanes also promote local businesses, as people are more likely to stop their bike to check out a store than they are to try and find someolace to park to do the same thing.  I encourage you to look at the link I am adding to this submission, which goes to an analysis of bike lanes, and covers what I said in greater detail.\nIf you care for the people within your province, I respectfully urge you to make the right choice, and keep the provincial goverment out of the decision of bike lanes.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "Opposing the proposed amendment to grant the province approval authority over bike lanes on municipal roads is crucial for several reasons. While it may appear that the amendment is meant to streamline or standardize bike lane development, it represents a significant overreach that undermines local governance and decision-making, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other areas of municipal autonomy.\n1. Erosion of Municipal Authority and Local Autonomy\nMunicipalities like Toronto are best positioned to make decisions about local infrastructure, including bike lanes, as they are directly accountable to their residents and have intimate knowledge of local conditions. Ceding control to the province threatens the democratic principle of local governance, weakening municipalities' ability to plan and respond to the needs of their communities.\nCities are diverse in their traffic patterns, transit needs, and geography. What works for Toronto may not be ideal for other cities or towns. The province, with its broader and less granular focus, may lack the nuanced understanding required for making effective decisions about bike lanes in specific neighborhoods.\n2. Bike Lanes as Critical Infrastructure for Sustainable Cities\nBike lanes are not just an alternative form of transport; they are critical infrastructure in the fight to reduce congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and promote healthier, more sustainable urban living. Cities worldwide are increasing bike lane networks as part of comprehensive transit solutions aimed at reducing car dependence. The province's potential interference with these efforts runs counter to global trends in urban planning and environmental stewardship. Reducing lanes for automobiles and increasing space for bikes is not merely a loss of road space but a gain in efficiency and sustainability.\nFurthermore, single-use automobile trips are among the least efficient forms of transit. In Toronto, traffic congestion is a major issue, and bike lanes are a proven tool in reducing congestion and promoting multi-modal transport. Prioritizing cars over sustainable transport options such as cycling and public transit reflects outdated thinking and will only exacerbate long-term challenges.\n3. Economic and Environmental Costs of Automobiles are Understated\nThe true cost of single-use automobiles in urban centers like Toronto is vastly underrepresented. Not only do they occupy immense amounts of road space relative to the number of people they transport, but they also impose hidden costs related to pollution, road maintenance, and public health. Noise pollution, air quality degradation, and carbon emissions are just some of the externalities that make automobile-centric planning unsustainable in the long term.\nRemoving vehicle lanes to install bike lanes is not simply a subtraction\u2014it is an investment in a cleaner, more efficient urban future. Bikes take up far less space than cars and can move more people with less infrastructure, at a fraction of the cost. The public burden of single-use cars on healthcare (due to pollution-related illnesses), on public infrastructure (due to wear and tear), and on climate change (due to emissions) must be considered when discussing the balance between car lanes and bike lanes.\n4. Data Collection Mandates Should Serve Local Interests, Not Provincial Control\nWhile data collection on bike lanes can be beneficial for planning, it must be driven by local interests and the need to improve services for residents. The proposed requirement for municipalities to provide information to the province could be used to undermine or obstruct bike lane installations, rather than support their thoughtful expansion. Centralizing control over this data serves no local interest and risks politicizing infrastructure decisions that should be driven by local needs and priorities.\nA Provincial Mandate Could Slow Progress and Innovation\nToronto has made significant strides in expanding its bike lane network, which has helped shift more people toward cycling as a viable transit option. Allowing the province to weigh in on these local decisions could slow or even reverse the progress made. The delays, bureaucracy, and potential for conflicting interests that come with provincial oversight will almost certainly inhibit innovation in urban mobility.\nMoreover, local governments have developed detailed master plans and frameworks based on extensive community consultation and urban planning expertise. Provincial interference risks derailing these evidence-based plans in favor of less-informed, one-size-fits-all policies.\nThis amendment is not about improving urban mobility or increasing efficiency. It is about stripping municipalities of their ability to make decisions that are in the best interests of their residents. The province should support municipalities in their efforts to build sustainable, multi-modal transit systems that include cycling infrastructure, not take control away from local governments. Toronto and other cities should retain their authority to prioritize bike lanes where appropriate, as these are integral to reducing congestion, promoting sustainability, and addressing the true costs of urban automobile dependence.\nRejecting this amendment is crucial to preserving local autonomy, promoting sustainable urban transit, and ensuring that bike lane development reflects the needs of the communities they serve.\n"

        "comment": "This is the stupidist biggest waste of money proposal I've ever heard of.  Look around the world at great cities and best practices and they are putting in cycling infrastructure, not removing it.  Not to mention these are city of Toronto roads.  The province needs to stop interfering in matters that are not theirs and that they don't fully understand.\nBike lanes keep people safe and keep cars off the road.  People who actually live in the city of Toronto don't all own cars and need to get around.  It is the visitors who are coming in, driving through and creating the congestion. Taking out street parking is a more logical step in getting traffic moving, not taking out a lane of actual moving traffic (bikes).\nThese cars driving through and causing the congestion are not spending their money in the city they are passing through.  It's the pedestrians and cyclists, ttc users that are stimulating the local businesses.\nCars in the downtown are elitist, polluting and contributing to the obesity epidemic.\nRemoving the lane that promotes a fast, free, clean and active approach is just so stupid.\nBike lanes give much more back to the economy and prevent health and environmental ill effects thus saving the province money in the long term.\nThe research and evidence on this is there from all over the world.\nIt's so frustrating that we have a premiere who wants to waste resources, not invest in the future, and  take us backwards.\n"

        "comment": "This is the most backward thinking proposed legislation I\u2019ve encountered in a long time. Studies have proven that bike lanes REDUCE traffic congestion, not cause it. There is no evidentiary proof that bike lanes cause traffic congestion. If the framers of this proposed legislation actually did some research instead of reacting to the whims of one man (greenbelt removal, paper bags in the LCBO, more room for gas guzzling SUV's from the suburbs), they would come to the conclusion that municipalities work work better with an increased infrastructure for bicycles, pedestrians, and mass transit. Look at the examples of London, England and Montreal, Quebec. Creating a war on bicycle just perpetuates the ugly us versus them mindset. There\u2019s room for everyone if you actually open your mind to reality.\n"
