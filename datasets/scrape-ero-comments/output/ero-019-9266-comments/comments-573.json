        "comment": "As a Torontonian, I am disgusted by this proposal. This morning the City of Toronto released a report showing that the cost of removing this integral bike lanes would cost us the taxpayers $48 million on top of the $27 million already spent on putting the lanes in, some of which have only just reopened. Explain to me how a premier who claims to be saving us money and reducing the overreach of government can at the same time throw away $75 million of our dollars and at the same time take agency away from the elected municipal representatives that I voted for to make those decisions.\nI ride a bike frequently in this city. I also own and drive a car regularly, often to visit my family outside the GTA. I have more experience navigating this city by bike and car than I'm sure many of the people who support this proposal. Removing bike lanes does not reduce congestion. This is a well understood fact of city planning has been proven time and time again in practice. What is proven to reduce congestion is better access to more reliable public transit\u2014something the provincial government has also taken away from my city. I was just starting high school when construction of the Eglinton Crosstown started. Now I'm 6 years into my career our of university and there's no sign of completion. I might add that Eglinton is the only street in this city where I have experienced true gridlock. Not on Bloor, nor College, nor University, and it's due to a construction project the provincial government wanted to adopt and now seem uninterested in completing.\nI would also add that removing bike lanes will not change human behaviour. Moving bike routes to secondary roads does not mean the cyclists will move with them. They will continue to use Bloor, College, and University to navigate the city because those are roads it makes sense to do so on, but now they will have to share lanes with vehicles. This will increase congestion and put lives at risk. I have lost more than one person in my life to cycling on a road shared with traffic. I see their ghost bikes around the city and am reminded of the difference that this kind of essential, common sense infrastructure could have made to them and the people that miss them, myself included.\nIt is a fact that cycling is not only the cleanest way to commute, but also by far the fastest way to traverse the city, and for that reason alone the number of cyclists in Toronto will only continue to grow. Ignoring the need to build infrastructure that supports the growing number of cyclists here is ignorant and inadvisable. Tearing down the existing infrastructure in a transparently political move is despicable. Tear down or not, I will be biking down Bloor to work. Cars can either pass me while I ride in a protected lane, or they can wait behind me on the road. Your choice. Please reconsider this damaging, vindictive proposal to harm the city I live in and love.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian living in an area that has yet to have cycling lane access, I am AGAINST Bill 212 Schedule 4 requiring the City of Toronto to have provincial ministry approval for constructing cycling lanes, and create the framework for the provincial ministry to remove cycling lanes.\nThe City of Toronto has done extensive work in planning an efficient cycling network to maximize citizen mobility and connecting its citizens to public transit networks, as seen in IE14.3 - Cycling Network Plan Update (2025 - 2027). The efficiency of the cycling network plan is heavily contingent on its major arterial cycling paths along public transit networks paths (Bloor, Yonge, University) in order to provide the citizens access to public transit networks.\nThis cycling network aims to REDUCE ROAD CONGESTION by providing the citizens a valid viable cycling transport option, and also public transit option with mixed modes of transport with cycling included.\nThe proposed removal of cycling lanes along major arterial roads at Bloor, Yonge and University will have a NEGATIVE IMPACT TO ROAD CONGESTION. If removed, considerably more people that would have cycled on the cycling lane would feel inclined to drive. There would be induced demand of cars on the roads. Those that remember the history of these roads of interest before cycling lanes were implemented would say that back in the day, these roads were already congested for cars due to all the roadside parking, and also unpleasant to walk through due to the noisy car traffic and cars going back and forth between lanes to avoid parked cars. Going back to those days would not be great for a significant majority of the citizens, except for the very select few that get to benefit from road side parking in front of the few businesses that they stop at. And if parking would not be allowed on these roads after cycling lane removal, see the argument below on economic activity impact.\nThe proposed removal of cycling lanes will have a NEGATIVE IMPACT TO TTC RIDERSHIP and decrease citizen mobility. If removed, considerably more people that would have taken public transit because they can cycle to a subway station, may no longer consider that to be a valid or efficient mobility option. They may be more inclined to drive should the bike lanes be removed.\nThe proposed removal of cycling lanes will have a NEGATIVE IMPACT TO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY for businesses along these major arterial roads and also surrounding areas. The decrease in local mobility means less frequent stops by citizens to local businesses. Cycling lanes have vastly improved pedestrian mobility, safety and general welcomeness of the area for frequent stopping. The removal of the cycling lanes will equate to less overall business.\nAs the goal of the bill 212 is to \"reduce gridlock\", the very approach of Bill 212 Schedule 4 would act as a disservice to its own goals, which is why I voice my opinion of being AGAINST Bill 212. It would be a disservice to the majority of the citizens that benefit from cycling lanes, either directly, or indirectly. It would also more specifically act as a disservice to the very drivers that 'believe' that removal of cycling lanes would reduce gridlock and congestion, where in fact such acts of reducing cycling network efficiency would actually get in the very way of what they desire by worsening congestion.\nTo all the drivers out there that do not care to consider the benefit of the majority, at least care about your own goals and ambitions of reducing gridlock and congestion. Do not make your own driving experience WORSE by removing cycling lanes. These cycling lanes are there to improve citizen mobility, so that the cars that do need to drive through those areas and do not have a valid alternative can drive through the area while encountering less cars.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is absolutely galling. It is a culmination of the petty tyrant characteristics embodied in our Premier. In what world does this fall into the category of provincial responsibility at all? It's a slap in the face to all Ontarians who live in Toronto AND all those who don't. For Torontonians like myself, it's a clear overreach of provincial power and petty meddling because god forbid the drive to Queen's Park for people like Dougie and his buddies (aka ministers) is sometimes slow. For non-Torontonians, it's a slap in the face because why the hell are their hands being tied to develop bike lane infrastructure in the future and why the hell are they on the hook for the cost of bike lane removals in Toronto?\nRemoving bike lanes and limiting the ability for future bike lanes to be built is going to kill people. This is not hyperbolic, this is true. Toronto's streets are already so dangerous for non-drivers. Removal of these bike lanes will not only deter people from biking, but the people who still will because it's literally how they live are going get hurt or killed. People who live in cities deserve mobility. It doesn't seem like I'm saying anything controversial. People who live in cities deserve not to get pancaked by the Premier on his way to work on the 10 days in a year he is actually in the office. Cities in 2024 run on bike delivery as well-- are the Ontarians who do these vital jobs valued so little? Is the trade-off really a more convenient commute in exchange for their lives?\nNot to mention that the lack of evidence behind the reasoning for this Bill. The gridlock which is clearly driving our beloved Premier up the wall are not a result of bike lanes and they won't go away when the bike lanes are gone. If anything, congestion will increase as people who would've biked will be in cars. Also, the Toronto congestion stems from the highways, it's on the highway ramps to enter and exit the city. It was for a long time due to a STILL UNFINISHED Eglinton crosstown LRT. And honestly, who gives a shit about congestion in Toronto? Yeah, there is traffic and slowdowns when you are moving through, in, and out of the biggest city in Canada. No shit! This is an economic, financial, cultural, political capital. So long as that keeps being the case, there is going to be gridlock and congestion on our roads and highways.\nThis is not a real public problem, there are individual solutions people can take to overcome this. Hey Dougie, hop on a bike! Take the TTC! Maybe then you'll see how the other half lives. Maybe then you'll see that more than anything this city needs funding to make sure options other than driving are seen as viable to eliminate congestion -- which would also eliminate car pollution and make our streets safer for everyone as well.\nThis government hates us. They hate everyone who isn't directly related to them or lining their pockets. In my lifetime I've never seen a more blatantly corrupt government in office. Their priorities are so disgusting - Our healthcare system is falling apart at the seams but hey at least there are more dangers around! Alcohol on every corner and drivers that will injure or kill us on our bikes. Good thing our healthcare system is well-equipped to handle how many more people it will have to serve thanks to this government's god-awful policies and legislation.\nI can't wait to vote them out soon. I will be campaigning strongly to make sure they lose the next election.\n"

        "comment": "Increasing transit frequency across the board and finally opening the 14 year old Eglinton cross town  will reduce gridlock, not more construction to remove bike lanes.\nIs this just a ploy to pay construction companies more?\nWhat a waste of money. The city spent tons to put these in, to do the consultations, and you want to waste more to take them out?\nI'm a driver and I say leave the bike lanes alone.\nStop meddling with Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal outlined in the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 (Bill 212), which includes provisions for removing existing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto.\nRemoving these bike lanes would have a profoundly negative impact on many individuals who rely on biking as their primary mode of transportation. For those who cannot afford cars, biking provides an affordable and environmentally friendly means of getting to work, school, and other essential services. Eliminating bike lanes would force these individuals to seek alternative, often more costly, transportation options, putting additional financial strain on lower and middle-income families.\nEliminating bike lanes would increase the risk of accidents and injuries for cyclists, as they would have to share the road with motor vehicles. This heightened danger might deter people from cycling altogether, leading to increased traffic congestion, higher air pollution, and more public health issues. In Toronto, 70% of residents use bicycles for everyday trips, such as commuting to work or school.\nOther Negative Impacts:\n- Increased travel times for drivers due to construction and road redesign.\n- A loss of $27 million was invested in the installation of these existing bike lanes.\n- $48 million in additional costs for redesigning and reconstructing roads to create space for motor vehicles.\n- Environmental consequences that hinder the city's ability to achieve its TransformTO target of net-zero emissions by 2040.\n- Public health concerns stemming from increased air pollution and fewer opportunities for active transportation.\nWe must consider the social and economic impacts of this proposal. Lower and middle-income individuals, already struggling with rising living costs, would encounter greater transportation barriers. This goes against efforts to promote equitable transportation access in our city.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider this proposal and prioritize the needs of all residents, especially those who rely on biking as an affordable mode of transport.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nShahbaz\n"

There's a good case to be made that people could ride much more in the future.\nRegardless, my main question is: Is this solving the gridlock problem? adding another lane will add more cars. The VAST MAJORITY of cars have one person in them. doesn't that seem to be a bigger problem?\nWhy not get these millions (!!!) of dollars and invest in finishing the Eglinton RLT for example, or expedite the new subway lines?!?!\nI don't fully support bike lanes in canada because of the weather alone, BUT this whole thing seems like a smoke screen to appeal to a certain type of people, and most of those don't even live downtown!\nLet's have a bigger picture look please, this is a joke. maybe they shouldn't have been installed in the first place, but can we please move forward.

I am writing to state my opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which is unsupported by evidence and ignores data-supported advice from planning experts, environmental advocates, and cycling groups.\nYour Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 will in fact make gridlock worse, will make our streets more dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians and more stressful for drivers, and will greatly harm the environment. According to the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI), in their Statement on Bike Lanes from a Planning Perspective: \u201cAs registered professional planners, OPPI members work to support a variety of mobility options in planning communities. Bike lanes provide people with options, improve public health and safety, support economic activity, foster social interaction and community connectivity, improve air quality and mitigate climate change impacts. The proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices. It is also counter to the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes.\u201d\nAbundant research shows that expanding bike lanes and investing in sustainable infrastructure including a robust public transit system is a much more effective\u2014and equitable\u2014solution to reducing gridlock, improving public health, and cutting emissions. I do not want my tax dollars to be spent on destroying bike lanes that already exist, and I do not support legislation that will make it more difficult for municipalities to add new bike lanes in the future.\n"

        "comment": "Taking out bike lanes is foolish and short-sighted.\nBicycles will still be allowed on the same road.  I rode on Bloor before the bike lanes were installed.  I will ride on Bloor if they are removed.  The difference is that *I* will now be slower and not as safe, because I'll have to go around the cars that are stopped at lights so I can get to the front of the line.\nI'm required to ride as far to the right as is safe.  If I'm not safe with cars passing me in the same lane, then I must move left so that cars cannot pass and I can be safe.  That lane has become a de facto bike lane, but it is not safe.\nThe fact is, that if you are sitting in traffic and angry because you see space in the bike lane, then you should make the obvious choice and get a bike or a scooter.  It's the same as if you were at the bank or supermarket or wherever.  If you are standing in line and see an empty teller, you don't stay where you are and complain about the people in front of you in the line.  You move to the empty line.\nIf you go to europe, few people are driving in the big cities, because they have mostly figured out that it's cars that cause congestion, not subways and cyclists and pedestrians.  Drivers are mostly delivery vehicles and taxis.  Commuters take trains, subways, cycle, etc.\n"
