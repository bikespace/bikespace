        "comment": "Since the installation of the Bloor and College St bike lanes, I have for the first time in my entire life as Toronto citizen (25 years), felt safe enough to use my bike to get to and from work. I spent 6 months of 2024 cycling to work, it was faster than the TTC, not to mention the enormous boost to my physical and mental health.  I even bought a bike chariot this year to take my young daughter around because separated bike lanes felt safe for us to be in.  Whenever we are in a separated lane, I feel confident.  The second I have to enter mixed traffic or even a \"sharrow\" that isn't on a residential street, I am regularly too close to moving vehicles and that's just not acceptable for me to take that risk for both myself and my daughter.\nI am also a driver, I own a car and I use Bloor St. regularly to run errands or visit family.  Since the installation of the Bloor bike lanes, traffic has actually IMPROVED for me as a driver.  Bikes are safely in their own space instead of weaving in and out of traffic or squeezing between a live lane and parked cars.  The idea that bike lanes have made things worse on bloor is flat our incorrect.\nThis government needs to understand that cycling does not create gridlock, it gives people an alternative option to get around.  Many trips this year I used to make by car I now make by bike because there are new bike lanes.\nDo not rip out bike lanes, or prevent the installation of new bike lanes.  Leave Toronto transportation planning to TORONTONIANS.\n"

By removing bike lanes traffic will increase due to least transit diversity and biking will become incredibly unsafe for millions of commuters.  Paying the tolls foe truck drivers on the 407 and increasing the go train, bus, and bike infrastructure instead would reduce the need for driving infrastructure changes as the redistribution of road users would take stress off of major intersection and roads like King, Spadina, and the Garnier Express.  Please do not remove bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed policy, as written, would be ineffective, regressive, and dangerous to the thousands of cyclists who choose to bicycle on municipal streets. The idea that cyclists can simply use 'side streets' to get to their destination is misguided. In areas where side streets connect with major routes, such as Shaw or Palmerston in Toronto's west end, and prioritize cycling through the use of one-way roads, side streets can be a boon. However, in the case of Bloor street there are no side street alternatives allowing cyclists to traverse east or west across Toronto. There are limited crossings for cyclists along the Humber River, save for Bloor, Old Mill, and Dundas (2 of which being major streets, 1 involving multiple hills and connecting with another major route at the end); furthermore, without traffic calming or the development of one-ways to build out bikeways, these side streets would not be attractive cycling routes. Finally, the removal of bike lanes and resurfacing of the streets would be a tremendous amount of wasted taxpayer money and would contribute to worsening traffic during this period.\n"

Eliminating bike lanes will not improve traffic and it is a complete waste of money to remove newly installed bike lanes (for example, on University Ave. in Toronto) only to have to reinstall them later down the line, after watching people die and seeing traffic get worse.\nYou should be embarrassed for putting forward this proposal - it's dangerous, backwards and goes against common sense.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill is not only a step backward but reflects a deep misunderstanding of effective urban traffic management. By restricting municipal decision-making authority over bike lanes, the bill undermines local governance and dismisses the clear evidence that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock in cities. Research shows that well-planned bike lanes encourage cycling, thus removing cars from the road and alleviating traffic congestion. In fact, cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have demonstrated that bike lanes can seamlessly integrate into city infrastructure, reducing travel times and easing pressure on urban roads.\nMoreover, this bill disregards the concept of induced demand\u2014a well-documented phenomenon in transportation planning. Induced demand occurs when new roads and highways attract more car users over time, eventually bringing traffic congestion back to its previous levels or even worsening it. Expanding highways, as this bill prioritizes, has been shown repeatedly to offer only short-term relief from congestion, as drivers adjust their behavior, and the added capacity fills up with new traffic.\nIn essence, the bill's reliance on traditional highway expansion fails to consider sustainable, long-term solutions. Municipalities are best positioned to understand and address their unique traffic challenges. They should retain the autonomy to implement measures like bike lanes that have been proven to decrease gridlock and create more livable cities.\n"

Some of us would stop biking, some would bike despite the obvious increase in risk, but all of us would mourn - and rage about - this backwards slide in our city.\nAlso, and this should be obvious - if we're not biking we're driving, and if we're driving there's more traffic.\nEven my young conservative friends hate this.

        "comment": "This policy proposal is not well thought out. I think it can be argued that a municipality knows its community and its community\u2019s needs better than the provincial government, therefore giving them the necessary information to develop bike lanes as needed. If we want to reduce gridlock and get people where they need to go, we need to invest in public transportation, not make room for more cars. Safe and accessible bikes lanes encourage people to opt for alternative modes of transportation, which naturally reduces the amount of cars on the road. I never bike because I don\u2019t feel safe biking on main roads without proper bike lane infrastructure. The amount of bikers that get hit because of this is a major problem. Safety, environmental impacts, and accessibility are all factors that need to be considered when implementing bike lanes, but limiting the municipal governments power to build bike lanes is a poor policy that needs to seriously be reconsidered.\n"

This is meddling in the affairs of municipalities without having boots on the ground and the proper reach and expertise to handle this matter. This will create unnecessary bureaucratic burden and a waste of tax dollars. Also, the way it is handled top-down and frankly with force, it goes against the principles of our democracy. This matter should be left for the city councils and the municipalities to discuss and decide.\n"

Municipal governments are better equipped to understand the needs of their citizens and streets; this decision should be theirs alone to make - like all other municipal road decisions.\nI consistently use the bike lanes on major thoroughfares in Toronto. They are my primary way of getting around. I have felt safer getting around the city with these bike lanes installed and have spoken to many others who feel the same. City streets are a method for everyone to get around and cycling should be encouraged and protected. Streets are for more than just cars. Removing protected, separated cycling lanes will result in the death of more cyclists - deaths attributable directly to this decision.\nMaking it easier to drive through this city by adding traffic lanes result in induced demand and make traffic issues worse in the future. As more arterial roads and highways are expanded. More cars will be funnelled into cities like Toronto, further exacerbating gridlock, parking issues and commute times after an innitial decrease.\nActive transportation, commuting and public transit should be prioritized and celebrated for reducing congestion, emissions, and opportunities for road fatalities. This piece of legislation runs contrary to these public goods and is the wrong move.\n"

They are good for the environment, and are much cheaper than adding transit or car lanes. But most importantly they are a municipal decision.

        "comment": "I think this Bill 212 does the exact opposite of what it's intended to do. If we are trying to stop gridlock in the city we need less cars in the city. Safe bike lanes have immensely helped getting people out of their cars and using other modes of transportation. Biking infrastructure has been a fast and low cost way to do that. The over step of the province wanting to dictate what the residence of Toronto need and want so people in the GTA can drive around the city with ease is an abuse of power. The city isn't built for the large population of cars on the road and no bike lane removal is going to help that. We should prioritize the bikers and pedestrians safety not prioritizing people in cars to get to their destination faster. The Ontario government should focusing on improving and developing our public transit at a faster rate!\n"

        "comment": "This new legislation is, on so many levels, counterintuitive. Communities in Ontario and across Canada have been moving ever so slowly to move away from the prioritization of the motor vehicle by enhancing access to alternate methods of safe, viable and green transportation. I have been cycling in Toronto for 30 plus years as a commuter and my rides to and from work have become much safer and over that period of time  the number of cyclists (and other non vehicular methods of transit) have risen dramatically. If the goal is to make Toronto a world class city we need to keep up with the great cities around the world that continue to develop infrastructure that is not centered around the motor vehicle.\nPerhaps a plan based on the real needs of the community in the long term instead of a plan based on perceived political short term gains makes the most sense.\n"

Not to somebody who does not live in, visit regularly, or has never even been to a particular city or town.\nFor every cyclist that the provincial government intimidates into not cycling, not only is not one less car on the road, it is also one more car on the road.\nCyclists have the right to choose this mode transportation just as much as the driver vehicle has a right to choose a motor vehicle for transportation.\nFor a person to choose cycling as their main mode of transportation, whether it be for environmental reasons, health reasons, financial restrictions, or whatever other reason, cyclists do not deserve to die by being forced onto roadways with 2+ ton death machines when protected infrastructure can allow them to reach their required destinations safely.\nCyclists are people too. They have husbands. They have wives. They have sons. They have daughters. They are somebody\u2019s child.\nThe bicycle infrastructure of a city should be left up to the municipality. I don\u2019t have a right to tell Kitchener what to do with their bicycle lanes when I live in London. Doug Ford has no business telling my city how to best accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users, and motor vehicle drivers.\nThe provisional government should be encouraging municipalities in whatever way it can to build environmentally friendly and safe infrastructure for all people to travel.\nEliminating bicycle lanes will not eliminate traffic congestion. It will cause more traffic. It will result in induced demand.\nI highly encourage this legislation to be turned down. This is embarrassing legislation to submit from Ontario to the rest of the world. Even more so than building a tunnel under the 401.\nThe provincial government should be embarrassed by even tabling such legislation.\nDon\u2019t destroy the little infrastructure that cyclists have to keep themselves safe while they transit to their destination, while saving money, improving health, and helping to save the environment.\nAgain, I strongly believe that the design infrastructure should be left up to the municipalities and not some distant bureaucracy.\n"
