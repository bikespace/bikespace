Bike lanes on the main arteries have changed my life, and make biking in this city far safer. Over the years, many of my patients have been in bicycle accidents with cars, and these could have been prevented with bicycle lanes at the time. Do the right thing and embrace the future!\n"

        "comment": "This is a horrible over-reach of government, and a policy that is in exact opposition to reducing traffic times. More roads do not reduce traffic, they merely result in more traffic caused by induced demand. The idea of allowing a provincial government to override the road plans of the local governments is ridiculous and I hope it will be used against them in future elections.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to urge the government, in the strongest terms possible, to either withdraw Bill 212, or to amend it so it prioritizes actions that will truly reduce congestion, such as improving transit and adding MORE cycling lanes to encourage fewer people to use cars.\nThe bill proceeds from a false assumption that cycling lanes have cause the congestion that currently plagues Toronto and other cities in the province. In my own neighborhood or Beaches East York, a recently installed bike lane was found to add, at most, a minute to travel times in the neighborhood. Additionally, the bike lanes have proven popular with locals.\nPersonally, I truly appreciate the bike lanes as a way of keeping my family safe. We are a family of cyclists, and before the installation of the Danforth bike lanes, biking on the Danforth was an extremely dangerous proposition. Knowing that my family can use the bike lanes gives me enormous peace of mind.\nBike lanes are also a way of siphoning more cars off the road. My husband works in downtown Toronto, and in all but a few months of the year he bikes to work. He finds biking not only faster than transit, but much faster than driving.\nThe government is also acting with inaccurate information. The Premier has stated that only 1% of people commute to work using a bike, but has used old and inaccurate statistics. As the article I linked to below shows, in neighborhoods with good biking infrastructure, between 7% and 16% of people commute using bikes. Getting that many people out of cars doesn't make traffic worse; it drastically improves it.\nI also strenuously object to the provincial government overturning decisions made by our democratically elected local representatives who have a far more nuanced view of the needs of the city.\nAnd finally, from a strictly financial perspective, I find it obscene that the provincial government is willing to spend an estimated $48 million dollars to rip out infrastructure that already cost tens of millions of dollars to install. It is an incredibly wasteful use of taxpayers' money from a government that claims to abhor waste.\nI hope you will either kill this bill, or revises it to take action that will truly help traffic congestion and encourage cycling in our city, improve transit, and discourage more cars from using our already crowded street.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply opposed to several elements of this bill.  I don't see why the province should have any involvement in bike lanes when it can be determined by each municipality for their separate needs. I also do not support any legislation that makes it easier for the province to expropriate land, especially given how poorly the Wilmot land expropriation has been handled.  I live in Kitchener South Hespeler and we have been made very aware of how easily the government can decide they can come and take what they want with little to no public input, and how difficult it has been for the community to have a voice.\n"

        "comment": "This policy will increase traffic not decrease it, as the cyclists who use the bike lane will not disappear, they will simply take up a whole lane of traffic now, as cars are required to give them 1 metre of space to pass.\nThis law will also hurt business, as cyclists are proven to stop and shop more than cars.\nLet Toronto decide how to arrange its own streets, don\u2019t dictate this nonsense from the provincial level. Stay in your own lane, and don\u2019t take away my (bike) lane.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which poses a significant threat to the progress being made toward creating vibrant, sustainable, and accessible public spaces in cities and towns across Ontario.\nOntarians overwhelmingly support initiatives that make our communities safer, greener, and more connected. Projects like cycling networks and complete streets are essential for reducing traffic congestion, achieving net-zero emissions, and providing alternatives to car dependency. These initiatives contribute to healthier, more livable communities and align with the values of a forward-thinking province.\nBill 212 risks undermining these efforts by empowering a small minority of voices to block transformative projects. In Toronto, this legislation could derail the expansion of our cycling network, which has already demonstrated its value in reducing emissions, improving safety, and fostering community connection. In other parts of Ontario, where communities are just beginning to realize the benefits of complete streets, the bill threatens to halt progress indefinitely.\nThis legislation is a step backward at a time when we need bold, inclusive action to build a greener and more equitable future. I urge you to prioritize the needs of all Ontarians by rejecting Bill 212 and supporting initiatives that promote vibrant, multimodal communities.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver in Toronto the biggest impediment to driving in the city is illegal parking and construction, not bike lanes, plus a serious lack of transit.  If bike lanes were removed they would simply be replaced by parked cars which wouldn't solve the problem.  I'm seeing a lot of bikers using these lanes and more will come as they are established, reducing the number of cars on the road.  They also seem to  work as giant traffic calmers, so surprisingly protect pedestrians as well.  I am in favour of leaving the bike lanes in place and putting that money towards transit so that I can leave my car at home.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bicycle lanes from downtown Toronto would be a misguided decision that could negatively impact safety, mobility, and economic vitality in the city. The following outlines key reasons why maintaining and expanding bicycle infrastructure is crucial for Toronto's economic development and reducing road user injuries and deaths.\nSafety Improvements:\nOne of the primary benefits of bicycle lanes is enhanced safety for all road users. Research consistently shows that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collision rates and injuries:\n- A study published in the Journal of the American Planning Association found that after implementing separated bike lanes on Bloor Street in Toronto, cycling collisions decreased by 38% on the street itself and by 35% in surrounding areas, despite a 2.57 times increase in cyclist volume[1][2].\n- Data from the City of Toronto reveals that on Bloor Street, cycling injuries dropped by 56% after bike lane installation, while pedestrian injuries decreased from 13 to 5 per year and motorist injuries reduced from 29 to 21 per year[5].\n- Similar safety improvements have been observed in other cities. In New York City, the installation of cycle tracks decreased injuries to cyclists and pedestrians by 57% and 29% respectively[4].\nIncreased Cycling Adoption:\nBicycle lanes encourage more people to cycle, which can help alleviate traffic congestion by reducing the number of vehicles on the road:\n- After installing bike lanes on Bloor Street, cycling volume increased by over 40%.\n- The minister's assertion that only 1.2% of trips in Toronto are made by bicycle is false. According to provincial data, nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility vehicle.\n- Bike Share Toronto statistics show annual ridership increased from 665,000 trips in 2015 to 5.7 million trips in 2023, demonstrating growing demand for cycling infrastructure.\nEconomic Benefits:\nContrary to concerns about negative impacts on businesses, research indicates that bicycle lanes can have positive economic effects:\n- A study on Toronto's Bloor Street bike lanes found that local businesses reported getting more customers after the lanes were installed.\n- Research by the Clean Air Partnership revealed that in the Bloor Annex neighbourhood, patrons arriving by foot and bicycle visit most often and spend the most money per month.\n- Only 10% of patrons drive to the Bloor Annex area, suggesting that removing parking for bike lanes would have minimal impact on most customers.\nMinimal Impact on Vehicle Traffic:\nWhile there are concerns about increased congestion due to bike lanes, evidence suggests the impact on vehicle traffic is limited:\n- A simulation study published in the journal Sustainability found that implementing dedicated safe cycling lanes had no significant impact on average travel times for cars.\n- Any perceived increases in travel times may be due to other factors such as population growth, the post COVID rebound and increased vehicle ownership, rather than bike lanes themselves.\nPublic Support and Demand:\nThere is significant public support for improved cycling infrastructure in Toronto:\n- Over 70% of Torontonians, including both cyclists and non-cyclists, reported that separating bike lanes from traffic would most improve cycling in the city.\nLogistic issues with the proposed removal of bike lanes:\n- For bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, there are no feasible parallel alternate routes that wouldn\u2019t also result in the conversion of motor vehicle lanes.\n- The estimated financial impact is $48 million in additional costs to provincial taxpayers for the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge. This is money that could be better spent on fixing health care or improving transit.\nMultiple organisations opposing the proposed legislation:\n-  Mayor Olivia Chow and Toronto City Council have formally expressed their opposition to Bill 212. The province should withdraw the proposed amendments and work collaboratively with cities to address congestion and road safety.\n- the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council all oppose Bill 212.\nConclusion:\nRemoving bicycle lanes from downtown Toronto would be a step backward in terms of safety, mobility, and sustainable urban development. The evidence strongly supports maintaining and expanding cycling infrastructure to create a more efficient, safe, and vibrant city for all residents.\n"

Bike lanes reduce carbon emissions and enable people to get the recommended amount of cardiovascular exercise. Getting rid of the bike lanes is a huge disservice to the people of Toronto, especially those that use those bike lanes, endangering theirs and pedestrian safety.\nFord will do well to remember that he is not the mayor of Toronto; he is Premier of Ontario. This vindictive behaviour should stop\n"

The bike lanes are critical to the health of this city and people use them! A lot of people rely on them.\nPeople downtown are sick of suburban drivers dictating policy that impacts us more than them. Why should drivers control our transit infrastructure? If anything Toronto should be investing more in the TTC and other forms of public transit.\nDriving is NEVER going to be the transit mode that meets the needs of this city\u2019s growing population. Adding more lanes downtown is futile and backwards. Don\u2019t get rid of the bike lanes. Spend money doing something better, like adding another subway line (on top of the new one - good job on that!)\n"
