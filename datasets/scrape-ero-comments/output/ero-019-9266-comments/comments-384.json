        "comment": "This proposal is shocking for a number of reasons, including (i) it increases \u201cred tape\u201d around constructing bike lanes, which is something this government claimed to be trying to reduce (ii) it takes away the ability for municipalities to plan their own transportation infrastructure, which is illogical since municipalities would know their needs best (iii) it goes against the will of voters in municipal elections by taking power away from municipal councils (iv) it is inconsistent with the goal of improving traffic, since bike lanes are shown to have positive impacts in most cases (v) it does not employ evidence based decision making principles (vi) it will result in unsafe conditions for cyclists and people will die (vii) it will be bad for businesses since research shows that bike lanes are good for business and merchants usually support them after they see the results. This proposal needs to be eliminated. It is very bad for the province. It has already started a culture war where drivers are becoming increasingly belligerent with cyclists. Mark my words, people are going to be killed as a result of this legislation, if it passes.\n"

        "comment": "It's shameful to ignore all the consultations and analytics that the city of Toronto has to support the three bike lanes being arbitrarily removed. It is easy to see that these pieces of infrastructure keep lots of people much safer and do not contribute to congestion - if anything they allow it to be lessened by providing spaces which more people will find comfortable to cycle in. Reverting to side streets is not helpful because as the map shows, there aren't any comparable city side streets which allow the same through travel that these roads do, and there isn't any policy writing in this document that allows it to be easier to add lanes to them either.\nAs a 25 year old Ontarian and City of Toronto resident born and raised, I often rely on these bike lanes in my day to day life to get to and from work and other destinations. I also am a driver and have been since my 16th birthday, an anomaly in this city. I was on these roads using both modes as these lanes were installed, and I witnessed first hand that they make the traffic flow and safety better for everyone, especially as often the other car lane was just on street parking (which is still retained in the current design). The cost of living crisis is squeezing people like me and this government trying to take bike lanes away with no factual basis is appalling - they are a free, fast and reliable way to get around Toronto. Stay out of my lane, out of my city's decision making process and let me and the thousands of others who use these lanes daily get to where we need to go safely. And while you're at it, maybe encourage other drivers with the means to do so to... then you may see some actual congestion go away.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's proposed legislation, which includes the removal of critical bike lanes in Toronto and the approval process for new bike lanes across the province.\nThis proposal is not only short-sighted but also a significant waste of taxpayer dollars. Tearing out already constructed bike lanes is a costly and inefficient use of resources. These bike lanes have proven to be effective in reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and promoting active transportation.\nFurthermore, the province's focus on removing bike lanes while simultaneously pursuing costly and environmentally destructive projects like Highway 413 is deeply concerning. Highway 413 is a massive infrastructure project with a projected cost of billions of dollars, and its benefits are questionable, especially considering the minimal impact it will have on overall traffic congestion, particularly outside of peak hours.\nI urge you to strongly oppose this legislation and prioritize sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective transportation solutions. Investing in public transit, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly urban design will yield long-term benefits for our communities.\nI implore you to reject this harmful legislation and instead focus on policies that support sustainable, equitable, and climate-friendly transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "Overall, I think this bill is at best unproductive and here\u2019s why:\n1: six people have died in Toronto alone while cycling this year and that\u2019s with the cycling lanes. I feel uncomfortable with the idea that my government is ignoring the fact that choosing to get rid of bike lanes to save time for drivers is fundamentally going to be at the expense of the lives of multiple cyclists. That is a problem to me.\n2: This is (fiscally speaking) incredibly irresponsible on the part of the government. I noticed the bill includes in its provisions a mechanism to remove bike lanes on various streets. The issue I have with this is that most of those lanes were just added and removing them would be a massive waste of my tax dollars. I would vastly prefer if this money was put into making living in this already incredibly expensive province easier, rather than removing bike lanes we just spent millions of dollars installing and / or improving. Considering that this is an administration that prides itself on austerity, I find this a baffling decision.\n3: I think this Bill is incredibly focused on one type of person, while ignoring many others. It is clear that people who live in Toronto\u2019s suburbs want the bike lanes removed, and they are absolutely entitled to that opinion, but that is an issue when the people who actually surround the bike lanes and live near them want them there. I think that generally speaking, the people whose streets the bike lanes are on should get to decide whether there are bike lanes or not. The fact this is being taken out of their hands is incredibly troubling to me and feels like a very slippery slope.\nIt is for these reasons that I wholeheartedly hope this bill does not advance further, and is scrapped so as to take  these points into account.\nThank you for reading my input.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI use bike lanes almost every day, and it has reduced my travel time significantly.  It's faster than both taking the subway, and driving. When I do drive, I appreciate that cyclists are in their own lanes and not cycling close to my vehicle in my blind spot. I feel anxious driving on roads where cyclists also ride without bike lanes. Removing bike lanes won't remove the cyclists, but they will make it more dangerous for cyclists and drivers.\nBike lanes have also increased business on streets with bike lanes. People biking past a store are far more likely to stop in and shop than people in cars. There are amply studies that show this.\nKeep our bike lanes, and build more bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "First of all, I am a driver in an urban area. The key to reduction in traffic is to allow people choices in how to travel and commute. Every person who chooses to bike, walk, or take transit, is one fewer car on the road. Cars take up a lot of space on the roads, so when someone switches to another travel option, it is a win for everyone. This is the only reliable way to reduce traffic, building more lanes we know does not work.\nUnfortunately, the proposed Bill 212 seeks to greatily limit the freedom for citizens to choose how they wish to travel and commute. Riding a bike on car-only busy streets is very dangerous, so people won't do it. This is what puts everyone in cars and causes increased gridlock.\nThis bill is a backwards step carrying on the poor thinking that caused gridlock in the first place. The cities (and citizens who live in those cities) are the best judges of how to create travel options to reduce traffic. A provincial regulatory overseer just creates more bureaucracy and wastes huge amounts of money. Let the people of our cities manage this issue. A conservative government should not be promoting unneccesary red-tape.\n"

I drive and don\u2019t like congestion or traffic either. But I recognize that we need a variety of options for commuting, and the bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge are good overall for everyone, including those who travel from Pickering or Mississauga. That\u2019s because for every biker, it\u2019s one less car that\u2019s on the road. The three streets that are being targeted have bike lanes because of years of planning and investment. Let\u2019s not waste money and time on this: instead we can use the money in better ways. Thank you for allowing me to comment.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the Addendum posted on October 31 2024 stating that\n\"The Ontario government is proposing an addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles.\"\nThe proposal contained in this addendum is not supported by any hard data or evidence that has been posted in the public domain by the Government of Ontario.  I have driven down Bloor and Yonge Streets before and after the bike lane implementation and have experienced no noticeable impact on driving times following the introduction of bike lanes.   It is noteworthy that the Government of Ontario has not released any of the data they purport to have to show a detrimental impact of bike lanes.  In the absence of these data this Addendum suggests unilateral Provincial overreach rather than a data based decision.\nIn fact, this addendum flies in the face of evidence collected by the City of Toronto as well as the Bloor Street BIA who warn that \"removal of bike lanes would be disastrous\" to the surrounding community. If anything installation of the bike lanes have made driving easier due to the lower speed and generally more consistent flow of traffic on both Bloor and Yonge rather than having to deal with traffic merging in both directions.\nI fully support the Mayor of Toronto's stance against this unilateral, short-sighted and car-centric removal of bike lanes on these streets and am wholly against Bill 212 and its associated Addendum.\n"

Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure for the elderly and children. The unable to drive elderly use their electric scooters to buy groceries. Children use them to go to school and as a shared path to sites of interest such as parks, malls, and mom-and-pop businesses. It also teaches the young road awareness with a low risk and low cost for when they become drivers. Cyclist sharing their space with cars represent an increased risk for themselves. Cyclist involvement in car accidents will contribute to insurance premiums increase and strain the healthcare and welfare systems.\n"

The most disturbing thing about this policy though is that it will definitely cost lives. Cyclists will be killed by motor vehicles directly as a result of removing existing bike lines and making it harder to build new ones. For nothing, since removing cycling infrastructure just forces more people to drive. Why are cyclists so much less important than drivers that we would endanger their lives in the name of trying to save drivers a few seconds on their commute?\n"

I currently live in Oakville Ontario where there are few bike lanes, and where they do exist, they are clearly designed to favour car traffic, making them next to useless. This bill is incredibly short sighted and so obviously politically motivated. We need more, safer and better connected bike infrastructure, especially in Toronto, a city I love and was a resident of for 10 years.\nThe more you build out bike lanes and public transit, the easier it is to get around with these modes of transit to more people will opt to use it, the less cars there will be on the road and the smoother and fast the traffic. It's just common sense.\nI ask you to reconsider this regressive bill.\nThank you.\n"

The section of Yonge street I live on is approved to have 1 lane of traffic in each direction removed to be replaced with bike lanes some time in 2029. Removing existing, or preventing future bike lanes anywhere, under the guise of improving congestion is completely disconnected from any relevant data from the past ~30 years. Municipalities worldwide have seen the traffic improving capability of bike lanes; the only viable way to reduce car traffic is to build viable alternatives to driving. I eagerly await the construction of bike lanes along north Yonge street, despite driving to work every day.\nPassing this legislation is a massive overstep of the provincial government, and a complete waste of tax payer dollars. There are much more pressing issues that impact our province that need to be addressed, instead of wasting time on pathetic efforts such as this. I would be embarrassed to have proposed or to support this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is dangerous and reckless for all road users. It is also not an effective long term plan to deal with growing population and density, and car traffic. (Listen to the traffic reports - the slowdowns are usually not in areas with bike lanes!)\nAs someone who uses roads in Toronto in both car and bike, I find the causes for gridlock are:\n- construction - including major multi-year blockages for the subway lines - which block roads, bike lanes and divert traffic to other arteries\n- cars or trucks sitting in curb lanes and/or bike lanes, blocking traffic at all hours\n- an increasing number of cars on the road from higher densities\n- issues with transit mean fewer people want to use transit\nAn effective solution requires a multi-pronged approach which focusses on increasing transit options, and reducing the number of cars on the road. Building or encouraging more infrastructure will only increase the number of cars an exacerbate the existing issues.\nAs well, it's unfathomable that with the increasing number of injuries and deaths on the road, that this proposal has been put forward.\nA growing  number of people are on the road on bikes, scooters and other small vehicles for many reasons, including financial reasons and not many transport options - and regardless, increasing non-car traffic is a positive thing in our cities.  Forcing them onto the road with cars poses a danger for all: those who will be injured/killed through having to share the road, and those who cause the injuries and will bear longterm psychological impacts.\nEveryone on the road needs to be protected - yet this legislation prioritizes saving a couple minutes off a commute over public and personal safety.\n"
