        "comment": "As a resident of downtown Toronto, a driver, cyclist and pedestrian I am deeply deeply concerned about the removal of bike lanes, at the cost of the taxpayer, with no evidence that it will improve gridlock and traffic in this city. As a citizen of Toronto I have been impacted by the construction of these projects for years, and to see projects like the College Street and University Avenue bike lanes barely be completed before they are ripped up is baffling and a total waste of resources.\nBeyond that, the risk to human life is so high without bike lanes, in a year where 30 cyclists and pedestrians have been killed in the city of Toronto and 151 seriously injured. There are already too many intersections in this city where friends and family live where I have to call them when news of an accident come across my news feed. I do not want to have more areas added to that list, I do not want to be terrified that my wife who cycles to work will not be safe, and I do not want her to have the concern to me.\nThe total disregard for the residents of Toronto that this bill has is deeply distressing when the province has so far refused to engage with actual proven methods of reducing traffic (ie congestion charges, investing further in transit, supporting traffic enforcement by the city.) With no evidence, and strong opposition, who is this bill for? When will this province commit to evidence proven, safe, world class and future thinking solutions to our infrastructure?\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on major corridors and restricting alternative transit options would be a step backward for sustainable, accessible transportation in our community. Bike lanes are critical for encouraging safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly travel choices. They offer an alternative to car trips, reducing congestion and emissions, and are essential in supporting those who rely on cycling for daily commutes or as a preferred transit option.\nEliminating bike lanes could discourage cycling and lead to increased vehicle traffic, further straining roadways and contributing to air pollution and noise in neighborhoods. Moreover, bike lanes play an important role in enhancing road safety for all users by providing clear, dedicated spaces for cyclists, which reduces the likelihood of accidents.\nAlternative transit options are equally crucial, as they provide accessible choices for those who may not have a car or prefer not to rely on one. Limiting these options could make it harder for residents to connect with public transit, access key destinations, and adopt healthier, lower-carbon lifestyles.\nSustaining and expanding bike lanes and alternative transit pathways aligns with goals for a more livable, resilient city. By supporting a diverse range of transportation modes, we can ensure a safer, more efficient, and more inclusive transportation network that benefits everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is outrageous. Municipalities who are rightly trying to balance the needs of all of their citizens AND mitigate and adapt to the climate and biodiversity crises we are facing should be ENCOURAGED to develop solutions including the preservation and addition of bike lanes to promote bike travel, healthy lifestyles, and reduced cars on the road. All levels of governments need to LEAD in this effort to transform our communities, rather than hinder.\nThe fact that this is a request for consultation coming from the Environmental Registry is even more bizarre to me - you all know the facts, the reality, and the challenges, if you are working in this field. I appreciate that you are asking for our opinion, and because of all the mis and dis information, the average citizen is ill-informed on these matters, and so the consultation will probably not be as helpful as it might otherwise be.\nIf you need an expert perspective, this renowned Earth Scientist has a TedTalk from July 2024 I would suggest you include in the consultation process.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this bill is a massive overreach of provincial jurisdiction. Doug Ford and the provincial government should be far more concerned about building housing (don\u2019t think that we didn\u2019t see that the provincial government missed its target of 1.5M homes built), fixing the healthcare system instead of crippling it, and on actually improving infrastructure for rural and northern communities. Instead of antagonizing a city that desperately needs actual evidence based ways to improve congestion \u2014 which time and time again research has shown is improving bicycle infrastructure and more robust public transit options.\nBike lanes are not only better for traffic by providing people with alternate modes of transportation, they also take cyclists out of dangerous situations. This will just put more people in harms way. We cannot have a thriving, vibrant city if we do not move away from being so car centric.\nFinally, the most confounding part of this legislation is that the conservative government is proposing using additional taxpayer dollars to remove infrastructure that we have already paid for to put in. University Ave\u2019s bike lanes were literally just completed and now we are talking about taking them out? That is such a massive waste of taxpayer money and it is setting us back as a city. As a taxpayer living in Toronto, I am incredibly upset by this. We cannot have local infrastructure and city planning policies interfered by MPs who don\u2019t even live within the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycles are traffic.\nIn making a cycle lane one does not remove a traffic lane. Instead one makes a safe lane for a good type of traffic.\nCycle lanes do not waste time.\nIn our busy city, time is important: to pedestrians, cyclists, car-drivers. We all need to get around efficiently. By separating pedestrian, cycle and car traffic in separated lanes, one allows all three forms of traffic to move efficiently at their different paces.\nCycle lanes do not cause gridlock.\nCars cause gridlock. Even when driven according to the rules, cars take up space and cause jams. When the rules are not followed, they do worse. As an example that I see every day, when cars block intersections, they immediately back traffic up in all directions producing instant gridlock.\nI have cycled on Bloor, University, and Yonge since moving to Toronto in 2003. With four children and no car, cycling safety was always a concern, even for the most basic things such as getting to work/school, or getting groceries. We had several accidents involving car drivers failing to give space or check before opening car doors. But thankfully the long-term consequences were no worse than a raised anxiety level.\nThe bike lanes have transformed my life as an individual cyclist. I no longer panic-sweat my way around, repeatedly wobbling into the flow of moving cars as I pass parked ones, wondering all the time if drivers can see me, and aware of driver irritation as I slow them down. Instead, by and large, I feel seen and safe.\nMore importantly, beyond me as an individual, the bike lanes have transformed our city. Cyclist numbers have mushroomed from the few brave souls of 2003 to a stream of confident riders. You see many more families and elders using the cycle ways. And delivery services benefit enormously from the speed and relative safety with which cyclists can get around. The bike share program has proved an excellent way to make cycling more convenient and affordable for occasional users. All this has been made possible by cycle ways that allow cyclists to be seen, protected, and safer.\nBicycles should be given space in our busy city. They are efficient, non-polluting, quiet, compact, affordable, and relatively unlikely to harm someone in an accident.\nWhile acknowledging that we still need car traffic lanes, I hold that we should not only keep our current cycle traffic lanes, but add to them. In an ideal world, they would be as normal as car and pedestrian lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an awful idea.  I'm a driver and bike lanes make it easier for me to understand where bikers are so they don't pop out of nowhere.  I live in North York where there is basically no biking infrastructure and bikers end up on the sidewalks where they are a danger to pedestrians.  There should just be a dedicated space for bikes, cars and pedestrians to make everyone's lives easier.  I'd also personally find it much easier to visit stores and restaurants that are too far to walk if I could bike there and not have to deal with driving and parking.\n"

        "comment": "I am a father, a worker, a Toronto resident, a driver and a cyclist. And I am enraged by this poorly thought out and callous law that aims to stifle new bike lanes in Toronto and even rip out ones recently installed. This bill is wasteful, lacking in data and logic, it will put myself, my child and my friends and fellow residents at further risk by removing and preventing the installation of safe bike lanes to help us get around the city. The data are clear: congestion is a problem, but bikes are part of the solution. Every person on a bike is one less person in a car. Cyclists frequent businesses, spend money, and are just as much as part of the community and the economy as someone in a car, while producing less pollution and creating must less danger on the roads for others compared to cars. I urge this government and every voting MPP to reconsider this vindictive and foolhardy law that seems aimed and stoking division, punishing Toronto and will likely lead to deaths on the roads, which will be squarely on your hands.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation requiring Ministry approval for bicycle lanes, particularly where motor vehicle travel lanes are affected, raises important considerations regarding local autonomy, public safety, and sustainable transportation.\nImpact on Local Autonomy:\nMunicipalities generally have the most direct knowledge of local transportation needs and community priorities. This proposal could add layers of bureaucracy that may hinder timely implementation of bicycle infrastructure. Empowering municipalities to make these decisions locally, in line with provincial safety standards, could better address unique local contexts.\nSafety and Sustainable Mobility:\nThe Ministry\u2019s mandate to review whether a bike lane would \u201cunduly diminish\u201d motor vehicle traffic flow might inadvertently prioritize vehicle capacity over active transportation. Given Ontario\u2019s goals of promoting sustainable, safe, and inclusive transportation networks, considering bicycle lanes as an essential part of infrastructure that supports public health and reduces congestion may be beneficial. This focus would align with the province\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and encourage active transportation.\nEfficiency and Resources:\nRequiring Ministry approval could potentially delay projects, increasing costs for municipalities and deterring smaller jurisdictions from investing in cycling infrastructure. Additionally, municipalities may need to redirect resources to meet new reporting requirements, which could strain budgets and affect other transportation projects.\nClarity on Standards and Transitional Provisions:\nThe proposed \u201ctransition\u201d provision allowing projects already underway to proceed is a positive step. However, more clarity on the specific criteria the Ministry will use to assess applications and the regulatory processes involved would help municipalities plan accordingly. Establishing clear and measurable criteria for both approval and review of existing lanes would create transparency and consistency in decision-making.\nThis legislation could benefit from a collaborative framework that encourages municipalities to build safe and effective cycling infrastructure while meeting provincial traffic flow goals.\n"

Please provide factual evidence beyond anecdotal stories from disgruntled drivers to support this change.  Is my safety as a multimodal transport user less important?  How does this help us achieve decreased emissions or improved road safety targets?\n"

We now have high particulate matter due to vehicles and gas plants which has made it so on a regular basis our air quality is so poor it significantly exceeds WHO standards. This is causing pre mature death and can contribute to asthma and cognitive issues in children.\nSince you will no doubt move forward with removing bike lanes, please immediately fund a large bidirectional network of bike lanes in the city so cyclists don't have to start using cars.\n"

        "comment": "Given the current government's stated (but unmet) focus on building housing and densification, giving people options for how they move within and through their communities is the only thing that will work to address congestion.  Perhaps the Premier is unaware of how many units have been approved for development over the next decade in Toronto on or near Bloor Street West.  If the bike lanes get ripped up, people will just sit in congestion in two lanes instead of one.\nAmsterdam wasn't always Amsterdam.  Paris wasn't always Paris.  Toronto doesn't have to repeat the mistakes made by so many other urban centres.\nDon't be upset or surprised if traffic doesn't improve meaningfully when you rip up the lanes.  How many cyclists will end up back in cars if you take away their lanes?  How many people not in cars will think \"oh, the roads are open, time to get back into my car and drive\"?  How many cyclists will take the lane as per their rights, slowing traffic down behind them?\nSix cyclists have died in Toronto this year alone.  How many more cyclists will die if they don't have safe infrastructure?  How many lives are you willing to sacrifice because you think it will save time on commutes (it won't)?  Because apparently that answer isn't zero.\nThis is dangerously short-sighted and will not solve the problems that you think it will, but it will certainly cause new problems, and it will make fixing it even harder.\nIf you're going to do the wrong thing and rip up the lanes, what are your plans for compensating the City of Toronto for the installation?  If I buy a car and you tell me I can't have it and you offer to tow it away for free, I'm still out the cost of the car.  You owe them money - pay them.\n"

        "comment": "As both a driver and a biker I am strongly against this proposal. Cars are by far the least efficient form of transportation, and it is insane to be spending more money ripping out existing infrastructure that provides a viable alternative. Moreover, every single street mentioned in this proposal has a subway running underneath it which transports FAR more people per day than any highway every could. We need to incentive people to use the appropriate transportation option, rather than removing alternative options to cars. Whether this be subsidizing subway rides, tolling the roads, improving subway service, keeping bike lanes clear year round.\nAdding more car lanes has been shown time and time again to create induced demand. I have extreme doubts that adding these car lanes would do anything to improve congestion, especially since cars will often stop in the extra lane, creating hundreds of random bottlenecks everywhere on the street. Moreover, removing bike lanes does not remove the bikers. They will continue to use these streets, and now instead cars will be stuck behind them.\nI have personally almost been struck by cars multiple times, both walking and biking around the city. Each of these times has been by a driver speeding around trying to get from point A to B as quickly as possible. Many people die every year from this every year in the city. Adding bike lanes provides safety to some of the most vulnerable road users. Moreover, reducing the number of lanes calms the traffic and makes reckless driving more difficult. As a pedestrian and biker I feel safer having slower moving traffic in the city. As a driver, I feel more calm when people are not speeding in and out of lanes trying to get one car forward.\nI say all this recognizing that cars are still a viable form of transportation and some people rely on them for mobility. The solution is not to serve this one mode of transportation, but to help clear the roads of cars that do not need to be there. I strongly believe that there is an alternative solution that is both cheaper, and moves more people, but we will never find it if we do not explore alternative solutions.\n"
