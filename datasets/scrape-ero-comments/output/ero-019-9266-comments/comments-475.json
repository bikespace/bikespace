        "comment": "I support bike lanes. I am a lifelong resident of Toronto and have been cycling to my work downtown since 2009. Although cycling is possible without bike lanes, the expanded infrastructure has greatly improved safety and decreased the number of negative interactions with drivers.  My observation is that the cycling network is well used and each new addition encourages additional users. I would urge you to visit any of the cycle tracks leading into downtown during the morning rush to see how many cyclists are on the streets. I would expect the government to make decisions first and foremost with safety in mind and then based on evidence. I see neither of these elements in the proposed legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford;\nThis proposal is of significant concern to me. First, it is an intrusion into the powers and responsibilities of municipalities. They are best placed to meet the needs of their citizens in this policy area. And for most of Ontario this legislation is just another example of the Ontario government's focus on Toronto to the exclusion of the rest of the province.\nSecondly, adding more lanes to roads is not the solution to traffic congestion. Many studies have shown that adding more capacity to the road network just increases the number of cars and then the congestion follows, Adding to the capacity of the road network is not going to help - adding more options for people to get around will make a difference.\nAnd thirdly, removing existing bike lanes is costly and is not the best use of government funds. Putting those dollars to improved transit will make a real difference to Ontario taxpayers. A concerted effort to get people out of their cars and into transit that works for them would demonstrate the government's commitment to improving the lives of Ontario taxpayers.\nAnd last but not least, bike lanes protect the cyclists who use the roads. Removing the bike lanes won't remove the cyclists - it will just make them less safe.\nThank you for paying attention to my comments.\n"

        "comment": "The Province has other Provincial matters it should be managing and not be involved in urban planning decisions of municipalities.  This proposed Act illustrates the Provincial Government\u2019s fundamental lack of understanding of what\u2019s actually its purpose and a similar lack of understanding of urban planning, transportation and basic economics.  This Act is completely and utterly flawed.  There is no clear evidence that the Act would achieve anything positive and is a complete waste of time, money and effort that aught to be directed to something useful.  I\u2019m disgusted that my tax dollars are being wasted paying the salaries of staff and elected officials putting together this pointless legislation.  It\u2019s as useless as that silly idea of a tunnel under the 401.  What on earth is going on at Queens Park?  There\u2019s important work to be done and I\u2019m disappointed to see effort being put towards this proposed Act.  The Province needs to still with Provincial matters and stop playing at being a municipal government.  If this Act goes through, you\u2019ll absolutely lose my vote in the next election.\n"

A modern city like Toronto doesn't need more lanes for traffic, we need safe alternatives like decent, reliable transit and a connected network of bike lanes.\nGridlock might be reduced briefly by this retrograde action, but as every study of traffic patterns shows, it will return, worse than before.\nRemoving bike lanes will guarantee more people will be killed or injured on our streets... Especially young people.\nThis Bill should not be enacted.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, cyclist and TTC user I can unequivocally say that my preferred format of getting around the city is on my bike.  And I will ride my bike the majority of the year because the city has made that possible with bike lanes and through the expansion of bike share.\nCiting a stat that only 1.2% of commuters are on a bike is disingenuous.  That is an old stat from 2011: Cycling has exploded in the last few years.\nDisappointed the Premier (1) pits drivers against cyclists (2) never comments on the poor operating track record of the TTC which is beset by delays everyday yet moves millions of residents every week (not to mention the poor record of metrolinks on LRT deliverables- where is his outrage there??)\nHugely disappointed and angry at the overreach into municipal affairs and thought of wasting taxpayer money to rip out existing bike lanes.\nAnd infuriated that the Premier wants to apply a suburban mindset to the city.  Look at the density in this city - cars are NOT the solution to move masses of people.  Fine for suburbs but NOT a city.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes when so many major cities have done the opposite with significantly positive impacts on health and commerce shows profoundly poor judgment. As a former New Yorker, the proliferation of bicycle infrastructure has been spectacular and given me cause to reconsider returning to Toronto which has been far too slow in public space investments. Toronto is playing a dismal game of catch up when compared to other major urban centers, globally, in terms of public transport and quality of life initiatives like the promotion of cycling. Interference by the province like this proposal is disappointing.\n"

So where is the data on bike lanes and congestion.  What has been trotted out so far (1.2% ride bikes) is so wrong that it is laughable.  If I can't trust the data why would I support the bill?  Bike lanes and usage is very local issue.  Mr Ford, stay in your lane!\n"

Ford even cited a statistic from 1991 to justify it, claiming that \"1.2%\" of torontonians bike to work, when todays statistic is actually 10%, with many more cycling for various other purposes. Not to mention the hufe safety risk thisbposes to cyclists.\nAs a cyclist, if the lanes are removed i will be forced to ride in the middle of the car lane for my safety. Will the people driving behind me be happy theres no bike lane?\n"

Cyclists deserve a direct route to work and removing the bike lanes will not stop people from using these streets since they are the most convenient and that\u2019s why bike lanes were added in the first place. This will not reduce gridlock and you know it, what is adding one more lane going to do? The answer is nothing.\nYou will cause more cyclist deaths and make driving more challenging on these major streets cause bikes and cars will have to share and it will be more frustrating for everyone.\nI am a cyclist and a driver and I do not support this!\n"

We need collaboration to solve transportation and climate challenges. More road lanes create more traffic congestion, not less. My son bikes on the Bloor bike path. He cannot afford a car and some days not even transit fare to get to work. I was relieved to hear he had a safer route - but now his health and possibly his life are being placed in jeopardy. I bike, walk, take transit and drive and value all modes. Let's work together to find solutions to keep all of us safe from accidents, air pollution and climate change harms.\n"

Having efficient public transit in and out of the city, ttc and service across Ontario, and safe options for travelling by bike will reduce gridlock and emissions. The province is wasting money going back and forth on these lanes when it should be investing in improving and adding more lanes. I feel that  to switching major streets to one way boulevards, alternating east to west - would be much more efficient and would still leave room for a safe bike lane.\n"
