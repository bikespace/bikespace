This is definitely not something that works for everyone, for example I personally do not want to cycle (I have to travel far for work), but I believe that bike lanes are indeed helpful to reduce congestion in the city and I think it wouldn't make a lot of sense to remove them.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident in downtown Toronto for over a decade, and despite not a cyclist, I find that bike lane in Toronto is good for our community, and for safety of cyclist, pedestrians and drivers. I'm pleased to see the completion of Bloor Street bike lane on Bloor Street, which I had lived for 5 years. It is enormous waste of tax payer's money to rip out this newly completed bike lanes, along with other existing bike lanes in University, and Yonge Street.\nUniversity Avenue is a wide two lane through road with wide \"islands\" of park and monuments in the middle of the road, which people rarely reach. I don't see the reasons that it cannot accommodate two narrow bike lanes by its side.\nForeseeing the future, In 5 to 10 years, full-self driving will be rolling out steadily and computer-driven vehicles will be more efficient and congestion in downtown will get more alleviated. Computer-driven vehicles can readily take into account of bike lanes and maneuver the road effortlessly.  The completion of Ontario Line will also reduce number of cars in downtown.\nAlso, demand to bike in downtown will only surge drastically as the city build a more comprehensive, and safe bike network.\nThe short sight vision to get rid of bike lane is ignoring this future urban trend of more bikes, more autonomous driven cars and expansion of transportation. It will leave us with big regrets to nullify our newly built bike network.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who voted for PC in the previous election, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this Bill.\n1. This adds governmental red tape and additional bureaucracy, which is the last thing we should ever want to see from government.\n2. This is a top-down heavy-handed authoritarian socialist-engineering approach coming from the Provincial legislation to control municipal planning, transportation mobility, and micro-manage municipal and local affairs. I did not elect the PC government to have them govern like the CCP.\n3. Cycling infrastructure provides essential transportation for a whole range of road users for a whole range of travel uses that ultimately increases economic productivity and encourages the return to the office, increased shopping on streets like Bloor, more spend in downtown restaurant establishments, trips to sports games, and enhances the overall vibrancy, vitality, and prosperity of the city.\n4. These cycling lanes creates a basic standard of safety that reduces the opportunity for cyclist-automobile conflicts and encourages a greater number of people to bike without feeling vulnerable and unsafe on city streets. Conversely, removing these lanes will encourage cyclists to become drivers, increasing congestion on downtown streets for the same commuting patterns.\n5. As a driver, it is much better for everyone on the road to not have cyclists clog up car traffic lanes creating undue traffic, interact with automobile traffic with uncertain movements, and to be in the cycling lane where I know they are. Bringing them back to the traffic lanes is a disaster.\n6. Bike lanes support the other transit investments made in the city and personally save me time and money on my commute to work. It currently takes 20 minutes to cycle to work (specifically on the Bloor bike lane) whereas it takes me 40 minutes to drive (plus I must pay for parking downtown) and 45 minutes by public transit on the TTC. When you add up these differences in commuting time and saved costs from not parking and driving, it adds up to a lot more than the $200 cheque we are slated to receive.\n7. Needless to say, but this Bill 212 also contradicts EVERY research study done on the impacts of cycling infrastructure on the built environment, which overwhelmingly demonstrate that cycling infrastructure reduces congestion, enhances safety, and promotes local businesses. We will become a less productive City and Province should this Bill 212 move forward.\nPlease know that this social-engineering red-tape introducing Bill 212 will place the Ontario PC on the wrong side of history on the same side of other disastrous social-engineers of the past century.\n"

        "comment": "I've been riding a bike in downtown Toronto since I moved here 40 years ago. It's been my primary mode of transportation because it is inexpensive, not hurting the environment, often the most efficient way to get around, healthy and fun, but back in 1984 it felt dangerous at times and many car drivers didn't help matters by being considerate or remotely aware of the idea of sharing the road. As time went on the car traffic congestion has gotten worse and worse along with road rage from frustrated drivers. Each time a bike lane appeared I was proud that the city was moving forward as clearly more cars are not a sustainable solution to downtown transportation. I\u2019ve never felt bike lanes slowed down car traffic, but it was the number of cars that created grid lock downtown. I've seen an increase in bikes over the last decade which has corresponded with the ever increasing number of bike lanes that create a safe, enjoyable experience. Food delivery people are some of the worst riders out there, but they certainly rely on having bike lanes to do their job efficiently as so many people now want their take out delivered. Getting rid of bike lanes is the wrong move. It is backwards thinking. We need to encourage people to not drive downtown and take the TTC, bike or walk. Invest more in public transport instead of tearing up bike lanes we've already paid for.\n"

If the goal is to reduce congestion on our streets, then we should be focusing our efforts on improving public transit options, or providing incentives for companies to adopt fully work-from-home business models.\nBike lanes are also significantly safer for cyclists, providing them protection from cars. I've never feared for my safety while in a bike lane. I can't say the same about riding on the street.\nThis bill is only adding more red tape towards building better public infrastructure, which we are desperate to get more of these days.

        "comment": "Traffic exists because of people driving cars. Adding another lane of traffic, another suburban development, another parking lot, etc encourages more people to use cars, creating more traffic, which then results in an eternal feedback loop of rising car dependency leading to more investment in car infrastructure leading to more car dependency, etc. Downtown cores are for density and local and public transportation. Removing/scrapping proposed bike lanes in downtown cores will not \u201creduce time in traffic\u201d because they are inherently dense areas\u2026 you may as well argue to remove buildings, patios, and sidewalks since they are preventing the addition of more lanes for cars downtown. While I understand that car culture is so ubiquitous and ingrained in North America that attempting to overturn it would require tremendous upheaval, the big picture cannot be ignored. If the PCs cared about reducing traffic and commute times, they would invest more in public transportation projects, bike lanes, and fight car dependency, which would increase safety, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, lower car traffic, and decrease costs for maintenance of car infrastructure (!!!). It is shameful that Doug Ford is using cyclists as a scapegoat instead of looking at the bigger picture of the toxic cycle of car dependency.\n"

        "comment": "This is a gross overstep of Provincial authority. What the hell does the Province have to do with traffic in the city? If Ford wants to set BIKE LANES in Toronto or other cities, he should run for CITY COUNCIL.\nAnd that is besides the fact this is a stupid policy anyways, written by people who neither live nor regularly commute in the areas he's talking about. I live on Bloor, I generally don't bike, but I see the number of people using it, and it is DEFINITELY a plus to the community. Traffic is not really effected (it has always been congested), and most people should be using public transit on these corridors anyways, given that Yonge and Bloor have SUBWAY LINES. And it will NOT make a dent on traffic. Every study shows the problem is too many cars (and I have one, I'm not just being self serving)! I guarantee you that the majority of people complaining about this are outside of the communities this effects, and simply want a freeway to bypass the communities themselves.\nThis is why the Provincial Conservatives had to put this legislation forward instead of the city - because the COMMUNITIES want the Bike Lanes. It takes people outside these communities to get people who want to remove these bike lanes despite the fact it removing them would make the places less liveable - all so they can more easily bypass the community on larger roads faster.\nAbsolutely terrible policy up and down, with a major overstep of provincial powers, to ruin communities to help shore up their voter base elsewhere. Whoever put this forward should take a long hard look in the mirror. If they think this Provincial overstep is worth it, they should remember that the Cons won't be in power forever. Once this door is opened, the suburbs will open itself to the SAME type of overreach, and you can bet the rural & urban communities have a lot of complaints on how the suburbs are run.\n"

        "comment": "The future of all society is the removal of cars. Cars are inefficient modes of travel due their high cost, high space requirement, and low efficiency due to inherent design such as rolling resistance. The only way we will be able to transform human society into being carbon neutral is by prioritizing more carbon efficient modes of transportations in places where they make sense. The City of Toronto is the most obvious place where this applies. There is already such a high use of public transportation that it makes sense to further enhance its capabilities by implementing safe, interconnected bike lanes. If there existed a large interconnected bike network, I would personally much prefer that, in place of driving in a city as congested as Toronto. It is not feasible to expect cars to be the main form of transportation in Toronto, that is why there exists the TTC. This bill does not make any sense because instead of further supporting the TTC to reduce the amount of congestion, it instead aims to increase it by further prioritizing cars. By emphasizing car travel, people who would bike would instead choose to drive, this would increase the amount of traffic on the roads, while conversely emphasizing bike travel would then cause more drivers to start biking, provided that the bike lanes are of high enough quality.\n"

The provincial government should not be disrupting municipal infrastructure decisions. Cities represent the infrastructure demands of their constituents better than the provincial government.\nThis bill effectively bans bike lane infrastructure from being built due to the increase in delays and cost from the bureaucracy.\nRemoving bike lanes will have the opposite effect to reducing vehicular traffic. Cyclists who would have taken the bike lane would be forced to be in a car lane, increasing risk of accident and making the journey less safe and less comfortable for both driver and cyclist. Those who stop cycling altogether will be forced to take cars to their destinations, increasing car traffic.\nAll in all, this bill reduces Canadians' freedom to choose how they want to move places, increases costs for cities, and is unlikely to solve gridlock (which fundamentally is about reducing the number of cars on the road).\nWe should be following progressive infrastructure policy, like in Europe or Montr\u00e9al, as an example for a greener and healthier future. This bill is the opposite of that and represents vested interests in carbon fuels and the automobile industry. Approving this decision would be a black mark on our province for future generations.\n"
