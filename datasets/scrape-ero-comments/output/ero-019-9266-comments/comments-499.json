        "comment": "Hi there. I'd like to comment on the bike lane suggestions. As both a bike rider, commuter and car driver, I am NOT in favour of removing bike lanes. This is short sighted thinking especially in light of the influx of ebikes and scooters to enable and encourage more people to move around our cities NOT using a car. If we remove these bike lanes, it will become the wild west for the bikes/scooters. Additionally, if we opened up more lanes for cars, in two years those lanes will be full of cars and we will be back to where we are now...we need a long term, durable solution and that includes bike lanes. Bike lanes are essential for creating a safe, accessible, and sustainable city. They protect cyclists from traffic, encourage more people to choose eco-friendly transportation, and help reduce traffic congestion and emissions. With dedicated bike lanes, cities become more inclusive and healthier spaces for everyone, promoting active lifestyles and reducing pollution. Investing in bike lanes is an investment in our community\u2019s safety, health, and future.\n"

Bikes (and bike lanes) are constantly easing the congestion, and removing them is a terrible, terrible idea. People will die. Congestion will stay the same.\nPlease reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "This comment pertains to ERO No. 019-9266.\nWith respect to building highways (Schedule 2 and 3), my concern is that the activity/ies will be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act.  This exemption is not in the best interest of Ontarians.  For example, not considering all alternatives may not take into account the under utilization of existing Highway 40.  If Highway 407 was utilized at capacity, Highway 413 may not be required thus negating the need to remove farmland from productive use as well as saving taxpayers considerable sums of money.  Additionally, assuming that there is a genuine need for Highway 413, limiting the environmental impacts to just those of the highway, and ignoring the additional development that this highway will undoubtedly cause, will have significant impacts beyond the study area, for example stormwater runoff surges downstream of the study area (see Valencia, Spain for further details of the consequences of not planning for this scenario).\nWith respect to the Highway Traffic Act (Schedule 4), the focus of the review of bicycle lanes should be broadened to include parameters other than traffic flow.  At a minimum the review should include: (a) collision and fatality statistics, (b) actual (for existing bike lanes) or projected (for proposed bike lanes) share of transportation mode of bicycles, (c) consequenes of removing or not building bicycle lanes on traffic flow if the modal share of bicycle transport is switched to motorized vehicles and (d) in the case of removal of bicycle lanes, whether equivalent bicycle infrastructure already exists, in reasonable proximity, to provide an alternate route.\nThank you, in advance, for acting on these comments.\n"

        "comment": "While I understand the want to reduce traffic in congested areas in Toronto, bill 212 will be detrimental to cycling in all of Ontario, not just Toronto. This would bar any smaller local governments from developing their own cycling infrastructure without first acquiring provincial approval. This will slow down development for expanded transportation infrastructure in Ontario. I cycle often for work, shopping and pleasure. Bike lanes help me feel safer, just as if I was walking on sidewalks. We should focus on safety over extra lanes for cars. Bike lanes are also important for the youths of Ontario, building a province centred on car infrastructure is not fair to those is are not allowed to drive, especially when there may be no public transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "This is an overreach of provincial power, and a step backwards in managing both traffic congestion and reduction of emissions. Bigger roads just encourage more cars to fill them, and reduce the amount of people able to move through them efficiently.\nWe need to focus on finishing projects that have been started (Crosstown LRT, Ontario Line). This plan is merely a quick fix distraction from the larger issue at hand. Public transit and bike lanes move far more people safely and efficiently than roads. Investing in a robust regional transit system to move out-of-towners into the city and onto convient transit systems such as the TTC or bikeshare would reduce cars on the road and curtail congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do more to keep the city moving and reduce gridlock than parking lanes. A more fair proposal would be to remove street parking lanes on major streets such as Bloor St and Yonge st, which take up more space from traffic lanes. The fact that there is only one usable lane on much of Queen St for example that must be shared between the streetcar and all traffic is absurd. Encouraging cyclists would reduce the dependency on cars and Ubers in the city and make traffic faster for those who do drive.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about bill 212 and the negative impacts of this on our road infrastructure.\nAs a driver, I greatly value bike lanes on roads, as they make sharing the road safer and more predictable. In my neighborhood of East York, I notice a significant difference when driving on streets like Cosburn, which has dedicated bike lanes. The bike lanes provide a clear space for cyclists, so I always know where to expect them and can avoid getting stuck behind them in traffic. Removing bike lanes to prioritize vehicle-only infrastructure will lead to more confusion and frustration for drivers and cyclists alike, creating unnecessary disruptions for people on the road.\nThis bill does not serve the best interests of Ontario\u2019s people, and the process feels rushed without adequate public support or input. Ontario deserves thoughtful, responsible planning\u2014not hasty decisions that will harm our communities and environment for generations to come. I urge a reconsideration of this bill and to prioritize a truly balanced approach that considers all road users.\n"

I previously drove to work every day but now I use my bike 95% of the time year round. It is faster, safer and a great way to get exercise. On the days where I take my car, there has been no increase in travel times whatsoever. Ripping up something that is clearly working is an absurd waste of taxpayer dollars. The government should focus on actual issues such as improving the economy and leave bike lane decisions to local planners.\n"

        "comment": "Not only is the government ignoring their own task forces and countless studies, but they\u2019re supposedly \u201csaving\u201d your time and WASTING your money. If anything causes more traffic than a bike lane (and this is more perception than actual fact) it\u2019s CONSTRUCTION. The hilarious proposition to rip out infrastructure that is 1. Completed 2. keeping cycling traffic safe with protected lanes and 3. Keeping motorist traffic safe by reducing speed in populated zones (or reducing the ability TO SPEED) is simply a ploy to win votes from conservative voters outside the GTA who simply don\u2019t know enough about the matter but feel strongly about it. What is simple that reducing lanes creates slower traffic, yes, but more streamlined traffic. Driving on any street where drivers can weave in and out of lines are infinitely worse for causing traffic jams and accidents (just sat in a jam on king west, would have much rather driven on bloor).\nAs a conservative government, it\u2019s laughable that you advocate for reducing the red tape, yet developers and construction companies groan about how you consistently add burden to their projects with red tape (does eglinton ring a bell? Where has the province been in the time it\u2019s taken to build crosstown? Or finch?) Yet again you are adding red tape to more infrastructure. I thought this was a mantra the conservatives attributed to liberals. Boy was that wrong.\n"

For a party that touts itself as fiscally conservative, it has no problem spending millions to undo improvements that have already been constructed or put in place such as the bike lanes throughout the city.\nIf you want to truly reduce congestion downtown, may I suggest banning private single-occupant vehicles? The vast majority of cars I see clogging up the street only have one occupant and surely that must be the most effective solution. Otherwise, don't pretend to care about reducing traffic and call it for what it really is: a massive waste of money, time, and a distraction for the government to keep stealing funds from healthcare, education, and much more.\n"

Contrary to the name of the Bill, this legislative change will not reduce gridlock for me nor will it save me time as a cyclist. Dedicated bike lanes are the reason I am able to commute to my job safely (even at eight months pregnant). Further, cycling has permitted my family to remain a one car family, contributing to this government's broader policy agenda on the environment while spending our money at local businesses in our neighbourhood.\nStudies are clear that adding roadways do not reduce congestion but do the very opposite.\nFurther, the unnecessary oversight will cause further delays to infrastructure development that again work against the very policy objective you state as the goal of the bill.\nI would urge your government to strongly evaluate whether the proposed legislative changes will meet your policy objective using available evidence.\n"

        "comment": "I am perplexed at the way in which this proposal distinguishes between \"bike lanes\" and \"traffic lanes.\" Are bicycles not traffic? Do cyclists not have places to get to on time? Of all the ways we can get around a city, why are motorised vehicles the only ones designated as \"traffic\" in this proposal?\nAs the Ontario government envisions a future where our cities' streets are less congested, I ask them to envision a future in which cars are not the primary method of transportation. It is very clear that we cannot continue to rely on fossil fuels because of climate change. While electric cars are arguably less harmful than gas-powered cars, they still rely on mining critical minerals which has enormously negative impacts on ecologies and communities, especially indigenous communities. I am a 23-year-old university student and I ask that we collectively imagine and build a future beyond car dependency. This is not only crucial for addressing climate change -- bikeable and walkable cities are also healthier, better for business, happier and more just.\nGridlock is not caused by bike lanes. It is caused by too many cars on the roads. The solution cannot be more space for cars. This simply invites more cars and then 10 years from now we'll be in the same gridlock. We need to build streets and cities that offer safe and convenient choices that include walking, cycling and public transit, so that people can choose alternatives to driving their car. Bike lanes are just one way we can make our streets safer and more enjoyable for cyclists, and thus encourage more people to bike instead of drive. Gridlock is not caused by bike lanes. We need more bike lanes, not fewer. Bike lanes are traffic lanes than can move way more people per square metre compared to car lanes. Bike lanes and other non-car transportation infrastructure will ease gridlock, not more space for cars.\nThe Ontario government must not remove bike lanes in Toronto or anywhere else. If anything, the provincial government should be encouraging more bike lanes. The provincial government must not require municipalities to get provincial authorization for new bike lanes as this will make their implementation slower. Allow the people who know their roads and neighbourhoods best to decide how to build their roads. Leave it to the municipalities.\nThe language in this proposal is blatantly placing the car on a higher level of importance than other forms of transportation. It is written, \"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster,\" without acknowledging that this means cyclists will get to where they are going slower and less safely. We must recognise that owning and driving a car is not universal. There are so many reasons why people don't drive -- they are young, they cannot afford to have a car, they have a disability, etc -- and this is why our streets need to provide multiple convenient transportation options to choose from. By legislating cars as the only important form of traffic (as this proposal does), the Ontario government is reinforcing existing inequalities.\nI grew up in Peterborough Ontario and relied on bike lanes and multi-use paths to get to school and around town. Last fall I lived in New York City and relied on my bike to get everywhere. The streets with bike lanes made me feel way safer and helped me travel way faster. Streets with bike lanes move everyone faster -- even car drivers, because fewer people need to drive is there are convenient alternatives.\nI was hit by a car once on my way to school in high school and then recently I was run over by a pickup truck while biking to work and was lucky to survive. Our streetscapes can be really dangerous for cyclists, which keeps people from choosing to bike and keeps them dependent on a car, causing gridlock. The answer is not to remove cycling infrastructure. The way forward is to dream bigger than car dependent cities. We can make our cities way more accessible, safer, more convenient and way more awesome to live in if we prioritise people, not cars.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford has no business meddling in removing Toronto's bike lanes. This is a waste of taxpayer's money. Adding more lanes for car traffic will just induce demand of cars, and the traffic downtown has gotten worse in the past several years (since lockdowns). Those of us who actually live in the city have seen it.\nTaking away bike lanes makes cyclists more vulnerable to motorists. We need to ensure the safety of cyclists commuting to school, work, and delivering food. Studies have shown where bike lanes are installed helps increase ridership. Bike Share services have increased significantly and this year - riders in Toronto have taken 4.7 million trips.\nThese need to be protected so we can continue to move around the city we live in.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident, this bill will prove harmful for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\nFirstly, the provincial government shouldn't be adding political red tape that slows down local governments that is trying to increase transportation options in the city.\nFor bikes:\nBike lanes are a life saving essential infrastructure for people cycling. Without them people cycling are in danger of being hit by cars, or they might be a danger to pedestrians on sidewalks.\nCars belong to roads, pedestrians belong to side walks, and bicycles belong to bike lanes. That way each way of transportation has a dedicated and convenient place.\nFurther more, if the rode is congested, has high speed limit, or just busy, cyclists would resort to using the sidewalks in fear of being run over. Personally as a person who cycles occasionally, and would like to cycle more, I would rather ride on the sidewalk and be faced with a fine, then to use a busy rode that poses a risk to my life.\nFor Drivers:\nBike lanes get cyclists out of the road, and out of the way of drivers, helping with a better flow of traffic.\nThe ease of use of bike lanes give some people the option to cycle instead of drive, overall removing the amount of cars from the road, and again, easing traffic.\nFor pedestrians:\nProper permanent bike lanes, in a way, act as an extension of the sidewalk making walking along the street a much more pleasant experience that would lead to a more lively and active city.\nThis bill is only adding more and more red tape that just limits the city from giving more options to get around. Taking transit can be hard and inconvenient enough that using bike-share TO was a great alternative for ttc delays and cancellations.\nThis bill will take people off of bikes and move them to either cars, worsening congestion, or on to public transit, only adding more overcrowding already existing on an underdeveloped  transit system for the size of Toronto.\n"
