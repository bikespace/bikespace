        "comment": "November 20, 2024\nEnvironmental Registry of Ontario submission, re: Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nAccording to INRIX\u2019s 2023 traffic data (1), Toronto ranks 7th in traffic delay time in North America. While we shouldn\u2019t be content with that number, for the city that ranks 4th in population in North America, it also doesn\u2019t point to an unprecedented crisis that merits the outlandish solutions being proposed in Schedule 4 of Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\nOn September 19, 2024, CBC reported (2) that this government was \u201cconsidering bringing forward legislation that could prohibit the installation of bike lanes when lanes for motor vehicles are removed\u201d. The next day, Cycle Toronto launched our \u201cI Love Bike Lanes\u201d petition (3):\n\"Help us tell the province that we love our communities\u2019 bike lanes, and we don't want the province saying where they can or can't be built because:\n\u25cf        Bike lanes are good for business\n\u25cf        They\u2019re good for the environment\n\u25cf        They\u2019re good for public and personal health\n\u25cf        They give us freedom and mobility\n\u25cf        Bike lanes save lives\"\nTo date, 23,083 people have added their voice asking the province to stay in their lane.\nSchedule 4 of Bill 212 isn\u2019t about bike lanes. It\u2019s not about tackling congestion, working with municipalities for data-driven solutions, or giving people more safe transportation options. It\u2019s unprecedented jurisdictional overreach undermining local democracy that will cost taxpayers millions of dollars and put lives at risk.\nBefore you vote, did you know\u2026\n\u25cf      Association of Municipalities of Ontario (4), Ontario Professional Planners Institute (5), Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (6), and Ontario Traffic Council (7) have all come out against Bill 212?\n\u25cf      120 physicians and researchers wrote a joint letter (8) opposing Bill 212?\n\u25cf      It is false that only 1.2% of people bike to work in Toronto (9), and according to the province\u2019s still confidential data nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility vehicle (10)?\nThe government has yet to produce any data to justify Bill 212. Why is this government so distracted by 11 km of bike lanes in Toronto? Why should voters outside of Toronto care?\nRepeatedly Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria have insisted they\u2019re not against bike lanes, just want bike lanes where they make sense. I don\u2019t doubt their sincerity. But municipalities like the City of Toronto are not casual about how and where it plans its cycling network, and each step is approved by democratically elected city council members. In the case of the bike lanes Bloor St., University Ave., and Yonge St., no alternate routes exist that wouldn\u2019t also involve the removal of traffic lanes (11). People riding bikes want to get to the same places as people driving or taking transit. Not every trip is bikeable and not every person will choose to ride a bike, but people need more safe and convenient transportation options. Ripping out these bike lanes will leave people without safe options.\nThe words \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d do not appear anywhere in the bike lane sections of Bill 212, and the only consideration to approve or remove bike lanes would be \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d.  And adding more red tape to the Ministry of Transportation to do detailed corridor studies each time any one of Ontario\u2019s 444 municipalities proposes a new bike route is neither an efficient nor effective use of provincial resources. And it's an insult to families who have lost a loved one riding their bikes by removing tools from local municipalities. At the end of the day, we all just want to get home safely.\nWe urge you to keep working with municipalities and your local communities, and not to pass Bill 212.\nBest regards,\nMichael Longfield\nExecutive Director, Cycle Toronto\nReferences\n1 https://inrix.com/scorecard/\n2 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-government-bike-lanes-1\u2026\n3 https://www.cycleto.ca/ilovebikelanes\n4  https://www.amo.on.ca/policy/finance-infrastructure-and-economy/provinc\u2026\n5 https://ontarioplanners.ca/OPPIAssets/Documents/Policy-Papers/OPPI-Stat\u2026\n6 https://ospe.on.ca/advocacy/response-to-bill-212-why-we-need-to-rethink\u2026\n7 https://assets.nationbuilder.com/cycletoronto/pages/4543/attachments/or\u2026\n8 https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\n9 https://www.thetrillium.ca/news/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026\n10  https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/province-led-survey-suggests-higher-cy\u2026\n11 https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-250545\u2026\n"

        "comment": "We are writing to express our full support for the proposed BILL 212.  As  concerned residents, we believe this decision is crucial to resolving several serious issues caused by the bike lanes, and we appreciate the Provincial Government\u2019s attention to this matter.\nSince the installation of the bike lanes, we have witnessed a significant increase in road congestion, leading to longer commute times and greater frustration for drivers. This has been especially problematic here in Etobicoke where traffic flow has been severely disrupted due to the removal of vehicle lanes.\nAdditionally, the bike lanes have contributed to a decline in business for local shopkeepers, as the lack of parking and ease of access to their stores has made it more difficult for customers to stop and shop. The increased congestion and restricted road access are negatively impacting the livelihoods of small businesses that form the heart of our community.\nFrom a safety standpoint, the bike lanes have also created unsafe conditions for pedestrians. In many areas, the reduced road space has forced people to walk closer to traffic, increasing the risk of accidents and making it harder for families and seniors to navigate our streets comfortably.\nThe bike lines and the repositioning of on-street parking has created situations, where drivers and passengers, are placed in harms way when leaving or entering their vehicles, due to the proximity of parking spaces to moving traffic\u2026!\nThe impact on emergency services is another concern. Response times for paramedics, fire trucks, and police vehicles have been delayed due to the blocked lanes, which is a serious risk to the well-being of residents in urgent need of assistance. PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING THE CITY IS SAYING REGARDING IMPROVED RESPONSE TIMES BY FIRST RESPONDERS.\nFinally, the bike lanes, despite their significant cost and disruption to the community, are simply not being used. The absence of cyclists using these lanes on a regular basis has made it clear that the intended benefits of this infrastructure are not being realized.\nGiven these ongoing problems, we fully support BILL 212.  Removing the bike lanes and restoring proper traffic flow, safer conditions for pedestrians, and better access to local businesses is crucial to bring back our neighbourhoods.  We believe this BILL is an essential step in addressing the needs and concerns of the broader community.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue. We appreciate your commitment to finding practical solutions that work for all residents, and we look forward to seeing positive changes for our city.\nSincerely,\nCONCERNED SUNNYLEA RESIDENTS of ETOBICOKE\nP.S.  We hope you do not believe the cost estimate provided by the City of Toronto to remove the bike lanes.  This exaggerated number only demonstrates that the folks at Toronto City Hall cannot be trusted.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI think this proposal is both dangerous and greatly misguided. Bike lanes do not increase traffic, but have been proven time and time again to do the opposite - reduce traffic. In a city as busy as Toronto, it is important to prioritize and encourage active transportation. The increase of cyclists will decrease the amount of car users.  Without these significant bike lanes, biking also becomes much more dangerous for cyclists. Cars often do not pay attention to cyclists whereas a bike lane provides a safe lane for biking.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor Street, particularly in the area from Prince Edward Drive to Resurrection Drive are an abomination of both planning and implementation. It's a gridlocked obstacle course for drivers,  the community at large didn't want them and was not adequately consulted and they benefit a vast minority of road users to the detriment of the majority. They can't possibly be removed soon enough. I've lived on Princeton Rd for 42 years.\n"

Toronto, like many major cities around the world, has decided to be forward thinking and try to support pedestrians and cyclists in its city. Bike lanes help reduce congestion and protect lives. One just has to look at cities around the world, including Paris and New York, to see that bike lanes help make cities more livable and protect lives. How many conservative MPPs actually cycle? Actually live in Toronto? Ford himself, in a CBC program in which he was ridng a bike, said that bike lanes made you feel safer. Such hypocrisy from him and pandering to a suburban voter base is hard to stomach. This bill should not be supported.\n"

The is too much congestion to justify having bike lanes with such low utilization rates.\nMoreover, the excess vehicular emissions due to idling, surely far outweighs any benefit of the few cyclists who are using the bike lanes and not driving or not taking the TTC.\nI am not opposed to bike lanes on streets that are not main thoroughfares such as bloor, university,Yonge , etc. bike lanes on the secondary roads are a fantastic idea.\n"

        "comment": "Good day,\nI am a planning grad student, and I am opposed to Bill 212 in its entirety. Specifically, for this comment, I am opposed to the removal of any existing bike lanes. Removing bike lanes increases the risk of cyclists being injured and killed on the road, and will not help to increase the flow of traffic, as is evidenced in many traffic studies.. This move appears to be less about evidence-based decision making and more about a political culture war that will result in people getting killed. Is that worth political points? Removing lanes will just push cyclists into the existing car traffic lanes, or will move those cyclists back to driving, both of which will slow traffic down. Toronto EMS has stated response times have improved since the bike lanes were installed, so what is the justification for removing them? If cyclists end up dying, and traffic does not improve, will the Provincial Government be liable for those deaths?\nI am also opposed to having any additional cycling lanes go through an approval process. What a ridiculous waste of time and money to have an additional bureaucratic step to implement something that planners know will help save lives, improve traffic flow, reduce carbon emissions and increase public health.\nIt is very embarrassing and ridiculous to have the Province meddling in what should be an entirely municipal affair, and that has so much positive evidence backing it.\nThe Province should be having an open and honest dialogue with communties about how they want to get around their communities, make sure that is backed by the latest planning evidence (ie reducing the number of car trips by allowing multiple modes of transportation!) And help to implement solutions, instead of authoritatively pushing cars and car-dependancy as the only solution. Cars are incredibly negatively impactful to our communties, and any opportunity to have other mode shares, which help to reduce traffic, greenhouse has emissions, improve public health etc. Should be promoted.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, which seeks to remove bike lanes in Toronto, is a short-sighted approach that disregards evidence supporting the benefits of cycling infrastructure. As both a cyclist and driver, I\u2019ve seen how bike lanes improve mobility for everyone by providing safer, more efficient routes for cyclists, reducing conflicts between vehicles and bikes. Studies consistently show that bike lanes boost local businesses by increasing foot and bike traffic while having no measurable negative impact on gridlock. Removing this infrastructure undermines efforts to build a more sustainable, accessible, and vibrant city.\n"

        "comment": "This bill includes variety of measures, many of which are designed to support populist ideals rather than improve the lives of people living in this province. Forcing the removal of bike lanes is a tragic mistake that must be avoided. The goal of removing congestion is understandable, but the creation of more highways and lane expansions always creates more traffic and will be an epic failure. The best way to reduce traffic is to improve access to a variety of forms of transportation.\n\tI have had the privilege to live in multiple cities across the world this year. Coming back to Toronto was quite a shock to the system. The city of Toronto is already an incredibly car-centric city. The city prioritizes cars in the use of space and rules of the road. Streetcars in Toronto are notoriously slow and are never able to keep to any schedule. This is largely because we have decided to accept that as a part of our transportation system. If we look to Melbourne as an example, it is a city with a population greater than Toronto with a similar density. The trams (streetcars) there travel throughout the city and have a very good on-time performance compared to streetcars in Toronto. Melbourne\u2019s tram network is also more expansive than Toronto\u2019s. Trams largely travel on dedicated tracks with many parts of the CBD having a track for trams and a single lane for cars. Trams are also free in the city centre and the way the system is setup, trams run every few minutes in just off-peak times and as frequently as every minute in peak times at many of these stops. Running on largely dedicated tracks in the middle road and being free in the city centre makes it very easy to get around without a car and encourages people to leave their cars at home or eat their offices when travelling to meetings around the city centre. It also encourages tourists to ride the tram network reducing that demographic\u2019s reliance on cars for getting around. Melbourne has all this and still, congestion does not kill productivity or waste people\u2019s time. I am confident that people who drive in Melbourne are frustrated by traffic as people are in every major city but in Toronto, it often feels like your only choice is to drive. This is a decision that policy makers have forced on us here.\n\tMontr\u00e9al, another city I have been lucky to live in this year is a city that has an expansive network of divided bike lanes throughout the city. The amount of users travelling through these bike lanes regularly looms large over the traffic travelling through the car lanes next to them. While I can totally understand being wary of the notion of \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d but in this case we know that they will come, it\u2019s not a fantastical aspiration. The Toronto Community Bikeways Coalition has done extensive work analyzing the traffic on bike lanes such as the one on Bloor, traffic has increased significantly, with thousands of trips occurring in these bike lanes every day, particularly in good weather. City centres shouldn\u2019t have highways running through them. Bicycle lanes are good for business, good for adhering to Canada\u2019s Paris Agreement obligations, and good for reducing traffic. The thought that added bureaucracy in city planning will improve traffic is a fantasy. No one elected you to create a bigger bureaucracy. Most people would say that they voted you for the exact opposite reason. Bike lanes with 100% local support would be subject to the whims of a government that may not represent any part of the area and I can only start to imagine how frustrating you might find such a situation if the provincial government started meddling in local affairs. While of course this government has been very happy to change up municipalities in ways that Doug Ford desires, it is incredibly prudent for every member of caucus to take a step back and really reflect on what this means for how our governments operate. You claim to be the party opposed to red tape and in support of businesses. Removing bike lanes, particularly in this manner does neither of these things.\n\tHighway 413 is akin to adding more lanes to existing roads. Neither will reduce congestion. If Highway 413 is a toll-free highway then it will quickly be swallowed up by traffic and the promos of 30-35 minute reduction travel times will quickly vanish. This is what has happened after every expansion of the 401 and every expansion of every congested highway throughout the world. In the alternative, if 413 is to be a toll road it will likely succumb to the same downfall as the 407. The 407 is super under-utilized. There are so few cars on that road, and that is only because of the excessive tolls of the 407 ETR that the province has no control over because of a past government\u2019s decision to sell-off public infrastructure. If the proposed 413 is undertaken as a toll road, it will not decrease traffic and be an expensive burden for road users or taxpayers, two groups that also of course have significant overlap.\n\tThe way to reduce traffic is give people the option to leave their cars at home. GO train expansion can reduce traffic on highways. How many people have you heard say \u201cI hate driving on the 401\u201d or \u201cI hate driving in Toronto\u201d. Many of these people would love to be able to not drive. GO transit is a wonderful base on which to build up regional commuter rail capacity. It is high on-time performance. Back in 2012, 80% of GO Transit train ridership had a car available to them but chose a train over a car. GO Transit fares are cheaper or the same price that people would pay to park their cars. GO Trains however also have the bonus of being faster than driving, especially for journeys including Toronto during rush hour, and more environmentally friendly as trains have very low emissions per passenger kilometres. On a commute of mine with a distance of over 65 km as the crow flies that included a walk of 2-30 minutes, taking the train was still faster than taking a car. I can only imagine that journeys where traffic fluctuations will make a bigger percentage impact on the journey time that this benefit would be more pronounced. I think the Provincial government should be looking to prioritize the expansion of transit so that one can choose between a car and transit without having to consider their independence. I recently concluded a 5 week internship at theatre company in downtown Toronto and was commuting from Guelph. The train got me to my internship in 2 hours door to door. The drive alone is regularly over 2 hours, not including parking and then still walking to the final destination. If I didn\u2019t have access to a car in Guelph that I could use, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay in Guelph as I would have had no way of getting into Toronto on the weekends as theatres work on Saturdays and Sundays. The bus journey between the two closest stops for me was 2 hours to 2 hours and 45 minutes but of course, busses are also subject to the whims of road traffic. That would have added between 30 and 75 minutes to my commute which isn\u2019t a feasible addition to someone\u2019s commute. Increasing GO train service and even some occasional weekend service would allow people taking further journeys ditch their cars and not have to rely on parking in Downtown Toronto.\n\tBuilding highways never reduces traffic. Improving transit, improving bike lanes, improving pedestrian options is not only good for business and the environment but it\u2019s also the best way to get Ontarians where they need to be faster.\n"
