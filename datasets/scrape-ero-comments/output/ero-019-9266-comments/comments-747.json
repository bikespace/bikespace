Removing these lanes, which required time and money to put up in the first place, will be extremely dangerous and in efficient use of public funds.\nBike lanes encourage more cyclists, thus reducing traffic. Bike lanes promote general population health as they offer exercise. Bike lanes help reduce environmental harm caused by pollution.\nIt would be a severe mistake to remove bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic in Toronto is an urban planning issue that has nothing to do with the bike lanes. It if anything has more to do with the lack of delivery of updated transit options and consistent building/upgrades over the many past decades.\nRemoving bike lanes does not remove the cyclists. Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow. The amount of cycling injuries and death in the city is UNACCEPTABLE. it is safer for all involved to have dedicated and protected bike lanes. The presence of dedicated bike lanes also opens up the possibility of dedicated cycling traffic signals (similar to the ones added to the bloor/keele/parkside intersection). I am also a driver in the city and prefer when cyclists, and smaller motorized bikes and scooters have their own lanes. It reduces stress, and increases visibility.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\nThe city should be moving TOWARD greener, safer, more sustainable transportation options versus doubling down on car centric policies that do not support the community or safety.\n"

        "comment": "As a member of a community association in the Pleasant View area, I strongly support the Province getting involved in approving where new bike lanes are implemented and reviewing existing bike lanes for potential removal.\nThere are currently plans to put bike lanes along Sheppard East, west of Leslie, and potentially east of Leslie in the future. This Renew Sheppard East plan is headed to North York Community Council for approval on Dec 3. I've attached a URL link below to the plan. See the Cycling Network page.\nIt does not make sense to me to put bike lanes on major roads, and possibly remove traffic lanes to do so, when there is already significant road congestion, and given the significant number of condo units being built along Sheppard. It is highly unlikely the majority of new residents will be cycling to their destinations.\nI've also attached a picture of a the left lane being blocked just east of Fairview Mall due to cars turning to get on the 404 north from Sheppard. This leaves two open lanes - image if one of them was decommissioned to allow for a bike lane - that would leave one open lane.\nThis is a very relevant issue for traffic in general for the 2km stretch along Sheppard between Don Mills and Victoria Park, especially given all the new and planned condo development, including 14 proposed ones (with an estimated 12,000 residents) on Fairview Mall lands. I've also attached a picture of traffic congestion westbound on Sheppard just west of the DVP by Fairview Mall.\nEven if a bike lane were combined with a dedicated bus lane (DBL), as the city has raised the idea of having a DBL on Sheppard East, it wouldn't make sense to take away a lane of traffic each way even for just a DBL on the above noted stretch. There is already congestion which will only get worse with the condo growth, and which is further impacted by having 8 traffic lights, the DVP/404 ramps and access to the 401 in this stretch.\nI am not against the idea of bike lanes, however, I don\u2019t understand trying to retrofit a city that is experiencing a continually growing population with more drivers, to accommodate bike lanes, especially on major roads, given the numbers and climate.\nThough I understand the removal of bike lanes will cost money, I can\u2019t see how it would be double to remove vs the installation cost. Traffic congestion costs money.\nAlso, I drive downtown often mainly at rush hour, and thus particularly support the removal of bike lanes on Bloor St. and University Ave. Coming off the DVP and then heading west onto Bloor only to find two lanes become one, with a backlog of cars, and yet only a handful of cyclists using the bike lane is frustrating.\nAnd reducing a major north/south route like University to 2 lanes each way, for bikes, given the number of events that occur downtown isn\u2019t reasonable, given we have very few north/south routes in the city. Other streets that should be looked at are Dundas East, where the bike lane is almost as wide as the car lane, and again I see very few cyclists, as well as the re-design of Adelaide east of University.\nAnother item i noted is along Highway 7. When heading westbound toward the 404 south ramp, there is a sign advising drivers to yield to cyclists. How does it make sense, to have drivers slow down in a flowing lane of traffic, as cars are coming behind them that could cause an accident, in order to make way for cyclists. The driver has to turn right onto the ramp, while the cyclist can slow and brake without impeding fast flowing traffic behind them.\nThere are a number of road/traffic related decisions being made that I question and wonder how/why they were made. Where are the numbers (when looking at the whole city, and not just the biking, population)? Do the decisions made represent the majority of Toronto residents and businesses, or special interests or being driven by philosophy.\nThank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts and for your consideration of them.\n"

        "comment": "As a business owner with multiple locations throughout Ontario, delivering fabricated stone throughout the province, I cannot offer support on this proposal. A dedicated bike lane functions to protect our most valuable citizens; young children and elderly citizens. Bike lanes are not designed for \"week-end warriors\" bike couriers or other confident riders. They are in place to provide peace of mind to people traveling from their homes to shops, school or work. This needs to be encouraged, more people on bikes means less cars on the road, freeing up space for those that must utilize a vehicle for their journey. A handful of people on bikes provides a massive visual contrast to the same number in cars; this is why people are often heard complaining the bike lanes are empty. Having a complete, protected system will encourage more trips by bikes, and has the potential of saving lives. Push for faster completion of public transit projects and speed up road work. Limiting construction hoard would also help flow, eliminating pinch points.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist, driver, parent, and resident of Toronto, I find Bill 212 (ERO 019-9266) very troubling. Municipal bike lanes are not, and should not be within the jurisdiction of the provincial government, and the provincial government should be focused on bigger picture issues, like the crisis in healthcare and public schools, or even just delivering the transit projects the province already has in progress, like the Ontario Line, and the Eglinton Crosstown Line. My impression is that mismanagement of project delivery by Metrolinx has been a substantial contributor to gridlock in Toronto, and it would be great to see the province take a hard look at that instead of focusing on bike lanes. Removing the existing bike lanes would be a substantial waste of taxpayer money, just like fast-tracking the deal to get alcoholic beverages into convenience and grocery stores was.\nBill 212 includes all kinds of disparate pieces that trouble me, like providing an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for Highway 413, and other measures to remove typical checks and balances on a project that will remove farmland, damage wetlands and restructure a major piece of Southern Ontario. It feels like this bike lane removal proposal is a bad faith attempt to distract from the 413 proposal. Premier Ford\u2019s land swap is already under investigation by the RCMP, and I have no faith that he has the best interests of Ontarians at heart. It seems likely that the 413 is being built to enrich developers, when a real attempt at reducing congestion would look at repatriating the 407. It would be more democratic if we could comment on all the issues in Bill 212 separately. I think improving rural internet is a great idea, and a good way to encourage people to move to less competitive housing markets, but I really don\u2019t like that it\u2019s part of an omnibus bill.\n"
