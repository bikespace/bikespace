The recent announcement by the Ford government to eliminate bike lanes and restrict their implementation is unbelievable.  Almost every time I go out for a bike ride I have a close encounter with an angry driver who puts my safety at risk.  Instead of removing lanes, a mandate should be put in place where a bike lane is included on every new road or roadway that is being rehabilitated.  It's time to stop the anti bike rehtoric and build a province that is inclusive for all modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto\u2019s bike lanes and bike share system draws visitors from the 905 region and beyond, enhancing the city\u2019s status as a leading tourism destination in the province. Cycling infrastructure not only improves the visitor experience but also provides a significant boost to local businesses. Research from Portland State University indicates that cyclists generally spend more at local establishments compared to car drivers, primarily due to the convenience and frequency of cycling trips versus car trips. Safe and accessible bike infrastructure is vital for tourists to easily navigate and explore Toronto\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods. Removing bike lanes would reduce transportation options for visitors without vehicles, diminishing the city\u2019s appeal and curtailing the economic benefits of cycling tourism. Maintaining bike lanes is essential for preserving Toronto\u2019s reputation as a welcoming, tourist-friendly city.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider removing bike lanes in a congested city to reduce traffic cas it can have several negative consequences:\n * Increased Traffic Congestion: While it might seem counterintuitive, removing bike lanes can actually worsen traffic congestion. Cyclists who previously used the lanes may switch to cars, adding to the number of vehicles on the road.\n * Decreased Safety for Cyclists: Bike lanes provide a dedicated and safer space for cyclists, separating them from high-speed traffic. Removing these lanes forces cyclists to share the road with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries.\n * Discouraging Cycling: Removing bike lanes sends a message that cycling is not prioritized or valued in the city. This can discourage people from choosing cycling as a mode of transportation, leading to increased car dependency and further congestion.\n * Negative Impact on Air Quality and Environment: More cars on the road mean increased emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, contributing to air pollution and climate change.\n * Reduced Accessibility and Equity: Bike lanes can be particularly important for people with lower incomes who may rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. Removing these lanes can limit their mobility and access to essential services.\nWhile removing bike lanes might seem like a quick fix to reduce traffic, it often leads to unintended consequences that can worsen overall urban mobility and quality of life. We need to learn more from other countries who value cycling as a mode of transportation and put more funding in public transit to connect the city better and alleviate traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are vital to supporting local economies. For example, the Bloor BIA saw a rise in revenue after bike lanes were added, demonstrating their positive effect on small businesses by drawing more cyclists and foot traffic.\nFurthermore, removing bike lanes would likely result in more cars on the road, leading to higher chances of collisions and insurance claims, which would drive up insurance premiums for all Ontarians, directly countering the province\u2019s affordability goals. Preserving bike lanes goes beyond transportation\u2014it\u2019s an investment in economic growth and financial stability for both residents and businesses.\n"

        "comment": "Decisions about bike infrastructure should be based on accurate and current data. The province's reported 1.2% bike commuting rate is derived from the outdated 2011 Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) data, which includes areas well beyond the city's core, such as Richmond Hill, Oakville, and Vaughan, and does not reflect current cycling trends in downtown Toronto. Relying on this outdated data to justify removing bike lanes in the city's center is not a valid argument.\nMoreover, any provincial intervention should be supported by a clear rationale that explains how changes to downtown bike lanes align with the broader goals of the province.\n"

Moreover, municipalities and their constituents must have the power and autonomy to make decisions about transit, facilities and other resources such as bike lanes with their own municipal representatives.\nI oppose this bill as a citizen, an Ontario resident and as a concerned person seeing the politicization and polarization efforts by the provincial government, using inaccurate data, and neglecting the health, safety and physical integrity of residents, only by their transportation choices. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a commuter using many modes of transportation - car, cycle, transit and foot - I would urge the province to back off on legislation that unilaterally reverses thoughtful - and local - public consultation processes and arbitrarily removes bike lanes without supporting data to guide such actions. Streets are for more than just moving vehicles, and all aspects should be considered before making changes.\nCongestion is an issue in Toronto, but can be more squarely attributed to the growing pains of construction related bottlenecks and generations of lack of investment ion transit. And everyone - cyclists and pedestrians included - have a right to be safe on our streets. Biek lanes and complete streets do that.\nTherefore, I oppose the arbitrary removal of bike lanes, and urge the province to leave jurisdiction of street design with locally elected city government. Democracy matters, please respect it.\nThank you for listening.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes reduces the transportation options available to commuters, particularly those who rely on connections to transit systems. This limitation undermines the substantial provincial and municipal investments in public transit, which aim to create integrated, sustainable networks offering residents a variety of efficient travel choices. Eliminating bike lanes jeopardizes the overall effectiveness of an integrated transit system and diminishes the potential for smooth connections between cycling and public transit. This ultimately hinders efforts to create a more connected and sustainable city. Protecting bike lanes also protects signficant taxpayer-funded investments by ensuring a well-rounded, multi-modal transportation network.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes before suitable replacements are in place creates unnecessary risks for current users. Existing arterial bike lanes are valued for their long, direct routes, and any replacements must provide equally connected alternatives to maintain safe and efficient cycling pathways. Without proper replacements, cyclists could be forced onto sidewalks, endangering pedestrians\u2014particularly those with disabilities or children. This not only threatens pedestrian safety but also undermines efforts to create a safer, more integrated transportation network. It is crucial to preserve bike lanes until well-planned replacements are available, ensuring the ongoing safety of all road users.\n"

In Toronto, where I live, my and my neighbours' taxes have gone towards implementation of these bike lanes, of which there should be more, not fewer. They go a long way towards making the city a more efficient, more progressive, more wonderful place to live. If the Ontario government starts messing with something the City has put in place, you'll be even less popular than you are now. Stay in your own lane!\n"

Considering Ontario\u2019s objectives to promote sustainable, safe, and inclusive transportation networks, recognizing bicycle lanes as a critical infrastructure component that supports public health and alleviates congestion could be advantageous. This approach would align with the province's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes and bicycle riders neither increase gridlock nor do they save time.  The measure of efficiency for any given road is properly \"number of people \" not \"number of cars\".\nAs a frequent long time bicycle commuter in the city and taxpayer, I agree that the design of the Yonge St. and Bloor St. bike lanes are sub-optimal and dangerous.  However they are well used and I challenge legislators to come up with solid evidence that they are the source of the gridlock on those streets rather than embarking on another bias-driven and politically motivated path.  There is a vast amount of evidence from Toronto and from other more forward-thinking jurisdictions on the value of bike lanes: economic, health, societal and transport.  Why do we choose to ignore these lessons?\nThis is such a disheartening and wasteful proposal.\n"

I believe that the proposed changes I step backwards and that as a province we must expand bike lanes not reduce.  Investment in public transit and urban planning that emphasizes non-motorized transportation would achieve a great deal more gains reducing gridlock while promoting a healthier lifestyle. Do not take away municipalities right to determine what is best for their citizens and roads. There are many cities and countries that have significantly greater cycling lanes/infrastructure and their day has shown improvement in transportation times. Check your facts please and consider the implications for the long term.\n"
