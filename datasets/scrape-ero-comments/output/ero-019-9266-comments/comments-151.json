        "comment": "This policy has nothing to do with gridlock and everything to do with demonstrating hostility and contempt for city-dwellers for the purposes of political pandering towards a rural or suburban audience. Toronto has a population of over 3 million. Does it have 3 million parking spots? 1 million? No. It does not. Every cyclist is a person not driving, a person who is not taking up parking space, a person who is not congesting the roadways. This bill will make traffic more congested and make city life more difficult. But Doug Ford will do it, because rural voters will do anything to watch city folk suffer.\n"

        "comment": "This is completely unnecessary. We should be creating more bike lanes and finding ways to use cars less, not the opposite. I have to drive to work and back every day, due to distance, but would love it if I could bike instead. Do not remove the bike lanes. Make more bike lanes.\nYou want to improve traffic, increase enforcement. Police services are so overwhelmed with violent crime that they can barely afford to enforce traffic regs. Maybe we need to make more special constables to take care of this.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a dangerously regressive piece of legislation masquerading as a solution to traffic congestion. In reality, it's an assault on evidence-based urban planning, environmental protection, and local democracy.\nThe provincial government's heavy-handed intervention in municipal bike lane decisions is nothing short of authoritarian overreach. This blatant power grab undermines years of careful local planning, community consultation, and democratic process. It's particularly galling considering that municipalities are legally empowered to make these decisions under the Municipal Act.\nThe Act's fundamental premise - that more car lanes reduce congestion - flies in the face of decades of transportation research. The concept of induced demand isn't merely a theory; it's a proven phenomenon witnessed globally. By ignoring this evidence, the government demonstrates either willful ignorance or deliberate disregard for scientific consensus.\nThe planned removal of Toronto's bike lanes is particularly shortsighted and harmful. These lanes serve thousands daily and have demonstrably boosted local business revenue - facts the government seems determined to ignore. This isn't just bad policy; it's actively harmful to urban communities and local economies.\nThe environmental implications are even more alarming. The reckless exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. This isn't merely cutting red tape - it's cutting essential safeguards for irreplaceable ecosystems. Once paved over, these vital carbon sinks and natural habitats are lost forever.\nThe timing of this bill, amid a climate crisis and rising urban transportation challenges, is particularly tone-deaf. Instead of embracing modern, sustainable solutions, the government is doubling down on failed 1950s-era car-centric policies that have proven disastrous for cities worldwide.\nThe absence of expert consultation in drafting this bill is glaring. It appears to have been crafted to satisfy political objectives rather than address real transportation needs. The result is a piece of legislation that not only fails to solve congestion but actively works against public health, safety, and environmental protection.\nMost disturbingly, the bill reveals a troubling pattern of governance that prioritizes short-term political gains over long-term public good. It's a direct attack on sustainable urban planning, environmental protection, and municipal autonomy.\nThis isn't just flawed legislation - it's a dangerous step backward that threatens to lock Ontario into unsustainable, unsafe, and inefficient transportation patterns for generations to come. The bill should be scrapped entirely and replaced with evidence-based policies that actually serve the public interest rather than political expediency.\n"

        "comment": "Let municipalities do what they want with their own roads, and keep politics out of it. The Ontario government does not know the traffic/congestion struggles of each city/town, so stop trying to micromanage them. And absolutely do not spend any of MY money on removing bike lanes that my ELECTED city council approved. If a bike lane is the will of a democratically elected city council, then leave it alone.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a prime example of provincial overreach into municipal affairs and demonstrates that the Ford government would rather push outdated car-centric dogma instead of listening to urban planners. For a government that claims to be fiscally responsible, they fail to admit that car-centric urban planning has proven with countless examples to be financially unsustainable.\nI travel by car more than half the time and welcome bike lanes. Keeping cars, bikes, and pedestrians all separated from each other is safe and inherently more efficient. Removing bike lanes on major arteries would force cyclists either back into cars or have them cycling in the same lane as cars. Neither of those scenarios would improve the flow of traffic.\nIf the Ford government is actually concerned with keeping traffic moving, their attention should be on eliminating street parking on high traffic roads rather than removing safe infrastructure that actually moves people.\nIt is clear that the Ford government does not seriously intend to improve mobility. They have failed to deliver viable transit infrastructure, and instead of taking accountability, they would rather waste tax dollars to rip up other governments' successful projects.\n"

It would also provide the ability to compel municipalities to collect and provide information to the province on existing bike lanes where a lane of traffic was removed.\"\nGiven that the province is presently ignoring the vast amount of evidence and research already gathered about bike lanes, what kind of evidence will it actually take seriously?\nOr is this issue going to be decided by the Premier's voluminous gut feelings?\nFord is not the mayor of any city. Let local democracy function without arbitrary and ignorant interventions from the province. Stay in your own lane, Ford!\n"

        "comment": "It's actually concerning to see the incompetence of our government on full display wasting time and resources trying to pass a bill like this. It has been studied and proven over and over and over again that the only way to reduce traffic is to reduce the amount of drivers on the road by providing alternative methods of transportation. It's not very hard to understand but for some reason the people that are making these decisions seem to completely be blind to the reality of the world we live in.\nWasting time and resources to rip out existing bike lanes not only will cause MORE traffic with lanes closed to construction, it will but both drivers of vehicles and cyclists in danger. Not only are you wasting tax payers money but the deaths of cyclists on the road with be on your hands after this bill passes.\n"

        "comment": "I am seconding other comments of a similar vein that question the legitimacy and usefulness of this legislation. It appears to be an overreach of provincial power, removing individuality of communities by forcing approvals through a Provincial conduit. While this may be appropriate in some cases, communities that are environmentally focused, like Guelph, where I live, traditionally have very high support for bike lanes and environmental assessments. The Premier making decisions for Toronto and requiring that all other municipalities fall in line is ludicrous. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election.\nThese are not new problems for growing cities and there is very deep literature that provides evidence for a number of solutions, none of which are removing bike lanes or environmental assessments. Alternative infrastructure such as high speed rail and mixed use housing, are typically the best option. This has been proven time and time again in studies across North America.\nFrankly, this government is a prime example of trying to implement policies that completely ignore public interest and desire, which leads to distrust and disinterest in our democracy. With the heightened tensions around politics these days it's insane that after a massive greenbelt scandal you would try to push legislation like this. We are all watching and following politics much more closely than any other time that I've been alive and I pray that the public is willing to wait for due-process justice instead of relying on a more traditional mob justice approach. Your job is to do what is best for the people you represent, it would be wise to remember that.\n"

New bike lanes should be permitted where local input and values support this. Perceived and real gridlock will not be solved by removing bike lanes. It will just encourage more folks to drive and thus creating more traffic. The safety that bike lanes provide is immense and should not be undervalued. I am deeply disappointed that this is even a conversation. People will die as a result of this legislation.\n"

The government should instead be focusing on decreasing this unsustainable practice and finish existing transit projects.\nIt may be frustrating for drivers to see when bikes are passing them by in bike lanes but simply put, it is other cars encumbering their journey parking and stopping negligently their rather than bikes. Enforcing existing road rules (such as not blocking the box or simply not stopping in the middle of traffic to let people out of a car) would alleviate many issues, on top of discouraging single-occupancy vehicles.\nIf bike lanes were in fact an issue that caused traffic, then why is it that our highways are the worst sources of traffic?\n"
