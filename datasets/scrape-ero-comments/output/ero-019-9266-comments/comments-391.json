        "comment": "This is a colossal waste of time and taxpayer money to rip out bike lanes that have already been installed. It's also massive overreach by the provincial government on what should be municipal issues (and which were decided on by Toronto city councillors). It's absurd that the Conservative Party (supposedly the party of small government) is introducing all this red tape and requiring provincial approval for, what again, is a strictly municipal issue. The evidence does not support that introducing bike lanes has any material negative impact on car travel times. Further, restricting bike lanes will make cyclists and pedestrians less safe. We have already reached record levels of cyclist and pedestrian fatalities this year. This legislation will ensure that people keep needlessly dying.\nLastly, the proposed highway 413 should not be moving ahead without environmental assessments. This government is selling out the future in order to double down on car dependency. You should focus on delivering on Metrolinx transit projects if you want to reduce vehicle congestion.\nAlso instead of wasting time on culture war issues, work on what should be the major provincial portfolios (fixing the housing crisis, the lack of family doctors, etc.)\n"

Making cycling less safe in order to make space for a handful more drivers on the roads is nonsense. I love in Ontario and I want to see more bike lanes on main roads because that's where we need them the most.\nThis short-sighted, irresponsible action is no worse than I would expect from this government, but I hope if this bill goes ahead, that when more cyclists are inevitably killed as a result, Premier Ford and everyone who enabled him are held accountable as murderers who would let Canadians die to save a couple seconds on their commute.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will set back the city a few decades. We can look to cities that lack public transport and biking infrastructure like Los Angeles, where the traffic is so bad people choose to stay at home, to know that having motor vehicles as the only form of transportation cannot scale with city size. We need viable alternatives to driving. Not only is this better for residents who choose not to drive, it is also better for those who choose to drive as the number of cars on the road is decreased.\nThe provincial government should not be adding red tap to city issues. The residents of the city are best placed to know what kinds of transportation infrastructure is required for their needs. The province should help them achieve these needs and not dictate what the province thinks they need.\nPersonally, I use bike lanes every day to get to work. I am fortunate that I can take protected bikes lanes alone my entire route and it is by far the most convient option. I take Tecumseth street to Adelaide and then follow Adelaide all the way to at Yonge. I also use the university bike lane to get around to various friends and complete shopping tasks.\nOn my commute, there are usually the same number of bikers alone Adelaide as there are vehicles. Assuming that each vehicle contains a single person, this proves to be a much more efficient use of space than a motor vehicle lane. There are so many bikes at times I end up in bike traffic, although unlike vehicle traffic, it does not slow down my commute by very much.\nI have had a large number of close encounters with cars outside of protected bikes lanes, to the point where I avoid biking if I cannot take a protected bike lane along all major streets along my route. Even in bike lanes, drivers can be agressive. I once had to force a car driving down the bike trail on lake shore to turn around and get off the bike lane. They were trying to get to a parking lot they missed and did not want to take the long way around. This was at night and had the driver not seen me he would have run me over in a dedicated bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely disappointed to see bill 212 proposed by the ministry of transportation. The bill is a display of critical misunderstandings regarding the benefits and impacts of bike infrastructure in major Canadian cities. Bike infrastructure, when it forms a complete and usable network, is orders of magnitude more efficient for moving people than cars. This is a simple fact that follows from the space that each mode takes. When our cities are growing faster than ever, it simply does not make sense to favour space inefficient transportation like cars over cycling.\nThe province should not be impeding the urban developments of major Canadian cities by adding additional red tape and bureaucracy. The plan would make cycling unnecessarily dangerous, lead to higher travel times, and increase the financial cost of building new infrastructure.\n- Ontario resident\n"

I take transit and, when it's safe and convenient, I bike. This proposal threatens the way I get around my city. It threatens the way thousands of people get around their cities in Ontario. Not only requiring provincial approval for every safe bike lane, (yes, every safe bike lane, because a safe bike lane cannot simply be painted in the gutter) but also ripping out existing bike lanes because drivers cannot handle taking up any less than 90% of the width of the road.\nCars are weapons. A cyclist cannot harm a driver. A driver can very easily kill a cyclist. The entitlement that drivers feel to hog the entirety of the transportation system gets people killed. Bike lanes save lives, and the promoters of this proposal will have blood on their hands.\nIf you want the roads to be less congested, you need fewer people to drive. Ripping out bike lanes is exactly contrary to that end. Ontario needs more bike lanes, and more numerous, more frequent, and cheaper transit options.\n"

        "comment": "This new policy on bike lanes is counterproductive. One new lane of cars doesn't fix traffic. This has been proven over and over since Robert Moses kept promising fixes in NYC in the '30s. It merely encourages more people to travel by car until the new lane is just as clogged with traffic a week later.\nThe reality is, the only way to reduce car traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Efficient and safe bike navigation in a city is one way to get to that. I'm not opposed to the idea of building out bike infrastructure on side streets, and that actually works pretty well in Vancouver, but requiring ministry permission for bike lanes on basically any public roadway does not get you there. It just delays any new bike lanes and discourages their use overall when we urgently need them.\nFurthermore, taking out the existing mentioned bike lanes is counterproductive even if the overall plan is to use the side streets. The side streets of Toronto are not fully connected, so cyclists have no choice but to use streets like Bloor to get from one area of the city to another. This means cyclists will end up in those streets regardless of the proposed changes, but by sharing lanes, cyclists are at much greater risk and drivers have a much more stressful commute having to carefully navigate around them.\nThe road sprawl required by car-centric housing developments is expensive to maintain, with downtowns effectively subsidizing the suburbs in cities and towns across the continent. It's good business sense for cities to encourage more density, and that's much easier to do when not every resident is reliant on owning and storing a car. Encouraging walking and cycling by designing streets that make those modes safe and comfortable will accomplish that. Studies on Bloor also showed that the bicycle traffic brought more business, so local business owners should be in favour of bike lanes too!\nA common talking point is that people can't bike in the winter. Looking at Montreal, this is untrue, and they get more snow than us in Toronto. There were few enough snow days last year that I could count them on one hand, and other than those, the bike lanes in Toronto were quite pleasant! It's certainly not as warm as being in a car, but by being active, it's much warmer than standing on a sidewalk waiting for a bus, which is already taken to be acceptable.\nBike lanes aren't causing the province's problems. Respectfully, please avoid creating more problems with regressive legislation, and let cities build the infrastructure their residents actually voted for.\n"

Driving with cyclists mixed in with regular car traffic is stressful and scary for all parties involved, and makes driving more difficult. I strongly disapprove of the province over stepping its bounds and enforcing what a city decides is best for its people. The additional red tape for all municipalities is extremely inefficient, and why should someone from one city be making a decision for the folks in another? In summary, Bill 212 should never be passed. It is clear partisan politics, instead of looking out for all Ontarians.\n"

Looking at the rest of the world, it's obvious that bike infrastructure will be used heavily if it's well connected and high quality.  Adding an extra lane will add extra space for cars, but reducing gridlock isn't going to happen if everybody needs to drive.  If the numbers of cyclists increased, it would have a far larger impact on reducing the number of cars than adding this useless extra lane.  This requires adding more bike infrastructure in the area, not reducing what we already have.\nPlease reconsider this bill.\n"

This bill would add unnecessary bureaucracy to urban planning across the province, and it would specifically interfere with municipalities' ability to serve their constituents, many of whom support having the freedom to choose how to commute, which includes roads that have safe bike lanes. The research on this issue is essentially settled: bike lanes serve an important need by providing a real and reliable option to commuters for how to get around, in addition to public transportation, sidewalks, and motor vehicles. All of these options should be available to Ontarians; removing bike lanes and slowing the expansion of cities' bike networks will only endanger the lives of people who do not drive and worsen commuting times for everyone by forcing road users to all use the same infrastructure. Bloor, Yonge, and University are not going to be easier to travel through for cars or for cyclists, if everyone who currently bikes on these roads is not able to travel on a separated, protected bike lane. There are no viable side streets that can replace these bike lanes, and even if there were, it would not be a reason to make these major streets, which span large distances in the city, less useful to both cyclists and drivers.\nI reject this bill's heavy-handed and one-size-fits-all approach to infrastructure and I strongly advise the province not to proceed.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's current government is urging us to \"Choose cleaner travel choices, such as public transit or bicycle\", on their own website for climate change.\nI do just that. I cycle from North York to downtown when possible in Toronto, and when I'm not able to do that, I take the TTC and then proceed to grab a Bike Share bike to finish the last mile of my journey. I'm healthier, I'm happier and my fitness tracker is happy as well, all while not introducing any new CO2 in the atmosphere by dragging down a gigantic metal box to clog up everyone else's commute. Owning a car and paying for parking already costs hundreds of dollars per month, and that's not even factoring in the cost of the car itself, it's mostly just insurance. This is less money being spent in Ontario on more productive goods and services.\nUnfortunately, this bill is proposing to remove any semblance of protection I have on major bicycle routes, leaving me to either stop cycling or to mingle with car traffic, causing even more congestion, emissions and tire particles flying everywhere.\nDon't get me wrong, I'd love to be able to sit in a quiet, climate controlled car, listen to music and get to my destinations within 10 minutes. But if we all want to do that in our cities (and we do), it's impossible to accommodate just due to the space required alone. Much more car-centric cities such as Houston, TX have not managed to fix traffic, what makes us think we will? You don't need to look to Asia and Europe to see what bicycle lanes can do for our society; just stop by Montreal and see for yourself. With way more snow and with a colder climate, they're managing just fine... no, they're thriving!\nIf you want to cast shame on Canada on the global stage, this bill will do just that. We're already a laughing stock for our oversized vehicles and our laughably bad or non-existent subway networks. Any promises we made to the UN or other organizations in terms of our emission targets will be null and void. We're supposed to be leading the world by example, but instead we're looking out only for ourselves and our comfort in futile attempts to drive large cars to & from the same place at the same times every day. If that's the path we want to take, don't be surprised when other countries start polluting more as well.\nDo not \"rip out\" our bicycle lanes just for the sake of populist rhetoric. Do not step in to micromanage traffic, let our cities do that. This bill needs to die on the vine, full stop.\n"

Just for some time in the future, I'm betting we will pay to put them back. The point of conservatives is to not spend money like liberals.\nThis is also adding more red tape for municipal projects, which is the opposite of what being conservative means.\nThis will increase government employees just to analyze future proposals sent in by municipalities if they want to build lanes. Again, going against typical conservative politics.\nI've been feeling lately that this is the most fiscally liberal conservative government this province has had and worsening the deficit.\nIt is typical conservative to like cars over any other form of transportation fine. But theres no need to spend the money on tearing down what municipalities want for their communities. Better off focussing on the413 and getting that started before rushing this dumb bill targeted at downtown toronto.\nWhat about the rest of ontario and their needs. Building a road to the ring of fire so ontario can once again be a resource leader.\nAs a driver too i dont want cyclists on the roads, same way i dont want pedestrians on the road, they impede traffic and giving them a lane is the logical thing to do since bikes are slow and small. If i hit one i dent my car and my insurance goes up. IF they get hit they break bones or die. Doing this while also pausing the gas tax is also weird, 413 money and all of that better be coming only from taxes paid by motorists.\nAs the city grows there is no room to expand streets further after this demolition of bike lanes. They were clogged before the bike lanes and that was with idk 1 million less people in the GTA. This wont fix anything anywhere as the population grows.\nI like to drive, i dont like to drive downtown, and its not because there are too many cyclists its because there are too many cars. If we can just get these drivers in bikes they would be out of my way and i could drive bloor smoothly. roundabouts could be interesting too because stop lights slow me down.\nMayor show won her mayorship with this policy when campaigning. People in that city voted for her to add bike lanes alot closer to today than people voted for the conservatives. Meaning that her goals are alot more up to date as to what city of toronto residents want from their city.\n"

However, there is ZERO need for bike lanes from South Kingsway/Jane, west to Islington (and beyond).  The usage of those bike lanes is vanishingly small.  The vehicle congestion, however, is unfathomably bad.  Further, the streets that serve as \u201cescape routes\u201d from that congestion have become much more heavily trafficked, with egregious speeding.  Sadly, Council Perks and Mayor Chow have negligently ignored our repeated exhortations to examine the impact of these bikes lanes.  Thank you for this opportunity.\n"
