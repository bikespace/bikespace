        "comment": "Bill 212 - ERO 019-9266  Reducing Gridlock, As commentary on ERO 019-9266, Bill 212 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024,\nI support municipal authority in determining bike lane development without added provincial oversight. Municipal representatives are closer to their constituents and better able to respond to the needs/wants of the community regarding both vehicle and bike transit as well as growth and development in neighborhoods. Research from major cities (New York, Paris, Copenhagen, Montreal) shows that bike lanes significantly reduce car commuter times.\nI applaud municipalities' efforts to decrease emissions and acknowledge the impact of increased bike ridership, as seen in Toronto, where bike trips rose by 4 million over eight years. More cyclists can alleviate road congestion and reduce vehicle numbers, contributing to lower emissions.\nCycling has a much smaller carbon footprint than cars, with the environmental impact of bike manufacturing offset within a year of use, making bike lanes crucial for combating climate change. As well, evidence shows that a population that bikes more is healthier, easing strain on both the health care system as well as traffic.\nCycling is an affordable, sustainable lifestyle choice and cyclists are equally entitled as drivers to arrive safely to their destinations.\nThis bill aims to relocate utility infrastructure, potentially leading to the expropriation of more agricultural and Greenbelt lands, which are vital for food supply  and carbon sinks. Ontarians have made it clear we do not want to develop the Greenbelt for any reason.\nIn this vein, I think that  thorough environmental assessments for Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass is essential to ensure compliance with species at risk legislation. Humans rely on the ecosystem to enable our current way of life. This highway threatens the wellbeing of all Ontarians. We know that more highways do nothing to reduce gridlock\u2014 safe cycling and expansive public transit do. I firmly oppose the expropriation of Greenbelt and agricultural lands for highway projects.\nI short, I oppose Bill 212 as it currently stands and see it as a threat to improved safety, security, and quality of life for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "The debate over bike lanes on major streets like Yonge Street, Bloor Street, and University Avenue in Toronto is highly polarized, with some arguing that removing these lanes would improve traffic flow and others emphasizing the negative impact on cyclists and the broader urban landscape. Examining both perspectives highlights the complex role bike lanes play in Toronto\u2019s traffic ecosystem.\nThose in favor of removing bike lanes often argue that it would alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow. Major streets like Yonge, Bloor, and University serve as crucial arteries in Toronto\u2019s downtown core. Supporters argue that dedicating lanes exclusively to cars would allow more vehicles to move through these busy areas efficiently. Without bike lanes, wider car lanes would allow for smoother traffic, reducing bottlenecks caused by cars maneuvering around cyclists. Proponents also note that removing bike lanes could facilitate the movement of public transit, especially buses, which often have to navigate around both cyclists and private vehicles. This could, in theory, improve the speed and reliability of surface transit.\nAdditionally, some people argue that bike lanes on these high-traffic streets are underused, especially during winter months when fewer cyclists are on the road. They contend that bike lanes are an inefficient use of limited urban space, particularly given the high volume of commuters driving in and out of the city. By removing bike lanes, they argue, Toronto would be better able to meet the needs of the majority of commuters.\nHowever, removing bike lanes could have negative repercussions for traffic and city life. Bike lanes play a crucial role in encouraging sustainable, non-car transportation in Toronto, a city plagued by congestion and high pollution levels. A reduction in bike lanes could discourage people from cycling, thereby increasing the number of cars on the road, potentially exacerbating congestion rather than alleviating it. By keeping bike lanes, Toronto can promote cycling as an alternative mode of commuting, which helps reduce the overall number of vehicles on the road.\nStudies also suggest that bike lanes improve the safety of all road users. Without designated bike lanes, cyclists may be forced to ride in car lanes, increasing the likelihood of accidents and slowing down traffic as cars navigate around them. This can lead to stop-and-go traffic, increasing both commute times and emissions. Additionally, keeping bike lanes provides continuity across Toronto\u2019s network, making the city safer and more accessible for cyclists.\nFrom an environmental standpoint, bike lanes align with Toronto\u2019s goals of reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable urban growth. Reducing reliance on cars helps decrease air pollution and aligns with the city\u2019s climate action targets. Economically, bike-friendly infrastructure is increasingly seen as an asset; businesses along bike routes often see increased foot traffic, as cyclists are more likely to stop and shop than car drivers. Removing bike lanes could negatively impact local businesses and contradict the city\u2019s broader environmental and economic goals.\nIn sum, while removing bike lanes from Yonge, Bloor, and University might seem like a way to improve car traffic flow, it would likely have broader, unintended consequences for congestion, safety, the environment, and the local economy. Instead of removing bike lanes, Toronto could explore hybrid solutions, like optimizing signal timing, adding dedicated bus lanes, or creating alternate routes for cars. Maintaining bike lanes on these major streets helps to support a balanced approach to urban mobility that accommodates a variety of transportation needs, rather than prioritizing one mode over others.\n"

Unfortunately, the space within downtown Toronto where those bike lanes are installed is limited, and as such can only accommodate a limited number of cars.

        "comment": "This proposal is profoundly backwards and ignorant of both what makes an excellent city and what those who live in cities need - not to mention the cost of removing bike lanes that quite literally were just built.\nI cannot begin to say how disappointed I am this proposal was ever drafted.\nSince I caught wind of this, I often look at the amount of people in bike lanes compared to those in cars, and am surprised to see that not only are the numbers of people even, but the footprint of bicycles is so much smaller and allows for significantly more efficient traffic. If removed, the bicycles would instead join the car traffic; putting people at risk, increasing frustration for city drivers, and making the experience of existing outside of a car in the city unpleasant. Additionally, I truly do not believe adding one more lane would resolve gridlock in this city. Urban planners across the board mention focusing on building & supporting alternatives to cars as the most effective way to reduce traffic - this would do the opposite. I do not bike as often as I would like to in the city because I do not feel safe if I'm unable to take dedicated bike lanes to my destination, and this is deeply unfortunate.\nTo end, this proposal prioritizes the few (truly, the few - appearing otherwise as they take up a comical amount of space compared to other modes of transportation) to built an unhealthier, louder, and more inefficient city that would be forced to bend to the whims of a premier that wants to micromanage a city he does not even live in instead of listening to those that we elected.\n"

        "comment": "If this proposal was actually about saving commuters time, it would be about improving our public transit systems and encouraging different methods than driving for getting around the province. Through induced demand, we can get cars off the most congested highway and all of north America on top of letting those who can't afford cars freedom and autonomy.\nBut instead , we completely ignore genuine solutions to the proposed problems, and instead cater to manufactured grievances between drivers and cyclists. All the while slipping in unrelated and incredibly unpopular details so they pass unnoticed in the process.\nRemoving bike lanes will not save drivers time, as every biker who can afford to will start driving, resulting in more congestion. Without these lanes, cyclists will be forced take up a whole lane, effectively equating to another car on the road while risking the life of the cyclist. Business's rely on the increased foot traffic, parent's rely on bike lanes for transporting their kids. We've had 6 cyclist deaths this year from cyclists being forced to merge into traffic due to obstructions of the few bike lanes we have. Remove them completely and this number will rise.\nI myself have multiple lasting injuries from having to look out for cars while cycling. It's too much, too threatening to bike in Toronto on roads without bike lanes. Roads where you are forced to dodge sewer grates, large potholes, and drivers using the right side of the road designated for cyclists as a place to park. Simply painting the right side of the road is not good enough to ensure cyclist safety.\nThis is all on top of the fact that the bill provides exemption from the federal environmental assessments of building highway 413, saving money for all of those involved in its construction while habitats get unnecessarily destroyed. The aforementioned principle of induced demand will cause more drivers, further adding to congestion 212 claims to remedy.\nThis bill is not in the best interests of public on the surface or at its core, and solidifies my belief that this government less interested in the betterment of the province by supporting those who need help the most, and instead wasting tax dollars by destroying something that was designed to solve the problem the bill falsely claims it will.\nI am firmly against Bill 212.\n"

We have induced an insatiable demand for cars in our city, making traffic an inevitability.\nWhat next, bulldozing businesses on Bloor to build even more lanes? The only solution to car traffic is viable alternatives to driving such as trains between cities and bikes and busses within cities move magnitudes more people in far less space.  This act will clog the streets with more cars and those who continue to bike without protection will die at a great moral and financial cost to society.\nFurthermore, the justifications that have been posed are using outdated data and the reasons have been systematically disproven. There are decades of studies and data from cities around the world showing that more lanes and more cars results in more car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist in Toronto for over 10 years and have seen how the expansion of bike lanes has made commuting by bike so much safer and more popular for me and people of all ages (including seniors and children/families). Every person on a bike is one less person in a car or in an overcrowded TTC subway car, streetcar or bus. We've also seen how installing bike lanes is GOOD for local businesses (e.g. small businesses along Bloor in the Annex), and there is NO evidence that bike lanes substantially impact travel times for cars or emergency response vehicles. The City of Toronto does very thorough due diligence in studying proposed bike lanes to ensure there is no significant adverse effect on people in cars or emergency response vehicles. And these bike lanes save lives!!! The provincial government is acting irresponsibly to make it harder to install more bike lanes, and to remove the bike lanes in Toronto that I, and thousands of other cyclists, rely on to commute safely.  This is a purely political move to appeal to voters who live outside of Toronto and who commute by car--who are the REAL contributors to increased traffic--that is not supported by evidence. It will waste millions of dollars and worst of all, will no doubt result in injury or possibly fatalities on Toronto's streets. Shame on the Minister of Transportation and the Premier for prioritizing this action over actions that will actually improve lives for Ontarians, like investing in health care or education.\n"

The intensification of gridlock has everything to do with rapid increase to population density due to huge condo towers with no infrastructure adjustment to support the influx of residents and their vehicles.\nMy commute to work includes main streets with bike lanes and without.  In the past 5 years, Bloor St West has actually moved quicker and had less traffic as I really do think drivers have switched to bikes on that route. The other street I take is college west of Ossington and it is a disaster every day all day.\nThe construction to remove the bike lanes will clog up traffic more - PLEASE don\u2019t add more construction to the city! It\u2019s already out of control.\nThe FIX is to get all departments communicating so that a road is only dug up once (fix streetcar tracks at the same time as replacing old pipes - not one year apart!) AND invest in better timed stop lights. Drive west on College between Dovercourt and Dufferin at 8:45am and you\u2019ll see the problem clear as day.\nThank you for reading\n"
