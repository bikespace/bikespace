        "comment": "I am 73 years old. I have been bicycling on the streets of Toronto since I moved here at age 10. I bike between 1000 and 2000 kilometres a year. The addition of bike lanes in Toronto has made my life significantly safer. It has also increased the revenue of many business along the routes. Please make a science-based decision on this contentious issue. Pandering to a vocal opposition for votes is not a reason to threaten the safety and lives of cyclists. Just because the current obese premier cannot ride a bicycle is not a reason to remove the bike lanes. And as an aside, the taxpayers of Ontario just paid several thousand dollars to repair my arm that was badly broken in a collision. A vehicle driver simply moved into my lane without looking. How many 100s of accidents involving bikes never make the news?\nFord should be ashamed of his proposals. Why would he rather see people in hospitals and morgues that safely cycling around the city?\nMany local businesses along these streets have voiced support for the bike lanes. The Bloor-Annex Business Improvement Area, for instance, put out a release last week saying monthly customer spending had increased since lanes were installed along Bloor Street, and removing them would be \"disastrous for the area.\"\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to tear out Toronto\u2019s bike lanes isn\u2019t just shortsighted\u2014it\u2019s a reckless disregard for human life. Bike lanes are not \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d or optional; they are lifesaving infrastructure that stands between our loved ones and fatal traffic collisions. Study after study shows the truth: cities with protected bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic deaths across the board, from cyclists to pedestrians and drivers. Removing these lanes is a choice to put lives at risk.\nConsider this: in cities with strong biking infrastructure, traffic deaths drop by up to 44%. That\u2019s not a number to ignore\u2014that\u2019s countless lives saved. Without these protections, we\u2019re condemning cyclists to unsafe streets where they are forced to share lanes with fast-moving traffic. This isn\u2019t a hypothetical; it\u2019s happening here and now. Just look at the families who have lost parents, siblings, and children because Toronto\u2019s streets haven\u2019t been made safe enough for cyclists. Each tragedy stands as a stark reminder that our infrastructure is failing to protect its citizens.\nWe don\u2019t need more cars clogging our streets; we need safe, equitable roads. Every family touched by a traffic tragedy understands what\u2019s at stake. Are we really willing to roll back safety to serve a narrow agenda? Removing these lanes isn\u2019t just a step backward; it\u2019s a dangerous leap toward more preventable deaths, more senseless tragedies, and a city that values cars over lives.\nThis is the bottom line: supporting bike lanes is supporting safety, progress, and the future of Toronto. Anything less is a vote for regression and preventable loss. Stand up for a Toronto that values its people\u2019s lives\u2014keep the bike lanes, expand them, and make our streets safe for everyone.\n"

It so so much easier and safer to get around the city to shop, eat and get from place to place with a bike. A bike is more accessible for a majority of the population, reduces congestion and pollution in the city. The downtown portion of the city of Toronto has seen more and more people use bikes every single year. The bike share system has seen a major increase in usage year over year. These people need proper and safe infrastructure to get around.\n"

The traffic times and gridlock have increased dramatically (disaster when the TTC is shut down which it frequently  is) and the lanes are very little used. I know have fire engines frequently using my small east west street to avoid Bloor. Gord Perks is all consumed with bike lanes and eliminating cars to an extent that is destructive of our neighbourhood  (Bloor West, High Park being prime examples) - PS not anti bike lanes, I ride ant i these lanes that eliminated 50% of road capacity on arterial road too far from downtown to be practical for cycle commuters.

Educate drivers that bikes will have to take the full lane, and should not be passed\n2. Ensure bikes have a path across railways and busy streets\n3. Measure collisions after you remove the lanes\n4. Charge drivers for the roads they will now own (and damage) via a congestion tax\n5. Measures the actual change in congestion\n6. Designated side streets should be zoned commercial so businesses can be accessible on bike.\nThis policy move is so short sighted, I\u2019m so disappointed with Ford, but we need data, and if we\u2019re going to use side streets, they need to connect and be active.\n"

        "comment": "Excellent proposal. As an Etobicoke resident I was involved with the Bloor West (Jane to Kipling) public consultation since day one. It was a farce, everyone knew that that the decision was already made. The forced implementation was a disaster. Traffic gridlock is unbearable at Bloor and adjacent main arteries (Dundas and Queensway). The City believes that favouring bicycles over vehicles will force people to use public transit. Meanwhile, public transit (TTC) is not ready to take the extra ridership. Unsafe, unreliable, crowded.( Bike riders bring their bicycles in the subway during rush hour when they don\u2019t suppose to do it, walking in front of TTC Supervisors that don\u2019t enforce the rules. The Queen streetcar became the CAMH mobile shelter, mental unstable people sleeping, and even relieving themselves on it, etc).\nI fully support the proposal. Finally, a government agency making common sense decisions and listening to the constituens!\n"

It has taken away one lane for cars turning right or going straight. Now ALL cars have to drive in one lane to turn left or right or go straight and it is a nightmare for cars!! Traffic congestion between Spadina and Strachan, south of King st is horrific. And now they\u2019ve taken away a traffic lane that helps drivers returning home from the gardener expressway to Fort York Blvd which is a densely populated area. There are bike lanes on Spadina ,Fort York Blvd and Strachan. Adding another one that removes a lane of traffic on Dan Leckie Way from Lakeshoere north to Fort York Blvd should not be allowed\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes in the city of Toronto will be devastating.\nI\u2019m both a driver and a pedestrian and love the bike lanes. They keep cyclists separate from the roadway and I feel much safer driving in areas with bike lanes. When I have to share the road with bikes, like on King St. W. and Dundas St. W., I\u2019m often caught behind a slow bicycle that can\u2019t be passed safely because of parked cars or construction on the roadway. So I have to reduce speed to share the road per the law - the cyclist will have moved over as much as possible and there\u2019s just not enough space on city streets.\nThe bike lanes allow cyclists to move safely through the city and actually remove obstacles for drivers. When driving along Bloor St. W. I never find the traffic too bad - the biggest delays I encounter are because of left-hand turners! But also general congestion - there are simply too many cars in the road. A safer cycling infrastructure gets more people on bikes and off the roads, improving traffic for those who do need to drive.\nI also think education needs to be done about how driving in a city is different than driving in the suburbs. There are many road users sharing the space, drivers, cyclists, walkers, and the road has to be built to safely accommodate  all these people. Drivers can\u2019t speed down Bloor St. at 60 km/h. It is a slower space to keep everyone safe.\nI adamantly believe in the importance of maintaining  the existing bike lanes and expanding that infrastructure. Anecdotally, it\u2019s been easier to drive through Bloor St. downtown since the bike lanes were installed.\n"

Cyclist deaths are at a record high, public infrastructure is falling apart, and the party that touts its fiscal conservatism is practically lighting money on fire to achieve a \u201csolution\u201d which will barely move the needle for affected drivers at the expense of pedestrians, cyclists, and communities at large. Every other megacity in the world has focused on improving mobility without cars; why is this government so focused on holding Toronto back? Truly embarrassing.\n"

These streets are the middle of the densest area in the country, the only way to move people more efficiently through this area is to get people OUT of cars in into more active modes of transportation.  This will increase injuries and deaths, hinder local businesses and harm anyone who doesn\u2019t have the money or ability to drive a car.  It is a classist policy and total overreach of municipal jurisdiction.\n"
