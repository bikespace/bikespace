        "comment": "I am writing my comments to express my concern and disappointment with multiple parts of bill 212. For the safety of children, the economic impact of households, and the cost to the government of Ontario / the Ontario tax payers, I feel like this bill adds multiple negatives to many communities.\nOctober 31, 2024 Addendum\nThe removal of bike lanes from major areas not only hurts businesses but also increases the risk of cyclist injury, increases induced demand, and removes the possibility of reducing car traffic. Bike lanes provide safe, cost effective, and environmentally friendly method to travel around the city, while also reducing automobile traffic. I do not agree that the province should mandate the removal of projects that have just been completed and the removal of alternative forms of transportation. I have broken down each aspect while attaching sources along with my points.\nAdditionally, see the following link that includes numerous studies to show how bicycle lanes can change a city for the better.\nhttps://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/economic-benefits\nSAFETY\n- The City of Toronto Cycling Study demonstrates how the population of Toronto has been increasing with the demand and desire for cycling infrastructure. An excerpt from the Nanos study:\n\"Toronto residents who reported being utilitarian cyclists (meaning they either cycle to work, school, to go shopping or visit friends) has increase from 29 per cent in 2009 to 44 per cent in 2019.\" (Nanos)\n44% of Toronto residents that cycle as an everyday choice of commute is an incredibly large percentage, regardless if it's 1 day per month of multiple times per day. The demand for cycling has been increasing (Nanos) and this means that cycling infrastructure is key in ensuring that cyclists are safe. The bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge provide a safe barrier from car traffic and parking spaces, ensuring that vehicles aren't hit and cyclists aren't killed. Removing these cycling lanes would reduce people's alternatives to driving and still not separate the cyclists who do not mind cycling on roads. I would encourage all MPPs who stand-by this bill to grab a bicycle and ride down any of these three streets and compare that to riding in a lane of traffic or in a bicycle lane with no curb protection to understand how safe one feels when riding these lanes. Not only for adults, but children as well.\n- Additionally, we have all seen both the impact of bad driving and bad cycling in our communities. The main difference is that cars weigh an average of 4,000 lbs and can travel at speeds excess of 100km/h in less than 10 seconds, while bicycles weigh <20lbs and travel on average 14-25 kms/hr. The size of a vehicle along with the dangers of distracted and reckless driving increase the possibility of fatality to pedestrians and other drivers.\nCOST EFFICIENCY\n- For a commuter, the cost of driving a vehicle versus cycling is an incredible difference. With gas prices, maintenance, and the cost of the vehicle itself, the initial cost of buying a bicycle is quickly overshadowed by the cost of a car. For reference, I have both a car and a bicycle. With a fuel + maintenance cost of $20.59/100km (based on my 3 year average), the yearly cost of commuting within the City of Toronto from home to work (In bicycle appropriate months) is $160.48, while the price of my yearly bicycle maintenance (Average from the past 3 years) is <$20 for chain lubricant. Additionally, the monthly costs of parking in my building ($175) and car insurance ($138.35) brings my yearly vehicle costs to $3,760.20 just for storage and insurance. This is on-top of the initial cost to purchase my vehicle ($15,000). Increasing bike lanes and alternative forms of transportation would save me this amount as I would be able to get rid of my car in favor of cycling and public transit. But, the move towards a car-dependent city is not favorable to my finances.\n- For the city & province, the cost difference between bike lanes versus car lanes is also very large. I have attached a study from Portland, OR that breaks down the costs analyzed between bike lanes and car lanes. In summary, $60 million would allow for the replace 300 miles of bike-ways versus 1 mile of a 4-lane urban freeway (Weigand, McNeil, Dill). Please read this attached study as it shows the great investments that bicycle lanes can be for cities in saving money.\nENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY\n- Bike lanes and the use of bicycles is no-doubt a more environmentally friendly and healthy form of transportation. The amount of emissions that a vehicle uses is vastly inferior to the amount that a bicycle uses.\n1. Not including CO2 emissions, vehicles emit Methane and Nitrous Oxide, both which are toxic to humans, while bicycles emit nothing.\n2. Bicycle lanes do not receive the same amount of wear as road lanes due to the limited weight, width of tires, and the oils / liquids spilled onto the roads from leaky oil plugs, coolant, and hoses.\n3. Noise pollution is significantly reduced with bicycles due to the lack of horns, tire friction, and engine noises. Here is a video of the differences in noise that different forms of vehicles make and the impacts it has on communities. In summary, at 10 minutes, the presenter measures the noise of bicycles versus cars. Bicycles had lower decibel reading of 65dBA (cyclists that are chatting) while passing cars were on average 73dBA (heavier vehicles were 76dBA, which is 4x louder than bicycles as dBA is a logarithmic measurement). A motorcycle had a decibel reading of 102dBA (equivalent to a car horn).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTV-wwszGw8\n4. Bicycles encourage exercise while vehicles do not.\nSCHEDULE 3 - HIGHWAY 413 ACT, 2024\nI do not agree that our province will be building large projects while putting into law an exemption from environmental studies. Environmental assessments identify potential environmental impacts, alternative solutions, and mitigations while also allowing stakeholders to voice their concerns. While I understand that the project is crucial in keeping Ontario moving, I do not agree in removing any processes (especially environmental protections) to simply keep projects cheaper or improve the speed of planning & development. This not only removes the ability to mitigate possible environmental damage but creates a precedent that specific projects can be exempt from whatever laws and requirements are put in place. I would much rather see alternatives in cost & time cutting rather than ones that tackle environmental assessments as we should be keeping our province's environment a high priority for our children and future generations. I have attached a link that breaks down the need and benefits of Environmental Assessments. https://velosiaims.com/the-significant-role-of-environmental-impact-ass\u2026\nSCHEDULE 4 - HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT\nI do not agree that our province should be dictating what municipalities are able to build in their community, especially items such as bike lanes or roads. This is for three reasons:\n1. As per the Municipal Act, 2001, outside of a few specific cases, municipalities do not need direct provincial permission to build or maintain roads. If bike lanes are now being approved provincially, there should be an equal review and approval process for local roads. This should be especially true when local roads cost more money to build & maintain, and take longer to complete due to size, materials, and the diversions caused to traffic, or the induced demand caused to these communities.\n2. This adds another level of bureaucracy to developing any new bike lanes which can stall or delay projects, at the expense of the Ontario tax payers. These reviews and assessments cost time, money, and reduce the efficiency of building critical infrastructure projects that can help increase driving alternatives and reduce the amount of people driving.\n3. This removes autonomy from cities that are able to accordingly plan with locals and councilors that  the people in those areas voted for. My neighbors and I have voted for multiple candidates in our municipal riding over the years as they have specific goals and plans for our community that align with our vision for where we and our children want to live. Seeing Members of Provincial Parliament making decisions on areas that they do not live in is (from a personal perspective) infuriating and insulting to our communities. Our municipal leaders and councilors should be making these decisions, not being overwritten by upper levels of government that do not live anywhere near our area.\nAlternatively, I would much rather see public voting or decisions made by our community rather than the provincial government making decisions for myself, my business, and my community, at the expense of tax payers like myself, neighbors, friends, and family.\nFinal Note: As I was writing this comment, I stumbled upon a video discussing the removal of bike lanes in Toronto that makes strong points of the benefits of cycling. Please watch through the video and read through the hundreds of comments that are against this change and intrusion onto bicycle lanes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FZDEehlaC4&list=LL&index=1\n"

        "comment": "This proposed piece of legislation is not only an overreach in what should be decided by local communities and their municipalities, but counterproductive to its stated goals. While it seems intuitive that reducing the amount of space dedicated to car traffic would increase congestion, developing robust bike and transit networks in big cities is in fact the most effective way to reduce congestion. Indeed, if these modes of transportation are made safe and convenient, fewer people will be on the road, leading to drops in traffic, even if fewer car lanes are available, as bike and transit lanes are able to move more people with less space.\nA lot of improvement to most Ontarian cities' bike networks still need to be done to fully reap the benefits they can provide once well connected throughout their cities. This legislation would not only halt, but set back such progress by multiple years, which will leave Ontarians with no choice but to drive everywhere in a more congested city than before.\nPlease reconsider this piece of legislation and help protect the safety of cyclist and reduce long term congestion in cities.\n"

        "comment": "Perhaps the government of Ontario should look to other world class cities for guidance on how to safely and efficiently move people. Good examples would be London GB who use a vehicle tax to help maintain public transit and road infrastructure while also encouraging citizens to use alternate forms of transportation, or Paris FR who are implementing a limited vehicle city centre. These measures work because all data shows that cars cause traffic congestion, not bicycle lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Conservatives have made false claims about bicycle lanes: They state that the installation of bicycle lanes used data collected during COVID-19. The lanes were installed during and after the shutdowns, but the data to justify them was collected from the years before. The data was collected in the \"Before Times\". Therefore the data reflect normal city traffic. The bike lanes are justified with good, accurate data.\nThe Conservative Party of Ontario claims that winter is an impediment to cycling. First, if the Premier can shirk his duties by riding a snowmobile in March when Ontario cities, Windsor, Toronto and Ottawa were besieged by anti-science anti-vaxxers, then anyone in Ontario can bike in winter. You get a coat, mittens, boots and you can survive winter. Just as you would if you were to catch the bus or walk the dog. Ontarians ski, snowboard, play hockey, sled, build snowmen, attend outdoor festivals in the winter. Winter activities are not only possible, but are celebrated in Canada.\nConversely, cars struggle in the winter too. Again, when the Premier called into CP24 while using his phone in January 2022 -- flouting the distracted driving laws -- he claimed to be digging trapped drivers out of the snow. Cars were trapped in the snow. Driving is possible because municipalities have plows, salt trucks and snow removal. Give the same capital to cyclists, we could cycle during the cold winters.\nThe streets are crowded because a car, with a 200 sq.ft. footprint carries one person on average. In comparison, a bicycle takes up a tenth the space, and weights 1% a car. By increasing use of bicycles, you remove bulky, space- and energy-inefficient motor vehicles, giving more room to necessary transportation of goods and services. Also we create a healthier population, saving on healthcare. Budget savings everywhere for the tax payer. Ontarians would also save money, by reducing car-ownership, insurance rates, maintenance costs. More money in our pockets would boost the economy, not hurt it.\nCities across Canada, North America and the world are independently making planning decisions to move away from car-dependency towards alternative transportation methods, public transit and active movement. This government is bucking the global trend. Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal, New York, Paris are all wrong, but somehow, a bunch of MPPs without planning or consultation experience know better than everyone else in the world? How arrogant! This government fouled up their gas-pump stickers and license plates! A group of elected officials, who in the mandate letters agreed to forgo planning and assessment are asking others to prove success, but when the federal government asked them for similar proof, they can not produce any for themselves. Hypocrisy!\nIn the past months, the news has been littered with pieces about automobiles killing pedestrians, driving through homes and schools, and vehicular assaults on the police. This government needs to realize that cars are dangerous. What kills businesses more: a 3 tonnes crashing through a shop window? or a shopper on a cruiser bike?\n"

        "comment": "AGAINST\nI love to drive. It can be convenient, safe and fun in many situations. With that said investment in alternative ways of getting around is key for a truly free city, as it gives options to residents. Removing bike lanes will only make public roads more unsafe. I dodge a lot of bikers in my city. The difference is I don't want people off bikes (my drive is often also full of car traffic, more cars is not ideal) I want them safely away from my vehicle on dedicated paths.\nAdditional government oversight - municipal planning is slowed when having to seek approval from the Provincial Government. This strikes me as odd from a government that has prided itself on removing or streamlining unnecessary bureaucracy. This will only serve to slow the progress of developing much needed urban infrastructure (another government policy priority base on all the ads I'm seeing about it).\nFreedom - cities need developed options for commuters to get around, whether it's by car, transit, walking or biking. In Canada we seem to think that biking is for children, but it truly is a mode of transit for many. Cars will always be around, and as a driver myself I will likely always prefer to drive. But it's great to have options when driving feels impractical, and I want those other options to be safe and sustainable. Not everyone can or should drive either, cars are expensive in a time of financial stress on many (as you can see by the dramatic slide in vehicle sales these past two years).\nTemporary fix for congestion - adding additional lanes to public streets will only work in the short term, until residents are incentivized away from other methods of getting around and seek driving as well. This is illustrated by Braess's Paradox (linked). It can work the other way as well, if no effort is placed in driving and everyone is forced into transit, it will also become crowded. The key is balance between the many options giving residents the FREEDOM to choose which works best for them.\nPublic safety - biking will never really go away, especially as cars remain expensive. Without safe and complete routes for cyclists, they will be forced into traffic, which will lead to deaths. Additionally this will ironically slow traffic as cars and bikes are reduced to the same speed as they mingle on public streets.\nWith the federal public service return to work mandate I've witnessed a massive increase in car traffic on the way to work on the 417. Most, it seems, have one person in each car. If people had options to get to work I truly believe that the flow of traffic would be reduced, so people wouldn't have an hour and a half commute both ways (downtown Ottawa parking is also a nightmare).\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply frustrated and concerned about this extremely frivolous and irresponsible legislation. The fact that government will move forward with the segment of this bill that allows the province to arbitrarily - and without any oversight or consultation - remove pieces of infrastructure that were installed by the municipal government is an insult to the taxpayers whose money was spent (and is now going to be wasted) to now get rid of it.\nThe devolution of certain responsibilities down to the municipal governments of this province is an integral part of what makes our democracy work. Municipal governments are able to respond more acutely and more directly to the needs of their constituents than the provincial government. Therefore I believe that this bill will not result in more efficient infrastructure implementations, but in fact, the opposite. It will represent egregious overreach in exchange for no discernable benefit, delegitimizing our local democracy in the process.\nWhat is more frustrating is that the bill ignores decades of established urban planning logic. Study after study has confirmed that making way for more cars on our roads simply induces more demand for them, leading to a situation where there can never be enough supply to accommodate demand. Countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany have discovered time and time again that the best way to tackle traffic issues in their cities is by providing alternative modes of transportation such as bike lanes, improved dedicated pedestrian rights of way, and high-quality public transportation.\nThe removal of urban bike lanes will also result in a sharp decrease in road safety, especially for bicycle users and pedestrians. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year -more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives.\nOverall, this bill is a bad idea executed without being based on a shred of provable evidence or research. The government must revise this bill after consulting with planning experts and municipal officials should it wish to regain the trust that it has undoubtedly lost with many people in this province after taking this clearly rushed and unstudied decision.\n"
