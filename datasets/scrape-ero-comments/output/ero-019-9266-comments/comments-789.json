The fact that taxpayer money, my hard earned money, will be spent to go backwards in removing bike lanes is appalling. Don\u2019t be so fiscally irresponsible with taxpayer money, your money, and stop this bill to remove bike lanes.\nRespectfully,\nEvan\n"

The protected lanes on both these arterial roads have been life-saving for us and many other cyclists that we ride with each day. In a year with record-high cyclists deaths, Ford\u2019s proposal to remove these bike lanes while stirring up anti-cycling sentiment among drivers is counter to citizen safety, counter to efforts to combat climate change, and an enormous waste of taxpayer money. Piles of credible research states that bike lanes actually reduce congestion. And no one can argue against their ability to protect vulnerable road users. I urge all decision makers involved to fight against this ignorant and dangerous bill.\n"

Adding further driving lanes has been proven again and again to only increase congestion as more drivers begin using it. Additionally, bike lanes are a municipal issue and the provincial government should not meddle here.\n"

        "comment": "This note is addressed to the provincial government of Ontario.\nAs a longtime resident of Toronto, I wish to state that I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nFirst, it is wrong for the provincial government to essentially override the wishes of citizens in Toronto who chose to elect a mayor and council that are in support of bike lanes in our city. This flies in the face of the democratic tradition, especially as it disenfranchises the local community most affected by the bill.\nFurther, as an automobile driver in Toronto, I feel much safer in operating my vehicle when cyclists have their own lanes in which to ride. Asking heavy, motorized vehicles like trucks and autos to contend with a mix of cyclists in the same lanes is dangerous. We've seen a number of instances where cyclists have been seriously injured or killed due to this unwieldy arrangement.\nAnother key issue is related to health and our environment. Promoting safe cycling is a tangible way to encourage healthy physical exercise, while at the same time reducing the amount of noxious products of combustion that is polluting our planet and endangering the viability of our very civilization.\nWe also know that it is not bike lanes that constitute a major cause of traffic congestion in our city. The plethora of ongoing construction, much of which is related to various building and infrastructure projects instituted all at once \u2013 the latter having often been ignored for years and years \u2013 is, in my estimation, the single biggest factor in the gridlock that drivers are experiencing these days.\nTo top it all off, the provincial government now wishes to force the spending millions of taxpayer dollars simply to undo what has been accomplished to generate diversity and safety in our transportation networks across the city. What an irresponsible waste!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes the removal of bike lanes from Bloor, University, and Yonge. This bill is misguided for several reasons:\nReduction in Congestion: Numerous studies have shown that bike lanes can actually reduce traffic congestion. For instance, data from Eco-Counter shows that building more roads with more lanes for cars does not reduce congestion due to induced demand. Conversely, dedicated bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road and easing congestion.\nMisleading Data: The data used to justify this bill is misleading because it is not localized to areas with high bike usage. It fails to account for the specific needs and behaviors of cyclists in these dense urban areas. Using generalized data to make decisions about specific locations is not only inaccurate but also irresponsible.\nCircular Reasoning: The argument that there is low ridership because of a lack of bike infrastructure is a classic example of circular reasoning. Without proper infrastructure, people are less likely to cycle due to safety concerns. Removing bike lanes will only exacerbate this issue, leading to even lower ridership and further justifying the removal of bike lanes. This creates a vicious cycle that undermines efforts to promote sustainable and healthy transportation options.\nIn conclusion, removing bike lanes from Bloor, University, and Yonge would be a step backward for our city. It would increase congestion, rely on misleading data, and perpetuate a cycle of low ridership due to inadequate infrastructure. I urge you to reconsider this bill and instead focus on enhancing our bike lane network to create a safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation system for all.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable. I am of the opinion that the safety of vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians should be prioritized over driver convenience. Many studies have found that bike lanes not only improve safety for cyclists, but all other road users as well. Removing the bike lanes is a reckless decision that will endanger all road users, and it's a huge waste of tax-payer dollars that could be otherwise spent on more important matters including health care, education and mental health.\n"

Bike lanes offer a healthy, affordable and safe way to get around the city which takes cars off the road thus improving traffic for everyone. Dedicated bike lanes save lives, reduce pollution and driver/biker stress and support small businesses through increased, on-the-ground circulation. I already paid for these bike lanes so don\u2019t waste my tax dollars removing them when they\u2019re highly used and appreciated.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives on Bloor St and uses it frequently to drive, walk, and cycle to various destinations, I strongly oppose the removal of the Bloor St bike lanes and any currently installed bike lanes across the City of Toronto. The idea that removing bike lanes could meaningfully contribute to any sort of traffic or gridlock reduction in the long run is nonsense, as it has been observed numerous times around the world that adding lanes of traffic only acts to increase motor vehicle use and roadway demand. What we really need to do is reduce roadway demand by offering safe, efficient alternative modes of transport to cars within our cities. Having an extensive, connected, and safe bicycle network in our cities will help increase the number of people who choose to cycle instead of drive, which is not only a much more effective way to reduce traffic congestion than adding lanes, but could also potentially save the province vast sums of money through improved public health.\nWhat we need in the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario as a whole is a balanced, scalable approach to human mobility that includes numerous modes of transport, not just motor vehicles. It is clearly apparent that cars are the least space-efficient solution for moving people around, and in places where space is at a premium we need to be looking for more efficient, dense modes of transport such as cycling and public transportation. It's also easy to see that there's an upper limit of the number of lanes we can dedicate to motor vehicles, so when a bike lane is returned to being a motor vehicle lane, there's a very limited amount of extra capacity this offers. We would be lucky at this point if the gridlock in our city even improved at all once the proposed lanes were returned to motor vehicle traffic, after all of the spending and construction disruptions. By the time these changes took place, the new capacity offered by the restored lane of traffic would probably already be met by the induced increase in demand for this lane of traffic.\nA single person in an SUV easily occupies the same space as tens of people in a bus or more than a handful of people on bikes. Every person who chooses not to drive has a much greater impact on reducing traffic than another motor vehicle lane ever could, and few people will choose to cycle if the infrastructure doesn't exist to make it a safe choice. Considering the arguments above, the numerous lives lost while cycling within the City of Toronto, and the excessive costs of removing new infrastructure to install an inferior solution, I would be appalled if the Government of Ontario pushed through this bill. The safety of all citizens should always remain the top priority, regardless of their chosen mode of transport.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic in Toronto is an urban planning issue that has nothing to do with the bike lanes. Removing bike lanes does not remove the cyclists. Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will be caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\n"

        "comment": "This is bill is an over-reach for the province.\nIt guts environmental protections with no reasonable justification, it decreases road safety protections, and it removes protections for the citizens of this province. It aims to create conditions where citizens have fewer protections. In addition, urban planning around things like bike lanes are the responsibility of municipalities. The province should not be interfering with these processes. Parks, community paths, shared-use facilities and bike lanes make our cities better spaces for individuals and families.\nWe need to maintain healthy ecosystems in this province. That is how we will be able to weather unforeseen circumstances and maintain resilience. Gutting environmental assessments will be harmful to humans and other living things in both the short- and long-term.\nI oppose this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 does not support the goals that have been put forward as its justification.     Gridlock exists, and will simply continue to worsen as a direct result of the provincial leaderships intention to further build upon the the existing urban sprawl that is the greater Toronto area (GTA).\nThe leaderships current plans to expand the GTA suburban housing market, and the associated  highway systems, will only further encourage personal vehicle usage, and exacerbate the problem this bill is supposed to help address.\nAll alternative modes of mass and individual urban transportation need to be supported, and encouraged.  This means public transportation needs further support, as does the need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.  This is especially important in any city like Toronto where there is a massive student population that may not be of driving age, or able to access the luxury of car ownership.\nAny arguments regarding lost revenue or productivity in the province have little to nothing to do with the three roadways in the city of Toronto being put under scrutiny here.   The only viable options are simply less popular to suburban residents who make their way into Toronto's core by car, and who choose to not see themselves as a part of the problem.   Making efforts to help remove unnecessary passenger vehicle traffic from city streets would help by allowing commercial vehicles to operate efficiently.    While unpopular, options such as London's congestion charge system may be needed.\nhttps://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge\nIt is unfortunate that premier Ford's position regarding cycling simply seems to echo that of his brother, who also recklessly spent tax dollars to remove cycling lanes during his term of office as the mayor of Toronto.   The late Rob Ford spent to remove painted bike lanes on some well worn streets, rather than waiting for them to be repaved instead.   Spending carelessly to win a vote, rather than doing what is best for the majority, is the greatest flaw of any politician.\nThe current leadership of the province of Ontario has failed to recognize that alternate modes of urban transportation, such as cycling, are critical to ensuring that the existing roads in the city of Toronto can be best utilized well into the future.   Working on efforts to make an increased urban density more livable is the only good way forward.  Most cities larger than Toronto have already started down that path, and the provincial leadership needs to step back and allow the cities leadership to handle it's own affairs towards that goal.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is yet another decision by the Conservative Government that will be a waste of tax payer money. At a time when as a province we have a shortage on affordable housing, a crumbling healthcare system, and a crisis in our school system it baffles one\u2019s mind as to why the Conservative Party and Premier Ford would interfere with the municipal jurisdiction of Toronto.\nIt is a fact that protected bike lanes encourage people to cycle, and increase the revenue for local businesses in neighbourhoods with bike lanes. This decision will not reach its intended goal of reducing traffic and will force more people to drive thus traffic will worsen. This continued prioritization of automobile reliance is not sustainable and will bankrupt our cities.\nEvery cyclist on the road is a net gain on the provincial budget. The healthier individual choice of cycling leads to reduced demand on family doctors, hospital wait rooms, and road maintenance. The societal benefits of reducing the amount of cars on the road are even more convincing. Car exhaust is linked to learning disabilities, asthma, cancer as well as other illnesses. The road noise caused by cars also increases your chance of heart attack and stroke. It leads one to wonder how the priorities for the conservative government and Premier Ford are decided. I would like to Ontario with a better vision for the future than to maintain this status quo.\n"
