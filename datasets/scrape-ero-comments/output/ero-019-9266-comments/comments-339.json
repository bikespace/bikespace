        "comment": "This proposal is an absolute waste of tax payers money.  Stats have shown that when bike lanes are available then people feel comfortable changing their behaviour to use them which ultimately reduces traffic.   If the only option is to drive people will drive. If the option is to bike, people will bike.\nThe Ontario government will ultimately  worsens traffic by causing delays in congestion while under construction and encouraging more citizens to drive vs bike ultimately adding more cars to the road.  Please consider spending this money on transit or other community minded solutions to traffic.\n"

        "comment": "What a waste of resources this is. The bike lanes on University in particular were completed within the last year or so and provide a crucial artery into downtown Toronto that safely gets more people downtown, not in a car. To dig it up now, and to make  the City to pay for it, suggests a complete lack of vision for our largest city and the economic engine of the country - the downtown core of Toronto. This proposal should be stopped dead in its tracks. Please divert this attention and money to build more, and more effective, public transportation in the largest economic center in the country, that continues to grow by approx. 100,000 people per year.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who uses all forms of transit\u2014cycling, driving, and public transport\u2014it's clear to me that bike lanes are essential to modern urban infrastructure. They provide a safe, sustainable transit option that ultimately benefits everyone by reducing road congestion. People who are skeptical about using bicycles as a form of transportation often cite SAFETY (lack of space and safe lanes) as their reason for not cycling. In turn, they drive or take Ubers, further INCREASING congestion.\nRush hour traffic has long been a reality since our city was known as the town of York, and claims that bike lanes have worsened congestion lack solid evidence; they\u2019re rooted in anecdotes, not data. The proposal to rip out bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge is a glaring misuse of taxpayer dollars, disrupting neighborhoods for the sole purpose of undoing recent improvements and pandering to rural voters. Instead of pointlessly reversing these advancements, resources should be directed toward infrastructure that truly serves our communities, as well as finishing late and over-budget provincial projects, like the Eglington LRT.\nPlease see the attached study from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which states \"Most surveys report that traffic safety is the major factor deterring individuals from bicycle commuting\". How can we expect to reduce congestion if more and more commuters feel too unsafe to cycle, and therefore are all driving cars? Our streets are only so wide - one more lane is not going to solve this issue. Modern infrastructure, which has already been completed and paid for, is the solution.\nI do not support the removal of completed bike lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor.\nThe municipal government must have a backbone in this issue. It is critical to the future of Toronto's citizens and the future of Council's position of power. If council members cannot protect Torontonians from provincial overreach, they are not fit to represent our interests.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled that your government is planning to remove existing bike lanes in the city of Toronto. You are putting the lives of cyclists at risk with your reckless actions as they will be forced back onto the road and unprotected from cars and trucks. We had a municipal election and Toronto rejected the anti-bike lane candidate you were hoping would win. How dare you interfere with what locals want to when data does not support your position? How about you go back to your transit projects and leave the rest of us to safely use our bike lanes? Disgusting decision all around and my bar for your government is pretty low to begin with.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide a safe and convenient travel route through the city, especially where public transit is lacking or inefficient (i.e. most of the city). Removal of bike lanes is short-sited and will just result in more congestion as there are more cars on the road, who are arguably the most selfish road users, constantly disobeying road regulations (illegal stops in the curb lane, blocking the box of intersections, coasting through pedestrian crosswalks without stopping or indicating, etc.)\nThis bill present a safety concern for all road users and should not be entertained. We should be making measure to REDUCE the number of cars driving unnecessarily through our city.\nFurthermore, this is an issue for individual municipalities to handle - the Provincial Government and Doug Ford have no place to dictate how an individual city should be internally run. This is a gross overstep of the political systems in place.\n"

        "comment": "A couple of years ago, I was sitting at my desk at 4:30 waiting to leave work. I heard sirens outside and didn't think much about it until I left my office. I learned that while I was sitting there counting down the minutes until I could leave work, a young cyclist was pinned under a car counting down the minutes until he died.\nThe young cyclist was killed by a car who disobeyed a traffic signal and illegally turned right on a red light, where it was prohibited. This event angered and saddened me and I began to think more critically about cyclist and pedestrian safety. Driver behaviour is unacceptable at the best of times and this legislation will support more poor driving behaviour and deaths. If that was your child, sibling, or parent trapped under that car taking their last breaths, you would think more critically about your decisions to remove bike lanes.\nI want you to go out there and bike on a street without bike lanes. With cars roaring past you. With no barriers. With drivers threatening you. Yelling at you. Honking at you. All because you chose to use a sustainable mode of transportation. Because you don't have access to a vehicle or efficient transit. Because you wanted to exercise. Because you wanted to cycle.\nYou cannot make this legislation without putting yourself in the shoes of cyclists.\n"

The province should fund public transit that reduces the number of cars on the road. This maintains safety for cyclists and provides reliable alternative transit that is better for the environment. The city has invested various resources into building these bike lanes and the province reversing them is a huge misuse of funds that can be used for better initiatives.\n"

I shop at businesses and eat at restaurants that would otherwise be out of my walking range, but too annoying to visit in my car\u2014a fact that removing the bike lanes won't help! As a not-especially athletic woman, I'm not going to risk biking in mixed traffic. (Many times there is no choice but to bike on main streets, because the side streets won't get me to these places.) I will feel unsafe, and probably stop frequenting these stores as a result. Why not address traffic where it really forms, by changing the rules on parking on thoroughfares\u2014one car parked in the right lane causes slowdown ripples for blocks. Or why not fix the streetcar? Removing an alternative mode of transportation will endanger people like me or else force me into a car, adding to traffic. And of course, I consider what this will mean for all the gig workers, who will be either become more car traffic, or else have to brave a far more dangerous job reality. I don't want the person delivering my dinner risking their life doing so! This proposal won't address what it pretends to. The priorities are all wrong, and it won't just be those who use the bike lanes who feel the negative effects.\n"

If the Ontario government attempts to remove parts of Bloor between Dundas West and Danforth, or University, there is no doubt that the cycling community will rally to resist the changes, physically. I and countless others use those lanes every day to get to work. The idea that these busy bike lanes are not \"traffic lanes\" is laughable. Ripping out bike lanes, many of which were just upgraded or completed, is a vulgar waste of taxpayer money. Stay out of municipal matters and maybe attempt to make Ontario liveable.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide a safe space for cyclists, encouraging more people to bike instead of driving. This is the way to reduce congestion and vehicle traffic! As more people opt for cycling, the overall number of cars on the road decreases, alleviating congestion! Cars are expensive, cost of living is high. People are trying to find alternatives to cars, people are trying to get to work on their bike, go shopping, meet friends - all while choosing an environmentally friend and cheaper alternative. Encouraging cycling improves healthy living and overall public health outcomes. Cyclists and cars can co-exist safely. Invest instead in enforcing traffic and bylaw violations (by both cyclists and motorists). The bike lanes on Bloor and University Ave in particular are very well used, by removing them you are encouraging cyclists to merge in a single lane and share the road with cars - unsafe and inefficient for all.\n"

Using the unfounded vendetta against bike lanes to sneak through the Highway 413 that no one but the premier's development cronies wants is absolutely disgusting.  Removing bike lanes from Toronto will only make congestion worse, and further endanger vulnerable road users. I would encourage this government to remove head from anus and look at the numerous studies that show bike lanes do not cause cause congestion, they reduce it, and furthermore, they encourage lively business areas.  We don't need a new highway. We don't need more lanes dedicated to cars. We need better transit. We need separated bike infrastructure. We need to reduce urban sprawl.  I would say that you should all be ashamed of yourselves, but I don't know that anyone in this government is able to feel shame.  Stop trying to be Premier of Toronto Mr. Ford, and stop wasting money on old, tired ideas. Get out of your SUV, or better yet, get out of the way.  This government is an impediment to progress, and has nothing better to do than to spite its cities.\n"
