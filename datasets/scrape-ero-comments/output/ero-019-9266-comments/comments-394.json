The popularity of ebikes  is seen as a threat to car sales.\nDespite the fact that car exhaust is a major contributor the pollution of the air we breathe, the government is going ahead with measures that benefit the automotive industry, to the detriment of our population.\nThe proposed legislation is sending a negative message about bicycles which will result in an increase in the abuse that cyclists already experience from drivers of automotive vehicles.\nThank you Doug.\n"

        "comment": "Your government IS proposing a Anti-Bike legislation (you can say it isn't, but that's simply not true if anyone takes the time to read the bill or hear how you talk about it). Your legislation is saying the safety of cyclists is not important and your government would rather waste money to remove or prohibit bike lanes so that more cars can be put into roads to further grow the gridlock that's literally being caused by cars in cities across Ontario. You are placing safety secondary to the idea that cars MIGHT be able to gain a few seconds of travel time back (which according to data is not factual... but that's another story).\nYou are planning to pass a legislation that will literally remove and prevent future bike lanes (which save lives and gives safer travelling routes) so that more cyclists can get hit, be injured and DIE. Car drivers will have higher chances of accidentally injurying cyclists because they won't be safely separated or have dividers between them. This is literally the OPPOSITE OF \"COMMON SENSE\"!!!\nDamn. You all must live on another planet or something. Read the room... No Ontarian wants this. No one wants higher chances to kill a person OR be killed! It's not controversial. Bike lanes are important. We want more of them built. Absolutely under NO circumstances should you be removing existing bike lanes. More should be build to keep people safe in the future. Do you remove pedestrian walkways when you don't visibly see large crowds constantly walking on them when you drive by? No. Because replacing a pedestrian walkway with a regular road lane would kill more pedestrians. It's NOT \"common-sense.\" Why do you think it is any different for bike lanes? You get rid of bike lanes or don't provide enough access to them, it simply means more people will die.\nThis bill is so gross on so many levels. No car or commute time is more important than human life!\nNo highway is more important to speedily build than the proper insurance of our environments safety and longevity. No government should be able to claim another property owners land as their own all willynilly like you propose here either.\nStop your corrupt and immortal shenanigans!\nVote NO to this legislation.\n"

I can't afford a car and transit is often overcrowded and slower than a bike anyway in Toronto. This decision makes no sense and make my cost of living go up if I have to pay for transit or rideshares. I already can't afford rent and now this?!\nPlease explain how this benefits the middle class, small businesses who rely on foot and bike traffic and how building one more lane will solve traffic congestion. Show me the stat which says 1 lane of car lanes move more people per hour than 1 bike lane which by the way, is way smaller than 1 car lane.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the recent bill aimed at removing bike lanes in Ontario. Bike lanes are crucial for enhancing safety for all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. They provide a designated space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and encouraging more people to choose biking as a safe and viable mode of transportation.\nIt\u2019s also important to recognize that cycling is often a chicken-and-egg situation: low ridership is frequently a result of inadequate infrastructure. By removing existing bike lanes, we only perpetuate this cycle, discouraging potential cyclists and limiting the growth of a vibrant cycling community.\nAdditionally, bike lanes play a vital role in reducing traffic congestion. By promoting cycling, we can decrease the number of cars on the road, leading to smoother traffic flow and less pollution. Investing in bike infrastructure not only supports healthier lifestyles but also contributes to more sustainable urban environments.\nI would like to prioritize safe, accessible, and efficient transportation options for everyone in our communities. I urge decision-makers to reconsider any measures that would hinder the development of bike lanes.\n"

The Bloor Bike lane has been a God send to be able to commute from the Danforth to downtown.  We used to take our lives in our own hands each time.  But now we feel safe.  And are safe.  Each time we ride our bikes, that is one less car on the road, clogging up the car lane.  We also ride our bikes to transit stations allowing us to continue a longer trip without taking our car.  It is cheaper, healthier and better for the environment.  All things that we are concerned about.  Being healthy, which means fewer hospital visits, saving money on gas and wear and tear on our car, and making the air cleaner for all.  We deserve a safe, cost effective and healthy alternative to having to drive our car. We have a car, take transit but love that we can also ride our bikes.\n"

I don't think you understand how many of my friends in the last 6 months have been door-ed while riding their bicycles because there wasn't a dedicated bike lane. Why are you trying to set Toronto back to the Middle Ages? Do you even ride a bicycle to work??? Let's have some compassion and common sense here given the current state of the economy. The bike lanes are working, there's an influx of people moving to the city, and you're going to CRIPPLE the transportation infrastructure by taking out bike lanes?! How often do you take the TTC? Do you believe it's a reliable source of transportation? You guys are in the position to make this city better and really put us on the map against other first-world cities but you decide this??? You should rethink your life and career if you're not trying to help the citizens of Toronto, truly. Go outside and speak to people to get a perspective.\n"

        "comment": "I'm deeply concerned about the province's proposals to restrict municipal efforts in creating and maintaining bike lanes, including plans to remove existing bike infrastructure in Toronto. The provincial government should not be adding unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy to hinder local governments striving to expand transportation options. As a daily cyclist, I rely on bike lanes for safe, efficient travel; they are essential transportation infrastructure, much like sidewalks, that enhance safety for all road users.\nRather than maximizing road space solely for cars, we need to focus on providing safe, viable transportation choices for vulnerable road users, including cyclists and pedestrians. These lanes not only protect cyclists but also improve the driving experience; when I drive, I much prefer cyclists having a designated space, away from main traffic. Additionally, bike lanes support public transit investments by providing more convenient, safe access to transit stations, reducing the need for short car trips. I urge you to support Toronto\u2019s bike infrastructure, which is essential for a safe, multimodal city that serves everyone effectively.\n"

        "comment": "Removing biking infrastructure will not solve gridlock traffic as more people will depend on driving in order to move around the city. If there is a better and more comprehensive public transport network, citizens will depend less on driving and number of cars on the roads would significantly reduce. Removing dedicated bike lanes will also force cyclists to ride on sidewalks and roads, causing dangers to pedestrians and other drivers. Instead of spending money to make transportation less effecient and cause more gridlock traffic, money should be better invest on improving public transportation and reducing peoples' dependencies on driving in the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike Lanes in Toronto\nWhat kind of city do we want Toronto to be? Right now the Provincial Government seems to feel that Toronto is a CAR city... there is no room for anyone else on the roads of Toronto but the car. If we look at cities around the world, the move is to allow other modes of transportation that are environmentally friendly, neighbourhood friendly... People friendly.\nMontreal can be seen as example of what bike lanes can do. There is vision that has turned their city into one people wish to visit. BUT it has taken time and courage to stay the course and allow citizens to accept the bike INCLUDING CAR DRIVERS. We need the people who drive cars time to see what bike lanes can do... As more time passes and people see and experience the fun of cycling bike lane ridership increases. To get rid of bike lanes will push the city back 3 years AND 7 years if they wish to re-establish bike lanes.\nWhat about the other reasons for traffic congestion... construction, poor enforcement of traffic laws, ride share companies which in 2020 was said to make up 15% of traffic in the city??? Why are we not talking about them? What about the benefits to biking re fitness for Torontonians?\nI have personally rode bike lanes in the city.  I have gone from Ossington and College to King and University. The Bloor St Bike Lanes are a pleasure to ride. It is fast well maintained and made my ride safer. Maybe our elected officials should try it themselves and experience the pleasures of a bike lane.\nTo arbitrarily remove bike lanes makes Toronto an out of date unfriendly place to live. Let's have real Vision and Leadership in our Province. Let's stop blaming bikes for all our cities congestion and work with our cities to make them more livable and enjoyable places to be!\nrichard\n"

This bill spends public money just to massage Ford's ego.\n2) As a driver: Toronto is congested as it is, even in places where there are no bike lanes. On two lane roads, the 2nd lane is mostly used as parking anyway.\n3) As Toronto resident and tax payer: Any money that would be spent on destruction of existing infrastructure should go to finishing line 5. To make less people drive.\n4) As a pedestrian: Every bike on a street is one less car trying to kill me, we need less cars downtown not more.\n5) As an economist: Have you ever heard of induced demand? If you add lanes, you will make traffic (and parking) downtown even worse.\n6) As a cyclist: there is a record number of cyclists killed by cars this year, as people cycle more.. (It is way faster to get through downtown on bike than on car or on TTC) You removing protected bike lanes will mean you will be to blame next time someone gets killed by a car in the area.\n"

        "comment": "I'm opposed to removing bike lanes along major urban roads, and I'm in favour of adding new bike lanes along both major and side streets.\nA major argument that is being used to justify the proposed legislation is the high amount of congestion in the city. The solution to congestion isn't to add a few car lanes, but rather to add a large amount of bike lanes and public transit options, thus getting cars off the road. If people made a quarter of their trips by a mode other than driving (e.g. trips to the pharmacy, biking to work once a week, visiting family 10 blocks away), that would remove 25% of congestion.\nI don't want my kids to get fat sitting in a car as I drive them everywhere. Instead, I want them to learn the value of physical activity while they smell the leaves in the autumn, feel the Sun in the summer, and learn to navigate slush in the winter (as I had to) as they take themselves places. Once they're old enough to explore the city on their own, I want them to be able to bike to the AGO to see the exhibits or Yonge & Dundas Square to meet friends, without my needing to worry if they will get hit by a car.\nI happen to be someone who bikes already, but there are many routes I choose not to take even though they would be more convenient, because they are dangerous.\nBikes are a viable transportation option. They are already used by a large segment of Toronto's population (especially if you only consider areas of the city where decent bike infrastructure already exists), and more people would use them if it was safe and convenient. To deny people the ability to travel in the city by bike is not only unsustainable for the future of the city; it's forcing people to spend money on increasingly expensive cars and transit passes when an obvious alternative exists.\nFinally, city infrastructure should be decided by municipal governments. It is not the provincial government's place to dictate where cities can or cannot build a bike lane.\n"
