        "comment": "Deeply concerned over the bike lane provisions in Bill 212, and urge the government to change course. While I understand and appreciate the need to address gridlock and ensure efficient transportation, I believe the approach of Bill 212 will harm Ontario's communities, resilience, affordability, and public safety.\u00a0Here's why:\n1. Dedicated bike lanes save Ontarians money during this affordability crisis, making cycling a feasible and free option\n2. Dedicated bike lanes improve public safety, for obvious reasons\n3. Bike lanes are low-hanging fruit in the 'causes of gridlock' equation - is there sound evidence to support the claim that bike lanes cause gridlock? Induced demand shows that more car lanes lead to more congestion, while bike lanes encourage cycling, reducing car traffic.\n4. The bill adds red tape to city planning, despite Ontario\u2019s stated goal to reduce red tape\n5. Taxpayers have already funded these lanes, and removing them and creating new infrastructure is an unnecessary expense\n6. Ontario is bigger and more diverse than just the GTA, and the needs of all Ontarians should be considered\n7. The 'us vs. them' mentality of cyclists vs. motorists is divisive and unproductive\n8. Municipalities were not consulted\n9. Diverse transportation options build a resilient and future-proof economy in the face of climate change\n10. Bike lanes make cities fun and liveable\n"

This helps to reduce cars on the streets and to give people the choice to travel in the most efficient way possible, which also improves the mental and physical health of our citizens. Removing bike lanes takes away people's choice and only adds traffic for the detriment of all. I strongly oppose this anti-bike lane bill and will vote accordingly.\n"

        "comment": "Dear lawmakers.\nPlease do some research. Do not remove bike lanes. That will increase congestion. Build more!!\nCommon sense is looking at studies and governing appropriately not out of spite or the whims of a few nimbys.  Bike lanes reduce congestion and help small business.\nIt has been proven time and time again.\nWhile I think that the tunnel under the 401 is an excellent idea and a great use of money, getting rid of bike lanes will hurt small businesses as cyclists stop a lot and buy things.\nDo bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion? Here's what the research says:\nStudies from around the world show bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses.\nWhile advocates look at dedicated bicycle lanes as encouraging more people to travel by bike \u2014 resulting in less traffic congestion, safer commutes for cyclists and reduced greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 some motorists blame them for causing more congestion.\nBut research shows that dedicated bicycle lanes are not behind perceived traffic congestion and can have many benefits.\nBuild it and they will come\nOne would think that building more roads with more lanes for cars would reduce congestion, but research shows that's not the case, thanks to something called induced demand. The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\n\"So for a short period of time, there might be a slightly improved [reduction], but within a year or two, or perhaps three, traffic is as bad or worse than it was before the lanes were added in the first place,\" said David Beitel, data services lead at Eco-Counter, a Montreal company that collects and analyzes pedestrian and bicycle traffic data.\nConversely, if you put in more dedicated bike lanes, people tend to feel safer and demand for use increases, said Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's department of civil and mineral engineering and Canada Research Chair in sustainable infrastructure.\n\"As soon as you build a bike lane, within a year, two years, the latent demand shows up,\" she said.\nBike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\nIn 2016, the European Commission's CIVITAS program published a study examining traffic congestion that looked at several cities around the world.\nFor example, in New York City, the authors shared figures from the city's transportation department that showed in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes \u2014 a 35 per cent decrease. One of the reasons they cited for the change was the installation of a left-turn lane, which not only kept cyclists moving but also stopped cars from holding up traffic.\nIn Copenhagen, which introduced its first \"green wave\" meant to encourage cycling in 2007, the city reported that \"the large number of bicycles, for example, makes it easier for necessary basic motor transport such as tradesmen, goods transport and buses to get through more easily.\" In fact, there is so much bike use that the city has had to add more bike corridors to cut down on bicycle congestion.\nOther case studies found either no impacts on traffic, or minimal delays \u2014 anywhere from a few seconds to just over a minute.\nThen there's Paris. The city saw a 54 per cent increase in bike use from 2018 to 2019. And for the first time, car use decreased by five per cent between 2010 and 2018.\n\"People [in Canada] will say we're not Europe. We're really no different. Cities all over the world invested in doing things by car for decades, and then basically all the big cities have realized this doesn't work.\"\nIn some Canadian cities, particularly Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton, bike lanes are widely used. Montreal has a whopping 1,065 kilometres of bike lanes, and Edmonton has more than 800 kilometres, with more planned.\nFinally, according to a 2019 report looking at the impacts of bike lanes on a different stretch of Bloor Street, local businesses reported getting more customers since the lanes were installed.\n"

        "comment": "This act is not based in science or known research. None of the proposed policies will actually reduce gridlock in the long run. Removing bike lanes without requiring a study is a waste of taxpayers money.\nBuilding 2 new highways in the middle of nowhere serves who exactly? Who will pay for the residential infrastructure between the new developments for these highways?\nThis is a terribly fiscally irresponsible bill and should be abandoned.\n"

        "comment": "To the Ontario Provincial Government,\nI am writing in regarding Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. As a citizen of Toronto for over a decade and an individual who uses a variety of transportation methods including walking, cycling, public transit, and carpooling, I advocate for safer & more sustainable transportation options for all. I support the expansion of cycling infrastructure as part of a comprehensive solution to reduce gridlock and congestion. I understand the concern about traffic flow, and I\u2019ve reviewed your top priorities such as short-term wins, economic growth, job creation, and cost-saving measures. I appreciate having this platform to share how expanding cycling infrastructure will not only improve congestion now and in the long term, but also support your other top priorities.\n_MORE BIKES = LESS CARS_\nAlthough the idea of improving traffic flow by removing bike lanes may seem like a great solution on the surface, it can only increase congestion in the long term. Removing bike lanes is a great idea for someone who cannot consider the long-term impacts. On the contrary, a capable team like yours can undoubtedly build strategic cycling infrastructures that can reduce gridlock and congestion in a way where Ontarians will reap benefits in the short term and in the long term.\nWell designed cycling infrastructure ends up encouraging more folks to use cycling as a means of transportation. As you understand, traffic congestion is a result of more vehicles on the road than there is space for. Those who do not care for the long-term impacts of our wonderful province would quickly opt to increase vehicular lanes as the obvious answer, but a thoughtful & strategic leader understands that reducing the number of vehicles on the road is the solution that wins for everyone now and in the long term.\nThe establishment of cycling infrastructure brings significant advantages to our most vulnerable road users, especially those who are less confident about sharing roads with vehicle users, particularly children. The safety of our future generation is paramount. Moreover, promoting cycling as a safer and better mode of transportation for children increases the likelihood that they will continue to use cycling in the future, leading to reduced congestion for generations. The positive ripple effects cannot be understated. This is the kind of forward-thinking that I anticipate from our provincial and municipal leaders.\n_ENVIRONMENTAL WINS_\nPromoting cycling over vehicle use significantly reduces emissions and makes Ontario an environmentally-conscious province. We\u2019ve had warmer-than-usual days this October, which is a constant reminder of the environmental damage that drivers are contributing to. Not only does providing more cycling infrastructure promote environmental benefits, it encourages future generations to lean into cycling as the obvious mode of transportation, and you\u2019ll leave a legacy of Ontarians who are contributing to a healthier, greener world.\n_SHORT-TERM BENEFITS_\nWhile I mention long-term benefits, I know you are responsible for implementing positive changes in the short term as well, especially since the current situation is getting out of hand. Fortunately, there are many immediate benefits to investing in bike lane infrastructure! This investment creates immediate jobs, like those in construction and urban planning just to name a few. These are well-paying jobs that will have a positive impact on the local economy. Moreover, the maintenance and future expansion of these lanes will create steady employment in Ontario, supporting industries tied to roadworks and infrastructure. The decision to support cycling infrastructure aligns with your goal of economic growth and creating jobs.\nFurther, bike lanes play a crucial role in boosting economic growth. Research shows that cyclists are more inclined to stop at local shops than those in cars. The convenience of biking encourages spontaneous visits, leading to increased spending in local businesses. Additionally, cyclists incur lower vehicle-related costs, allowing them to invest more in their communities. This vibrant economic activity strengthens local economies and supports the government\u2019s objectives of creating jobs and enhancing economic vitality.\nSince you are passionate and committed to lowering the cost of living for Ontarians, another huge benefit of biking is that it is a low-cost option that can help families reduce their transportation expenses\u2014whether it\u2019s through lower gas, insurance, or parking costs. By making it safer and more accessible for Ontarians to bike, your government can help families save money, which they can then reinvest into local economies.\nPromoting cycling can alleviate pressures on Ontario\u2019s healthcare system. With healthcare being one of your top priorities, here\u2019s another win-win situation. Increased cycling contributes to better public health outcomes, reducing the prevalence of diseases like heart disease and obesity. This shift ultimately translates into long-term cost savings for public services, allowing the government to allocate resources more effectively.\n_BIKE & TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE_\nSome have argued that it does not make sense to have bike lanes on all roads. In response, I encourage your team to consider how to strategically build cycling infrastructure to make the most of taxpayer dollars. For example, protected bike lanes built to be part of a broader, integrated transit plan would be much more successful. Combining cycling infrastructure with existing and new public transit options like the TTC, GO Transit and the Ontario Line can create a cohesive, multimodal transportation network that benefits both cyclists and drivers, ultimately easing congestion. Specifically, cycling infrastructure built around major transit lines like the TTC Yellow Line (Yonge St), Green Line (Bloor St), and Union Station is critical.\n_CITY DECISIONS_\nMunicipal governments have the most intimate knowledge of what their cities & citizens need. The needs of each municipality within Ontario will differ as well, depending on the makeup of its residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. I highly encourage trusting the mayors to make the right decisions for their cities so you can spend your time and energy on urgent matters that require your specific attention and expertise.\nInvesting in cycling infrastructure is a win-win solution: it reduces gridlock, boosts the local economy, creates jobs, and saves families money - all while making our streets safer. Your leadership on this matter will set a powerful example for the rest of Canada.\nSincerely,\nTeresa\n"

        "comment": "It is far less important to build more highways faster than it is to preserve and improve the quality of life of all people in this province. Reducing emissions and providing opportunities for active transit would vastly improve these conditions.\nRather than investing money in a dying industry of fossil fuel consumption, money should be spent on rapid transit such as passenger trains and inter-city busses. Municipal public transit systems should also be funded. We do not need more room for cats, we need fewer cars on the roads.\nImproving internet access and reliable electrical power to all regions of the province would allow more workers to work from more diverse locations, improving local economies in rural areas and allowing people to work where their families are. This would have the added benefits of allowing people to be less dependent on public services such as long term care, if they are able to live near their elderly and ailing parents.\n"

It's really embarrassing to see such a stupid idea written up like this with all of this seriousness it has not earned.\nBike lanes are full of people who would be driving otherwise. Any minor throughput increases from removing the small area from bike users will be lost to more cars instantly.\nThe ethics of this are monstrous. We need to get people out of cars to make our cities nicer to live in and visit. We need to reduce emissions. We need this money to be used on something that actually positively contributes to society.\nIts really shameful to see people working on this in the middle of a housing crisis. Why don't you build some houses for people who need them instead of working on such embarrassing ideas?\n"

Rob Ford has no interest in helping a better society by integrating the well being of individuals into planning for the future.\n"
