        "comment": "I agree with this 100% in Ottawa. It\u2019s ridiculous how the traffic in this city is always backed up all over because of bike lanes.\nIf bikes want to be on the roads like vehicles then they should be licensed just like vehicles and they should follow the rules and laws of the road, which they NEVER do. They always go through red lights and stop signs and drive in the middle of the vehicle lanes. It\u2019s horrendous driving in this city.\nIf they are licensed then they can be ticketed for any traffic violations just like drivers of vehicles are.\n"

        "comment": "My concerns are two-fold.\nFirst, the focus should be on ensuring the safety of all users of public roads in Ontario. Pedestrians and cyclists are the most vulnerable users so reasonable measures to protect them should be prioritized.  Separated bike lanes are one such measure that have demonstrated their value in improving public safety.\nSecond, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect provincial officials to be able to make informed and accurate assessments of municipal requests for bike lanes. This would require bureaucrats to be knowledgeable about not only the individual merits of each proposal but also how each proposal fits in to larger traffic flow assessments. This essentially creates a duplication of bureaucracy rather than relying on local knowledge and expertise.\n"

        "comment": "As concerned Ottawa resident and commuter, I support the comprehensive review of the current bike lane infrastructure, particularly in high-traffic areas where it may be contributing to increased congestion. While I acknowledge the importance of promoting alternative modes of transportation, it is essential that these efforts do not come at the expense of efficient traffic flow and public safety.\nIn many cases, the installation of bike lanes has resulted in the reduction of driving lanes, leading to longer travel times, higher emissions from idling vehicles, and increased frustration among commuters.\nI support a data-driven approach that takes into account both the needs of cyclists and the realities of vehicular traffic. If certain bike lanes are found to exacerbate congestion without providing a clear benefit, I believe they should be modified or, where necessary, removed. The goal is to find a balanced solution that accommodates all modes of transportation without disproportionately affecting one group at the expense of others.\nThis approach will ensure that our city\u2019s ( Ottawa ) infrastructure serves all residents equitably and effectively.\nThis approach recognizes the value of bike lanes but advocates for a balanced and data-informed solution.\n"

        "comment": "Cities know what is needed best in terms of transportation. As a public, this is why we elect mayors who run on promises that we expect to be upheld. They have more intimate knowledge of both the cycling and car traffic in a city. If a vehicle lane needs to be removed in order to install a bike lane this should be at the city level, and not at the provincial decision table.\nBike lines are important for the safety, improving traffic, flow, and improving the state of our environment. I myself cycle to work daily  and a dedicated separated, bike claim. These lanes are full of people who are cycling and taking cars off the road. We should be adding more not restricting them.\n"

These roads are designed with thorough studies and design, they shouldn't just be changed due to political sentiment.\nSecond, bike lanes not only improve congestion, they make cycling in the city far safer. If cycling infrastructure is removed, people will be seriously injured.\nLast, the idea of removing valuable bike lanes at the cost to the province is a grotesque waste of my tax dollars. The money should be better spent fixing our healthcare system which has been intentionally underfunded by the current government.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government should be promoting more bike lanes, not threatening to reduce bike lanes. Research shows bike lanes decrease congestion, and are good for local business. The proposed bill reflects an approach that is backwards & anti-progressive. In a time of climate change and the need to reduce emissions, it is incredibly short sighted and just plain wrong to prioritize cars over bikes, especially when research clearly shows the benefits of additional bike lanes. The bill is also an affront to democracy, in its attempt to further reduce the decision-making powers of municipalities. What sense can it possibly make for people sitting in Toronto to make key decisions on city planning for municipalities across Ontario? These decisions should be made by those who live in that municipality. Not by politicians far away in Toronto. This bill will weaken our democracy.\n"

        "comment": "More bike lanes means less car traffic! Which means less gridlock and also less environmental pollution. Biking is also great for both physical and mental health. And often, more financially accessible than driving or public transit. Depending on roads, biking is also more efficient and time saving compared to short distance car travel or public transit options.\nAs a frequent biker, more protected bike lanes will give me more safety. There have already been too many deaths and injuries due to car collisions with cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "A provincial government bill that imposes additional red tape on the implementation of municipal bike lanes contradicts established research on congestion reduction. Studies consistently show that expanding bike infrastructure encourages cycling, reduces vehicle traffic, and alleviates congestion in urban areas. By complicating the process for creating bike lanes, this bill not only undermines efforts to promote sustainable transportation but also hinders cities from effectively addressing traffic issues, ultimately stalling progress toward more efficient and eco-friendly transit solutions.\n"

        "comment": "Almost everyone in my life (myself included) utilizes bike lanes on a daily basis to get to work, run errands, get to appointments, and do their day-to-day commuting needs.\nWhile I am an experienced cyclist who is comfortable even on roads without bike lanes, many of my loved ones are only comfortable on roads with proper cycling infrastructure. At minimum bike lanes, and at their most comfortable: separated lanes like on Bloor in Toronto. Since actual bike lanes were installed on University Ave, me and the ones around me have gone from never taking that road out of fear, to now understanding it is one of the most safe we could take.\nIf the province was to remove bike infrastructure, it would cause many people in my life to go back to other transportation methods. Being on unsafe roads are not an option for most, and having to utilize unaligned side streets is significantly slower and at times not an option. For some, removal of bike infrastructure would lead them to public transportation, as they cannot afford cars. For others, they would go back to utilizing the same roads, creating even more traffic.\nRemoval of bike infrastructure will lead to move cars on the road, creating more congestion, and restricting future bike infrastructure will ensure that anyone considering switching away from a car won't do it.\nFor everyone's safety and to not create an even larger traffic issue for everyone, please don't proceed with this!\n"

        "comment": "Re:Bike Lane legislation\nI think this is a sensible move. It seems like common sense that if you restrict the number of lanes on the road the flow will go down.  Like a pipe.\nAdditionally, the emissions produced by a large number of idling cars wasting time in traffic jams should be evaluated vs. the emission savings due to the reduction in the ( small) number of cars taken off the road due to biking.\nFinally the obvious point about winter, the number of winter bikers is tiny but the bike lanes still restrict traffic all winter, without taking anywhere near the numbers of cars off the road as occurs in the warmer months.\n"

        "comment": "Municipalities are already working hard to meet provincial objectives on housing and transit. A\nAsking municipalities to address additional red tape imposed by this bill, or spending resources to rip up already finished roads, is the opposite of what we should be doing. Especially when the road space taken by cyclists is far less per capita than private vehicles, and doing this will only result in induced demand and cramming more vehicles into places where connecting roads cannot be expanded. It's simple math and geometry that cannot be overcome.\nIf the province is seriously concerned with the amount of road space taken by bike lanes, perhaps additional money can be spent finishing transit projects, which use the least space per capita. Failing that, if the province moves forward with this, it should simply assume the municipal roads it wants to change as provincial highways, so it is not burdening municipal budgets.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m very supportive of removing bike lanes where the data shows there is impact on congestion without enough cyclists.  I\u2019ve done the math on impact on CO2 emissions in Etobicoke and believe the new CO2 impact is about 174,000 kg of co2 which works out to about 13kg per incremental cyclist.  This will have a significant impact on Ontarios goal to reduce our CO2 emissions.  We need to consider the impact of idling due to congestion.\n"
