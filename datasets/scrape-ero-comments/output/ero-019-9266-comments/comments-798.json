        "comment": "A common talking point in the debate around traffic in the GTA is that of induced demand: the fact that creating additional lanes for vehicles actually generates more demand, and does not reduce traffic. Thus, ripping up bike lanes for cars will not support Ontario's stated objective of fighting gridlock. However, the concept of induced demand also holds true for bike lanes, and again, the evidence backs this up - \"build it and they will come\". However, this option does help to move cars off the road. If the province wanted to reduce congestion in urban areas, the data-based decision would actually be to build more bike lanes. As the current proposal would do the opposite, it seems that it is being made for other reasons.\nCycling is both climate-friendly and community-friendly. It dramatically reduces an individual's transportation carbon footprint and supports their physical health. Riding a bike is quieter and is better for air quality in our city streets. Both studies and anecdotal reporting from small businesses have shown that cyclists are more likely to stop and shop, contributing to the local economy.\nThis proposal represents an overreach into what should be a municipal decision, as municipal politicians across the province have repeatedly highlighted. Instead, the shared goal for the Province and the City should be to firmly establish Toronto as a world-class city. These cities are characterized not by more lanes for vehicle traffic, but rather by efficient, frequent, reliable public transit, and robust cycling infrastructure. Having lived in both Montreal and Copenhagen, it is clear that a city built for bikes is a city built for success.\n"

I\u2019ve been an avid cyclist in Toronto for 30 years and I\u2019ve watched as more and more people have started cycling as infrastructure for safe cycling grew. To undo all the work that has gone into cycling infrastructure is ignorant; its bad for the planet, bad for the health of the people of Ontario, it\u2019s an waste of money, and it puts people at risk. Don\u2019t remove our bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford\u2019s plan to remove bike lanes from major city streets is not only reckless policy\u2014it\u2019s a dangerous and deliberate power grab that prioritizes short-term political gain over the well-being of millions of Torontonians.\nBy targeting bike lanes, Ford is undermining years of evidence-based urban planning, dismissing public consultation, and dismantling critical infrastructure. This move would have disastrous consequences, exacerbating safety risks, worsening environmental challenges, harming local businesses, and threatening the principles of local governance.\nBill 212 is not about improving transportation or making streets safer; it\u2019s about consolidating provincial power at the expense of Toronto\u2019s autonomy. By overriding municipal decision-making, Ford is continuing a troubling trend of interference:\n\t\u2022\tCutting Toronto City Council (2018): Ford slashed the size of council mid-election, disregarding the democratic process.\n\t\u2022\tImposing \u201cStrong Mayor\u201d Powers: These powers allow the provincial government to force through its priorities, often in conflict with Toronto\u2019s needs.\nFord\u2019s repeated attacks on Toronto\u2019s governance are a blatant overreach, revealing a pattern of prioritizing centralized control over local expertise and decision-making. Bill 212 is just the latest example of this autocratic tendency.\nSafety: A Public Health and Humanitarian Crisis\nBike lanes are essential for protecting some of Toronto\u2019s most vulnerable road users. Removing them would have dire consequences:\n\t\u2022\tIncreased Collisions and Fatalities: Bike lanes reduce conflicts between vehicles and cyclists by up to 50%. Their removal will lead to more injuries and deaths, directly contradicting Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities.\n\t\u2022\tExacerbating Inequities: Cyclists are often children, seniors, and low-income residents who rely on bike lanes for safe, affordable transportation. This policy puts their lives at unnecessary risk.\nBy dismantling bike lanes, Ford is sending a clear message: the safety of vulnerable road users is expendable.\nEnvironmental and Economic Backsliding\nAt a time when cities around the world are investing in sustainable transportation to combat climate change, Ford\u2019s plan to remove bike lanes is shockingly regressive:\n\t\u2022\tWorsened Climate Impact: Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transportation. Removing bike lanes will force more people into cars, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and worsening Toronto\u2019s air quality.\n\t\u2022\tEconomic Harm: Contrary to Ford\u2019s claims, bike lanes benefit local businesses by encouraging foot and bike traffic. Removing them risks driving customers away, further hurting small businesses still recovering from the pandemic.\nThis policy ignores the global climate emergency and undermines Toronto\u2019s economy, all for the sake of a car-centric agenda.\nFord\u2019s rhetoric frames bike lanes as a nuisance to drivers, pandering to a vocal minority while ignoring the majority of Torontonians who support cycling infrastructure. This divisive approach fuels unnecessary conflict between drivers and cyclists, suburban and urban residents, distracting from more pressing issues like housing affordability, public transit investment, and healthcare.\nBy vilifying bike lanes, Ford is using populist tactics to score cheap political points at the expense of Toronto\u2019s long-term well-being.\nBill 212 is not just a transportation issue; it\u2019s a direct assault on Toronto\u2019s ability to govern itself. By overriding local decisions on infrastructure, Ford undermines the city\u2019s autonomy and sets a dangerous precedent for provincial overreach. If he can dismantle bike lanes today, what stops him from dictating other aspects of urban policy tomorrow?\nToronto\u2019s leaders and residents must recognize this as more than a policy debate\u2014it\u2019s a fight for the city\u2019s right to shape its own future.\nDoug Ford\u2019s attack on bike lanes is a calculated power grab that endangers lives, accelerates climate change, and weakens local governance. By removing this critical infrastructure, Ford is sacrificing Toronto\u2019s safety, sustainability, and economic stability to fuel a politically motivated agenda.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. While the goal of improving transportation infrastructure is commendable, I have serious concerns about the implications this bill has on property rights and the judicial process, particularly regarding expropriation.\nThe bill proposes amendments that would remove essential procedural safeguards in the expropriation process for designated projects. Specifically, Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 aim to expedite expropriations by eliminating hearings of necessity and adjusting possession dates, effectively sidelining property owners' rights to fair consultation and compensation.\nIt is deeply troubling that a government, over which since the Greenbelt debacle an odour of corruption floats, is positioning itself to bypass judicial scrutiny in matters of expropriation. The controversies surrounding the Greenbelt have already eroded public trust, raising questions about transparency and accountability in land development decisions. In such a context, granting the government greater powers to expropriate land without adequate oversight is not only inappropriate but also poses a risk to the principles of democracy and justice.\nExpropriation is a profound exercise of power that must be balanced with the rights of individuals and communities. The judicial process serves as a critical check to ensure that expropriations are conducted fairly, justly, and for the genuine public good. Removing or weakening these safeguards undermines property rights and could lead to abuse of power.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions within Bill 212 that diminish the role of judicial oversight in expropriation processes. It is imperative that any efforts to improve infrastructure do not come at the expense of fundamental rights and democratic principles.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I hope that you will act to\nensure that the rights of Ontarians are protected.\n"

        "comment": "Keep Toronto Moving is a not-for-profit community organization that supports removal of bike lanes from arterial roads.\nThe following petition received over 1400 signatures in favour of Bill 212.\nPetition to remove bike lanes from arterial streets\u2026enough of the insanity!\nI fully support the Ontario government\u2019s proposed legislation to overhaul the flawed approach to bike lane placement on our province\u2019s busiest streets. It\u2019s time for change\u2014change that respects the needs of all road users, prioritizes safety, and is based on transparent, objective data.\nThe following recommendations must be central to future public consultations and planning for existing and future bike lane installations:\n1. Data Transparency and Objectivity\nDecisions about bike lane placement must be based on transparent, year-round data collection. We need accurate, unbiased information that justifies bike lane installations, ensuring these decisions are made in the best interests of everyone.\n2. Immediate Review of Existing Bike Lanes on Arterial Streets\nThe Ministry of Transportation (MTO) must apply objective data collection standards to evaluate the usage of existing bike lanes. A review process should be implemented in the spring of 2025, with the MTO overseeing the entire process, including the scope, criteria for review and approval, and data collection.\n3. Moratorium on New Bike Lanes\nA temporary halt on new bike lane installations is critical until a fair, equitable decision-making process is established. It is clear that ill-conceived bike lanes are worsening congestion and creating safety hazards. Toronto is now ranked the 3rd most congested city in North America and 7th in the world, even surpassing New York City (Global Traffic Score Card, 2023). Immediate action is needed to prevent further harm.\n4. Public Opinion is Clear: Bike Lanes Are Failing Us\nMany Toronto residents are feeling the negative impacts of poorly planned bike lanes. According to a recent poll, 84% of Torontonians want regular evaluations of bike lanes every 2-3 years, and 63% want them removed from major roads. While 66% support bike lanes in general, they demand solutions that don\u2019t interfere with their daily commutes (Navigator Discovery Poll 2023). This public sentiment cannot be ignored.\n5. Emergency Response Times Are Suffering\nBike lanes, especially on busy four-lane roads reduced to two lanes, are causing dangerous delays for emergency vehicles. Lives are at risk when ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars cannot navigate through traffic due to poorly planned bike lanes. This avoidable public safety risk is unacceptable.\n6. End the Bias in Data Collection\nMunicipalities like Toronto have been collecting biased data on bike lane usage\u2014selectively monitoring only during favorable weather conditions. We need consistent, year-round data that paints an accurate picture of bike lane impact. The current method is misleading and unfair, leading to misguided decisions.\n7. Business Owners and Homeowners Are Suffering\nPoorly considered bike lanes are harming local businesses and disrupting residential streets. Currently, there are no clear, standardized metrics for approving or installing permanent bike lanes on arterial roads. This lack of foresight is damaging to local communities.\n8. The Ministry of Transportation Must Take Control\nData collection and analysis cannot be delegated to municipalities that have mishandled the situation. The MTO must lead with a clear, transparent methodology to determine where bike lanes should be placed, ensuring that all voices are heard.\nIt\u2019s time for an open, fair, and objective approach to bike lane placement. The safety of cyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and emergency responders depends on it, as does the well-being of our neighborhoods, businesses, and city infrastructure.\nTime is of the essence. I urge the provincial government to act swiftly and decisively to implement this legislation and bring much-needed order to the congestion on our arterial streets.\nLet\u2019s make our roads safer and more efficient for everyone.\n"

I am demanding your most undivided attention because it appears you are not listening to your constituents as a whole.\nIn the last few months we have seen a horrific rise in cyclist deaths on the streets of Toronto. The streets you propose to slash bike lanes from, Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave., are major paths north, east, south and west, making your plan that much more devastating. Devastating to those who rely on biking as a means to get to work, to school, to see friends and family, and to above all remain mobile in the city at a cost effective rate. You claim these proposed plans is to reduce congestion on the roads, but where is the consideration for cyclists alongside motorists? It is because there has been none, you fail to see how this puts cyclists in harms way. Since cycling regularly in the city for the past three years, I have had numerous brushes with motorists, fortunately none have resulted in serious injury or death but nonetheless the genuine threat to cyclist safety is ever present. This is because motorists already fail to pay attention to cyclists coming and going, the removal of bike lanes will only further put cyclists at greater risk of injury and death. Say, these proposals are passed, a true oversight and failure of your government, where and how do you propose cyclists travel? Do you propose we share the lanes with motorists? This would only add to congestion, no?\nI implore you to think rationally and with consideration to all who live in the city, your proposal has displayed a blatant disregard for everyone on the road and it is important you begin to see why that is wrong.\n"

Considering the cost of implementing the lanes in the first place and the cost and disruption that removing them would cause, this is not sound government policy. Wasteful government spending is contrary to conservative political thought. This government should not be pushing for more cars on the road. In lieu of investing in infrastructure and transit to make commuting more efficient, the government is wasting resources on this silly policy. Why are there so many people commuting via personal vehicle to work in the first place? Why are corporations forcing staff back into an office? It is foolish to think that this legislation is anything other than a naked attempt for the Premier to use his powers to make local, Toronto policy. Instead of tackling issues that actual affect the majority of Ontarians, this government continues to waste time and resources on personal vendettas of the Premier. It is quite clear that the government does not understand the responsibilities of the various levels of government. You were not elected in Toronto and you must stop meddling in the city\u2019s affairs.\n"

Riding on the street was considered dangerous back then, and it still is, but Toronto's efforts to create proper continuous biking infrastructure across the city has started to bear fruit. The Ontario government is manipulating data to underplay utilization and effectiveness. There are many parents and children riding the streets that would not otherwise dare.\nYou ought to be ashamed after the pomp and pandering about giving power back to the municipalities. This government has done nothing but run roughshod over the wishes of Canada's greatest city. The Premier has had it out for the city ever since it rejected him. The electoral math is also obvious. Doug Ford does not care what Toronto thinks. He's also obfuscating the true cost of removing them, a waste of time and effort.\nThe issue of congestion is caused by poor planning, not bike lanes. The city is designed for 1 million inhabitants but has 3 million instead, with another 3 living in the immediate vicinity. Consult professional transportation engineers, you cannot fix this problem with more cars and roads. The solutions are public transit, denser communities, and more bike lanes.\nLeave city planning to the cities. Stay in your own lane!\n"

Major cities like Montreal, New York, Paris, etc are investing and rapidely expending their protected bike lanes and related infrastructure.

They help reduce air and noise pollution. They make street safer for all users, including car drivers. They provide affordable/free transportation for all. They improve our population heatlh by making pwople exercise more. They are consitant with Toronto sustainability targets (net zero). Protected bike lanes are WAY cheaper and faster to implement compared with new TTC lines (even if they are also required).\nWith a fast growing population cities need to quickly improve and expend safe infrastructure for bikes along wit public transport, not reduce them!\nKeep our bike lanes.

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is completely and utterly a step backwards for Ontario's urban centres. Bike lanes are a necessary part of our dense communities and cities, specifically in downtown Toronto. Removing bike lanes would be catastrophic for the safety of cyclists, which is truly astounding considering how many cyclists are hit by vehicles each year already. As someone who personally knows a cyclist that was in a very serious accident and almost lost their life due to poor bike lanes and infrastructure in the City of Toronto, seeing this even being considered is beyond devastating. Reducing bike lanes to add vehicle lanes back in, is a step in the wrong direction from both a safety perspective but also from a sustainability standpoint. Adding back one lane will not reduce vehicle traffic on the roads, and arguably it will even increase vehicle traffic as without safe bike infrastructure, cyclists will begin driving. Vehicle emissions will rise and lead to poorer air quality, and increased negative health effects. With climate change and increasing global emissions, now more than ever Ontario needs to be promoting sustainable transit methods and working to reduce vehicle dependency, especially in our dense urban cores like Toronto. I cannot stress enough how completely backwards it is to be removing bike lanes to make more room for cars. We have focused way too much on planning our cities and communities for cars for way too long, we need to start planning our cities for people and their safety.\n"
