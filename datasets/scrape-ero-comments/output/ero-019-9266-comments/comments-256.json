        "comment": "This bill is an absolute misnomer. Removing bike lanes will lead to more people in cars, causing more traffic, more citizen deaths, more pollution, and worse cities across Ontario.\nAlso, it is a massive example of government overreach. Cities are responsible for their own roads and infrastructure. The Ontario government has no place telling cities what they can and can't do on their roadways especially when they have done their own research into the needs and wants of their own residents.\nBike lane have been proven to increase spending at adjacent businesses, have negligible impacts on driving times, do not impact emergency response times, and they increase the number of people cycling while reducing pedestrian and cyclist deaths.\nRemoving existing bike lanes will lead to more people dying. If the province is serious about Vision Zero, they will vote down this bill\n"

        "comment": "Kitchener-Waterloo bike lanes are hardly used, & incredibly inconvenient. The more lanes you have for cars, you would have less traffic in a standstill causing less carbon emissions.\n I see bikers not even using the rules of the road when it suits them causing them more at risk of getting hit. So i think whether we have the lanes or not there\u2019s always that risk. It\u2019s unavoidable.\n I find there is hardly a benefit at all or there needs to be a better way of holding bikers accountable for when they break the rules on the road.\nThey also don\u2019t pay taxes for road work. I\u2019ll pay any day to get them removed but the fact i had to pay to put them in just to make our lives more difficult drives me absolutely crazy.\n"

        "comment": "This idea is dangerous and backward thinking. The CARS are the problem, not the bike lanes. We cannot continue to bring in 500k people a year, and think that adding more cars, and winding lanes is the solution. The solution is a toll on cars in below Bloor, bordered by Roncy and Woodbine. $30. The CARS will go away, people will use alternative transportation. Protected bike lanes are essential. For socio-economic reasons, we need to preserve these lanes if not increase more protected lanes. People cannot afford to drive, and you are proposing to effectively influence only those with an income of $70k per year or more, as they are the only ones who can afford to drive. Coupled with online food ordering and delivery, you will only be rewarding those who can afford those deliverys as well.\n"

        "comment": "As a car commuter, I share the common frustration with increasing traffic congestion. I understand the annoyance that can come from sharing the road with cyclists, especially when it feels like they're slowing us down or creating unsafe situations. However, I believe that the proposed bill might actually make our driving experience more challenging rather than improving it, and this is backed by all the research I can find on the topic.\nHere's why:\n1. Keeping Cyclists Out of Car Lanes: Getting rid of bike lanes doesn't get rid of cyclists, it just puts them in our way. Dedicated bike lanes provide a separate space for cyclists, which means they are less likely to ride in the main traffic lanes we use. This separation can reduce unexpected slowdowns caused by encountering cyclists on the road, allowing for a smoother driving experience.\n2. Reducing Traffic Congestion: By offering safe routes for cyclists, some people may choose to bike instead of drive for short trips. This can lead to fewer cars on the road, which means less traffic for those of us who need to drive longer distances. Fewer vehicles can translate into shorter commute times and less stop-and-go traffic.\n3. Boosting Local Businesses: Roads designed for calmer traffic not only improve safety but also make commercial areas more accessible and attractive to pedestrians and cyclists. Cycling and driving at slower speeds can encourage people to explore local businesses they might otherwise pass by. This can lead to increased sales and a stronger local economy, which benefits everyone in the community.\n4. Improving Road Safety: With designated bike lanes and calmer traffic speeds, drivers can be more confident that cyclists are not suddenly entering their lanes, reducing the risk of accidents. Slower speeds give drivers more time to react to unexpected situations, making the roads safer for everyone.\n5. Enhancing Community Appeal: A community with bustling local businesses and safe, attractive streets increases property values and makes our neighborhood a more desirable place to live. This is beneficial for homeowners and can lead to better public services funded by a stronger tax base.\n6. Local Control Over Roads: The bill would require municipalities to seek provincial approval for changes that affect local roads. This could lead to delays and added bureaucracy, potentially slowing down other road improvements that could benefit drivers and the local economy.\nIn summary, while it might seem that reducing bike lanes and maintaining higher road speeds would make driving easier, the opposite could be true. Properly designed bike lanes and appropriately managed road speeds can keep cyclists out of our way, reduce overall traffic congestion, and make our drives safer and more efficient. Plus, supporting local businesses through increased cyclist traffic and more inviting roads benefits the entire community. I urge you to consider these points and rethink the proposed legislation for the benefit of all road users and our local economy, especially for those of us who rely on our vehicles every day.\n"

        "comment": "Not being familiar with the comment process, I am unsure whether the comment for different sections will be seen across the comments for the entire bill.  Assuming this is not the case, I submit the below which overlaps with my comments on the \"Building Highways Faster\" portion.\nI am hardly an activist, nor am I of any particular political bent, nor am I prone to hyperbole, but I feel forced to comment on this proposal.\nIt is appalling - starting with the cynical name of the bill.  The inference is that bicycle lanes cause gridlock.  There is very little evidence that this is the case. In fact, the opposite is more likely true - see the attached.  But the title grabs the headline.  I fear that for most people it stops there - believing that this is the case.  Any subsequent thoughtful follow-up is buried by the news cycle.  And for a certain segment of the population it also reinforces the idea that cyclists are the enemy.\nHowever, with respect to the environment, I would suggest that in the short term the impact would be minor.  The significant negative environmental impact of this bill would long term, in that it could discourage cycling.  It certainly doesn't promote it.   Bicycle lanes help to normalize cycling as a mode of transport, ultimately encouraging their use.  More bicycles means fewer vehicles, lessening emissions.\nThe government cannot be unaware of the numerous studies that show real, effective ways of reducing  traffic congestion (see attachment) - none of which include reducing bicycle lanes.  I can see no upsides to this bill, environmental or otherwise.  Rather than bravely taking long term actions that would make a real difference, the government wants to distract us with a proposed quick fix, which it clearly isn't.\nDon't look up.\n"

        "comment": "This is proposal is extremely misguided and short sighted. I vehemently oppose it for the following reasons: bike lanes are more effective at reducing traffic and gridlock than adding additional roads or highways. Bike lanes, where installed correctly, can improve road safety for ALL road users (including pedestrians). We should be prioritizing bikes and other modes of active transportation in order to improve the quality of life of Ontarians, and also to reduce carbon emissions (a point noticeably missing in this proposal). Finally, the provincial government should not have jurisdiction over municipalities to this extent. This proposal puts  too much centralized control into the provincial government, which will cost the taxpayers money due to inefficient practices.\n"

Adding more roads/lanes may lessen congestion for a year or two, but then it's back as bad as ever.\nWe need more people using transit and cycling and walking to reduce the number of car trips.\n"

        "comment": "This plan is politically driven and not evidence based. Numerous sources show that vehicular traffic congestion is not akin to rainwater: more lanes will not make it flow more smoothly. Rather, more lanes creates induced demand, leading to more cars on the road and more traffic overall. Major highways in Toronto, namely the 401 and Garnier Expressway, are prime examples of this\u2014despite the plethora of lanes, they often have standstill traffic.\nThe correct way to reduce vehicular traffic is to prioritize other modes of transportation. A combination of reliable and affordable public transportation services and comprehensive bike pathway systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, leading to less cars and therefore less induced traffic.\nMoreover, bike lanes make neighbourhoods safer for everyone\u2014they reduce traffic speed, making it less likely for both cyclists and pedestrians to be involved in a traffic accident. Delineated bike lanes in particular also prevent traffic accidents; the separation does not allow for cars to park in designated bike lanes, thereby preventing dooring and sudden merges into traffic. These lanes protect both cyclists and drivers in Ontario.\nIf you wish to reduce vehicular traffic, I urge you to invest into our cycling and public transportation infrastructure. Look to Sweden's urban planning for feasible ideas, or even Germany. We can achieve this goal without compromising the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

Progressive countries around the world are introducing bike lanes and restricting car access to cities (In Paris bicycles now outnumber cars).  If Doug Ford was not so cozy with developers he would realize that Ontarians do not wish an increase in highways - they want increase in public transit, Ontarians do not wish farm land removed for cars  - they want access to farm land retained in order to feed our population, Ontarians wish to reduce pollution and the burning of fossil fuels - they do not want Doug Ford continuing to ruin  our environment for Ontarians so that through building, building, building with no consideration for the future viability of our world.\n"

        "comment": "We are in 2024, climat change is on its way to getting worse and we need a net 0 carbon emission economy by 2030. It might be counter intuitive, but improving traffic by adding lanes is only a temporary solution because it will simply entice more people to go on the road which leads to worst traffic and increase carbon emissions. We NEED to remove cars from the road by having better public transport like buses, subway, tram, and train. Another way to eliminate cars and carbon is to use bikes. By having a safe, extensive and efficient biking network more people will be encouraged to use their bikes. We are not in the 60s anymore, we don\u2019t need a better car network, we need a bike network. By requiring selected municipalities to ask the provincial government if they can build a better world, YOU are making it unnecessarily harder and slower. There is a reason why we have a municipal government, because THEY know what THEIR road network needs and it what they need is more and better bike lanes the provincial government should only support it because the provincial government is not a municipal expert. So the provincial government should stop back seat driving because they are on a bike and not in a car.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential component of modern cities that enhance people's ability to get around, both directly and indirectly. They make it easier and safer for active transportation users to get around, reducing vehicle congestion for drivers. Cities have competent planners designing road infrastructure. Adding a provincial layer of approval is only unnecessary red tape and additional costs to an already costly process. Furthermore, the province has not given indication of what kind of criteria it will use to evaluate proposals.\nThe language used in this bill is intentionally misleading and wrongfully implies that people must chose between highways and bike lanes. It wrongfully implies that bike lanes have a negative impact on congestion. It makes completely irrelevant links to rural internet.\nThis government is trying to distract people from the government's inadequate funding of public transit, it's obsession with sprawling suburbs, and it's reluctance to provide equal opportunity to get around for people who cannot drive.\nI sincerely hope you withdraw this bill and let municipalities decide for themselves how to organize their roads and neighborhoods.\n"

Talk to urban planners, talk to EMS providers, they support the increased efficiency and economic impact of removing cars from the road and prioritizing safer transportation for all road users - pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, and more. We certainly don\u2019t want cyclists on side walks, but we have to give them safe places to ride. We need to promote people getting out of cars. Much of the slow traffic is not from bike lanes but from cars waiting to turn due to other road users and road design. I\u2019d rather be like Paris, France than an American suburb. This is the dumbest proposal which any study would tell you without much digging.\n"

They are green and they help make the city livable.\nIf we want to reduce gridlock, we should start by funding the TTC and adding bike lanes. We can also encourage carpooling. When we have viable alternatives to driving, people will be more inclined not to drive.\nI commute to work by bike from Toronto Danforth (using bike lanes on Gerrard, Shuter, Sherbourne, Richmond, and Adelaide) and have noticed a huge uptick in bike commuters. These lanes help make Toronto a more progressive city, as many people cannot afford a car, and public transit is usually much slower than biking. When I bike, I often notice that nearly every car is a single driver. Adding more lanes will only make us more dependent on cars - we need to give people viable alternatives and keep Toronto a livable city.\n"
