        "comment": "This is a terrible act and makes absolutely no sense beyond putting money in (already full) pockets. To reduce gridlock, the solution is to invest in non-car options. That's it. Not the 413, which this act is paving the way for, and definitely not making municipalities jump through hoops to install bike lanes.\nInvest in public transportation. Invest in safe modes of bike transit.\nPeople who cycle will not stop cycling. They will just do so in unsafe areas like the sidewalk or the street, going very slowly in front of cars. And guess what that will do? That's right, both get people killed AND increase gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Approving the Gridlock Act poses significant risks, especially since it won't actually alleviate traffic congestion as promised. While the Act claims to streamline transportation, its primary function is to expedite large highway projects by bypassing key environmental reviews, particularly through a hidden clause. This lack of transparency is concerning, as it enables development to move forward without public scrutiny or thorough assessment of the ecological impacts. Expanding highways has historically shown limited effectiveness in reducing traffic, often leading to more congestion as increased road capacity encourages additional car use.\nThe long-term environmental consequences are severe, for example: unchecked expansion risks habitat destruction, increased pollution, and loss of biodiversity, ultimately degrading local ecosystems and the quality of life in surrounding communities. Prioritizing short-term construction goals over sustainable urban planning, the Gridlock Act sacrifices environmental integrity with little actual benefit to commuters.\n"

        "comment": "Approving the Gridlock Act is problematic due to its potentially devastating long-term impact on the surrounding environment. The Act, under the guise of reducing traffic and streamlining transport routes, essentially encourages overdevelopment by paving the way for expansive highway projects without stringent environmental assessments. By hiding a clause that accelerates the approval process for a new highway, the Act bypasses critical oversight meant to protect local ecosystems. This lack of transparency is concerning, as it undermines public trust and prevents thorough evaluation of the project's environmental impact. Over time, the unchecked expansion could lead to habitat destruction, increased pollution, and reduced biodiversity, threatening the health of local wildlife and communities. This shortcut may benefit certain industries or developers in the short term, but the ecological harm and loss of natural spaces would be irreversible, making it a dangerously shortsighted approach to infrastructure.\n"

Show it to them instead of prioritizing cars once again! I live by the Gardiner ramp off Lower Jarvis St. and it is an absolute disaster. There\u2019s no such thing as rush hour anymore. It\u2019s a mess for most of the day with traffic control resources being used to direct cars and diffuse frustration of drivers. Invest in alternate ways to travel around the city that improve and reframe the traveller experience instead of providing bandaid solutions that isolate a large population of commuters. And be truthful\u2014cars are not the safer, more economical, healthier way!\n"

Attempting hide the removal of environmental protection to fast track the construction of Hwy 113, behind the control of municipal bike lanes is underhanded and should be grounds for removal from office.\nUsing provincial funds to destroy infrastructure already constructed and paid for by the city of Toronto is the opposite of fiscal responsibility.\nStop wasting taxpayer money on legislation that only benefit donors to the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "I agree that the provincial government oversees the bikes lanes. There is a proliferation of bike lanes affecting traffic and considering only local traffic, while in reality it affects commuters from multiple localities. For example, a person living in Milton need to commute or do errands at multiple locations in downtown Toronto, similarly with people from Scarborough, Vaughn, Brampton, etc. The GTA is huge and people need to move around. Bicycle infrastructure is mostly used by  locals, for recreational purposes, a few months and during day time. It is obviously impractical for long distances errands, with multiple family members (e.g. babies, elderly), riding with packages, during night time, and bad weather commuting.\n"

        "comment": "I feel that this bill has some extreme impropriety - the provincial level should not be meddling in Toronto level affairs simply to pander to Northern Ontario voters.\nIf the issue is truely about lane congestion, the great impact with least enforcement cost should be targetted at building developers who demand lane closures when they could be bussing in workers like many more advanced countries do. Building developers have been using Toronto's streets as a proxy extension of their building sites for years, but because monied interests are involved they are not the spotlight issue here.\nTraffic studies have already shown that the absence of bike lanes correlates to increased collisions and cyclist harm, and the current bike lanes are grossly abused by delivery drivers and Toronto police as free parking already. Removing these lanes will harm businesses in the areas since cyclists will have diminished safety.\nDo the right thing and stop selling out Toronto and the province into the pockets of private developers who are the ones actually clogging up city streets.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes or even not expanding the bike network is dangerous for cyclists and a huge step back in urban development. The government should be focused on ensuring all commuters are safe and encouraging more individuals to use alternative modes of transportation. It\u2019s good for public health, for the environment, and safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Why is Ford obsessed with cars? We are living the impacts  of climate change and instead of implementing policies that will benefit our communities, this government keeps pushing cars. What\u2019s more, expanding car lanes (and highways) has been shown not to improve traffic but worsen it. Make decisions based on the public good and not corporate greed.\n"

        "comment": "To reduce gridlock, a better approach would to implement tolls on toads that would variety depending on level of traffic - eg higher during rush hour.\nThe money can be re - invested in public transit and improved road maintenance\nAnother way would be to regulate construction in the city - specifically road repair and condo building.\nThe goal is to make transportation convenient and accessible for as many people as possible. There should be a greater emphasis low carbon transportation - cycling, public transit\nBanning and controlling bike lanes only marginalizes one group and will solve little.\n"

Do you think about the fact this infrastructure was created to save lives?\nWhy can you spend money on ripping up perfectly good infrastructure that improves businesses, saves lives, and eases congestion but somehow you have no money to:\n1. Improve healthcare\n2. Fund education\n3. FINISH TRANSIT PROJECTS\nAnother thing: Have you considered that this will put every delivery driver on the sidewalk? Oh joy, sure your constituents will love that.\nAll bikes have a right to an entire lane of traffic. I bet that will really speed up everybody's commute when all the bikes take the car lane for safety purposes.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike Lanes seems like a pretty poor plan. The long-term issues of moving people around a dense City will not be helped in this way. Add many more GO train and GO bus runs into the city so that folks from the surrounding areas don't have to drive in if they don't want to. Further increase TTC services. Lots of people would happily get out of their cars and free up space on the road.\nEncouraging more people onto the bike Lanes would be a better use of space. You would also be much safer. This policy seems like it's designed to have people hit by cars and some of those will be killed. This is an entirely predictable harm of this policy.\n"
