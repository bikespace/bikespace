        "comment": "The bike lanes in the city have been one of the few cultural and logistical selling points for keeping young adults in the city. It keeps transportation costs low to make up for the absurd rent prices, gives civilians a chance to explore the city and stay fit, and lightens the co2 emissions, traffic flow and TTC congestion altogether. It is mine and all my friend's favourite method of transportation and allows us to actually enjoy Toronto. They allow me to go to work, medical appointments, see my friends and contribute to the local economy with the money that I'm saving on a car, gas, parking etc.( all the things that are heinous in toronto to begin with).\nWe need more. It will attract a vibrant, happy and healthy subset of people and improve the city's overall lifestyle.\n"

        "comment": "This does not serve the interests of a large and growing minority of Torontonians including me and my family of 4. The proportion of trips we make in Toronto by bike are 50%, by walking 30%, transit 15%, drive 5%. We frequently bike along the University, Adelaide, Richmond, College bike arteries, an occasionally Harbord, Yonge, and Bloor too.\nRemoving bike lanes in Yonge, Bloor and University would be an error and cause the exact poorer safety for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. You would be impairing the mobility of all commuters. You are jeopardizing the safety of my family that includes 2 school aged children.\nI urge you allow the City of Toronto to follow its own research and procedures in setting it's own lanes for bikes and motor vehicles for the best mobility of all Torontonians.\n"

If the impact of human-created climate change isn\u2019t proof enough, the provincial government wants to ignore the economic facts and evidence?? BIKE LANES ARE GOOD FOR THE BOTTOM LINE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES by making them more easily accessible. Being stuck in traffic is NOT the fault of bike lanes and cyclists, but the decades-long lack of financial support from the provincial level to repair roads and critical infrastructure,  and build new fast and affordable public transit.\nStay the hell out of our business Mr. Ford. We don\u2019t need your bully approach to solving our transit and traffic problems. The work of your Metrolinx agency is easily the most succinct and poisonous example of how to completely paralyze entire neighbourhoods and upend the lives of thousands upon thousands of residents and small business owners all across the City of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Please don't spend taxpayer money to put our City in a backwards direction against the progress to successful, modern Cities. I have lived in the Annex near Bloor St for over a decade and am both a driver and a biker. I have driven on Bloor before and after bike lanes and have only seen improvements in car flow and bike flow. These decisions should be left the community who live in the community, see and use the streets. Commuters coming in daily face gridlock as there are millions of people coming in daily at the same time. Millions. Removing a bike lane won't fix car gridlock, and certainly is not a long term solution as Toronto grows and commuters rise. Rush hour happens everywhere. Not only on Bloor St. If you say more cars can fit on Bloor St without a bike lane, where will they be able to rush off to? Will there still be gridlock down Spadina and other major streets where there are currently no bike lanes toward the Gardiner that is backed up? Please consider long term solutions - more public transit and more bike lanes will and have been proven to reduce cars on the road. The Provincial government's consideration for this is deeply disappointing and shocking. They have not provided studies of any benefit, are wasting our money, putting the public in danger and are overstepping the community's decision. Bikers need to use both main streets and side streets to get places in Toronto. Tell me how to get to Union Station on bike without using a major street? Why is the safety of Toronto citizens being taken away who would have to share a lane with a car?\nPlease actually listen to the local community and urban community at large and consider our money, our life and our safety before making these decisions. I don't think the government is naive to the fact that more room for cars does not reduce traffic - I am sure the government is familiar with the many studies, example Cities and planning expert opinions, so as to why all relevant government employees are pushing this ludicrous idea is concerning and questions trust in this government who doesn't appear to be making decisions for public good and benefit.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this proposal is an innapropitae overreach of the provincial government on municipal matters. The provincial government needs to prioritize other more important issues such as health care and education rather than telling municipal governments whether they can or cannot build bike lanes. In addition, research has shown multiple times that building bike lanes will reduce traffic (also combat climate change and benefit people's health). Studies have shown multiple times that having more car lanes will not solve traffic. Cars are very inefficient at transporting people especially because most cars are occupied by only one person at a time thus taking up more space on the road. We need more sustainable modes of transportation to fix traffic and building more bike lanes is one such method. (And also investing more in public transportation)\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my vehement opposition to the proposed legislation regarding bike lanes, as outlined in ERO Notice #019-9266. This proposal is not just misguided; it appears to be a blatant attempt to cater to a small, vocal minority while disregarding the overwhelming evidence supporting cycling infrastructure. I am a car driver and occasional cyclist and I disagree with the proposal from both perspectives. My concerns are as follows:\n1. Impact on Traffic Congestion: Although the tagline of \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\" is undoubtedly catchy, it is unfortunately based in a pretty weak argument. I have not seen any compelling or reputable studies that suggest that bike lanes contribute to gridlock. Research from the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) indicates that well-designed bike lanes can improve overall traffic flow. For example, a study in New York City showed that dedicated bike lanes led to reduced vehicle congestion and increased travel speeds for all road users. In fact, evidence suggests that poor transit alternatives and high levels of on-street parking make a greater contribution to traffic congestion. Is the Province also planning to create legislation that limits on street parking as well?\n2. Safety Concerns: Removing bike lanes raises significant safety issues for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. These lanes not only protect cyclists but also enhance pedestrian safety by creating a buffer between moving vehicles and vulnerable road users. The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure can lead to a more predictable environment for all road users, thereby reducing the risk of accidents. This is particularly true when removing sections of bike lanes. Cycling levels are only going to increase and as a car user I would rather have certainty about where cyclists are on the road.\n3. Environmental Concerns: The environmental implications of removing bike lanes cannot be overlooked, and the vague promise that \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new and existing cycling lanes.\" is not wholly reassuring. Cycling is a low-emission mode of transport that contributes to reducing urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation. I have attached links with supporting evidence. I very much look forward to the province sharing the evidence for their decisions, which I am sure have been carefully researched and considered and are not a knee jerk reaction to someone important being late to a meeting because of traffic.\n"

        "comment": "A lot of money was put to put bike lanes for children, adults, and everyone to cycle safely in Toronto for those that cannot afford a car or want to incorporate a healthy mode for transport. In this day and age where cost of living is increasing, various modes of transit including bicycles should be explored. Cars take up more space on a road compared to a cyclist or even a bus that holds 30-40 passengers. I live in downtown Toronto and have felt safe cycling from yonge and bloor to etobicoke with these bike lanes to see family and improve my health to avoid straining our health care system. Studying Architecture and Urban Planning - there are various benefits to protected bike lanes, you reduce fatalities, you enforce drivers to manouvre safely and keep their eye on pedestrians and cyclists, you keep people healthy.\nI think this policy choosing to remove bike lanes in a major city is not thought out - New York and Chicago have more extensive bike networks. After months finishing the street upgrades for bikelanes in Downtown Toronto - just to rip it off seems additional expense that will cost Ontarians money and putting more traffic in our streets with construction. The main priority the Provincial governament should look into is investing in ways to encourage public transit use and providing reliable subway and bus service to take non-essential vehicles off the roads and enable essential vehicles for emergency services, construction, and necessary transport of goods and services to move with ease.Could we allow the city to study the stats and the impact of a bikelane installation after 4 years to see what benefits and drawbacks it entails? Seems wasteful when some of the improvements in my area are not even a year old, and many people have used the bike lanes this past summer. Bike Share Toronto has reported increased ridership.\nSInce the pandemic of 2020 - How come TTC investment and improving services and reliability, completing the Eglinton LRT is not even put into priority? If you want to reduce gridlock - invest and make public transit (TTC) much more reliable and improve subway infrastructure, and increase bus service, have a reliable, continuous bike network that encourages everyone to use it. For someone who lives in Toronto - hold site developers accountable when their contractor's construction trucks hog up the laneway and hold up traffic inefficiently.\nI strongly oppose this proposed direction of eliminating our bike lanes, it's an inequitable approach. I think all forms of transportation should be embraced and active forms should be encouraged.\n"

If the bike lanes are removed me and my family will be putting our lives in the hands of careless and distracted drivers.\nI lost a friend this year when a driver hit and killed him with his car.

There is no question but that removing the bike lanes, and re-prioritizing inefficient vehicles will increase traffic, and lower air quality in the downtown area. More emissions, more brake dust, more people getting run over, are all 100% predictable outcomes of this policy. It is an attack on our environment and quality of life, by a government overstepping its jurisdiction. More than this, it is a slap in the face to every taxpayer. The Ford government is spending huge sums to vandalize this city, and destroy infrastructure we just invested in. The disrespect for tax payers, who work hard to pay for things like proper infrastructure in our city (e.g., diverse transportation options) is a scandal.\n"

Over the last 30 years I have spent many periods in other cities, and upon returning home was thrilled at the increase in cycling infrastructure to alleviate the congestion cause by drastic population increase. I am happy to ride to restaurants, shops, work, anywhere, and note that I own a registered motor vehicle and two motorcycles. It is appalling to me that the provincial government would ignore factual data and consider such regressive and intrusive policies. As a voting conservative, I vow to never vote conservative again if this bizarre motion is passed. The city prospers from people being active economically, it regressees by turning our interior roads into highways, the same roads which were already congested a decade ago, long before any cycle lanes were installed.\n"
