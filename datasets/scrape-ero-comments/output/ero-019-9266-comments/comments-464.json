        "comment": "As a casual cyclist who bikes to run errands around the city, as well as commuting occasionally, the last thing the city needs is fewer bike lanes.  A decade ago, I rode my bike nearly everywhere for every task that didn't require a car, but as the city has become more hostile towards cyclists, I find myself pushed to the edges, taking the Lakeshore Trail rather than surface streets to to east/west, and basically not going north due to there not being a safe way to do so.\nRemoving existing infrastructure in order to placate drivers is 100% the absolute wrong decision in a world of climate change and lack of public transit infrastructure.  Adding more cars to the city will do nothing more than make traffic jams worse, car accidents more frequent, and drivers will still complain.\nRather that destroying what's already been created for cyclists, the city and province need to focus on improving the bike lanes as well as improving drivers' understanding of how cyclists and drivers can coexist.\nAs for the idea that cycle lanes are bad for local businesses, that is anecdotal at best as every major study shows that bike lanes either increase foot traffic to business or at worst don't cause a negative impact.\nDo not remove the cycling infrastructure as that will only add fuel to the existing drivers vs bikes fire because it will put more cyclists into the roads (where else are we supposed to go if we lose bike lanes?) and will result in more accidents/fatalities.\n"

How about encouraging people to walk, how about better more effienciet public transit options NOT buses or above ground trams, how about adding bike lanes??? Bike lanes for bikes only!!! NOT for electric bikes, scooters etc. BIKES- encouraging exercise and lowering carbon footprint. Disgusting Mr. Ford. You've lost my support.\n"

Doug Ford claims that only 1.2% of Torontonians bike to work. However, that data is from 1991. A study from 30+ years ago doesn't reflect the Toronto and its citizens of today!\nCurrent studies, which I'm sure he and his government have ignored because they don't fit their  narrative, show exactly the opposite. Ridership is up and we need to support and PROTECT Toronto's cyclists. We need to acknowledge the cycling deaths that have occurred in this city. It is shameful that we are even proposing such a Bill with the cyclist AND pedestrian deaths that have occurred in our city! The common denominator is always cars and the many distracted, speeding, 'main character syndrome' people that drive them. Bike lanes not only enhance safety for cyclists but also contribute to reduced traffic congestion, reduced speeding and reduced pollution. A modern city I would be proud to live in!\nWe live in a city of one person per car mentality. We live in a city where the right-hand lane is essentially a parking lot. It will continue to be and will continue to cause this congestion you blame on cyclists. We should be completing our construction and transit projects in a timely manner (HELLO LRT), keep existing transit running smoothly and encouraging more people to find alternative means to get around our city, for example, cycling.\nBike lanes should be the least of this government's worries. We need to protect the people that are making our city run smoother. We need to protect them, because they MATTER and their tax dollars should count too, no? We need to KEEP existing infrastructure set up for cyclists and not go back in time as if all of this is their fault. I\u2019m absolutely fed up with this government and their inability to read the room and follow proper studies that have been done concerning this issue and in turn make Toronto less safe for EVERYONE.\nDoug Ford needs to stay focused on bigger issues that he hasn't seemed to pay attention to during his time in office. Instead, he's focused on the important things like proposing Bill 212 and getting more alcohol in our corner stores. What a GREAT, soulless, contribution he has made to our society. But I guess it's all a welcomed distraction when you're not accomplishing anything at all.\nSincerely,\nFed up pedestrian, car owner, and spouse of a cyclist (An experienced cyclist, I should add, that I worry about every day when he leaves our home and rides to and from work in the GTA.)\n"

Why is the provincial government coming in from one man's comments to shut down the city's progress towards a more friendly bike-able city?\nI personally have been looking forward to more accessible bike lanes and bike shares in the downtown core so I can enjoy all the city has without adding to the gridlock by driving or inducing a demand for more ride shares. Biking along Queens Quay W, Adelaide, Richmond, and University Ave have been the only viable paths for me to feel safe - we need a lot more. I have since moved to North York and the infrastructure is just beginning to be built out - I can only reach a limited number of locations safely today.\nPlease do not stop the progress of adding bike lanes, I dream of a bikable city where my future children can safely get to school and activities without adding yet another car to the streets.\n"

Toronto - and Ontario - lag FAR behind in terms of appropriate infrastructure of CHOICE in safe transportation.  Bicycling has been my preferred mode for commuting and getting around the city, by saving me time and providing exercise. I have so enjoyed the installation of bike lanes over the last decade in Toronto. Your bill will NOT save me time, cycling does.\nRemoving bike lanes from some of the most travelled arteries in Toronto will certainly lead to death and injury for vulnerable road users. As a cyclist who has been hit from the side and doored by someone on busy roads without bike lanes, I can attest to the physical and emotional injury consequent to unsafe infrastructure. Cycling and infrastructure that encourages cycling - which bike lanes do - have innumerable benefits to individual health (physically and emotionally), community health, local economic health, and climate health.\nFurther, gridlock is a result of inadequate policies decreasing automobile use. Please empower municipalities to create plans that benefit ALL citizens, rather than dragging them back and getting in their way.\n"

        "comment": "The move to rip out recently built bike lanes represents a significant waste of taxpayer money, undoing decades of hard work and investments into transportation infrastructure.\nBike lanes are vital for cities, making them safer, healthier, and promoting business. Toronto\u2019s bike lanes are no exception; they are essential to the function of the city, and they are under threat.\nThe proposed Bill 212 plans to remove portions of the major bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University, and impedes the creation of future bike lanes. We believe the bill is very dangerous both in terms of what it means for the future of bike infrastructure in Ontario and in terms of the ability of cities to govern themselves.\nThe Progressive Conservative government claims that bike lanes are bad for business and that by removing the bike lanes on these major streets gridlock will be reduced, but this is not true. Businesses in the Bloor Annex state that their business have flourished due to the bike lanes and that bike customers far exceed car ones. The Star found that bike lanes are not responsible for vehicle gridlock, since the addition of bike lanes to Toronto's central roads commute times have both increased and decreased, largely due to external factors like construction and post-Covid traffic increases, not due to the bike lanes themselves.\nIf this bill passes, these streets will be much more unsafe. Bicycle lanes reduce the likelihood of crashes by up to 45%, and in Toronto there have been numerous deaths due to a lack of cycling infrastructure. We cannot let this happen, we need to protect bike lanes not only for the sake of bikers but for the sake of the whole city.\n"

I don't own a car, and public transit is extremely inconvenient for the route I have to take. I have friends who are cyclists and have suffered severe injuries in parts of Toronto without bike lanes. The Bloor bike lane is always full of cyclists, perhaps one of the most used and most fought for bike lanes. The cost of tearing it down, just in terms of dollars does not equal the benefit of time saved to car drivers, let alone the environmental costs, and safety costs to cyclists and pedestrians.\nBeyond this, the placement of bike lanes in Toronto need to be decided by planners who live and work in the city. It makes no sense to have the province involved in these decisions. Many people in Toronto who bike don't own cars. Biking works well in Toronto because of infrastructure progress like the Bike lane on Bloor. This bill is incredibly backwards, and not considering the needs of low income people in Toronto, environmental concerns, or just logical budget concerns. Tearing infrastructure down that cost money to build and serves a majority? Come on?! This is ridiculous!\n"

        "comment": "This is completely ridiculous. The Premier, on a nonsensical and anti-fact crusade against bikes, is attempting to reverse years of progress we've made in infrastructure improvements. It is a fact that has been proven time and time again that when you incentivize driving, more people drive, and when you incentivize other forms of transit, people use those. By giving the province power to remove bike infrastructure and to prevent its expansion in the future, this bill will make commuting worse for *all* Ontarians, not just the \"small minority\" who cycle.\nThe argument often used by bike opponents is that a small number of people in Toronto use bikes. However, this is because cycling infrastructure is lacking overall, barren in many areas, and incomplete in others. Rather than taking the 2% average city-wide, which includes areas with no bike infrastructure, why doesn't the Premier consider that areas with developed bike infrastructure are greater than 10%? Shouldn't this lead to the conclusion that more investment in bike infrastructure will lead to a higher rate of usage and take more cars off the road?\nThe highest rates of bicycle usage in the city surround Bloor Street - logically, due to its dedicated bike lane and the many routes that connect to it. A reduction of even a few percentage points of usage, which the Bloor Street bike lane removal would lead to, could mean hundreds or thousands of more cars on Bloor Street per day, which, I submit, would cause even worse gridlock than is supposedly being caused by bike lanes.\nAs an Torontonian who both drives and bikes, I am very upset by the Province's attempt to destroy progress and eliminate a net positive for residents. The Premier's crusade against cycling will therefore make commutes worse for all Torontonians and should be disregarded like the nonsense it is.\n"
