It is absolutely ridiculous that they've been put on major arteries through the city.

The City should target secondary streets only.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is based on misinformation and will result in little to no improvement to traffic congestion but instead a predictable increase in injuries and deaths.\nIt\u2019s unclear what statistic would ever represent enough people for this government to value their lives enough to separate them from fast-moving vehicles weighing over a tonne, but more than the government-cited figure of 1.2% \u201ccommute\u201d by bicycle in more recent years, there are many more kinds of trips taking place than just commuting, and the specific neighbourhoods where most of the mentioned bike lanes are located have much higher rates of cycling than the city\u2019s average and especially the metropolitan area that includes other cities. In some neighbourhoods the majority of households don\u2019t own a vehicle, including my own, so it is completely unjustifiable to remove safe alternative options except to convince us to buy cars and create more traffic than before.\nThere are almost never \u201cside streets\u201d available to which bike lanes could be relocated for any significant distance, and if claims that bike lines should simply be moved were serious the proposal would allow for a viable route to be confirmed and built BEFORE removing the current bike lanes. People on bicycles also have a right and need to visit destinations on main streets as much if not more-so than drivers who are more likely to only pass through.\nThe proposal\u2019s goal is to reopen \u201ctraffic\u201d lanes, but in many cases including the majority of Bloor street before bike lines were installed, these \u201ctraffic\u201d lanes were nearly always used as parking and loading zones. Even if these are officially reserved for moving traffic for a few hours during rush hour, these restrictions are often ignored by drivers, and the people still willing to ride bicycles in the unsafe conditions you\u2019ve created will be occupying those lanes, so that you will have accomplished nothing in terms of your stated goals. The government has also shown zero recognition of the fact that people on bicycles are also \u201ctraffic\u201d and that their numbers in a bike lane has been comparable or even higher than the number of people moved through a larger car lane.\nIf there are concerns with bike lanes, there are many better solutions available than to blindly remove them with complete disregard for evidence, local elected representatives, and people\u2019s lives.\n"

Each city is unique, and the municipal governments are in the best position to understand what is best for their own commuters, residents and businesses.\nActive transportation, including bicycles, have been proven in many, many cities of the world to reduce traffic and congestion by getting cars off the road.  Many more bicycles will fit in the same road space than cars. Active transportation helps people stay healthy (assuming they have safe places to walk and cycle!), and also reduces the emissions that are causing significant decreases in air quality which impact people's health.  Cities that do not have cars in their downtown centres have been shown to be safer and healthier.\nIt is cars that create gridlock, not bicycles. Let's reduce the number of cars on the road through providing efficient mass transit into and throughout our cities, plus safe spaces for active transportation.\n"

Currently I am a fraud to Nike on most streets except the ones with dedicated bike lanes. I have been to Montreal which has embraced bikes in a climate more severe than Toronto. It seems to work. Amsterdam is amazing with cargo bikes so common. We need to move bike lanes throughout the city and restrict powered vehicles from most of downtown. Many European cities charge a premium to drive into the city and it reduces the pollution and congestion. We must encourage public transit as well. When London UK removed many gas vehicles students were walking to school because it was easier to breath fresh air.\n"

I want them in a separate lane, so that I never have to worry about them when I'm driving. This is only going to make my life harder and cost me a bunch of money in taxes, for no good reason.\nI encourage the government to *not* pass this bill and instead focus on getting more people off the road entirely (e.g. better subway service!), instead of doing things that sound good in the media but don't actually make anyone's lives better.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose bill 212 for several reasons:\nA Massive Waste of Taxpayer Money: Removing bike lanes that were recently installed is fiscally irresponsible. These lanes were funded by taxpayers, and tearing them up would squander those investments with nothing to show for it. Over a hundred million dollars of tax money completely wasted.\nBikes Are Hugely Beneficial for Our City: Cycling infrastructure is essential for building a more sustainable, efficient, and livable Toronto. Bikes allow for the movement of more people with zero emissions, minimal noise pollution, and significant health benefits for riders. Investing in active transportation supports the city's climate goals and public health, which should be a priority for any forward-thinking government.\nThis Bill Wastes Government Resources and Fails to Address Traffic Problems: The proposed removal will do little, if anything, to solve the larger traffic issues plaguing our city. The 401 will remain gridlocked, and there is no guarantee this will even improve congestion on Bloor Street. Instead of making hasty and short-sighted changes, the government should focus on innovative and sustainable solutions to address traffic. The 413 isn't a good solution either. How about investing in our rail infrastructure to get trucks off the road. Or so that it doesn't take longer by train than it is to drive. Or construction projects that don't exceed a decade to complete.\nRemoving bike lanes would be a step backward for Toronto and an embarrassing misuse of time, money, and resources.

        "comment": "I do not agree with a lot of the bike lanes in this city. People rarely ride bikes all year yet we use cars all the time. Bike lanes should not be on major roads causing a removal of a car lane. As much as you don\u2019t like it, we need our cars especially for those of us living outside of the downtown core (but who need to come downtown for various reasons such as occasional work, appointments, etc). You need to be optimizing traffic for cars. Taking a car is still often quicker than public transit and allows us to be more flexible (eg need to leave to pick up a sick kid). TTC is so unsafe and dirty and GO train is so limited with its schedule. It would be a lot quicker for me to run to work or drive than to take transit bc of the way it is setup for my route. Closing the bayview extension to cars going north was also a major mistake as that was a large route for diverting traffic off the lower DVP/lakeshore. It seems like people who like bike lanes are people that live downtown and only travel short distances and don\u2019t have kids/pets. This isn\u2019t Europe so stop trying to make us so bike focused. These lanes rarely get used outside of the immediate downtown core. Divert bikes to less busy roads.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed act ignores several truths:\n1).      we are in a climate emergency and this act ignores the need to reduce the number of carbon emitting vehicles on  the roads.\n2)       Billions of tax dollars spent on new highways, paving over scarce farmlands and wetlands (which mitigate flooding )   are better invested in public transit infrastructure including high speed trains  and local efficient train service\n3).      for much less cost  ( financial and environmental) the Province could subsidize users of  the highway 407 toll road which is well below capacity freeing up other highways.\n4)       building more highways does not lessen gridlock ; it adds more drivers to the roads .  There is research available to the provincial government (which it selectively ignores ) that new highways/ road  only get filled up with more vehicles thus needing more roads and the cycle continues .\n5)      Cities need more revenue tools than just property taxes  to deal with infrastructure and maintenance of road and bridges . It is inequitable that all taxpayers  ( including non drivers) fund roads and highways. Toll roads make more sense but the Province has banned them inexplicably.\n6).    Maybe I am biased but Toronto is the economic engine of the province and the country .   The province (and Federal government)  should remember this and not hinder Toronto\u2019s  democratic agency\nand its desire to be a vibrant functioning world class city .\nprescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\nI strongly disagree,    the province should not interfere and micro-manage a municipal issue that        could and should be dealt with by locally elected representatives as is their right.  Why bother electing a local council if only to be vetoed by Big Brother provincial government.\nThe proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed. Based on the outcome of the review, a regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane and its return to a lane of traffic.\nI strongly disagree for the reasons above  as well as the total waste of tax payers money in the municipal and provincial level - funds that could be spent improving public transport   that would move more people  -   Not just \u201cdrivers\u201d !  Both levels of government have large deficits that need to be addressed before tax dollars are thrown out the window . The resultant months long road work would only  compound the gridlock the city of Toronto faces . This is a cynical ploy to curry favour with  Etobicoke voters before an election.\nThe framework is proposed to require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto.  Additional authorities to facilitate the removal of these lanes would also be included in the legislation including an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act and the requirement for the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes.\nI strongly disagree for the above reasons . I agree The City could have done consultations , plans and implementation of the bike lanes much better.  The chronically underfunded TTC  could not help to get more cars  off the road and mitigating the resultant gridlock . But it is not and the Province is partly culpable for this .\nHowever, given the sunk costs and costs undo the bike lanes . patience is required  -  other jurisdictions have done well in getting more cars off the roads  , moving people with a strong public transit system , improving air quality, for all local citizens . If the province can help with better suggestions to achieve this , the city should welcome its input but the province should respect local democracy.\n"

That it will increase greenhouse gas emissions through increased use of passenger automobiles over other forms of transportation. This is highly regrettable in the context of the climate crisis which is considered by climate scientists to be an existential threat to human survival.\n2.

Why is the province meddling in municipal affairs?  How would the provincial government respond if it was told how to operate its highways by the federal government?

        "comment": "I am deeply opposed to Bill 212. This provincial government has shown time and time again that it is self-interested and politically motivated, putting itself and its survival ahead of the broader interests of Ontarians. This bill will not reduce gridlock and save people time. The removal of bike lanes in the core is  a useful political wedge issue, but flies in the face of what traffic engineers and subject matter experts have to say about the effect of bike lanes on traffic. It is, however, obvious that this government is not interested in data or expertise on this matter. That much is clear when the number most often cited by both Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria is from a 2011 StatsCan survey. Recent data from the Ministry of Transportation suggests that cyclists represent around 5.8% of commuters in the City of Toronto. For trips into the downtown, where the bike lanes targeted are located, over 9% of road users traveled by bike, compared with 25% by car. In terms of the space allocated to each modal use, bike lanes are pulling their weight.\nBut this government does not care about data. Nor that traffic is mostly caused by construction. It is deeply committed to an ideological approach that will likely result in winning votes necessary for re-election, but will not provide long-term congestion relief. The province's own planning guidelines contradict its new approach on bike lanes, with most new developments in Toronto planned with more bicycle parking spots than car parking spots.\nThis is a deeply inappropriate jurisdictional over-reach, a waste of money, and a farce. Traffic will continue to worsen with fewer alternatives to driving available. People will die. But none of that matters to Premier Ford. This is good politics and bad governance.\nWhile bike lanes have received most of the press, the portions of this bill focused on Highway 413 are also deeply troubling. Citizens will be more likely to have their property rights trampled, all in service of a highway that will provide no long-term congestion relief. Highway 413 will not save commuters 30 mins end-to-end as the government promises; it will accelerate sprawl and shape future development patterns in Ontario, leading to more cars, more driving, and more congestion. Decades from now we can have the same conversation again, about needing to pave more farmland for a new highway that will surely be the one to solve congestion once and for all.\n"

I use my bicycle as much as I can in the city to avoid gridlock -- and to help cut down on it. As a driver I experience the most gridlock on roads like the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway that are NOT affected by bike lanes. And if there were better regional and within-the-city surface transit options, I would be driving my car even less. Decisions about bike lanes are a municipal matter. The cost to remove them is prohibitive. If I have to sit in my car for a few more minutes for the greater safety of others and to cut down on the pollution caused by vehicular traffic -- I'm all for it.\n"
