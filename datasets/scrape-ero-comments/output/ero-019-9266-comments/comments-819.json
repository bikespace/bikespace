The bike lane is hardly used, yet causes so much traffic congestion, negatively affects small businesses and creates unsafe conditions for both drivers and cyclists. I witness the negative impacts of the bike lane on Bloor St W on a daily basis, and would love to see my neighborhood be peaceful, approachable and safe once again.\n"

        "comment": "As a homeowner and landlord with properties in Toronto, I strongly oppose this proposed legislation, which risks decreasing the value of my investments. I chose to invest in Ontario because I believed in its forward-looking future, particularly the rapid modernization of downtown Toronto. Now, with this shift in approach, I have serious doubts. My property in Vancouver has benefited significantly from its proximity to biking infrastructure, not just in terms of value appreciation but also with satisfied tenants who appreciate the convenience. Additionally, the young family who resides in one of my Toronto property really enjoys the safety afforded by complete streets in their downtown neighbourhood. While I primarily drive and use transit, I firmly believe that the more people who have alternative ways to travel, the less stress it places on our roads. Restricting the expansion of bike lanes could hinder Toronto\u2019s growth and its ability to remain a competitive, attractive urban core. This legislation also puts my property rights at risk with its unreasonable expropriation clauses, further decreasing the attractiveness of investing in Ontario and Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "IN 2017, Doug Ford said the following: \"You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" I'm sure I won't be the only commenter to remind the government of this very sensible statement, made by Ford after actually cycling on Toronto streets.\nApparently Premier Ford has a short memory, and has decided it's now perfectly fine to sacrifice cyclists to one of his favourite voting blocks: car drivers. (The other, it seems, is heavy drinkers.) Yet again, this government has decided to override local democratic planning processes via a dictatorial central-planning regime that fails to honour painstakingly researched municipal decision-making, and then downloads all of the costs for this provincial interference onto the city. An incredible and completely unnecessary waste of resources!\nI am both a cyclist and a driver; I cycle year-round and mainly use the downtown bicycle lanes parallel to the Queen and King Street corridors. Anything to stay off the deadly main automobile arteries, where the cyclist is squeezed between parked cars and moving traffic, and is relegated to the worst-maintained parts of the road. Every time I'm on my bike, it means I am not driving a car and slowing down traffic. In addition to keeping cyclists relatively safe from automotive traffic, bicycle lanes encourage cycling, thereby alleviating congestion.\nThis is not just a political disagreement. Cyclists are killed every year on Toronto's roads because they are simply unsafe. (I myself have a permanent metal implant from a serious injury caused by a careless driver.) This in turn discourages cycling, which in every other way is a better option, cutting down on local pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing traffic congestion, and benefiting cyclists through vigourous exercise. Not everyone will be able to cycle to work or school, but we need to do everything we can to encourage cycling, and that includes making sure it's a safe method of transportation.\nDoug Ford has spent much too much of his time in office dictating to the municipality of Toronto from the Premier's office. Let Toronto's elected representatives do their jobs. Let cyclists ride safely. Leave the bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing in opposition to the proposed Bill 212, another omnibus piece of legislation that is ostensibly intended to alleviate vehicular traffic by expanding the road network according to the government. Experience has shown that the expanding roads does not solve traffic; rather, it induces more people to drive until traffic has returned to the previous levels. This applies to two parts of the bill I will focus on.\n1.\tHighway 413 / EA exemption\nI work as a consultant in the mining industry and understand firsthand how EA\u2019s are conducted and importance of doing them. By skipping this critical step, the project risks permanent damage to habitat and species. There are at least 15 at-risk species that would be impacted by this project. We have a responsibility as stewards to protect the environment and should be doing whatever it takes to mitigate our impact. Exempting an EA also prevents adequate consultation with stakeholders. In short, by doing this, the government is ensuring that a less than optimum outcome.\nTo consider taking on the risk to forego an EA should at a minimum have a very strong reason to do so. However the facts are that the Highway would be built at a cost of $8B and would ultimately save drivers an estimated 30 seconds according to an expert panel. There are viable alternatives that would cost less and serve more people, for example investing in public transit or subsidizing 407 tolls for commercial trucks. Has the government considered all alternatives?\n2.\tBike Lanes\nThe proposal to replace bike lanes with traffic lanes removes protections to keep bike users safe. This law will result in more people dying, full stop. I use the Bloor and University bike lanes on a daily basis for my commute. I ride with my children on these bike lanes. To force us to share the lane with vehicles puts all of us at risk of getting hurt or worse. Bike lanes should be on major roads. These places where we are biking to tend to be on major roads. There are no viable alternatives to replace these routes. I say it again for good measure; this bill, if enacted will kill people.\nSecondly, the entire premise of this law is to benefit car drivers at the expense of everyone else. It is especially inconsiderate in the downtown core where more residents bike and fewer drive. Turning my neighborhood into a highway for out-of-town commuters is a slap in the face. Furthermore, there is simply not enough space for every person to drive, especially as this city continues to grow, particularly around the transit corridors that this government has pushed for and where these bike lanes already exist.\nThirdly, for a government that prides itself on cutting red tape and fiscal prudence, this bill does the opposite. Local roads are municipal jurisdiction. The existing bike lanes followed years of consultation and improvements. For this government to insert itself and overturn a democratic and equitable procedure, tear out completed infrastructure and replace the road, and then presumably redo the whole process on side streets that the province deems acceptable, is the height of hypocrisy. Add to this the irony that the previous Conservative government downloaded these very roads to the city to manage and that the Minister of Transportation formerly was the Minister of Red Tape Reduction, is shameful and embarrassing.\nLastly, this legislation is not even compatible with other laws passed by this very government. Bill 185 has resulted in fewer parking spaces in new builds while bike parking has expanded, especially near major arterial roads. Similarly, the intensification of density surrounding transit corridors, another Provincial objective, is at odds with this bill.\n3.\tBad governance\nThe last point I wish to make is that this is another example in a long list of bad governance from this government. It is now the second time the government has exempted themselves from an EA (see Ontario Place). Any other major infrastructure project by a private company is expected to perform an EA. It\u2019s unfair and dooms us to causing irreparable harm by not doing bare minimum in understanding the impact to the environment.\nThe government has claimed that any new bike lane must be reviewed by the province with studies to prove no adverse impact to vehicle travel times. Yet before even finalizing the bill, the government comes out and says Bloor, Yonge, and University will be removed, studies be damned. The government justifies their bill by stating that 1% of residents bike (a fact from a 1991 report that included the entire GRA, rural and suburban areas) and that bike lanes are affecting emergency responders (a lie that has been thoroughly debunked by Toronto responders). The City prepares a report with a cost estimate to remove the bike lanes, and it is dismissed by the Premier and the Minister of Transportation without providing their own cost or rationale for why the City is wrong. All this suggests the government has no interest in facts or evidence. They are pushing an agenda that suits them and their benefactors. The residents that live in these neighborhoods are being willfully ignored and it\u2019s disgraceful.\nThe government has moved to limit debate because of a long summer recess. A long summer recess they gave themselves. Again, shameful that the government sees fit to limit democracy because they gave themselves a longer vacation. But par for the course for a government that sees opposition, alternative viewpoints, or constructive criticism as a hindrance rather than opportunities for improvement.\nIn closing, I am pleading that the government reconsider this poorly considered piece of legislation. It has been demonstrated over and over again that building more lanes and more roads will not reduce congestion. The government should be investing in alternatives to vehicular traffic like high-speed rail, dedicated bus ways, light rail, subways, etc. These can move more people for less capital cost while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it; this bill has been roundly criticized by numerous groups including the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, the Ontario Traffic Council, and BIAs located along the potentially affected bike lanes.\nFinally, this bill and particularly the fast-tracking of Highway 413 remain mired in the corruption scandal around the Greenbelt land swap last year, which this government remains under investigation for. The government has not been cleared of wrongdoing, and yet are aggressively pushing a bill that will primarily benefit the very same landowners that were credibly unduly influencing the governments decision making then. The same folks that contribute heavily to the governing party, attend the Premier\u2019s family weddings, and have secret rendezvous in Las Vegas. This bill should not be carried forward until the Greenbelt investigations have concluded.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nI love in Bloor West Village not more than five minutes from Bloor St. and strongly support all alternative modes of transportation, including bikes and bike lanes.\nI commute by bike to work and regularly use bike lanes in Toronto. They provide a safe, healthy, sustainable and economically viable alternative to congestion causing cars. Bike lanes have been proven over and over again not to cause congestion. This is not in doubt. They contribute to the vitality, healthy and economic success of cities around the world. Removing infrastructure installed by a municipal government should NOT be on Doug Ford's agenda.\nAs a driver I feel safer when bike lanes are available for cyclists. I strongly urge Toronto and the province to install MORE lanes. On both main roads and side streets when they are a suitable alternative.\nIn a growing province like Ontario, we need this infrastructure. There is no way Toronto or any other city can absorb more cars. There is not enough parking and certainly not enough space on streets for more metal boxes. We need to facilitate a transition to biking as a way of life. For many people, they will never even try cycling if they do not have the safety of bike lanes to begin this process.\nI feel this is a Conservative ploy to distract voters from other failed plans. It is clearly a wedge issue that will create more problems and unfortunately, contribute to a rising death toll on city streets.\nStop Bill 212 and leave the bikes lanes as they are. Add MORE bike lanes so we can truly begin to shift our city and province to a healthy, sustainable future.\n"

Why are people driving on these roads  in the first place which have the best public  transit in the city ? These are the last roads that should have bike lanes removed. The gridlock is not caused by bikelanes ( which are seen as part of the solution along with better transit ) but as all the studies and evidence shows , by construction and Toronto has seen an unprecedented boom in condo and other development . These developers are allowed to block public road ways for their construction projects including on Yonge , Bloor and Avenue Road . These blockages must be must better monitored , coordinated and limited to only where is it absolutely necessary and the developers should pay a fee equal to the losses in the economy caused by their  gridlock projects. This will incentivize them to move much more quickly to remove their blockage or not cause them to block in first place .\nLets get at the real cause of gridlock in the City of Toronto - removing and restricting bike lanes is really not the cause and is bad policy and probably all the policy makers at MTO know this in their hearts  and hopefully have communicated this to the  politicians they serve   - it might be good politics for the suburban voter but really bad and regressive policy - quite sad really\n"

Bike lanes have allowed me to introduce urban biking to my children, giving them more independence in the city and offering them a healthy active way to get around. Sometimes I drive through the city as well in these same proposed areas where the removal of bike lanes is being proposed. While I hear oftentimes complaints about the traffic and sometimes I hear the bike lanes blamed, I have not experienced any change due to the bike lanes. In fact traffic seems to move more fluidly and on an organized fashion. The congestion comes from bottlenecks due to construction, like at Avenue Rd and Balmoral; or Yonge and St Clair, not because of the bike lanes.  All of this without even considering the environmental costs of removal bike lanes. I would be so disappointed to see the bike lanes threatened as their benefits to so many people far outweigh the imagined costs relating to traffic.\n"

I remember listening to AM 640, where the head of the biker association stated that bikers don\u2019t stop at stop signs because they lose momentum. This perfectly encapsulates the insanity of bike lanes in Toronto.\nBike lanes are taking up driving space, condos are popping up everywhere, and there\u2019s less and less road available for driving. Just to be clear, no one takes their family out on a bike, no one goes to a supermarket to shop for a family on a bike, and no one does anything significant or economically impactful with a bike.\nOne lane to drive on Bloor Street and Yonge Street\u2014have you all lost your minds? Who is making these decisions? It\u2019s pure madness.\nThe weather is not suitable for biking, and the distances required for commuting aren\u2019t feasible for most bikers. If you care about bikers, put them on the sidewalk and give the roads back to drivers. Bikers don\u2019t follow any rules, and they openly boast about it. It\u2019s time for some common sense to prevail.\n"
