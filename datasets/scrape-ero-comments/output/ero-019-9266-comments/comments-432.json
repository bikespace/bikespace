I will never vote for a government that puts my life at risk by blocking infrastructure meant to protect me.\nThe argument that most road-users use cars, rather than bikes, is deeply flawed - this is in part because bike infrastructure is so poor. I love cycling and I know that I cycle less than I would if there was more and better infrastructure in my city.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist in downtown Toronto who uses bike lanes everyday this bill would be devastating. Every single day I see the bike lanes in use, people commuting to work, going grocery shopping, food delivery workers doing their job. By removing the three major bike paths you are endangering these people's safety and forcing them out of this method of transportation. This bill will not \"change\" how bikers get around, it will remove the option for them entirely. No biker will feel safe riding on these main roads without the protected bike lane. Biking is an essential method of transportation in the city and this should be taken into consideration. The bill shows clear favouritism for vehicle transportation and only personal vehicle transportation considering that there are barely any buses or public transit vehicles on those routes.\nThere needs to be serious consideration and review of the benefits of bikes lanes and what it provides for the residents of Toronto. Let the locals decide what they want. There is no need for the provincial government to be interfering with local government efforts in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Very unhappy with this proposal.\nAs a driver, I have come to like bike lanes.  They have their part of the road and I have mine.  This makes driving much easier and safer for drivers and cyclists\nRemoving bike lanes will not improve congestion.  Opening the Eglinton line and improving transit routes will reduce congestion.  Bike lanes are irrelevant to increasing congestion.   Congestion areas like London where drivers are charged in certain areas are proven to reduce congestion.  Toronto does not have the space to add more cars.  Cars pollute - who wants to breathe in that exhaust?\nCities like London, Paris, and even New York are introducing more bike lanes and are seeing results.  This will put Toronto behind.\nRoads belong to all vehicles not just cars.\nFurther, I resent that MY tax dollars will be wasted on removing bike lanes.  This is irresponsible, particularly for a conservative government that pretends it is fiscally responsible.  We have people living in parks across this province, people who cannot access health care, and deteriorating schools.  Why aren't my tax dollars being spent here to improve the quality of life for the people of Ontario?  Boggles the mind.\nFinally, we have three levels of government.  Let municipalities govern in their areas of responsibility. Stop overreaching and meddling in local matters.  Yes, you have constitutional authority over local governments.  You aren't supposed to use it to bully them and waste our tax dollars.  You have a moral responsibility to all of us to work with them to solve problems.  This is an example of \"good government\" written in our constitution.\n"

As a driver, cycist, walker and homeowner, this proposed bill impacts me, and more more importantly, Ontarians in negative manners.   First and foremost, transportation infrastructures are for all Ontarians, not just motorist. Share the road!\nDedicated bike lanes are basic standard of safety, like sidewalks for pedestrians. This is of upmost importance. Noone should be harmed, injuried or killed by someone else on our roads. As a driver, I feel safer for all when pedestrians and cyclist are in dedicated lanes/sidewalks, instead of being on the same lane.\nThis proposed bill 212 is shockingly shortsighted and selfish (from motorist perspective). It contradicts a share/friendly society that we as Canadians/Ontarians should be proud of.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes and restriction on future bike lane development is not only unnecessary but also puts Ontario and Toronto residents in danger and limits our ability to grow as a vibrant, connected, and environmentally responsible province and city.\nWe've been here before. In the 90s, they scrapped the Eglinton subway line\u2014filled in the tunnel and left our city\u2019s infrastructure incomplete. That mistake set Toronto back decades, and we\u2019re still playing catch-up today. Removing bike lanes now would be repeating the same short-sighted thinking, putting our community at risk while making Ontario and Toronto less attractive to live, work, and commute.\nBike lanes aren't just about serving people who already bike\u2014they\u2019re about building safer, accessible options for everyone, regardless of their current transportation habits. When you say that not enough people cycle to justify bike lanes, it\u2019s a self-fulfilling argument. People aren't cycling in higher numbers because the infrastructure isn\u2019t there to support it safely. Build a bike-friendly Ontario, and people will respond.\nInstead of focusing on removal or restriction, let\u2019s focus on improvement. There\u2019s a reason other cities have seen success by prioritizing cycling infrastructure\u2014it works when you commit to it.\nThis government tried to change the license plates just to leave its mark on the province, but the plan backfired when the new plates were so poorly designed that you had to revert to the original ones. How much did that mistake cost Ontarians? You will be making the same mistake again.\nOntarians and Torontonians deserve smart, forward-looking decisions for infrastructure, not reactive, political ones.\n"

        "comment": "I am an Ontario resident living in Toronto. I wish to comment on the proposed Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\u201d\nThe stated, abstract objective of this Bill is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. For these reasons, I oppose Bill 212 and believe it should not move forward.\nSincerely,\nA Toronto, Ontario resident.\n"

        "comment": "The portions of the bill about removing bike lanes are highly unnecessary and go against what the Ontario PC Party claims to stand for. The Ontario PC Party claims to want to remove red tape and bureaucracy, but this bill is adding much more red tape and bureaucracy by having to review each and every new and existing bike lane. The Ontario PC Party claims to want to increase the choices people have in their lives, but removing bike lanes is removing the choice to commute safely with a bike. The Ontario PC Party claims to want to save people money, but not letting people choose a cheaper alternative to driving like biking safely will cost people more money. The Ontario PC Party claims to want to reduce gridlock and get traffic moving, but removing bike lanes will incentivize people to drive and add more cars to the road. The Ontario PC Party claims to be for businesses, but business has increased where bike lanes have been installed not to mention the bike share business, and removing bike lanes will harm those businesses.\nThere was gridlock before bike lanes, and there will be gridlock if they are removed. There are alternatives that could help without touching bike lanes, like removing street parking and getting police to enforce the existing rules, such as not blocking intersections. When I drive, I don't want to worry about hitting someone on a bike or walking, bike lanes make driving safer too. This bill is also very focused on Toronto, the Ontario PC Party should be focused on the province as a whole, and let Toronto decide what's best for Toronto and other cities decide what's best for them. I don't expect the federal government to override what the province wants, so I don't expect the province to override what each city wants. The Ontario PC Party would do better by creating province-wide standards on what guidelines to follow if a city wants to implement bike lanes. Bike lanes should be considered essential infrastructure like vehicle lanes and sidewalks. More trains getting people downtown instead of driving downtown would also reduce traffic. The only way to reduce traffic is with viable alternatives to driving.\nI also think trying to speed up construction of highway 413 is unnecessary too. A better use of resources would be buying the 407 back and removing the tolls. This bill has a lot of attention on the bike lane removal, but the parts about the 413 highway should not go ignored.\n"

Removing them endangers not just cyclists but also pedestrians.\n3. **Traffic Congestion**: More bikes mean fewer cars. Removing lanes will likely increase congestion, particularly in a city already dealing with traffic issues.\n4. **Public Health**: Encouraging cycling supports an active lifestyle, lowering healthcare costs long-term.

Further, traffic congestion created by fewer automobile lanes restricts the speed of emergency vehicles, the effectiveness of which depends on wide roads and less unnecessary congestion. Main Street in Ottawa leads from downtown to Smyth Road where the Ottawa General Hospital and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario are.\nThank you.\n"
