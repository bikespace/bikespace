        "comment": "Dear all,\nThe proposed legislation presents a short-sighted approach to addressing traffic congestion in Ontario. While the focus on infrastructure development and broadband connectivity is commendable, the restriction on new bike lanes without provincial approval is counterproductive.\nFirstly, cycling is a legitimate mode of transportation, on par with walking, driving or public transit.\nSecondly, bike lanes can significantly improve traffic flow by increasing the overall capacity of transportation networks. A single bike lane can accommodate a much higher volume of users than a car lane, especially during peak hours. By encouraging more people to cycle, the government can alleviate congestion on major roads and reduce reliance on single-occupancy vehicles. Not to mention that any single car avoided from driving that day, especially in densely populated cities, is less CO2 inhaled by its inhabitants. Thirdly, I believe that bike lanes are inherently a municipal responsibility as they primarily impact local roads and the immediate population that's paying to live there. The provincial government should not overstep its jurisdiction in this matter.\nFinally, the key to reducing congestion is to diversify transportation options. Instead of forcing everyone onto highways or subways, the government should support a variety of modes of transportation, including cycling. By investing in bike lanes and other cycling infrastructure, Ontario can create a more sustainable, efficient, and livable province for all. As a former daily commuter by car, my quality of life improved enormously the day I got rid of it. I now commute via cycling and/or public transport, and this has resulted in less uncertainty in my time of arrival, better mental and physical health, more time spent at shops on the way as they are easier to stop at, and lower expenses on transportation. The problem of congestion is not brought on by cycling lanes, but by too limited transportation options, and their stricter oversight will only limit the ability of, and decrease the safety of, local inhabitants who just want to get where they want to, in the manner they choose.\nI urge the government to reconsider this proposal and instead focus on policies that promote active transportation, reduce reliance on cars, and improve the overall quality of life for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Strongly oppose the removal of bicycle lanes. This would certainly would be a step back into the wrong century. Let's not make decisions based off emotional frustration with traffic, but based on objective evidence. Bicycling reduces waste/fossil fuel output, is healthier, reduces traffic and is generally a faster mode of transportation in city centres. Cyclists need more protection, and more lanes; not less!\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is entirely contrary to the data. Study after study has shown that protected bicycle lanes not only save cyclists\u2019s lives, but help to reduce traffic congestion and increase safety for all road users. They also help to increase sales for businesses along routes where the bike lanes run.\nThe proposal is also anti-democratic. The Provincial Government should focus on solving the problems only it can solve, such as fixing health care. Leave municipalities alone to solve the local problems we have elected them to solve.\nIn one way only bike lanes are like car lanes. The more of them you build the more they will fill up. You won\u2019t solve traffic congestion by building more lanes or more highways, because they will fill up and become congested almost as soon as you build them. But when the bike lanes fill up, those riders won\u2019t be in cars polluting the atmosphere and clogging the roads.\n"

        "comment": "The title of this bill is a lie. Removing bicycle infrastructure will only increase congestion and kill more pedestrians and cyclists.\nShame on the officials bringing this bill forward. Increasing alternatives to single occupancy car use is the only way to improve congestion! If congestion was based on bike lanes, then the 401 would have no congestion! The reality is congestion is caused by the inefficient mode we try to keep using.\nAdd more bike lanes and add more high quality public transit : that's how we'll reduce congestion, but most importantly help save lives and give people the opportunity to flourish within their city.\n"

We can't afford two cars.\nWe could be as careful as possible, but all it would take is one distracted driver to ram into her from behind, which would have life altering consequences.\nWe need our bike lanes. If we don't have them, you are forcing us to make difficult choices and compromise the safety of my child.\nI also think that the writers of this act may fail to understand that, if i am forced to bike in a lane shared by cars with my daughter, I will be taking the entire lane to maximize her safety. This will not make things faster. On the contrary, it will slow cars down if I am forced to be in the same lane as them.\nI will never forget who passes this, and I mean it when I say that you will lose my vote forever if this goes through.\n"

We need a better infrastructure for the bike lanes to work. You can\u2019t just slap them on top of what we have already! We shouldn\u2019t have to link to other studies. It is the job of our government to do research and the research shows that more cars and more access to cars does not equal less traffic.\n"

According to the highway traffic act, as a cyclist, I am entitled to take up a whole  lane of traffic if I feel unsafe and require a metre of space between myself and cars, legally. Do you really think this will improve traffic?\nI also do not want to die getting to work, running errands, meeting up with friends, or simply going for a bicycle ride. Municipal roads are extremely unsafe as it is and you want to take the one thing we have to help me feel safer? Do you want me to die, Mr.Ford?\n"

If people can take a train, fewer cars will clog up roads. If people can safely bike, fewer cars will block roads. If there is better public transit, fewer cars will clog roads. This bill does not take any valid research on traffic or the environment into consideration. Tearing up already built bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money.\nPeople are not just drivers. People who use cars can also use public transit and bikes.

Main road bike lanes are usually the most efficient way to get people to their destinations - looking at the car's footprint it occupies for a single person (typically), it hard to see how making more room for cars will solve the congestion problem - consider congestion charges if not moving people efficiently across - so less single use drivers and more buses, more public transportation - feels like this is a distraction tactic and will remember this when voting provincially\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely not. Leave municipal issues up to municipalities. Toronto needs more bike lanes FAST to reduce congestion, not more car lanes. Induced demand works both ways. Install a car lane, more people will drive and congestion stays the same. Add bike ones, more people will cycle, relieving traffic and roads from cars. It\u2019s that simple, induced demand is such a basic and widespread concept  that so many politicians ignore because it doesn\u2019t fit their \u201cagenda\u201d\n"

I\u2019ve seen none to date.\nOn the contrary, the evidence I am aware of shows that bike lanes:\n- Save lives\n- Reduce congestion\n- Are good for business\n- Improve public and personal health\n- Are good for the environment\n"

        "comment": "If it weren't for bike lanes, my partner would probably be dead. They live in Toronto, and they have almost been hit many times, particularly on streets without bike lanes. Prioritizing vehicles over a more eco-friendly and efficient mode of transit will do little to actually increase traffic flow. Cycling is much faster in gridlock, so why should citizens choosing a faster, more environmentally conscious mode of transit be penalized? It encourages people to use vehicles rather than bicycles, therefore adding to traffic, which will only make things worse. Compromising bicycle safety when cyclists are already killed so often by motorists is ridiculous. Bicycle lanes save lives. The province should not be able to force municipalities to compromise the safety of their cyclists in favour of vehicles.\n"

We need to do everything we can to encourage alternate modes of transportation (bikes, public transit) to get more cars off the road - this will improve congestion.\nI also adamantly oppose Highway 413, which would be a disaster for further congestion, the climate, and our environment.\n"

        "comment": "This is a foolish proposal on two fronts:\n1) There's plenty of research on urban planning demonstrating that building more lanes does not reduce traffic and that public transit/bike lanes help ease congestion. One example, though not by far the only: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026. The Ford government is fully aware of this research yet not following it to propagate its own agenda, which seems to be making our car-focused society even more car focused.\n2) I am opposed to the insidious attack on municipal autonomy from this provincial government. Municipalities have the resources to hire or consult urban planners and their own constituents to find the most workable solutions for their area. This is an overstep of the provincial government.\nInvest properly in transit and non-car focused solutions that are affordable and accessible. I am opposed to Bill 212.\n"
