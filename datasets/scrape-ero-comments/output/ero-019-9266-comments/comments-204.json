        "comment": "By removing bike lanes, you are encouraging people who currently bike to drive, since it will no longer be safe to bike. This increases the amount of cars on the road, adding to congestion. Notably, a car takes up much more space than a bike, meaning these people will take up significantly more space on the road. Additionally, anyone who continues to bike is at greater risk of death or serious injury from being hit by a car. As a result of missing bike lanes, some bikers may be tempted to start biking on sidewalks for their own safety, in turn putting pedestrians at risk of injury.\nMoreover, many people choose not to drive in certain areas due to the existing congestion, myself included. Turning a bike lane into a car lane will encourage these people to start driving, filling up the new lane in no time. As a result, replacing a bike lane with a car lane will not reduce the congestion, it will simply lead to a larger number of cars on the road. The danger of congestion stems from the fact that drivers need to remain aware of a large number of vehicles in order to drive safely. It seems evident to me that having more cars on the road will lead to more collisions. Collisions are bad, not only due to the deaths and injuries they cause, but also because they are often the root cause of delays and further congestion on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make it safe for ALL motorists in Toronto. Drivers don\u2019t want to hit cyclists and cyclists don\u2019t want to be hit.\nPlease do your homework and look up global research on urban transportation before making decisions. Bike lanes reduce traffic congestion overtime. While increased car lanes in the short time reduce congestion but in the long term INCREASE traffic congestion. Also cycling is healthy, for both people and the environment so let\u2019s encourage it in our cities.\nI don\u2019t own a car, can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019d rather bike if I can because it\u2019s healthier for me. But lack of bike lanes or ones that just spontaneously end are not safe. My elderly parents drive and are always concerned about cyclists. They want me to continue to bike but don\u2019t want to hit anyone and WANT bike lanes so everyone is safe.\n"

Perhaps if cities had more transit options, or bike lanes, people would feel better using them.\nI\u2019m not sure why roadways are a priority, as it has been proven that they do not reduce gridlock. We should be encouraging other ways for people to get around.\nI\u2019ve been hit by drivers, had many fail to look, when bike lines lanes are not in use. Bike lanes play a pivotal role in me getting around safely, and I\u2019m not sure how reducing the lanes keeps people safe and moving.\nPerhaps, the province should focus on completing transit projects, promoting alternatives to getting around, and allowing city planners to continue what works best in their cities.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous. As someone who has lived in Toronto my entire life, the introduction of bike lanes has only made it easier and safer for me to get around my city. There is evidence that bike lanes reduce congestion. The solution to traffic is to make cities more bikeable, not less bikeable. Moreover, removing bike lanes will make the roads less safe for cyclists like myself who commute to work. There are already far too many deaths of cyclists on roads without safe bike lanes. Let\u2019s not make it worse. I could not disagree more with this government\u2019s proposal.\n"

Why spend money removing the safety of human beings?! On bike lanes that the city is already used to. Not to mention the benefit to businesses on said bike lines.

I feel it\u2019s important to have safe options for cyclists that include dedicated infrastructure for cycling for the use of pleasure and commuting. I feel it\u2019s important for this, especially as the population of our city continues to increase.   I think it\u2019s also important to look at other cities that have successfully adjusted their infrastructure to include bikes as a more viable option for getting around. Amsterdam and Copenhagen, being too, even New York to an extent, and those cities still function well as centres of commerce. There\u2019s no reason why Toronto can\u2019t do it as well. Not to mention, we need to curb our impact on the smog in the city since our air quality is already lower quality than it should be. Thank you.\n"

It's definitely an overreach of power for the province to be stepping in to these types of decisions. I'm a car driver and a road cyclist so I feel I have a balanced perspective on this. Cycling lanes make the city of Toronto, where I live, a more livable place. And in this time of climate change we need to encourage bike users, not discourage.\n"

Bike lanes are a municipal issue and should not require provincial approval.\nBike lanes help reduce traffic by reducing the number of people in cars. It also helps keep cyclists safer.

I do this to reduce environmental impact, to avoid contributing to Toronto\u2019s increasingly unsustainable traffic congestion issues and for the enjoyment I get from riding my bike.\nHowever, it is becoming more and more dangerous to be a cyclist in this city. It is distressing to see the \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d mentality unfolding, around drivers and cyclists and I often fear for my safety when I\u2019m on a main road with my bike.\nThere is so much evidence from cities around the globe, that shows cycling is good for business, for the culture and for the wellbeing and stability of a city. Toronto is in so many ways a world class city, but decisions like the one to remove this vital alternative to more cars on the road feels incredibly short-sighted.\n"

Making it an actual viable option for travelling to and from places, not just for work.\nWhile we are at it. Let's look at parking on main streets. That. Causes. Congestion.\nParking on side streets and off arterial roads would greatly increase movement of cars.\nIn Toronto, bikes lanes are used constantly and all year round. It takes cars off the road.\nBetter transit would take more cars off roads, not more lanes. More lanes means more cars.\nIf you want to add more lanes, they should be dedicated transit lanes so that it is more beneficial to actually take transit.\n"

Toronto has a car problem. 70% of commuters get to work via car every single day and that statistic is abysmal. If you want to solve gridlock, get people out of cars. Improve public transit. Build bike lanes that actually get you somewhere, not random bike lanes in random places that connect to nowhere. We need bike lanes everywhere, on more streets, so people use them. This bill is backwards, will take us back 25 years and create more traffic while it\u2019s being implemented. Utter lunacy.\n"

All research on this topic proves that, due to induced demand, adding lanes increases gridlock rather than reduces it. This bill is like saying you want to cool your house down, but instead of turning on the AC, you turn on the furnace.\nThe only way to reduce gridlock is to provide efficient, high-quality alternative means of transportation. The more alternatives there are to driving, the fewer drivers there will be on the roads. If the province truly wants to reduce gridlock, it should be investing in/supporting bike lanes, subways, LRTs, priority signaling, and a multitude of other items that will significantly improve alternative modes of transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road.\n"
