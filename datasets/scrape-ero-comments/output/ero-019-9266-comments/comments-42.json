        "comment": "Bike lanes reduce congestion. Single driver cars create congestion. Removing bike lanes is not only shortsighted, it poses a safety risk to cyclists.\nMore cars on the road = more congestion and more emissions. Adding bureaucratic red tape for cities where bikes are most needed is not progress. This will not only save no one any time, it will be taking cities backwards regarding environmental concerns. Attaching a link to the entire article, but this was a particularly salient section that should be seriously considered:\nBuild it and they will come\nOne would think that building more roads with more lanes for cars would reduce congestion, but r esearch shows that's not the case, thanks to something called induced demand. The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\n\"So for a short period of time, there might be a slightly improved [reduction], but within a year or two, or perhaps three, traffic is as bad or worse than it was before the lanes were added in the first place,\" said David Beitel, data services lead at Eco-Counter, a Montreal company that collects and analyzes pedestrian and bicycle traffic data.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, pedestrian, and cyclist I am deeply concerned about the proposal to restrict the development of bike lanes that would remove a car lane. I live in Toronto, at College street and Spadina, where the new bike lanes have had a profound positive impact on my safety.\nAs a driver, I can say with confidence that these bike lanes have reduced traffic: every cyclist who is encouraged to bike on our big beautiful bike lanes is one less driver on the road adding to gridlock. When faced with the decision to bike somewhere or drive, I am much more likely to choose to bike these days due to the high quality bike lanes available in my area: along College, University, and Bloor to name a few.\nAs a cyclist, I am also more likely to stop at a local shop during a ride, whereas when I'm driving I typically don't want to find a place to park and get out of my car.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will not save me time and will increase commuting time and decrease safety for so many. Bike lanes are a way of reducing traffic, as they allow for less cars on the road. Bikes take up much less space on the road then cars, and therefore more bikers that feel safe and will commute by bike will effectively reduce car traffic. Commuting/travelling by bike is better for the environment as it reduces the amount of gas cars on the road. We should be doing all we can to reduce cars on the road and improve other environmentally friendly methods of transportation, such as biking. Any added bureaucracy or red-tape needed to increase the number of bike lanes will impede that goal and reduce the quality of life of the people of Ontario and Toronto.\n"

Not only will it not reduce gridlock in the slightest (not an opinion, absolute fact), it will make cycling more dangerous in the city, and frustrate drivers more as cyclists are forced to do dangerous (but legal!) things like drive in the centre of the lane.  I may not agree with all of Ford's policies, but this is incredibly stupid.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation will kill people. People need to get places, be that by car, or bike, or transit or walking. But just one of these travel options is killing hundreds and injuring tens of thousands of people in Ontario every year.\nMotor vehicles make our streets dangerous to people walking and cycling. If people are to be able to use the public streets, as is their right, something needs to be done about this danger. Bike lanes provide that protection to allow people to bike places. That means fewer cars on the road and fewer deaths caused by drivers.\nYou can't simply push cyclists onto side streets and expect that they won't still need to use the main roads. The main roads are main roads for a reason. They are often the only way to travel longer distances, as side streets are meandering, or dead ends, or don't have bridges to cross rivers, highways, train tracks etc. They need to be used to go places. And speaking of places, many main roads are where the places (shops, restaurants, etc) that people want to go to are located. They're also where new zoning by-laws are pushing the most density. So you've got the highest concentration of people living without cars, and all the destinations they would like to go to on these streets, but they cannot safely use them unless they use a car?\nPeople will still bike on these main roads even without bike lanes (albeit far fewer people than if there were bike lanes), and many of them will be killed because they were not given a safe way to do so. And in addition to that, even more people will decide not to bike, because it is not safe, and they will instead drive. More cars on the road will not \"solve traffic\" - you need to get people out of their cars - you need to give them ways to do that. It's the only way to actually reduce traffic congestion, not more lanes, not more cars.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal would represent an enormous step backward in the way infrastructure is developed in Ontario if the bill is passed. There is no evidence locally or globally that bike lanes worsen congestion, rather, evidence suggests they are good for business, and lead to less cars on the road, which is the true solution to congestion.\nEven if bike lanes had some negative effect on congestion, would they not still be worth the safety they provide to commuters on their way to work, kids on their way to school, or people out enjoying Ontario's beautiful weather? This proposal plainly puts the convenience of drivers above the safety of vulnerable road uses, who are already vastly over represented in accident-related fatalities.\nThe claim made publicly by the Conservative government that bike lanes could be placed on side streets instead is not a viable alternative. It inconveniences cyclists far more than an arterial bike lane inconveniences drives, and makes cycling a less viable alternative, which worsens traffic as more people require cars to get where they need to go safely and quickly.\nConsidering the environment, bike lanes encourage fewer cars out polluting on the road, they encourage urban development that Ontario needs during this housing crisis, and they stimulate local economies.\nThis bill is also a massive overreach into city powers.\nI urge the government to reconsider this backwards bill, and to leave municipal infrastructure up to municipalities.\n"

If there isn't a bike lane available, I am forced to bike in the middle of a traffic lane to ensure I don't get doored or clipped by a car, which contributes to traffic.\nHaving said this, my main concern is still provincial overreach.\n"

        "comment": "This is a misguided proposition, the province does not need to get involved in the local affairs of bicycle transportation lanes. The province just cut red tape by reducing the involvement of the province in local housing approvals, they should reduce gridlock by enabling cities to continue building multimodal infrastructure without government meddling.\nI am a new resident of Toronto and I do not have a car. I have noticed that there are 5 to 6 bikes at an intersection with 5 to 6 cars as well, and that in itself is reducing the car traffic by half. In more car-centric societies like the U.S. everyone drives and traffic is at a standstill in cities like Atlanta and Los Angeles. Building 413 helps drivers and building bike lanes at the same time means we are expanding capacity in all directions for a bigger and brighter Ontario. A well-rounded and efficient transportation system means building for bikers, drivers, and transit riders. The lanes on Bloor handle thousands of bikes each day and that in itself reduces traffic, think of it that way! Don't fall into the trap of making transportation partisan, because everyone bikes around our beautiful province in every direction.\n"

While I understand the frustration that many drivers feel about traffic congestion, placing the blame on bike lanes overlooks some key points.\nIn the past decade, the GTA\u2019s population has grown significantly, leading to a rise in car ownership. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand\u2014many of my friends bought cars during the pandemic to avoid public transit. However, road capacity hasn\u2019t kept up with this growth. Without offering alternatives, we\u2019re only making congestion worse by forcing more people to rely on cars, rather than promoting safer and more sustainable transportation options.\nFor cities to thrive, we need to expand\u2014not reduce\u2014active transportation options. By investing in biking infrastructure and public transit, we can create long-term solutions that benefit everyone. We know that people are more likely to bike when they feel safe, and removing bike lanes will only push more people back into cars, worsening the problem we\u2019re aiming to solve.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation and focus on solutions that improve safety and reduce congestion for everyone.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"
