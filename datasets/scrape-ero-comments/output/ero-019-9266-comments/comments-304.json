        "comment": "I am deeply concern how the contents of this bill related to the removal of existing bike lanes. These bike lanes were put in place under the direction of City Staff and elected members of Council. Local roads have always been the responsibility of Municipalities and this feels like a gross overreach of provincial responsibilities. If the people of Toronto want to remove bike lanes they could elect council members who run on removing bike lanes.\nThe removal of bike lanes will reduce the number of people cycling and INCREASE the number of cars on the road. This will have the exact opposite effect as the bill intends.\nProperty taxes were used to build these bike lanes, and now it is being proposed that my income tax be used to remove them. If the government wants to reduce waste I would recommend not tearing up existing infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot believe this is being pushed forward. It\u2019s so obvious that removing these bike lanes will do nothing to relieve congestion. The Ford government knows this, the people of Toronto know this. Millions of dollars have been spent on the bike lanes and now we are talking about creating more construction, spending money to u do what we just spent all this money on, it\u2019s absolute insanity. I will be attending protests, and will do everything I can to be apart of the movement that blocks this from happening. We are people, we are not sheep.  Just because Doug ford says something, doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. Doug Ford wishes he was the mayor of Toronto, and it\u2019s pathetic.\n"

        "comment": "The congestion on University south of College cannot be ascribed to bicycle lanes having been constructed. For months, construction of water mains along University and TTC construction on Queen had closed all traffic lanes but one in each direction. I live in this neighbourhood and witness the traffic at all times of the day and night.\nNow that the bike lanes are operational and University has two traffic lanes plus a parking lane, it is left turns from southbound University at Gerrard and Elm plus the lack of a right turn lane at Elm that are causing most of the problem. With two parking garages and a surface lot behind Mt. Sinai Hospital, the amount of traffic turning right at Elm (particularly at rush hour and lunch hour) is substantial and the lack of a right turn lane means that pedestrian traffic crossing Elm prevents cars from turning right and blocking the right lane through most of the green light. If there is also a car turning left to access Sick Kids hospital or Toronto General, southbound traffic is brought to a complete halt. Two suggestions I have for the City are to ban left turns at Elm and to create a right turn lane at Elm southbound on University.\nAnother alternative would be eliminating the lane of traffic in each direction that is taken by parking rather than eliminating the bike lanes.\nFinally, I believe that the Province should not be micro-managing traffic flow in the city. The city should be able to address issues to the benefit of city residents without ham-handed actions by the Province. Bicycle lanes are beneficial to many residents.\n"

        "comment": "The University, Bloor, and Yonge bike lanes greatly reduce transportation time and encourage people to cycle to work. Not only does this reduce gridlock by taking people who would otherwise be in cars off of the street, it also leads to healthier lifestyles and, consequently, lower use of the healthcare system. This is to say nothing of the environmental benefits of fewer cars.\nThere are already an unacceptable number of injuries and deaths to cyclists due to careless drivers and lack of infrastructure. If this government removes some of the most used safe lanes in the city, they will be knowingly responsible for the resulting deaths and injuries and should expect that the public will hold them accountable.\nThe decision to destroy freshly built infrastructure when there does not appear to be any data backing up the supposed rationale is monumentally wasteful and indicates a complete lack of respect for taxpayer money.\n"

In this cost of living crisis, bike share programs have been a lifeline to accessibility and exercise. Bike lanes make me safer to use that option.\nBike lanes mean that I have one less worry while driving. As a driver, bike lanes make me safer as I don't need to worry about sharing the road with cyclists.\nRemember: you are not stuck in traffic, you *are* the traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Dear MPPs or Provincial policy people,\nTell your leader & Minister this is a bad idea. I will likely be killed from these decisions! You will make my commute either: extremely unsafe, entirely not possible, or take over twice as long! Why does my safety and commute time not matter to you? People are more important than \"potentially\" saving mere seconds off car drivers commutes (I say potentially because your assumption on this isn't backed up by facts).\nI cycle almost daily from east end Toronto using Danforth/Bloor bike lanes to get to work downtown. There are very limited alternative routes and those still go down main roads including Rosedale Valley to Bayview, or Bloor/Danforth to Pottery Road. Those alternatives take over twice as long to do and don't work when the Don floods. There are no \"side streets\" to get me to work/home or the other essential places I use Bloor bike lanes, Yonge bike lanes, or University bike lanes when running errands. If bike lanes are only approved for side streets no one will use them because they won't lead anywhere useful for cyclists to go and would be a huge waste of money to build.\nI used to live in the Annex area and also Yonge/Davenport. The bike lanes in those areas are massive improvements to what those areas were like a decade or so ago! They are so much safer for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. The city consulted citizens, did studies, did pilot projects, and so much more, before building bike lanes you now see on Bloor, Yonge & University. I was consulted. They are needed. They address issues those areas faced for decades and people fought to get those bike lanes added. How is the province any better equipped than the city to make decisions for local municipalities? Why are you vetoing municipal decisions instead of helping them build what's right for their community?\nWhy are you writing legislation to undo decades worth of work to improve cities, like Toronto. Citizens want bike lanes, plus actual data and studies show bike lanes are safer and improve traffic!\n"

As someone who drives, the bike lanes are effectively used and help my drives within the city be more efficient.\nIt has been proven time and time again that removing safe, alternate transportation methods will just make gridlock worse again. Does the province consult with urban planners about this? I would like to see what source of information they are using to indicate that this will save time.\nIf they province really wanted to save time, they would consider adding more protected bike lanes. Hopefully the next government will have this figured out, as this one does not understand what is a priority or what Ontarians want.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this is a most foolish move. I am not a cyclist, but feel that lives have been saved by the installation of bike lanes, and that their removal will have a singularly bad effect. Not only will this endanger cycling citizens, but drivers as well. Instead of removing bike lanes, you should be encouraging people to take public transport . The easier it is made to drive by removing bike lanes, building new highways etc, the more traffic there will be.  Instead encourage public transport, impose a cost to driving into the centre of large cities.\nI am disappointed in this government.\n"

        "comment": "This bill fundamentally misunderstands city planning and all it will serve to do is waste taxpayer money and slow down traffic.\nI am a cyclist and I commute daily on the Bloor and the University sections that have been specifically mentioned. Before the separated lanes these streets were far too dangerous and now they are a joy to cycle on.\nAll that removing agency from the cities does is add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy that will slow down and waste taxpayer money. Not to mention that bike lanes don't even slow down traffic as has been mentioned by countless city planners. The Ontario Professional Planners even just came out and confirmed that this bill will not reduce gridlock.\nAs someone who is on Toronto streets a lot and observes traffic there are two major things that slow down traffic. The first being improperly enforced construction sites. Far too often they are allowed to close off roads and sidewalks with no oversight. This needs to change. And the other massive problem is drivers. Specifically them making illegal turns that slow everyone down. This goes unenforced which makes more drivers do it. A driver who thinks they're entitled to make an illegal left turn slows down far more people than bike lanes ever have.\nA problem with this bill is that it centers drivers desire to move as fast as possible along roads. There is no reason that drivers should expect to be going 50km/h in the downtown core. As a cyclist I average around 20km/h and I'm able to get wherever I need on time.  There needs to be a fundamental rethinking of how people flow through this city and the reality is that needs to make cars slow down.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed legislation. I drive and cycle, and I am most comfortable driving when cyclists are in their own separated lane, and am safest when biking in a bike lane. Bikes need direct routes through cities as much as cars. I am very concerned that this proposal will needlessly waste taxpayer money removing municipal infrastructure we have already paid for, while doing nothing to improve traffic and putting lives at risk. This is is such a silly overreach, it makes me angry. I wish we had a premier and provincial government with a basic understanding of modern transportation planning.\n"
