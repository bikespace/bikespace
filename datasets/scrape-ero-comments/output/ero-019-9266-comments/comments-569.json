        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal and a waste of public funds. Adding lanes does not reduce traffic, it just induces more people to drive, maintaining the same or worse traffic problems with lower quality of life for people living in the city due to the wasteful removal of vital cycling infrastructure. To actually reduce traffic congestion, the provincial government should instead increase its investment in public transportation and encourage more use of active transportation like cycling, not less.\n"

        "comment": "Protected bike lanes are essential to the safety and convenience of Torontonians. I own a car and a bike, and I almost always choose to bike if I'm going anywhere south of St Clair because it is the fastest and most efficient way to get around this city. Removing bike lanes on main streets will not solve the issue with traffic. The only thing that causes traffic is more cars on the road and accidents due to unsafe driving. Please focus on making Toronto MORE bike-friendly, not less. The Bloor bike lanes in particular are amazing and crucial to my commute. Let the city worry about it's roads and let the province worry about provincial things, like traffic on major highways (hmm but there are no bike lanes on the 401...?) and our failing medical system.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto worker, I oppose this decision. 1. This decision should be made by the municipality. 2. Bike lane removal itself will cause significant congestion and cost. 3. While a small percentage commute by bike, many others bike for recreation and for work itself. E.g., Food delivery workers, who need safe spaces in what is their workplace. 4. Some of the proposed removals are less than a year old, so any data on their effects on traffic, safety, congestion, etc are not yet complete and accurate, given seasonal variations.\n"

It encourages drivers to be more mindful when turning and it some area it is a physical barrier. I am a commute on bike lanes for work and for recreational reasons because it makes me feel more safe in the city. Allowing more cars on the streets also allows more bigger vehicles and they do pose a bigger potential risk and danger for anyone else on the streets.\n"

Although I supported Ford in the past this may be the last straw. It's another waste of taxpayers money (see $250 million to cancel deal with LCBO) and has 0 proven efficacy and looks like based pandering to a population of people who do not live in Toronto.   Please reconsider this idea. Without bike lanes cyclists will mix with drivers and slow traffic even more.\n"

        "comment": "I live downtown and commute by all forms of transit: walking, biking, transit and driving. My work moved it's office recently and I along with probably a third of my coworkers now commute to work daily using the Bloor bike lanes. I could drive to work, but it takes almost twice as long as any other form of transit, and this is NOT because of bike lanes. The reality is that the downtown core is just not meant for driving, there is not enough room and too many people (and way too many cars, mostly parked and occupying lanes ironically). Bike lanes are not the problem, applying transportation ideas from rural or suburban areas to the downtown core is just plain stupid. Additionally, the removal of bike lanes forces cyclists into the lanes of traffic, which is uncomfortable and dangerous for everyone. No driver enjoys sharing a lane with a cyclist because of the different speeds of travel.\nBiking needs to be encouraged more, as it is such an effective means of transit for everyone who is even of simply average physical mobility. With more people on bikes, there will be less cars on the road, which also means that for those who are forced to drive, or for transit, there will be less overall gridlock.\nThis Bill goes against all evidence and will simply lead to more wasted taxpayer money, more gridlock and more cyclist and pedestrian deaths. If the Bloor bike lanes are removed it is quite likely I'll end up driving to work more, which means another car on the road.\nI voted for this government, but this Bill is nothing short of moronic and goes against even common sense.\n"

        "comment": "This act is a gross overstep of provincial government into municipal affairs and decision making. It's wasting time and money from both levels of government.\nThe Ontario government must address issues affecting the province as a whole. Cities decide their rules based on local information. Research supports bike lines to keep cyclists safe (including our CHILDREN), and safe cycling conditions mean fewer people in cars, so less traffic and improved health outcomes for Torontonians.\nThere is so much evidence to support this, in addition to my own experiences. Leave bike lanes alone. Stop wasting tax payer money to remove things because our Premier personally does not like them. We're a democratic society, not Doug Ford's personal fiefdom.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing to request a reconsideration of Bill 212, specifically regarding provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure like bike lanes. There are five key benefits that bike lanes bring: (1) improved safety for all road users (including reductions in dooring, sideswipe, and rear-end collisions), (2) better economic outcomes for local businesses and governments, (3) lower greenhouse gas emissions, (4) a narrowing of access gaps for equity-seeking populations, and (5) enhanced physical and mental health. I\u2019ll focus on the health, equity, and safety impacts of protected bike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is crucial for reducing chronic health conditions and improving mental wellbeing. Active transportation, such as walking or cycling, is an effective way to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines, boosting health, fitness, and overall wellness. Bike lanes not only encourage more cycling but also increase the total distance traveled by cyclists. Research shows that replacing car trips with cycling can extend life expectancy by up to nine years. Additionally, physical inactivity costs the healthcare system an estimated $6.8 billion annually due to its link with chronic diseases.\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately affects equity-deserving populations, including racialized people, those living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and Indigenous peoples. Lower-income neighborhoods often lack safe and healthy design. When active transportation infrastructure like sidewalks, bike lanes, and transit options are integrated into these areas, social and health inequities decrease. This gives people access to affordable, safe travel options to reach work, groceries, recreational facilities, and healthcare. This isn\u2019t just a local finding\u2014global research shows that high-quality, multi-modal infrastructure increases active transportation, yielding social and health benefits. More affordable travel options also mean people can spend more on essentials like food and rent or extras like supporting local businesses.\nFinally, the installation of bike lanes significantly improves safety for all road users. The Canadian Paediatric Society has noted that well-connected cycling infrastructure creates a \u2018halo effect,\u2019 reducing collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists within a 500-meter radius. Protected bike lanes, in particular, are the safest option compared to painted lines or other alternatives.\nInvesting in high-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more walking and cycling, benefiting both physical and mental health while reducing chronic disease rates. These benefits must be distributed equitably, so all community members can take advantage of active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against this proposal. To require provincial approval for new bike lanes that reduce a lane of car traffic would add a layer of bureaucracy to the process and make it less efficient. Also, any addition to the number of lanes that are open to car traffic will not reduce gridlock. This is because of the concept of induced demand. The more lanes that are built reduces traffic in the short term, but it also encourages people to drive more. This leads people to drive more, such that, in the long term traffic increases and gridlock returns. If the idea that more lanes of traffic reduces gridlock was true, then Los Angeles would have the best traffic in the world. We need people to switch driving cars to using other forms of transportation if we want to reduce gridlock. We cannot make that switch unless municipalities are empowered to make the best transportation choices for themselves without provincial oversight.\n"

And highly unlikely to be worth the \"investment\". Leave Toronto city planning to Toronto City Hall! We don't need to make life tougher and more expensive for people who live in the city  just so that those who don't can drive into and out of it more easily (which is not even necessarily the end result of this backward-thinking plan). There are far better ways to spend $48 million of taxpayer money in Ontario. Cancelling the Therme deal would be one that comes to mind. At least that would benefit Torontonians!\n"
