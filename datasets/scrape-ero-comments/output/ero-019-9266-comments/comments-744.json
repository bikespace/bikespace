        "comment": "Encouraging cycling instead of driving makes our cities livable, walkable, attractive to tourists, and more sustainable for the long run. Closing bike lanes can only result in one of two things: 1) People who cycled now feel unsafe and drive instead, causing more traffic on the roads, or 2) Cyclists move into the lanes of traffic and function as a slow car, causing massive slowdowns on the roads as drivers have to wait behind them. Without safe modes of transit downtown, I'd seriously limit where I go and what businesses I frequent. Long-term, I'd consider moving to a more logical province that isn't putting our cities back a hundred years.\n"

Cyclist safety is incredibly important, and moreover, bike lanes have been shown to reduce both traffic and emissions.

I am sure that the mental heath and physical activity benefits of biking all these years have helped keep my health care expenditures down.\nI have observed the steady growth in bike commuting over the years as concerns about the environment have grown, the ability to afford a car has decreased, and the advent of bike lanes had improved safety- in spite of the growing population. Every day, I witness every day how biking is a great equalizer that contributes to a stronger and more human community. We communicate by voice when \"passing on the left\", we look into each others faces at stop lights and take moments to chat. It provides an opportunity for rich and poor, educated and non-educated, to mix in a way that may not otherwise happen if not biking or walking. Through that we are helped to recognize the humanity in one another and enjoy the shared community. This happens far more readily on bikes than in cars, because of the nature of the vehicle.\nMy experience does not square with what the Ford government is presenting as the rationale for and against bike lanes. It is also contrary to the direction that great cities all over the world are taking.\nThanks to the city for its great job in building bike lanes. Leave them alone. Keep investing in improved transit.\n"

It\u2019s going to hurt the environment as it will increase the number of cars in downtown Toronto, resulting in more CO2 emissions, and air pollution for everyone who lives and works in downtown Toronto.\nIt will put the lives of cyclists and pedestrians at risk. Cyclists will no longer be protected in bike lanes, and there will be more cars, causing more accidents with cyclists and pedestrians. It will simply reduce safety for everyone.\nIt will result in an estimated $500 million of spending to undo work that has already been done. The way of the future is bike lines so a future government, will have to reinstall the bike lines resulting in more wasted taxpayer dollars. We need to spend this money on higher priorities.\nI am a cyclist and someone who drives downtown. I don\u2019t want the lanes removed, we need to look at other solutions like better transit. In fact, the Toronto Star has speculated that removing the lanes will result in more cars downtown and the traffic won\u2019t improve at all.\nI am deeply concerned and hope you will listen to the citizens of Toronto and realize that this is a shortsighted idea (that has no evidence that it will help traffic) and that hurts people and the planet.\n"

This has improved my productivity and mental wellness, because it is way faster than driving (which I would normally do). The city is blessed with good topography for biking and with climate change extending the riding season, biking has become for me the most viable and convenient way to get around the city.\nAs an aside, if we are serious about climate change, how can we do away with infrastructure that encourages emission reduction. My personal gasoline consumption has halved since I started biking to work.\nEvidently, bike lanes change commuting behaviours, which is all the more important as businesses are recalling more workers back to the office. Removing them would be a near-sighted mistake.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a critical ingredient in building more sustainable, efficient, and enjoyable communities. In addition to moving people more effectively than single occupancy vehicles, they also generate more jobs per dollar during construction and boost property values of adjacent properties. Cyclists also spend more at local businesses than motorists.\nMunicipalities have a deep understanding of their own transportation systems, and are best situated to identify when and where bike lanes should go. The province should not be intervening in such a hyper local issue, particularly in cases where projects are already underway. The move to rip bike lanes out of Toronto streets is a costly and wasteful overreach that will make congestion worse and cut the legs out from beneath the city\u2019s efforts to create a more enjoyable and productive city. For other municipalities, this Bill will prevent critical and proactive action to improve transportation.\n"

When I drive, it is enormously helpful when the bikes have their own lane. When I bike, I feel much safer when I have my own lane. I shop, go to appointments, commuted to work for over 30 years, on a bike. I shouldn't have to take my life in my hands to bike downtown.  The more bike lanes there are, and that connect, the more bikes there will be. Using a form of transit that is healthy, non-polluting, cost-effective, and reliable should be encouraged, especially in a city sadly lacking in good public transit. And we all know that lack of transit, increasing population, and the ubiquitous never-ending construction are the real cause of Toronto's traffic problems.\n"

        "comment": "I object to this proposal, and find the government's promotion of it disingenuous and reprehensible. According to the proposal, provincial approval for new and existing bike lanes \"will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation,\" and will \"consider environmental implications and be developed in consultation with targeted stakeholders including large municipalities.\" Yet the premier has already repeatedly stated, prior to the development or consideration of any such criteria, that the principal existing bike lanes being targeted\u2014namely sections of Yonge, University, and Bloor\u2014will be removed, which, far from a measured and informed policy approach, suggests that the main criterion on which the existence of bike lanes in this province will be decided is whether the premier himself likes them or not. It is unfortunate, from my perspective, that he does not, but more to the point it is galling that this is how the question of bike lanes in the city of Toronto is being decided. As an indication of the province's commitment to \"consider environmental implications,\" we might further note that the proposal is to include an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act, while the commitment to \"consult with targeted stakeholders\" seems rather belied by the province's almost gleeful pursuit of this proposal over and against opposition from the government of the city of Toronto, which has been elected by the people of Toronto.\nThe government's repeated appeal to \"common sense\" with respect to the bike lanes is disrespectful and dismissive of those whose \"common sense\" might differ, and is reflective of a narrowness of imagination and outlook that cannot see that its own view of the world is not the only one, or of an obstinacy that simply doesn't care. Rather than harping on \"common sense,\" it would be better if the government would recognize and acknowledge that the values and priorities at the root of this proposal are indeed that\u2014values and priorities. The idea that the need for car and truck drivers \"to get where they need to go\" faster in central Toronto should be prioritized over other considerations, including but not only the safety and well-being of other road users and their own need to get where they need to go, is not self-evident. I for one disagree. The premier likes to speak of Toronto as a \"world class\" city. Perhaps it would be helpful for him to point to the world model he is following in this case, so that the people of Toronto can have a better understanding of his vision for the city and the \"world class\" example being emulated, toward a more open and honest debate about what we want this city and province to be. I for one again struggle to think of another major world city that is currently removing bike lanes in favour of promoting increased car use in its core. Learning of such an example might be helpful for understanding how the premier's version of \"common sense\" is to be reconciled with any plausible notion of \"world class.\"\nBy the same token, rather than harping on \"common sense\" it would be better to have a serious consideration of the effectiveness of the proposed measures in realizing their stated objectives. Do bike lanes really contribute significantly to delays for drivers? Perhaps the government could supply some arguments on this score. God knows studies have been done. In my own experience as a frequent driver and cyclist in Toronto, it seems that it is bad driving that is most often a problem for other drivers\u2014drivers blocking intersections on red lights, stopping or standing in curb lanes when it is prohibited, being inattentive and slow to respond to signal lights and traffic movements, etc. Perhaps raising the standards of driving tests would be a more effective measure? Or increasing the enforcement of fines? Or do we ask so little of drivers, both individually and collectively, to have any responsibility and accountability for their own fluid circulation through the city? It might be the current government's \"common sense\" to blame bike lanes, but it is not at all clear, and the government has done nothing to make it clear, that that is in fact the case.\nOf course, such questions and counterpoints, among others, would be obvious to anyone who was attempting to understand a problem in good faith and solve it on the basis of sound reasoning and evidence. I don't think that's what the government is doing here, and I have no thought that stating these points here in this comment will make any difference at all. But, as the proposal has invited comments, I would like this comment to be recorded.\n"

Removing them will push more people into cars, worsening traffic and air pollution. Even if there were evidence that bike lanes worsen traffic, prioritizing \"the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\" over public health and safety is indefensible. From 2015 to 2024, 28 cyclists have been killed in Toronto, and 380 seriously injured\u201468% of these collisions happened on streets without bike infrastructure.\nBill 212 also comes with a staggering price tag. According to a City of Toronto report, removing bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge alone is estimated to cost taxpayers $48 million\u2014money that would be better spent on real solutions, like public transit and active transportation.\nThe opposition is loud and clear. Mayor Olivia Chow, Toronto City Council, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, and the Ontario Professional Planners Institute are all against this bill. Ignoring these voices, along with health and safety experts, is a blatant rejection of evidence-based policymaking.\nBill 212 drags Ontario\u2019s cities backward. The province must withdraw this misguided legislation and collaborate with municipalities to tackle congestion, road safety, and climate challenges. Ontario deserves better.\n"

Bike lanes provide safe routes for cyclists, encourage active transportation, and alleviate pressure on public transit systems. Removing them will likely increase vehicular traffic, worsening congestion, pollution, and safety risks.\nWhile the bike lane restrictions are concerning, the other provisions in this bill are even more alarming. Expropriating land from families\u2014disproportionately impacting marginalized communities\u2014to build highways is both unethical and shortsighted. Moreover, bypassing environmental impact assessments erodes critical protections for Ontario\u2019s ecosystems and public health.\nHighway expansions, including Highway 413, have repeatedly failed to address traffic congestion and instead contribute to urban sprawl, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and the destruction of natural habitats. This focus on highway construction reflects a short-term prioritization of economic interests over the long-term wellbeing of Ontarians.\nI strongly urge the government to abandon this harmful legislation and instead invest in sustainable, evidence-based transportation solutions that serve all Ontarians equitably.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this vital issue.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\n### Conclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"
