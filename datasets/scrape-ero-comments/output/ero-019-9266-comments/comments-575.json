        "comment": "I see this proposal as a step backwards. Cars, many, if not most of which are single occupant, should not be controlling our policies on gridlock nor transportation. Enabling, even better, encouraging bicycling has so many benefits beyond environmentally friendly transportation. The health benefits of a fitter population, noise reduction, pollution reduction, fossil fuel reduction, to name the obvious all point towards making policies which reduce vehicles, not hinder bicycling. Priorities need to be public transportation and bicycles and using space left over for cars. Use tax money to give people viable options to cars will do more for the long term traffic congestion and provide many benefits. Perpetuating the problem by catering to cars only exacerbates existing concerns and perpetuates a bad option. Every effort should be made to reduce vehicle traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this bill that does nothing to improve traffic flow and will instead put lives in danger. Adding more lanes is not the answer as the government of Ontario is fully aware. 80 years of research has proven this time and time again. We need to move people out of cars and into public transit, shared transit and cycling. Every day in Toronto I see families with kids, commuters in suits, delivery services utilizing safe infrastructure. The bike lanes are very busy throughout the commuting times. I want to get to work and then home again alive, and putting more people in cars solves nothing.\n"

        "comment": "Do not remove bike lanes in Toronto.\nWe can't afford to spend the money!!!\nI recently moved back to TO from Stouffville. I bike and drive and can report that the bike lanes are not a problem. It's just as good/bad to drive on streets with the bike lanes. It's definitely better to bike on streets with bike lanes.\nAlso, why is the province monkeying around in Toronto? Go fix the problems on 401. Get the construction done please.  Then widen the 401 where it narrows and causes an 8 minute delay all day long over a stretch of about 2km.\nIf you want to give Toronto money to speed up traffic, it would be better to spend any extra money finishing up construction projects as they're our biggest problem.\n"

        "comment": "I write this comment with hesitation. Not because I lack confidence in my thoughts but because I lack confidence in the Ontario government to care.\nThe proposal for this bill flies in the face of all the available research and evidence we have. Despite the fact that this will only further incentive driving leading to additional congestion - studies on induced demand are plentiful - the government has decided to fan the flames of a culture war as opposed to actually trying to fix the problems we face. It's an obvious cheap play for votes, not a serious solution.\nIn addition, this is such an overstep. It's apparent that each municipality has a far better understanding of what their citizens want and the best ways to manage their own traffic.\nI'm not foolish enough to think you are unaware of all the studies showing how bike lanes reduce traffic, or how cars are by far the least efficient way to move people through a city. There has been an enormous effort on behalf of the current government to ignore all facts and plow ahead with a nonsensical plan - that I'm not convinced these comments will be either read or acted upon. Yet here I am - trying to convince the Ontario government to allow me to continue to bike through my city without the fear of being run over by the driver of a car. What dystopian hell are we creating here?\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver in Toronto and I support bike lanes, they make the roads safer for all of us and support the reduction of congestion. The removal of bike lanes will have dire consequences for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians and I do not support this. Before we had these bike lanes, there were more accidents and confusion amongst all users of the road. Aside from the evidence that bike lanes are good, this effort is entirely political and baseless. I urge this government to use evidence to make decisions. If you want to reduce grid lock, invest in public transportation and open up the eglington lrt now.\n"

        "comment": "Removing or reducing the construction of bike lanes will not help traffic, this is basic urban planning. It endangers cyclists, is anti-environmental, and means that the cyclists have nowhere to be other than the road, which is what actually holds up traffic. If you want less jams, give the bikes their own space to be in that doesn\u2019t get in the way. Terrible policy making. I\u2019m so disappointed that our province would try to strangle urban planning like this. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal should be scrapped entirely. Cities around the world are adding bike lanes because they support safe, fast, and emission free transport. The government has provided no coherent evidence to support removal of the existing lanes. Cycling is the best way to move around the city of Toronto and we should be building more lanes, not removing existing ones. It is a disgraceful use of public funds to spend money to rip out the existing infrastructure and make cycling less safe. The Premier's office got this very wrong, and they should leave municipal issues like this to the municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes will negatively affect local businesses with less business given a reduction of \"slow\" foot/cyclist traffic and the removal exterior sitting area. Increasing the number of traffic lanes does NOT solve the lack of parking in the downtown core surrounding the bike lanes to be removed.\nRemoving established bike lanes is a step in the wrong direction. First of all one of the main problems along these routes is not the actual driving TIME but instead it is about DESTINATION PARKING. Regardless of increasing the lanes for cars by removing bikelanes will not solve the issue of parking along these routes, and local businesses will actually see a drop in their business as bikes actually increase local traffic and business customers, since parking bicycles does not require street surface area. Moreover, there are many cyclists that will continue to use these streets, and cars will not be able to go any faster, since passing bicycles will require cars to merge and give the required minimum 1m clearance to bicycles. This will lead to an increase in road rage as motorists will feel entitled to the road more than cyclists, which is incorrect. This in turn may lead to an increase of cyclists using the sidewalk to travel along these streets where bikelanes are to be removed, even though it is prohibited in Toronto for cyclists over 12 years old. More importantly, the bikelanes have allowed many local business on these streets to setup exterior sitting areas on the streets, removing street parking while not affecting bikelanes. The objective of creating an additional travel lane on these main streets will require the removal of all on-street exterior sitting area for restaurants on these streets in order to accomodate the additional car lane.\n"

        "comment": "I have a number of issues with the proposed legislation that would require provincial approval for new bike lanes and, worse, would even potentially remove existing bike lanes:\n1) Common sense approach\nThe PC party mentions often that it is a party that uses a \"common sense\" approach to managing our transportation network, however common sense should never replace experts such as engineers, planners, and scientists, especially for something as complex as transportation and road planning. I would never attempt to build a house based on my personal common sense opinion about building -- I would consult a qualified builder as a minimum, and possibly an architect as well.\n2) Removing car lanes could exacerbate the situation\nThe suggestion that removing car lanes or adding bike lanes would make traffic congestion worse seems intuitively correct, however actual scientific studies have shown just the opposite -- making it easier to drive actually increases traffic and makes congestion worse, in the long term. This is an example where relying on common sense would lead you to the wrong conclusion.\nHere are some posts and studies which explore this idea further:\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/mbonsma.bsky.social/post/3l6n25us3f52m\nhttps://nacto.org/docs/usdg/disappearing_traffic_cairns.pdf\nhttps://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Impact_of_Highway_Ca\u2026\n(Links provided by University of Toronto Data Sciences Institute)\n3) Problems, particularly for small businesses that depend on vehicle access for customers\nLastly, the suggestion that reducing car lanes is damaging to local businesses has also been shown to be incorrect. In fact, increased foot and alternative traffic can actually improve the situation for local businesses, not make things worse. Many businesses in the Bloor Street West business area have signed a petition requesting that the existing bike lanes already there remain, since they have been shown to be beneficial to their businesses.\nThe Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering and the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto have published a joint study in which they studied the impact of bicycle infrastructure and how to prioritize new infrastructure that is equitable and optimal. The paper associated with this study can be viewed here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2024.104010\nI hope that your party will reconsider this proposed legislation and instead allow Ontario's transportation experts to do their jobs unimpeded by this wrong-headed and unnecessary encumbrance.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I use bike lanes every day and consider them essential transportation infrastructure. For people living in cities bicycles are less expensive and easier to maintain than a car. Taking away bike lanes limits options for people who can't drive for various health or economic reasons. Should this bill pass, it will limit people like me in their regular activities.\nTaking away bike lanes will force cyclists into the road with cars. Not only is mixing car and bike traffic dangerous for cyclists it slows down car traffic since bikes are typically slower. Forcing all modes into the same space will slow everyone down and benefit no one. An increase in safe, separated bike lanes will increase the amount of bike traffic without increasing congestion since bikes are smaller and will encourage some motorists to cycle instead of driving.\nTo increase car traffic at a time when we need to reduce emissions is environmentally irresponsible. Encouraging car use is economically irresponsible as well. Bicycles produce no emissions and are significantly more affordable.\nThe province shouldn't be making it more difficult for local governments to help their citizens get around. The added steps in the proposal may well cancel bicycle infrastructure plans in cities across the province.\nMore roads are not a solution to congestion. Fewer cars are.\n"

Speed up and pay for MORE public transportation all across the GTA so that it is easier to commute into the city. This will reduce the need for cars to come down into the city.\nIf you want to reduce it even further - TAX cars driving into the core, just like in London and New York.\nThis is a bad plan and lousy legislation. Stop adding lanes, start adding public infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This entire bill is a shameful overreach by the provincial government that benefits no one in Ontario who isn't a wealthy developer or personal associate of the Premier. There is absolutely no evidence provided by the provincial government to suggest that bike lanes have contributed to the rise in gridlock traffic in any city in Ontario. In fact, the opposite has been proven time and again all around the world in multiple studies and case studies of other cities. Additionally, to sidestep important legislative safeguards to facilitate the building of a highway that has also not been proven in any way to be a remedy for traffic in and around Toronto is an insult to all Ontarians. If you want less traffic on the 401, invest in alternative transit for people and transportation infrastructure like rail for freight. Stop basing policy on what will benefit only the citizens of Ontario who are the wealthiest and most well connected to the Premier.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback concerning Bill 212.\nThere is no doubt that gridlock is a significant challenge for Ontarian's that must be addressed. Accordingly, this bill seems well intentioned. However, the bill is  misguided in it\u2019s approach as not only does it  fail to solve the problem of gridlock but it also;\n Risks to harm a viable alternative that actually reduces grid lock, i.e.  bike lanes.\nIncreases risk of traffic injuries and fatalities by displacing cyclists from dedicated lanes and into regular vehicular traffic, thus hobbling the implementation of of the Vision Zero program.\nIs an overstep by the provincial government in to the local administrative purview of municipal governments and increases the levels of bureaucracy.\nWastes taxpayer dollars, particularly in the context of removing bike lanes that have already been build\nGridlock\nA 2019 city survey found that nearly 10 per cent of residents cycled to work. Another 25 per cent reported cycling regularly for other reasons. Cycling lanes in fact can reduce gridlock when correctly implemented. The more people have access to bike lanes, the more they come out of the woodwork and start biking,\u201d said an associate professor in the University of Toronto\u2019s civil and mineral engineering department and Canada Research Chair in sustainable infrastructure.\nThe evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion  (https://cyclingsolutions.info/cost-benefit-of-cycling-infrastructure/)\nTraffic Injuries and Fatalities\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles. This is something already addressed in the Vision Zero program, that is to consider all active modes of transportation, such as driving, walking and cycling.\nProvincial Government Overstep\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making. Local input from ordinary citizens like myself in to municipal affairs could be overruled by provincial government actors who are removed from the local process.\nWaste of Taxpayer Dollars\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Removing functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible\nI hope you will carefully consider some of these points before moving ahead with Bill 212.\n"
