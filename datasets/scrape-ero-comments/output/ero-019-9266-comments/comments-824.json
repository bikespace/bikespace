        "comment": "Hello\nI support alternatives to driving. However it should not be at the expense of getting the vast majority of people to where they need to go, making our cities less accessible and putting people at risk to get out of cars or cross the street, and businesses suffering. The bike lanes are destroying communities where people could walk, shop and eat locally. It is also preventing people from travelling to other communities like those close to downtown or in the core of downtown.\nThere  is so very little net gain and so much damage to so many people. If we want to help the environment this is not helping. Cars are idling, and there are so few people riding their bikes. Plus our weather is not compatible with the use of bikes for 5 months of the year. It would be ideal to have bike lanes but the costs are too great.\nI fully support the provincial government in vetting the development of bike lanes particularly if it requires the removal of a car traffic lane. I  fully support eliminating bike lanes on Bloor, university and other major arteries in the city that were implemented. The costs have been too great. This error cannot happen again.\n"

Let's build it for them.\n- Please do not interfere with the important investment the city of Toronto has made in these lanes - through local democracy at work - and please respect the need to shift our traffic patterns.  Everyone in a car is not possible for Toronto, so let's not disadvantage those using other modes of travel.\n- Building a highway over greenbelt land would also be a travesty, increasing carbon emissions and destroying farmland.  For food security in our future we NEED to protect and preserve farmland. the primary purpose of the highway is to spread housing further out, instead we need to intensify, in the city, where people can travel by transit, walking and cycling and can save a LOT of money by not needing to have a car.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with Bill 212.\nI believe this legislation is a massive overstep from the provincial government into municipal jurisdiction. Bike lanes are a critical part of urban design. They help with traffic calming and ensure the safety of all road users. Bike lanes on arterial roads are crucial as there is no efficient throughway on side streets. Cyclists are more likely to stop at local shops along the street unlike vehicle users. There are countless studies that have show the real numbers and advantages of bike lanes. Statistics also show that with safe infrastructure more people choose to commute via a bicycle as they now feel safe doing so which in turn reduces congestion.\nRemoving bike lanes is extremely short sighted and pandering to commercial buisness that do not experience walk in clientele like so many other buisness do.\n"

        "comment": "This is a harmful and wasteful bill that goes entirely against modern and well founded principles in urban and traffic planning. Removing bike lanes will not alleviate gridlock (in fact the opposite is mostly true) and will put Toronto back both years and millions of dollars that should otherwise go towards other more productive and beneficial initiatives like community care, public housing, and transit. This bill is both harmful and backwards in premise and should be resolutely condemned.\n"

        "comment": "A sad a baseless political move. We have study after study showing that more car lanes equals more cars, that bikes lanes are good for communities and businesses. A robust bike lane network makes more people feel safe to take up biking over time, and helps to reduce stress on other forms of transportation. Plus throwing all of this investment down the drain and the added wild cost of removal. All for what? So some people who felt angry in downtown traffic might feel momentarily vindicated and then\u2026 will still feel angry in downtown traffic?\n"

        "comment": "A few quick thoughts::\n1. The recommendation is the wrong solution at the wrong time:  Autonomous vehicles are going to be taking over.  More lanes won't be needed.  Gridlock and accidents will be reduced.\n2. It is well established that the more you add lanes for cars the more you need to add more lanes for cars. It's a demand that creates more demand. Some places in the last few years have _eliminated_ highway lanes and the benefits have been many.\n3. The recommendation does not reflect the realities of city living.  In Toronto the subways, street cars and buses are crowded, the sidewalks are crowded, the bike lanes are crowded.  If you want to get all those people into cars, you'll soon have to pave over the whole city and have skyways on top of skyways.    If you want to make more room in the city for more people, improve transit and add bike lanes - maybe convert some car lanes into pedestrian-only and bike-only - which take up much less room..\n4. Accidents will not be reduced by having more highway lanes.  Accidents will increase and the harm to people and property will increase.\n5. More highway lanes mean more accidents, more use of hospitals, more pollution, more pollution-related diseases:  more burdens on the health care system with no increase in funding for all of that.  Health care for _everyone_ will be compromised.\nThink.  Please.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on Bloor west of Jane are a bad idea and should be removed. They exist solely for the PLEASURE of cyclists and serve no other purpose. There is an emission free subway a few feet below them if they wish to make an emission free transit of Bloor, or if they do not have access to a car.\nPollution is increased due to bike lanes because of the many cars idling in bumper to  bumper traffic. Having to turn right from the centre lane increases danger to cyclists and pedestrians. Stores along Bloor are suffering and what used to be an attractive boulevard is now an eyesore.\n"

This response concisely outlines the dangers and risks removing bike lanes will pose for both drivers and cyclist. They also note: \"Rather than reverting to outdated, car-centric policies, we must invest in a diverse range of public transportation options, including cycling infrastructure, to make our roads safer and our cities more sustainable. We owe it to our communities to develop solutions that will support our growing population, reduce emissions, and ensure that all road users can navigate the streets safely and efficiently.\"\n"

More cars moving faster where they want to go=more cars on the road. It\u2019s that simple\nCyclists will not be the only casualties - we all will be.\nWe need fewer cars on the road and absolutely more cycling infrastructure.\nI lost a friend in September - he was returning home on his bike from work. He was a young vibrant hardworking proud public servant, community leader, fundraiser, father, husband, son, brother, a light to so many. If there were a way to put a dollar value on his contributions left undone and the impact his tragic and unexpected death has had,  it would exceed the inane cost of ripping up the bike lanes already put in place.

        "comment": "Hello, I'm a Toronto resident that uses the Bloor and University bike lanes daily for my commute 11 months a year. I am very strongly opposed to the plan to remove the bike lanes in Toronto, I think this is an extreme step backward from making our roadways safe, which I think is the #1 most important role government has with respect to roadways. Toronto has made significant steps in reaction to cyclist deaths by redesigning these roads to prevent future deaths. Removing these lanes would mean holding the position that cyclist safety doesn't matter.\nI have seen commentary on this topic that if the lanes end up getting removed, the best approach for cycling efficiency and safety is by biking in the middle of the lane whenever possible. I vow to take this approach in the event that the bike lanes are removed.\nI am and will continue to be in favour of car traffic efficiency as a cyclist, unless these bike lanes are removed.\n"

Building highway 413 merely encourages reliance on cars, and causes irreparable harm to our environment.\nFurthermore, taking away bike lanes in cities encourages car-dependant lifestyles, increases traffic congestion, and creates a city centre that is unavailable and dangerous to those who don't have access to cars.\nI am asking government officials to abandon Bill 212, invest in public transit solutions including the addition and maintenance of bike lanes, and to commit to environmental protections of areas such as the Greenbelt.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes are an integral part of urban planning, they encourage alternate modes of transportation and actually relieve traffic and prevent accidents for those not in a car- a larger demographic in a metropolitan city. Extra traffic lanes will not relieve traffic as Toronto holds a large amount of people within the city and who come and go from the city on a daily basis, a better solution to the congestion would be to have public transportation be easier to access and use, as well as encourage alternate forms of transportation. More traffic lanes means more cars and the problem will persist and get worse, the answer then? To get rid of whole city blocks to fit cars? To get rid of the city, for the city?\n"

It is a gross overreach of power, at the Sour Grape Premier\u00e8s whim.  *See Science Centre Overreach  to help Ford Buddies get rich.\nAn even stupider idea is to further disrupt traffic to rip out  the busiest bike lanes in the city. Bloor-Danforth ave and University are probably the most used lanes. Strongly suggesting that all municipalities justify their future bike lanes does make sense, but the province\u00e8s oversight should be a rubber stamp on what the city decides, not an overturning.\nThe stupidest idea I have ever heard was putting another highway UNDER the 401  -- ie stopping traffic on the nations biggest highway for years.  One could almost expect this kind of stupidity  from an episode of the Simpsons.\nIf the Gov of Ontario wants to do something smart, it should decree the former sale of the publicly funded 407 to a private consortium as illegal, and keep those future revenues to fund traffic expansion in the province.\n"

        "comment": "I ride my bike for the majority of my errands, to commute to work, and for social outings. My community installed separated bike lanes, which have been a major game changer for me, especially as they are maintained in winter. This enables me to ride more than I ever did before. It saves me money on transit, taxi fares. On top of getting around, cycling keeps me active, and it boosts my mental health. As drivers seem to be more erratic, I am thankful for more cycling infrastructure that allows me to move around my city safely.\nWhile I understand that some drivers are not happy about added cycling infrastructure, I imagine that many (myself included when I do drive) are grateful that cyclists have their own space on the road.\nI hope that you will consider factors such as affordable transportation and personal wellbeing rather than simply considering matters of 'efficiency'.\n"
