        "comment": "Allow me to just state at the upfront that I am completely on board with reducing gridlock and saving people time. It\u2019s a crying shame how much of our short lives are wasted behind the wheel of a car, on the seat of a bus, or at the handlebars of a bicycle. I think that every person in this great province we call home deserves their hard earned time, and with a little bit of extra safety we can make sure they live long enough to enjoy it.\nBefore the installation of the University Ave bike lanes, I was twice hit by drivers on the road. I\u2019m not one of those kitted out, spandex covered, Tour De France style cyclists you see around the city. I\u2019m much more comfortable in a work jacket and jeans. That\u2019s all to say that it wasn\u2019t any aggressive or showy biking on my part that got me hit, it was simple human error by the drivers of each car. I don\u2019t fault them for it, we all get distracted, some of us have worse reflexes than others, and it\u2019s only human to make mistakes. But I am incredibly lucky to have escaped alive, and relatively uninjured. My work jacket saved my skin, literally. Some people aren\u2019t that lucky, and it\u2019s those people that my heart goes out to. Bike lanes can, and do, keep cyclists out of traffic, leaving roads clear and obstruction free.\nI think the real problem isn\u2019t between drivers and people on bikes. It\u2019s between hardworking people trying to get from point A to point B and freeloaders who treat our public arterial roads like a parking lot. Look out on Bloor, College, and Dundas Street on any given day and you\u2019ll see good, honest drivers and cyclists stuck behind lazy good-for-nothings who leave their parked cars empty on the side of the road. Sometimes they don\u2019t even properly park, and instead just leave their hazards on in traffic like they\u2019re \u201cpark anywhere\u201d buttons. Frankly, it\u2019s a disgrace. Parking belongs on side streets, in parking lots, and in your driveway at home, not on arterial roads. If we really want to speed up traffic and reduce gridlock, why aren\u2019t we taking away these so called \u201clazy lanes\u201d full of parked cars that don\u2019t even move?\nTake away a bike lane and cars get stuck behind cyclists that now have to share the road. I don\u2019t have to bore you with statistics\u2014you already know the figures\u2014that\u2019s just common sense. Not to mention the lives lost in collisions, and the drivers behind bars when that happens. Take away street parking on arterials however, and you\u2019ve successfully opened up a whole new lane of traffic for free. Remove the \u201clazy lanes\u201d and you can get this province moving again.\nThank you for your time.\n"

Despite making a higher-than-average salary, the high costs of living in the city, combined with the god-awful parking and traffic conditions in this city, mean that I do not have a car and rely on cycling, or transit, to get around.\nI cant really afford a car now, and I certainly couldn\u2019t afford to get around by any other means for the first 10 years I lived here, was a student, a min wage worker.\nNearly every single person I know - specifically those with a similar lifestyle to mine - relies on cycling to move through the city. The bike lane infrastructure on bloor, Jarvis, and university are essential arteries to get around.  Without dedicated bike lanes, you are slowing down each of these roads to the speed of anxious drivers who are unaware and too unskilled to drive with/alongside cyclists, and risking the lives of people on bikes in the process.\nThe bike lane pilot on bloor was a massive success, has almost near-perfect reception for people who actually *live* close to bloor, saw positive uptake of business on bloor.\nAnd for University? That bike lane project was barely finished before these plans to take it away. University Ave is not a street where vehicle congestion is an issue to begin with! It\u2019s nearly always quiet.\nDestroying these lanes will cost the city and the province 5x the price it took to build them in the first place (poor budget control for a government fixated on cutting budgets), and nobody living in the city, especially along these routes, is actually in support of this decision.\nLet cities manage themselves and back the hell out of Toronto. Don\u2019t you have better things to do than antagonizing people who have few options for getting around? We just want to go to work, get groceries, feel safe on the road. You\u2019re destroying key infrastructure that helps people survive here.\n"

        "comment": "This is a blatant power grab to enable the provincial government to unilaterally build the expensive, environmentally harmful, and inefficient 413 Highway. As far as the bike lanes themselves go, all rigorous studies show they reduce traffic and are a net benefit to the city by taking cars off streets and lowering pollutants. There is no logical reason to rip out these bike lines which will be very expensive and will not resolve anything while also increasing vehicle emissions and encouraging more cars. Like many of the Ford government policies, it centers around what is good for him personally at the expense of the electorate which is shameful public policy.\n"

As someone who has been struck by a car while cycling, I feel this bill is dangerous, wasteful and an overreach of provincial power.\nBike lanes are designed to keep cyclists and drivers safe while removing slower moving cyclists from faster cars. Without bike lanes, most would not feel safe on the roads at all.\nWhat is the cause of gridlock? Cars. The best way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road. Bike lanes save lives and make roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians and drivers alike. If roads are safer for cyclists, it becomes the more attractive option.\nThis is also an overreach of provincial power. Why should small towns and cities across the province be subjected to such a broad policy? The province should not be responsible for deciding when a bike lane is appropriate.\nFurthermore, using provincial tax dollars to remove already existing bike lanes in Toronto is distasteful and offensive to those living outside of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to compliment the Ontario Government  for taking leadership and proposing legislation that would end the madness created by our mayor and Toronto City Hall politicians re-bike lanes in general, but specifically bike lanes that remove a lane of traffic both ways such as those on portions of Yonge Street between Bloor and St.Clair. While I am not anti-bike, there are many other road alternatives, not as convenient for bikers or the food delivery service providers on e-scooters who seem to proliferate these lanes, that could better accommodate the safety issue that the bike lobby always raises without causing such disruption to traffic flows on Yonge Street and surrounding side streets as drivers use them to avoid traffic jams.  The vast majority of bikers using these lanes in my view show total disregard for safety and rules of the road.  They ride as if they feel the world owes them and everything revolves around them.  Always very aggressive in their riding behaviour and it seems they feel they are immune to stop signs, rules of the road, red lights, speed limits and merging traffic, no lights at night, no helmets in many  cases. The police are not going to do anything about it and the bikers know it  resulting  in their total disregard.  I am in my 70's and live  in the Summerhill area.   We are forced to pick our time of day to go out , or grocery shopping or arrange doctor appointments to avoid the traffic congestion and mess the bike lanes have created especially in the 2-7 pm time frame on Monday to Friday. As a homeowner in the area if things don't improve there should be a quality of life tax refund on our city taxes for the inability to live normally as residents as other Torontonians do in other areas.  Stop trying to make our city into  Amsterdam, the cities are  totally designed and built differently.  Thank you Ontario  Government, at least the conservative portion, for leadership on this issue and end the madness and  bring common sense back into this discussion with city politicians who have only shown their ability to cause kaos amongst its citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which seeks to remove bike lanes on major streets such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto. I strongly urge you to vote against this bill.\nAs Minister of Transportation I hope you understand bike lanes save lives. Our province has already seen tragic fatalities involving cyclists, and removing the dedicated infrastructure that protects them would only put more lives at risk. Safe, separated bike lanes are essential in encouraging people to choose cycling as a mode of transportation. We need to create a city and province that prioritizes safe, healthy, and sustainable commuting options.\nWhile reducing gridlock is a valid concern, the long-term solution lies in reducing car dependency and making non-car commuting\u2014biking, walking, and public transit\u2014the priority of the province of Ontario. Encouraging these modes of transportation can help ease congestion, improve public health, and address our environmental goals.\nI urge you to take a stand for the safety of Ontarians and for the future of sustainable transportation in Ontario by voting against Bill 212. Protecting and expanding our bike lanes will not only save lives but also contribute to building vibrant, accessible communities.\nThank you for considering my concerns, and I look forward to your response on this matter.\nSincerely,\nMitchell\n"

        "comment": "This piece of policy is absolutely ridiculous. Firstly this is a gross overreach of provincial resources into micro-managing municipalities. Secondly, it has been well established that increasing road volume does not reduce traffic and gridlock. The only reliable way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road. One way of doing that is INCREASING the number of bike lanes, and alternative ways of travel. This proposal is either incredibly poorly researched or a thinly veiled way to pander to anti environmentalist and pro-car lobbyists.  I am vehemently against this piece of legislation and hope that this backwards type of thinking is left in the past, where it belongs.\n"

Prioritizing the construction of additional highways only increases the amount of car owners on the road. With more drivers on the road competing for space, gridlock would just be guaranteed. Ontarians need freedom of choice when it comes to travelling.\n2. Bike lane construction needs to remain a municipal jurisdiction. Please don't further inflate the size of the provincial government. Municipal governments deal with the traffic in real time and have access to more up-to date information. Moving this over to Provincial jurisdiction only creates more lag to the process.\n3. There needs to be more consultation on this Bill. Expediting the construction of highways is inefficient. The future needs freedom of choice when it comes to travelling.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lane policy should remain the purview of local government (city, town, etc.). It's not clear why the Provincial government is once again interfering with city planning policy. The proposal is shortsighted and fails to address the actual causes of congestion. It will only increase road congestion and danger. The current research on dedicated bike lanes shows that they greatly improve road safety, decrease congestion and/or have minimal impact on motor vehicle travel times, and are beneficial to local businesses by bring more people traffic, not less. Our solutions to making our city livable should be focused on people not cars. In Toronto the use of the bike share program has increased exponentially and the implementation of bike lanes has drastically improved road safety. The numbers used by the Provincial government to illustrate increased congestion are from a period of time when the COVID pandemic had greatly reduced the number of cars on our roads. Since that time people have returned to work in the office and are once again going out regularly. Additionally, since that time the number of road work projects and building projects causing road or lane closures has also greatly increased. Congestion also comes from a lack of alternative methods to move around the city. We need improvements that get people out of cars, such as continued improvement of bike lane infrastructure, urban planning focusing on making our cities more walkable and strong investment in public transit. Most cities around the world have already learned that a robust, accessible public transit system and strong bike infrastructure are the backbone to a strong economy. However, both the Canada and Ontario governments have failed to properly invest in public transit. Although Toronto is of great economic and strategic importance to the country and province it has one of the most under funded, expensive to use, limited reach public transit systems in the world. The proposal seems to be intended only to target a hot-button issue to draw attention away from numerous Provincial government scandals and to draw votes prior to an expected election by scapegoating bike lanes/bicyclists. An us vs. them campaign. We need real proposals based on research that will actually address congestion and poor road safety, not scapegoating.\n"

        "comment": "The complete failure of this proposed legislation is summed up with a single phrase, that you wish to help \"drivers\" move faster and more efficiently. The goal should be to help \"people\" move faster and more efficiently.\nCatering to drivers, which generally means cars and trucks and SUVs, also usually means single-occupant vehicles. Study after study, along with a long history of trying to increase capacity (i.e., more roads, more lanes, more highways), demonstrates conclusively that this DOES NOT WORK as intended.\nRemoving bike lanes, as emphasized by a premier who wants to pretend to be the mayor of Toronto, is simply the same bad idea flipped on its head. That the premier's own commute might be on one or more of the prominent bike lanes targeted for removal simply elevates this policy from \"incompetent\" to \"selfishly incompetent.\"\nThe government of Ontario, and its premier, are supposed to be acting to improve the lives of all Ontarians. Focus on improving health care, education, and transit. Making transit better, including bike lanes and promoting active commuting options, removes cars and creates more room and faster commutes for those who must use their vehicles. Not less.\nPoliticians need to recognize that they are generally not the smarted or best-informed people engaged in an issue. In some cases, they appear to be the *least* intelligent individuals expressing an opinion.\n"

        "comment": "This will have a devastating impact on the community and be a waste of my tax dollars (given many of these safe and effective bike lanes were just completed/made safer).\nHaving dedicated bike lanes on main thoroughfares makes things safer and commutes faster for both drivers and cyclists. It makes cycle routes predictable and reduces turns, where more cyclists are struck and seriously injured and where cars may not know to look out for riders. It will put MORE cars on the road as cyclists won\u2019t have another option, increasing congestion and pollution. It reduces the physical health of our population. The 1.5 metres it takes for a bike lane will not relieve congestion, it will just increase parking (which slows down traffic as people attempt to park on the main streets). It will move us away from being a world-class and progressive city (which are all increasing bikes lanes) and our city will be less enjoyable.\nWhat we need is better transit options for those living in the suburbs (more frequent Go Train options and more routes), and reliable TTC service (which is easier when there is less traffic and dedicated transit lanes - which could be combined with bike lanes). We need higher density living instead of sprawl.\nRemoving the bike lanes will force cyclists onto the roads. Which they are allowed by law to ride on. This will frustrate drivers and make it unsafe for everyone.\nPeople are frustrated with transit times as we got used to not having them during the pandemic and the city and province didn\u2019t adequately plan in years past for proper infrastructure.\nI am beyond angry with Doug Ford\u2019s repeated short sighted and wasteful measures that do not focus on Ontarian\u2019s quality of life for future generations.\nI am pleased the Ontario Line is going in and the city/province should be planning for the next subway project!\n"
