        "comment": "I am someone who drives to the nearest TTC station, I rely on both my car and public transit to safely get to work everyday and I believe we need to build BETTER and MORE protected bikes lanes\u2026NOT TO REMOVE THEM.\n1) The city has already spent millions of dollars and years building these bike lanes\u2026how is it more cost effective to spend millions more to tear them out? How is more years of construction going to reduce congestion? How is throwing away barely used materials like plastic and concrete guardrails MORE environmentally friendly? It is not.\n2) This is a gross overreach of provincial jurisdiction and will set a precedent that the federal and provincial governments can intervene where the people don\u2019t have adequate representation. Not to mention the fact that the province will not adequately address such minor issues with the quickness that is required\u2014the province already takes so long with basic tasks within their jurisdiction, you want to add more to that plate? Why?\n3) the province states that it needs \u201cdata\u201d to back up bike lane building decisions, but seemingly ignores the fact that every single traffic study shows that adding more lanes for vehicles does not reduce congestion or accidents. Even the new highway Ford wants to build had multiple studies saying that the highway 413 would not significantly reduce traffic\u2014especially with the cost & environmental impact it would cause. So, on that note, where is the data and the studies (that are independently conducted & not funded by automakers) that show the opposite? Where are the studies from cities around the world whose population is even bigger than toronto\u2019s that show more lanes = better traffic & safer streets? They do not exist. What the data actually shows time and time again that reducing road speeds, adding bike lanes, narrowing lanes, adding in barriers that are well designed & decorative reduce collisions, are more safe, and are more pleasant to use.\nI am a driver, I own my own car and very proud that I do, but I am tired of cyclists not having a safe space to ride forcing them to weave in between traffic. I\u2019m tried that their rightful frustration is taken out on their fellow commuters. I am tried that I cannot walk safely down streets simply because cars are given every right & leniency. I\u2019m tired that the TTC buses and streetcars are stuck in the same traffic as me, stopping every 5 meters instead of having their own dedicated lanes. I\u2019m tried that I can\u2019t rely on any mode of transport that I have the free will to use. I want to be able to walk or drive or bus or bike or hell, even fly to where I need to go if I so chose to.\nThis act that has been proposed by Ford\u2019s government will not help anyone, and is actively going to put Toronto behind other world class cities even more than it already is. We need better road design and that includes better bike lanes in the places people need to go, not shunted off to back roads where they will not be used due to the inconvenience\u2014like building a road to nowhere. For decades North Americans haven\u2019t relied or had even the choice other than to use their cars, the bike lanes will be used, they simply will not be jam packed on the first year they are open. They need more time and they need more than just the driver\u2019s opinion before they are torn out.\nTLDR: this act is a waste of time and resources; it should not be passed.\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely baffling that the provincial government considers removing and restricting bike lanes as an effective method for reducing congestion. Automobiles continue to be the most polluting, dangerous, space-inefficient, and expensive ways for folks to get around and it has been proven time and again that the only way to fight congestion is to give people viable alternatives to driving. I have linked a recent CBC article supporting these statements. If the government really wants to fix congestion, it would speed up the Finch and Eglinton LRT projects.\nThere are also other unsavoury portions added to the bill, which the bike policies are no doubt to distract the media from, such as removing the environmental assessments for the pointless Highway 413 project and increasing the speed limits on our already dangerous highways.\nCyclists will die as a result of removing protected bike infrastructure. These deaths are preventable.\n"

I needed my car to get to work, shops, and activities. I don\u2019t drive as much now that I live in Toronto, but I still drive to see family and for shops and activities where convenient. With less experience biking, I bike only where it\u2019s comfortable and safe.\nSartre once wrote that \u201cHell is other people\u201d. For drivers, Hell is other cars. I\u2019ve wasted so much time sitting in traffic. My car was totaled after I got rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic. In Toronto, I\u2019ve gotten stuck blocks away from getting on the Gardiner, not even seeing the highway before I eventually gave up.\nEven worse are bikes when there is no bike lane. If there\u2019s a bike lane, we can get past each other no problem. If there\u2019s no bike lane, I have to either pass the bike (stressful with other cars around) or crawl behind them if I can\u2019t pass.\nWe\u2019re all frustrated by traffic and we want solutions. But removing bike lanes could backfire and make driving worse. There will be more cars in our way and it will be harder to get past bikes. If I don\u2019t feel safe biking somewhere, I\u2019ll drive. Others will do the same or will bike in car lanes. Remove bike lanes and people like me might be the car \u2013 or bike \u2013 you\u2019re stuck behind.\n"

As a driver, cyclist, and transit user myself I think that more focus should be directed to giving Ontarians functional options so that driving is not always the best option.\nLast-mile transit solutions, more reliable transit, safer streets, and an intentional shift away from the GTA treating downtown Toronto like a place for commuting to are required to relieve this burden.\nIf we want traffic to feel like it did 20 years ago, then we'll need to have millions fewer cars on the road. Make it more convenient not to drive and people will shift.\nIt also seems wasteful to create and grant 'Strong Mayor' powers to enable local leaders and then pass meddling legislation.\n"

        "comment": "I thought this was a joke at first. Anyone tied to the attempt of removing or trying to remove bike lines should be fired and ashamed to be a public servant. This city needs progressive and sustainable thinking to set itself apart from other cities. This requires systemic changes like reinforcement of bike lanes and infrastructure that supports the city\u2019s development while enriching and protecting the lives of its citizens. Make more bikes lanes, access to bikes, safer locking methods and more people will be able to use them. If there\u2019s currently not enough use of bikes in cities maybe it\u2019s because cities need to do more to make biking more practical and safer, by reinforcing the bike lanes, making laws that prevent drivers from obstructing them and leading to accidents as well as more licensing for bike owners if that\u2019s an option to protect bikes from theft. A crackdown on thieves and making special bike parking that wouldn\u2019t allow for crime would make it much easier to own, and use a bike within the city and get to enjoy the bike lanes without having to worry about loosing your mode of transportation to theft. There really should be a downtown congestion tax for drivers to encourage cyclists as well as Go train patrons. Prioritizing the use of privately owned motor vehicles when typically there\u2019s only one occupant per vehicle is a mistake.\n"

As a daily cyclist, I rely on these lanes to ensure the safety of myself and my family during our commutes. The bike lanes are not just painted lines; they are vital infrastructure that protects us from traffic and promotes a safer, healthier community.\nRemoving these lanes is a significant backward step for our city. Instead of dismantling existing infrastructure that supports cycling, we should be focusing on expanding and improving it. Cycling is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation that can reduce congestion and pollution, contributing to a better quality of life for everyone.\nWe must adapt our city to be more cyclist-friendly. This means investing in safe, accessible bike lanes that encourage more people to ride, fostering a culture of active transportation. I urge our leaders to prioritize the safety of all road users and to think long-term about the benefits of a cycling-friendly city. Let's not take a step back; let's move forward towards a more sustainable and inclusive future.\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown Ottawa resident, I am dismayed that this government is proposing a review and potential removal of existing bike lanes, including the protected bike lanes on O\u2019Connor Street. The O\u2019Connor Street bike lanes have been overwhelmingly successful and are a much-loved part of our active transportation infrastructure, with over 150,000 uses per year.\nThis legislation undermines good transportation planning, and I'm concerned it will make it more difficult to build bike infrastructure that can reduce the number of deaths and catastrophic injuries on our roads. It will also put all of the city\u2019s goals to mitigate climate change at risk.\nWhile it often goes underdiscussed in conversations about traffic and modal share, the reality is that many cycling infrastructure projects are put in as a direct response to tragic accidents and deaths of cyclists on the road. Cyclists are not just statistics \u2013 they are beloved family members, colleagues, and community members. This legislation is profoundly disrespectful to thousands of Ontarians whose lives have been profoundly changed by a road accident.\nThis is a government that claims to want to reduce red tape, and to be strong stewards of taxpayer dollars. If that\u2019s the case, why are you adding layers of bureaucracy to local decisions, and proposing to waste public dollars on ripping out brand new, highly used infrastructure? The data on bike lanes is clear \u2013 rather than increasing congestion, they decrease it by providing a safe alternative option.\nPremier Ford, Ontarians want common sense policies \u2013 to get from Point A to Point B safely and securely whether that\u2019s on foot, by bike, by bus, by train, and by car. Bicycles are part of traffic and deserve space on our roads. Municipalities know what their residents are asking for, and it\u2019s safer streets. There\u2019s still time for the province to do the right thing for Ontarians, and to pull back from this outrageous over-reach and withdraw this uninformed and dangerous bill.\nIn short, bicycles don't cause gridlock. They reduce gridlock. Supporting more, better and safer bike usage is the future.\n"

And residents in those communities are uniquely poised to provide input on a case by case basis.\nAs well, I am appalled by the authoritarian approach the current provincial government is taking when it comes to prioritizing automobile travel over safe travel for everyone who uses the roads. This arrogance defies logic especially in a carbon-challenged world that is rapidly approaching the brink of catastrophic climate change.\nA more insidious cause of gridlock in my city, Toronto, is the continued blocking of roads by developers who routinely take up entire lanes of traffic for years at a time during construction.\nWhen one sees the haunting image of ghost bikes erected in memory of cyclists killed as they try to navigate the city, the idea of removing local authority to make decisions about where cyclists should be permitted to ride is an authoritarian power grab with lethal and tragic consequences.\nThis policy proposal is so misguided and absurd that the only explanation for it is the transparent political motivation to generate votes for the political party in power. Perhaps it's time for the Premier to start to govern the province for all of the people who live here, not just the politically-aligned voters in key strategic districts.\n"

        "comment": "The requirement for provincial approval for city bike lanes is a governmental overreach, and it creates unnecessary red tape. It's city officials, not the province, who know best what the traffic patterns are like at the city level, and what it takes to help people get to and from work, school, and patronizing local businesses. As a taxpayer both at the Ontario level and at the municipal level, I am abhorred at this proposal to have my tax dollars be used for evaluating the same thing (whether a bike lane should exist) at two different levels, and I urge the Province to drop this unnecessarily Big Government proposal, and instead focus on passing legislation that would benefit the entire province, for things that would make sense at a provincial level.\nFurthermore, cars cause gridlock, not bikes. I choose to not own a car because I don't want to contribute to the gridlock problem, or to the increasing costs of road maintenance from car traffic. I am currently in a city where I can bike safely to the farmer's market, to local mom-and-pop shops in the central business area, to entertainment venues. On a safe and segregated path where I am not competing with cars, I can pay more attention to what new shops have popped up and that I could check out.\nDedicated bike paths lets me support local businesses that, in turn, pay taxes to Ontario. The vast majority of my non-essential spending (shopping, eating out, entertainment) is done by bike or on foot. When I can't get to those places easily, I would switch to online ordering from big international corporations that don't pay their fair share of taxes to Canada and Ontario--this means less revenue for the Province, as well as increased gridlock from delivery vehicles.\nBill 212 would end up doing the opposite of the original intention. It would cause more gridlock (more people forced off their bikes and have to drive, more trips by delivery trucks), hurt local businesses that rely on their neighbours' patronage, and drive up the cost of running the province through creating more red tape.\nLet's make Ontario a place to grow by giving people options on how they want to get around, and by giving cities the freedom to decide how best to advance their local economy. We really don't need this extra Big Government intervention.\n"
