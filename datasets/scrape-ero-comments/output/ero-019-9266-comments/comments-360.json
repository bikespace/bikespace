Queen and Yonge closed for at least 5 years , traffic disruptions Pape and Danforth, Eastern Avenue near Broadview, Queen and University, Liberty Village and that is just a little list to start with.\nI am both a driver of my vehicle and I use the Bike lanes every day. Since the the bike lanes have been constructed the use has transformed how many Torontonians travel in our city. Out of their cars and on their bikes. Again ford forcing his will on the people of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government never lets good policy get in the way of a bad idea. Bike lanes support so many good policy outcomes: from REDUCING congestion to improved public health outcomes to reduced health care costs to increased economic output. We know this...you know...because of evidence.\nBeyond the bad policy that we've gotten used to from this administration, one of the more galling things about this is that the government is playing politics with people's lives. More people will die because of the removal of bike lanes. Not least because of driver agression being stoked by the Ford government lying about the causes of congestion, effectively blaming cyclists and bike lanes. Shameful.\n"

        "comment": "The notion of reducing bike lanes runs counter to the safety of cyclists, the urgent need to reduce carbon by car use, and in particular in central Toronto areas to encourage the use of public transit. Examples of many cities where cars in particular are discouraged are London, Paris and Amsterdam where charges are made for most car use. In those cities investment is made in rapid transit and by far the predominant transport use is subways and buses and cycles. The increasing use of Toronto cycle hire says much about the popularity where cycle lanes encourage the bike use. It does seem highly retrograde to actually remove already constructed bike lanes\n"

        "comment": "I applause the action Doug Ford's government is taking on this proposal. Toronto GTA traffic is chaotic and the bike lanes play a large part where they are installed. I walk down University Avenue and I saw no more than 5 bikes on the north bound bike lane and more than 100 cars sharing the 2 traffic lanes in the afternoons around 2 pm. That's was observation over a few days.\nThe city is talking about installing bike lanes along Sheppard Avenue East. One can imagine the congestion this plan will bring.\nWhile taking bike as means of transporting is a good alternative to driving, we need to look into its impact to the city. Here are my suggestion / thoughts:\n- A traffic study should be done to count the number of bikes vs. cars at different time of the day over a period of time, to determine if bike lanes serve the public well. The result should include how much time the drivers spend behind the wheels to get through traffic. No one should have to spend more than 2 hours to go back and forth to work.\n- Can the bike lanes installed not on the main streets?\n- People with visual or hearing problems may not hear or see the bikes coming.  New measures should be implemented to protect the people with disabilities.\n- The bikers may say if you build it, they will come. I would say, who would take the bike lane in winter which can be long and snowy. This is not Europe where they have the bike culture and more suitable weather for biking.  If the bikers have to pay a licence fee to use the bike lanes, then we know are serious they are. Implement the bike lanes when there is a majority. That's only a democratic thing to do, and please do not be controlled by the loud lobby groups.\nI strongly support this Bill. I don't think the City of Toronto knows what they are doing. Their Consultation (e.g. the one on Sheppard Avenue West) is just a show that there was one done, but their mind has already been made up.\nMr. Ford and his government has my strong support, and I am spreading the word to drum up support for this Bill that makes common sense.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation, and sincerely hope the government reconsiders it. I\u2019ve submitted a version of this comment before, but since there\u2019re been new amendments to the legislation, I feel compelled to send it again.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons why I whole heartedly oppose this bill:\n1. I live near Bloor Street West, and as a pedestrian I feel significantly safer on the street since the bike lanes were installed (all three phases). The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel.\n2. I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them. People will die.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3. I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4. It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government pretends to care about, taxes. I am confident that when the government changes, whether that\u2019s in 1,2, or 6 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014pedestrians to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5. I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Kingsway. I am absolutely delighted to hear that the bike lanes along Bloor Street will be ripped up. How anybody could think that removing a car lane would not increase congestion is beyond my ability to comprehend. I am not against bike lanes as long as they are not, removing lanes for cars. Either widen the streets or narrow the sidewalks for bike lanes on major streets. Premie Ford\u2019s suggestion that bike lanes be on secondary routes is an even better idea.\n"

        "comment": "A bill framed like it will reduce congestion yet the plan is to actually reduce road capacity (by taking bike lanes out) makes absolutely no sense. It is a matter of fact that bike lanes reduce congestion (especially in urban/dense areas since most daily trips are short enough not to require a car). The only way to reduce traffic is to give and incentivize viable alternatives to driving. On top of the fact that this bill will do the opposite it aimes to achieve, it also will hurt ontarians financially by removing the ability to cycle safely and essentially forcing us to buy a car and pay for all the expenses that come with it just to live. Furthermore it will create more carbon emissions due to the increased cars on the road. There will be more cars on the road (more traffic) as a result of this bill because of the extremely basic economic concept of induced demand that this government seemingly cannot comprehend.\n"

It\u2019s clearly political in nature and intentionally vindictive towards downtown Toronto in particular. The government has not provided any proper data to show bike lanes are the cause of Toronto\u2019s recent congestion issues, and should instead be focusing on the public transit lines that have fallen far behind expected completion dates, the impact of construction on the Gardiner, and any number of ideas that could reduce traffic (such as congestion tolls).\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible legislation for so many reasons: it wastes money, ignores ample evidence to the contrary, ultimately makes the problem worse, and will cause people to get hurt or killed. But that's what I've come to expect from this government.\nDo you know how you ease congestion? Get more people OUT of cars and ONTO bikes and public transit. How do you get more people onto bikes? You give them a safe and direct route. All this does is further encourage car use which leads to, you guessed it, MORE CONGESTION. This is not an earnest attempt to ease congestion and improve conditions in the city. If you were really serious about that, you'd introduce tolls/congestion pricing to discourage frivolous car use and improve bike and public transit infrastructure. But no - this is a hacky ideological play to your suburban base who feels entitled to the city without getting out of their car.\nPeople and small businesses will suffer. The problem will get worse. Taxpayer dollars will be wasted. A Doug Ford special.\n"

We have just finished construction on many of these bike lanes and now you want to rip them up despite the fact that they improve safety? We are in a climate crisis. We are waiting for this government to finish construction on the Eglington LRT. This is not evidence based. This is not what the people of this city want. This is a way for the Ontario government to distract the public from all of the bad deals you are trying to push through. Enough. Doug Ford is a stain on this province and the people of Toronto have always known it. Taking out bike lanes in the midst of a climate crisis is as shameful as ripping out Ontario Place.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lived in the GTA suburbs for half their life and the city of Toronto for the other half, I can't figure out how this legislation appeals to anyone in Ontario or those travelling within / through Toronto.\nIf I'm driving a car I want bike lanes so cyclists aren't in front of the car slowing down traffic or swished into the side of the lane making them hard to see or easy to accidently crash into. Bike lanes and proper barriers help drivers predict where cyclists will be located to assist in avoiding unnecessary collisions. I don't want to kill or injure someone while driving. I do want to get someplace in a timely manner too. Please make it easy for me to succeed by dividing the lanes.\nIf I'm cycling I want to know I have the least chance of being hit by a car possible, am easy for cars to see, and want to get someplace in a timely manner. A bike lane is ideal as it helps keep me separated from cars that can injure me accidentally (or purposely run me off a road)! A bike lane helps me keep moving quickly to where I want to go so I won't hold up car traffic or be held up by the gridlock car traffic causes in roads.\nI'm not sure what I'm missing here, but bike lanes seem pretty essential to me whether I choose to drive or cycle... in with case I want to travel safely, get there in a timely manner, avoid pissing other travelers off. Cars and bikes both need space on main roads like Bloor/Danforth, Yonge and University because those are main arteries in Toronto that can actually get you someplace you want to go. I can't use side roads in my car or on my bike to get someplace I want to go in Toronto because the city's roads aren't built that way. You have to use main roads to get to office buildings, stores, school, etc. when in Toronto.\nI'm urging you don't remove existing bike lanes, please let municipal governments decide what's best for their areas. Let them build more bike lanes without unnecessary provincial red tape. Don't pass Bill 212. It isn't safe. Studies show lack of bike lanes decreases safety and increases traffic.\nSincerely,\nA concerned Ontarian\n"

        "comment": "This is a clear overstep of provincial power and adding policy regarding City of Toronto bike lanes should not be the purview of the province. The province does not have the transportation data regarding the efficacy of such lanes and is cherry picking statistics while blatantly ignoring the data from the city of Toronto regarding both the efficacy and popularity of the bike lanes. The bike lane policy is not for the people. I live within 30 metres of the Yonge street bike lane and it has been a major improvement for the community, reducing speed of traffic improving pedestrian flow of people to local businesses. I will stop walking and frequenting businesses on Yonge street if the bike lane is removed, as I will no longer feel safe as a pedestrian given the proximity of the cars to the sidewalks if the bike lanes are removed. Don\u2019t touch the bike lanes, this provincial policy is not for the people who actually live and transport by the bike lanes.\n"

This year, Toronto has already had 6 cyclist deaths, and many of them could have been prevented with dedicated bike lanes/no barriers in the bike lanes (as in the garbage bin on Bloor that blocked the lane and led to the cyclist's death). As a cyclist, without the bike lanes I'll be forced into traffic. Honestly, it's a huge waste of money and resources for infrastructure the city has just completed. The city went through intensive consultations and studies to ensure the bike lanes made sense - just leave them as is. The issues with traffic are with unplanned/poorly planned construction, the volume of cars on the road due to a crappy TTC and GO options, and if you look at the DVP, 401 etc. that's where the volume is and there are no bike lanes there. Why not focus on things like healthcare, education and housing? That's literally what Ontarians care about! Stay in your lane.\n"
