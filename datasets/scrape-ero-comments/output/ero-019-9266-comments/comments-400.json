It is so rarely \"bumper to bumper traffic\" on these streets. The real traffic comes from the highways! From the Gardiner! Removing bike lanes will NOT do anything to ease this traffic! Even on Bloor, if you remove the bike lanes, all you will get is 1 extra lane, not on both sides. 1 extra lane in total! If you want two lanes, remove the parking! This is the most counterintuitive legislation you could ever come up with, quite literally made by people who have never lived inside this city. Keep your hands off of Toronto!\n"

By focusing on adding lanes, you ignore the underlying causes of congestion. Investing in public transit, creating bike-friendly infrastructure, and improving pedestrian access are more sustainable ways to reduce traffic by providing viable alternatives to driving.\nwith the insane amount of immigration we have had in the last couple years, it is absolutely ridiculous to believe that removing a bike lane and adding a extra lane will solve or alleviate the issue of traffic,in Toronto. cars are literately the least efficient way for people to travel. and I am against the waste of my tax dollars to build a bike lane then have it removed using my tax money to build a road with my tax money. Toronto and Ontario need less car dependency not MORE!!!!\nI am Strongly against this!!!!!!!!!!\n"

        "comment": "The name of this project is ironic as research shows us time and time again that adding bike lanes improves traffic flow for all road users. Even if they didn\u2019t, the government should be providing safe options for all road users, not just the privileged few. There is approximately 30% of the population in Toronto who doesn\u2019t own a car. Has the government simply decided that not owning a car disqualifies people from safe transportation? This is the kind of message you\u2019re sending.\nThe provincial government is making a desperate attempt to block the construction of new bike infrastructure with this ridiculous bike lane review process. No such process is in place to remove overbuilt and underutilized roads. This level of bureaucracy should not be coming from the provincial government. If a community wants a bike lane built, that should be left to that community without meddling from the province.\nThe Premier might not consider bike lanes important enough to be worth his time, but the fact of the matter is that myself and many others depend on this infrastructure to safely get to work or school. It\u2019s a real punch in the gut to not only hear that the government doesn\u2019t care about my essential infrastructure but actively wants to rip it out so that a dozen or so more cars can fit in bumper-to-bumper traffic. This crusade against bike lanes is, at best, uneducated and, at worst, downright vindictive.\nI support safe bike infrastructure. I want to see more of it in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "As an avid cyclist, a retired cycling commuter and believer in environmental causes, I find this bill offensive, dangerous, regressive and a colossal waste of time, effort and money.\nGiving people a safe, reliable, cheap, alternative and efficient transportation method only makes sense. This could lead to more use of current and future bike infrastructure, and healthier populace, reduced strain and costs on the healthcare system, cleaner air and roads.  I don\u2019t know how many people have travelled to Manhattan, but after a day of touring around I always felt I needed a shower due to the vehicle exhaust and tire particles in the air, not to mention the constant noise levels. I often feel the same after walking the downtown streets of Toronto.\nA safe, separate series of bike lanes that connect neighbourhoods with areas where people actually want and need to go (and not making routes circuitous by routing them along non through streets) would reduce the number of cars on the road, reduce congestion, pollution and the need for extra car lanes.\nProtected bike lanes would help safeguard the lives and safety of cyclists. As an avid cyclist, I have had several close interactions with inattentive, uncaring, or vindictive, coal-rolling, gravel spewing drivers who felt I should not be taking up their precious roadspace. If cyclists had their own dedicated, safe and efficient routes, as they have in some European countries, these unsafe, dangerous interactions would be reduced or possibly eliminated.\nRemoving already established bike lanes would put cyclists at greater risk than they already are. I find it passing strange that two of the routes are those used by the premier of the province on his commute to and from work and home. Here\u2019s a question: why does the premier not use public transportation? From my own use of the TTC system, I found it fast and efficient. Considering he lives in Toronto, it would probably get him to work faster, more efficiently and definitely more environmentally friendly than the Ford-mobile. Pretty sure he doesn\u2019t drive around in an electric vehicle.\nRemoving existing bike lanes is regressive. We are now in the 21st century, and supposedly fighting for our own survival with the threat of climate change, over-population, urban sprawl, daily threats to the Greenbelt and farmland, and yet this government seems to want to protect the status quo from the mid- to late-20th century with outdated thinking, and no forward perspective other than paving over the entirety of southern Ontario. This is not how to prepare for the future. This is a regressive move. It shows this government has no care or consideration for a segment of the population. No ability to look to the future with new ideas.\nAll the money, all the time, all the effort by grassroots groups, planners, city staff, construction crews, politicians will now be wasted. Something we have come to expect from government. But now, we get to see all of that time, money and effort wasted again by removing existing infrastructure, and now by two levels of government.\nI find the lack of concern for vulnerable road users, lack of future focus, lack of wanting to develop a livable, workable, walkable, cyclable city, lack of environmental concern, lack of fiduciary responsibility all very offensive, dangerous, regressive and a colossal waste of time, energy, effort and money. Premier Ford should stick to provincial concerns and leave the running of Toronto and other cities to the elected officials and their civic employees.\n"

Do not waste our tax revenue on ripping out infrastructure that is already in place!\nI want to use my bike more, but can't, due to virtually no bike lanes in my area forcing me to unsafely share the road with automobiles when I do make that choice. As a cost effective transportation option bikes are not going to vanish. Do we really want them to dangerously share road space with automobiles, or does it make more sense to provide them with infrastructure that safely integrates them with other road traffic?\nWhat's next? Remove other essential infrastructure such as seldom used sidewalks to further cater to automobiles? Society as a whole needs more reason to leave their automobiles at home and use alternatives such as public transit and bike lanes. If we don't install and expand those networks then there are no alternatives to automobiles and congestion on the roads will simply remain.\nPlease, do NOT remove bike lanes!

It boggles the mind that our government has never heard of induced demand. Here's a quick summary for the current MPPa: making more car lanes will lead to more driving, which will cause more traffic. It's simple.\nNot only does this proposal go against any basic research on traffic reduction, it's also massive government overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Why should the province tell cities how they should build their roads? If the people in a given city want bike lanes, why should the province have final say?\nI know that I sound pretentious and condescending writing this. I do not care.

Walking is more dangerous then biking in curtain parts of downtown. Tourists use bikes, we need to be a tourist friendly city!\nBikes do not pollute, no parking issues, do not destroy roads like heavy cars and trucks do. They do not speed and pose less danger then cars do. Police officers use bikes and bike lanes too. Youth bike to schools, Universities, Colleges.\nWhat about all those food delivery people on bikes? Switch to cars too? A thousand more cars?\nThe people in charge are clearly narcist and don't think or care about communities they don't live in.\nIf Ford used a bike, maybe he would be in a heathier shape physically and mentally! We should take example from Europe where Government officials bike and use public transit.\nFord to switch from driving! How about that?\nThanks for reading!\nI'm a middle aged person living and working down town, 90% of my commute is by e-bike. Bike lanes are a need for safe commuting. Lets make Toronto a safe, clean, healthy and a friendly place, with great bike infrastructure. Work with your communities not against them, why destroy what is already there and works?

        "comment": "As an Ontarian who cannot afford a car, I find it disappointing and upsetting that the current government is prioritizing the use of cars in urban areas purely in order to \"reduce gridlock\" and \"save time\" for motorists. Having safe, convenient, and affordable ways to move through the city - on foot, by bike, or on public transit - would be a much better solution to these problems that wouldn't incentivize car ownership as the expensive yet necessary cost of travel within the province.\nI encourage the Ontario government to consider a new plan that shows more care for those who are unable to drive, whether due to financial or health reasons. The roads are safer with fewer cars and better drivers, so punishing people who would choose safer alternatives (such as cycling or public transit) is only going to make city streets more dangerous and congested. Motorists are a serious threat to themselves and everyone around them, so they should be treated as such and kept away from pedestrians and cyclists, not given more leeway to drive faster and more recklessly.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nA concerned Ontario citizen\n"

They run red lights all the time, always take for granted vehicle drivers ensure their safety but the problem is they do NOT follow traffic regulations.  They play victims.  But then at the same time they harass pedestrians so everyone walking on the streets are \"expected\" to give them the way, they believe.  They simply expect everyone watch for them and give them their way.  They don't follow rules and are the most dangerous in creating accidents but always blame on car drivers.  They should all be BANNED from the streets and roads.  Period.   Bike lanes are not making the city green.  They are making the city RED - accidents, blood and death.

I have also seen zero negative impact on my business which is situated on Bloor Street at Royal York. Removing these lanes without proper assessment of their impact and at a cost to the Ontario tax payer is a short-sighted and obvious political move. One only has to look at cities like Montreal, Amsterdam and London to see that including bike lanes in the city plan makes for a vibrant and equitable city not one focused on cars as the only solution to mobility.\n"
