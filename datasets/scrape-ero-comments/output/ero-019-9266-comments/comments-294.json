        "comment": "Bike lanes in cities are a matter of life and death.\nBike lanes provide a dedicated space for people to ride bikes in safety (including children) \u2014 out of the way of vehicular traffic. Without bike lanes, cyclists must take the lane to protect their safety, which will drastically slow car traffic across the city. Bike lanes can often reduce traffic congestion, which is in fact caused by the volume of cars on the road and not by bike lanes.\nBike lanes make streets safer for all residents, not just cyclists.\nBike lanes are good for business, especially on main streets.\nAs Premier Ford said himself in 2017, \"One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe. You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was.\"\nBesides this serious life safety issue, bike lanes have been proven to be good for business.\nBike lanes save lives.\nRemoving bike lanes will be blood on Doug Ford's hands.\n"

I regularly use it and it is always faster than when I used a car pre-covid on these roads.\nPlease don't do the Alberta move - reduce public transit frequency and then claim people dont use public transit, and then reduce it further.\nBike lanes allow more throughput - Force people to use bikes, subways, and walk, and reserve cars for the ones who truly need it. Add congestion charge for cars.\n"

        "comment": "This is the stupidest, most uninformed bill I have ever read. Ontario is not facing a highway issue. It\u2019s facing a transportation issue, and highways are by far the most the most efficient and expensive way to move PEOPLE. Our goal shouldn\u2019t be to move drivers, our goal should be to move PEOPLE. The best way to do that is mass transit and bike lanes within cities. Cities around the world, like Paris, Montreal, and Seville show us the massive positive impact of a good bike network. All these cities have bike lanes on major roads because that\u2019s where destinations are. If anything, these roads should have as few cars as possible, not more. On any given day, Line 2 (the subway) under Bloor moves far more people in a far more eco friendly way than a useless car lane that would get clogged with illegal parking anyway. If we cared about getting people out of gridlock, we\u2019d be upgrading the subway. Removing bike lanes will worsen traffic, increase pollution, reduce health, increase healthcare costs, and KILL PEOPLE.\nNo scientific, environmental or economic study in any part of the world, including those conducted in Toronto, have ever indicated that bike lanes are a net negative to society and traffic. The science is in. We need more bike lanes on more major roads, not fewer. Anyone who cannot understand this uncontested fact clearly has ulterior motives that are not in the best interest of our province. This bill is taking us backwards.\n"

        "comment": "If we're talking about investing money from the provincial budget I to making commuting better in Toronto, removing/restructuring existing street is a waste. Investing the money into TTC to make transit more accessible would be a better use of tax payer dollars.\nAny future endeavors should be advised to the city, which the people who live here elected an official invested in our best interest.\nThe provincial government should be looking to expand its views and monetary ability to other regions in the province.\nContinuing to only invest in the GTA will only exasperate the existing issues.\n"

        "comment": "I literally beg the Ford government to reconsider proposed removal of bike lanes in Toronto.  They have a vital role in my family\u2019s safe commute and have substantially improved the quality of our lives. It has made our neighborhood safer and created less congestion giving us a safe alternative to driving. It has also had a positive health impact in our lives. The Bloor bike lane has been the number one positive development in our neighborhood over the recent years. Please do not remove this vital part of our lives.\n"

        "comment": "I have never provided feedback for provincial legislation before but this proposal is simply too asinine to ignore. Even if you believe that bike lanes are in the way of cars, or that we should have a better process for choosing roads for bike lanes and designing bike lanes, just blindly removing a few bike lanes you don't like before creating a review process is just\u2026stupid.\nToronto (the obvious target of this proposal) already has a pretty intensive process for designing bike lanes, and public consultation. If you think there are issues with that, you should require them to change the process. Not establish an entire secondary repetitive process of review and bureaucracy. It makes no sense whatsoever, regardless of your opinion of bike lanes.\nOf course, you know as well as I that the only solution to traffic is viable alternatives to driving, but perhaps this truth is hopeless in the face of wedge issue politics. At the very least, maybe focus on buying back the 407 before kicking this hornets nest.\n"

        "comment": "Hi Dougie,\nI hope you actually speak to a transportation planner and realize that reducing single-occupancy vehicles (ie- people driving by themselves) is the main cause of traffic congestion. How about instead of wasting your time on measly municipal matters, you focus on improving important provincial issues, like the sorry excuses we have for our healthcare and public education systems. Or, how about you get those sad sacks at Metrolinks to do their jobs! We are sick and tired of waiting for the Eglington Crosstown to open! Or, how about getting Go trains back to running at pre-pandemic schedules? That'll actually get a whole bunch of people moving while also not clogging up our highways! Keep your mitts off our downtown bike lanes!\nFocus on provincial matters Doug! You aren't the mayor of Toronto.\nPS: You can't buy my vote.\nSincerely,\nA Downtown Toronto Resident in M5V 3Y3.\n"

        "comment": "This is a municipal issue and should be left to the municipal government to determine if bike lanes should be kept or dismantled. Overall, I\u2019m strongly opposed that the provincial government is attempting to intervene on an issue that is not in its jurisdiction. Furthermore, this is a waste of time and tax payer money.\n"

        "comment": "The bill and the conjoined plans to remove bike lanes on University are foolish and shortsighted. The bill reads as a way to have the appearance of doing something about traffic, when in fact the two things that will help traffic most are the opening of the Ontario Line and finishing construction projects that have shut down the streets.\nI recently moved to a place on University Ave, and when I walk down University into work every morning, I see that a lane could be added without removing any bike lanes by removing the on street parking. This would also make driving more efficient since there would no longer be any need to wait while someone parallel parks.\nRemoving on street parking on other streets such as Dundas would also go a long ways towards making traffic flow more efficient, and would do more for the City than removing bike lanes would.\n"
