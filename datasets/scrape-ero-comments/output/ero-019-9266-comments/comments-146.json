        "comment": "Bill 212 is a complete overreach by the Province and quite absurd of a request for time saving. Removal of bike lanes, won't actually reduce the time it takes to commute throughout Toronto but instead will put more Toronto lives at risk.\nAs someone who was struck by a car on a street without bike lanes, I wish there were MORE bike lanes in the city streets. The bike lanes allow for folks to feel safe, secure and not worry about additional careless actions by car drivers in the city. in 2019, 44% of Toronto dwellers rode bicycles throughout the city for every day function, in the year folllowing this has increased. So the safety of civilians, bikers alike should also increase. Too many people in Toronto have died due to lack of bike lanes, removing this would only increase this number. Luckily, I did not die from being struck by the car but I could have. However if it was street with bike lanes, there's a chance that collision may have never occurred.\nIf you want a way to reduce the time it takes to commute through the city, it would be for a better transit system with more routes, subway lines, streetcars, buses, or alternatively faster construction that delays the drive through the city.\nPROTECT BIKE LANES AND PROTECT CYCLISTS.\n"

I do not think that this is a good way to spend public money, especially since it will not substantially reduce driving times.\nI also think that providing EAA exemptions for the 413 serves the province. We should respect proper protocols and ensure that our infrastructure projects are built according to clear guidelines.\nThis bill is a poor piece of legislation and I expect better of the Ontario Conservatives. I urge them to rethink this bill which will only divide our province waste taxpayer money.\n"

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing regarding the proposed framework requiring provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment The EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\nUrban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\nAir quality at street level where people walk and bike\nNoise levels that affect mental and physical health\nSafe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\nAccess to sustainable transportation options\nStreet-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\nOverall quality of life in our communities\nBike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\nCreating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\nReducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\nDecreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\nEnabling active transportation that improves public health\nBuilding more livable, human-scaled urban environments\nSupporting sustainable urban development patterns\nProviding equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\nContradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals Your SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\nContradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\nCreates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\nPrioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\nUndermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\nContradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\nPlaces an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\nEnvironmental Assessment Concerns While the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n\"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n\"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\nAir quality impacts\nStormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\nOil and gasoline leaks\nTire particles and microplastics\nBrake dust and heavy metals\nRoad salt and de-icing chemicals\nSediment and debris\nThe cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\nThe relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\nClimate Change Obligations Your SEV specifically commits to:\n\"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n\"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n\"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\" The proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nEvidence-Based Decision Making The proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\nIgnores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\nCreates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\nOnly bike lanes must be justified with data\nNo similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\nMunicipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\nThe default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\nOverlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\nReduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\nSignificantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\nCardiovascular disease\nSleep disturbance\nCognitive impairment in children\nMental health impacts\nReduced property values\nImproved public health outcomes through active transportation\nEnhanced road safety for all users\nEconomic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\nIncreased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\nHigher property values on calmer, more livable streets\nReduced road maintenance costs\nGreater neighborhood desirability\nMore equitable transportation access\nMunicipal Planning Integration Your SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\nUndermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\nCreates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\nMay discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\nCould delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\nRevise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\nEnvironmental benefits (both natural and urban)\nPublic health impacts\nSafety improvements\nEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\nAccessibility enhancements\nClimate change mitigation potential\nIntegration with existing transportation networks\nEnsure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\nReflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\nConsider both immediate and long-term impacts\nAccount for municipal transportation master plans\nInclude environmental and health metrics\nSupport the achievement of provincial climate targets\nRecognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\nModify the data collection requirements to:\nInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\nConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\nAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\nMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\nEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\n--\nhttps://www.cycleto.ca/an_update_on_bike_share\n"

        "comment": "As a long time resident of Ontario, I live and work in downtown Toronto. I have chosen not to own a car, but rather take advantage of the intermodel options that exist. In any given week, I walk, ride my bike, use the TTC, use the UP Express for travel to the airport, use Uber, and on occasion, use a carshare program for bigger outings.\nHowever, my preference is to use my bike as much as possible. As someone who is in my late 40s, riding my bike throughout the city is an amazing way to remain active, do my part for the environment, as well as getting around reasonably quickly. I travel large distances across the city to run errands, get to work, visit friends, grocery shop, go to appointments and to socialize and explore the city.\nAs someone who has also traveled to many cities in the world, the best cities are always the ones with robust public transit and great biking infrastructure. These create vibrant cities that are accessible to citizens and visitors alike, and also are more affordable.\nI want to go on the record that having options is important to the diverse set of citizens and visitors to our cities and province, but equally important is having safe options.\nThe City of Toronto has made significant strides in the past 10 years to create a more connected and safe cycling infrastructure for its citizens and visitors. This has been crucial has the city grows, and also sees more people visiting. More highways and lanes of traffic are not the solution, as study after study shows that they quickly fill up and gridlock ensues. We need more, better and safer options across the breadth of transportation infrastructure.\nFor the province to interfere with the well considered and studied plans of the city is not acceptable. Leave the City of Toronto to study, design and deliver on the infrastructure needs of its citizens and on behalf of its visitors. That includes not meddling in the important work of building out and improving safer cycling infrastructure, which also improves the safety of all road users as well as pedestrians.\n"

Investing in bike lanes bring economic and public health value, as shown in one study in NYC.\nThis bill will accomplish the exact opposite of its original purpose. It's a waste of taxpayer money for a jurisdiction which does not fall under Ontario's mandate anyway.

This is unnecessary red tape that I believe will slow the approval of future road construction within municipalities and in turn could slow the construction of new residential, commercial or industry areas. The mountain of paper work and approvals needed to build any new infrastructure in Ontario is already too large, I do not see a need to add to it.\nAdditionally, the province has failed to provide evidence that reducing the number of bicycle lanes or adding one lane of traffic will reduce gridlock in any municipality. Why is province proposing additional red tape to municipal projects, when it is not known if removing bicycle lanes or adding a lane of traffic will reduce gridlock?\n"

        "comment": "I'm submitting a comment about the provincial government's proposal regarding bike lanes. I disagree with the proposal for many reasons.\nThe proposal is inherently pro vehicle and that stated purpose is \"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\". The government's purpose should be to get people (not cars or drivers) where they need to get to faster AND safer. Excluding consideration for another important method of transportation is a transparent political move by the government to cater to the elite.\nThere are issues that are unique to Toronto regarding cycling that the municipal government is best suited to deal with. In particular, less people have cars and therefore more people bike as a form of transportation. There is no need for the provincial government to be inserting itself into something that is very clearly a local and municipal issue that should be dealt with my local government's in a better position to understand local needs.\nIn addition, if the government is going to discourage cycling and encourage the use of vehicles, it should be conducting environmental studies on the impact of these types of decisions that will reduce bike lanes, reduce the number of people biking and increase the use of cars. It should be encouraging, not discouraging cycling, which causes zero emissions and is better for the environment.\nThe bike lanes make commuting safer for everyone, including drivers of vehicles. Not all roadways/routes have bike lanes. Bike lanes are limited already, but they provide cyclist with at least some options to be able to get from point A to B with some protection.\nThe reality is that cyclist will continue to be on the road and will take up a lane of traffic. The only difference is that now cyclists won't be protected and will be putting themselves and others in danger.\nFinally, the provincial government should be collecting data on what is causing congestion before inserting itself into municipal politics. The increased level of construction on major highway and roadways, along with population growth for an area like the GTA, are clearly the real reasons for increased traffic and congestion. As someone who  has lived in Toronto my entire life, traffic has been getting worse for many  years, and long before the increased installation of bike lanes. Reducing bike lanes will not \"get drivers where they need to go faster\".\n"

The beauty of our landscapes shapes my daily choices; I select my commute based on the scenery and choose my home for its natural surroundings. Compromising our province's bike lanes would jeopardize the very qualities that make Ontario so special to me. It would not only increase emissions that threaten our environment but also eliminate a vital commuting option for myself and my children as we navigate our daily lives.\nOur bike lanes are a testament to our commitment to sustainability and community well-being. Cities like Amsterdam are celebrated not just for their charm, but for their pedestrian-friendly infrastructure that fosters a vibrant, connected community. By dismantling bike lanes, we take a significant step backward, undermining the progress we\u2019ve made in creating accessible and livable urban spaces.\nOntario is about more than just business and consumerism; it\u2019s a region rich in natural beauty and cultural significance, with lands that hold deep meaning for many communities. We have the potential to not only feed the world but also to nurture a diverse array of wildlife. We should champion initiatives that enhance our connection to this land and celebrate its beauty, rather than yielding to the interests of car manufacturers and oil refiners.\nThis land belongs to us, and we have a responsibility to protect and honor it. Let's invest in our bike lanes and the environment they represent, ensuring that future generations can experience the same wonder and pride in Ontario that we do today.\n"

When physical activity is part of my commute, I feel more energetic when I get to work and more healthy.\nI specifically plan my routes to use streets with bike lanes. Even with bike lanes, I have had scary interactions with cars. Without this protection, commuting by bike would be much more dangerous.\nIf I did not commute by bike, I would probably drive. Not only would this increase road congestion and vehicle emissions which is worse for the environment, it would also lead to more wear-and-tear to roads. This would lead to requiring more frequent maintenance and more road closures.\nFrom a policy perspective, it is abundantly clear that promoting bike lanes and improving public transit leads to a greener, healthier city with less car congestion. I have included a link below with a document from the WHO on the personal and climate health benefits of cycling. This is a layperson article, but there are countless more technical papers outlining the personal and climate benefits of cycling. The evidence is indisputable. From a personal perspective, my physical and mental health would decline if bike lanes in Toronto were closed or reduced.\n"

I am a nurse at a hospital in the city.\nAs a driver in the city, my routes to work, recreation, and errands are frequently made more difficult by parked cars on major roads. For example, I frequently drive on Bayview and Mt Pleasant. These roads are one lane each direction in many spots due to parked cars. Cars have to merge back and forth, or stay in one lane causing lengthy traffic. Alternatively, I take side roads, where I often feel that I\u2019m creating unsafe conditions with lots of pedestrians and other road users.\nAs a cyclist, I have been commuting by bike far less than I used to because my life is at risk. Frequently vehicle drivers pass within half a foot of me, drive erratically by swerving around me to scare me, or honking and yelling. I am a strong cyclist, and I\u2019m not cycling slowly. I keep to the side of the lane so cars can pass. And yet, I have had many occurrences where my commute to work might result in my death. I also cycle recreationally, again the feeling is my hobby might result in someone killing me due to their negligence or entitlement.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t perfect - again, as a strong cyclist, I\u2019m often faster than many other cyclists and bike lanes make it difficult to pass. However, without bike lanes, and with feeling increasingly unsafe cycling in Toronto, my only option to cycle in the city is to take the lane to provide myself with more space to cycle defensively. My commute to work is cut in half when I cycle. Instead of contributing to traffic in my car, I can quickly get from home to work. All I want is to feel like I\u2019m going to make it there and back safely.\n"
