        "comment": "There is so much wrong with this bill so I'll try to go through as much as I can.\nFirst of all, I live in Ottawa. It feels like major government overreach for Queen's Park to make these types of decisions for my city. Where to add or remove bike lanes should be up to the city, not the province. Many of the proposed removals are in Toronto so far as well. That feels like a complete waste to me that my tax dollars are going to rip up the city of Toronto's biking infrastructure as well. That should be up to them.\nIt has been proven many times over that adding more car lanes only reduces congestion for around 6 months at best. This is a term called \"induced demand\" The gist of it is that initially, the regular users of the roadway get more space but as more people start using the roadway due to reduced traffic, it ends up getting congested again. Look no further than the 401. It's somewhere near 18 lanes at its widest point yet it still has a traffic problem.  This also happens in many American cities like Houston and Los Angeles.\nAnother point I would like to make is that bike lanes actually help traffic by taking more cars off the road. It gives people who may not even want to drive more options to get around. I live in a suburb with really poor cycling infrastructure and a lack of anything close unless you drive a car. To get to my nearest grocery store by bike, it takes me near 30 minutes. If there were any stores within 10-15 minutes by bike, I would choose the bike every single time over my car. Cars take up more room on the road than bikes too. The best way to reduce traffic is to get people out of cars and give them viable alternatives like better public transport and cycling. Look at European cities like Amsterdam or Copenhagen or even all the way in Tokyo. Less people drive in those places because their alternatives are so much better than ours here in Ontario. Even look at how quickly Montreal has embraced bikes.\nRemoving the lanes will make it more dangerous for cyclists. Without protected lanes especially, many cyclists will still be on the road. Moving them to side streets won\u2019t always be an alternative like the bill proposes. Now their chances of getting hit my a car will be significantly increased. If you follow hockey, you have heard of the death of Johnny Gaudreau. He was hit and killed by a drunk driver while riding his bike on the side of the road. Had there been a protected lane, he would not have been in that situation in the first place. Now, all those cyclist who currently use protected lanes across Ontario will be more at risk of a similar fate.\nFor a government that prides itself on removing red tape and \"getting things moving\", this sure adds a lot more red tape and slows decision making down. You have lost my support and confidence. I'll leave a few links and videos below that support my claims and i strongly urge to look at them and scrap this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I'm not a cyclist.\nThis bill is completely counterproductive for downtown areas. Bike lanes improve traffic for motorists by keeping cyclists away from cars.\nIf bike lanes from downtown streets are removed, a large number of cyclists will be cycling directly on the road and taking up the ENTIRE right lane (as they are legally allowed to do). Think of all the cyclists that will now be directly on the road impeding traffic, slowing down cars, preventing right turns, etc.. This will make traffic for motorists a lot worse, not better.\nEven worse, some of these cyclists will now decide it's unsafe to bike and decide to drive instead, that will just add more cars to the road and make traffic even more congested.\nBefore this Bill goes forward, I ask that a thorough and independent scan of other jurisdictions be completed to determine how removing bike lanes have affected congestion in other downtown areas. Publish the results and then let the people decide.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with this bill to remove the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to add transportation options. I live around these streets and find the bike lanes to be frequently used and they make the streets more welcoming and nice to walk down. Adding more lanes would just encourage more people to drive which would just make traffic worse, never-mind the environmental and safety issues. The solution to traffic problems in the city is not more car lanes, but viable alternatives to driving and taking out these bike lanes would be many steps in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, just as I want pedestrians to stay on the sidewalks, rather than be in the road, I want cyclists to be in the bike paths/lanes, rather than mixing with the rest of the cars. Having good bike infrastructure speeds up traffic for both cyclists and cars. I also enjoy biking, and would do it far more often if the bike network were more complete and safe. Why is the Government of Ontario trying to set up this red tape that prevents the cities from deciding what is best for them on a local level?\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill. Cities must be allowed to make cycling infrastructure a priority. Cycling must be a viable choice of transportation for the public, and without proper infrastructure, cycling can be extremely dangerous.\nIt is vital that we reduce the number of cars on the road, and there is no better way of achieving this than making bikes a more viable choice. Most trips taken by car are under 3km. There's no reason those trips couldn't be done by bike.\nRemoving bike infrastructure puts more cars on the road, and increases traffic. For the folks who still decide to travel by bike, reduced infrastructure greatly increases their risk of fatal accidents.\nThis bill would result in people dying, and all for the hope that drivers might save 1 or 2 minutes driving time\n"

        "comment": "Please rename this bill to be factual. This is the \u201cIncreasing Gridlock and Making Commutes Longer at your Tax Dollar Expense\u201d bill.\nIf you are a driver, give a nod to a bike lane near you. They are reducing the number of cars on the roads so that there are less cars stopping you from getting where you want to go.\nIf you are a local business owner, give a nod to a bike lane near you. They are encouraging foot traffic to your business.\nBike lanes keep Ontarians safe, and provide an affordable means of travel for those of us who cannot or do not want to pay for a car. As a young professional who has been saving to buy a house for 7 years, not owning a car has allowed me to save more each year and get closer to my goal. While I am still years away, expensive car payments would have made it nearly impossible. In the affordability crisis that we are in, providing Ontarians with safe and affordable transit options is critical.\nThis bill works AGAINST an affordable and livable Ontario. I hope the premier will reconsider this horrible plan than benefits no one.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes, or not allowing them to be build in the first place harms everyone. When there is more space for more cars on the road, more people will drive and within a short amount of time, it will be just as congested as previously. Cars are the congestion problem, so when you give people other safe options, some will choose to not drive, and that actually helps reduce congestion. But if it is not safe & people do not feel comfortable biking, then less will. By removing bike lanes you will end up being responsible for more vulnerable road user deaths, whether it be pedestrians or cyclists. There will be more pollution, due to the increase in traffic. There will be less Children walking or biking to school, which makes them less independent & less active. Please don\u2019t move forward with this, it will end up harming so many, including car users, but most especially those made vulnerable through this decision.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI am a resident of Toronto and a healthcare worker at the UHN. The biking infrastructure that has been established on Yonge, Bloor, and University have been essential to making me feel comfortable to using my bike and the bike share service to run errands, go to work, and patronize stores on those streets. Because they are such an efficiency way to get around on bicycle, I am inclined to not use my car, as biking is often faster and now safe. Without these bike lanes, I would simply return to using my car, clogging up the street of Toronto. This causes more congestion and pollution in our city.\nPlease reconsider this move to remove such amazing biking infrastructure. We shouldn't be aiming to increase the capacity for cars on our road, especially with subway lines beneath these major roads and biking infrastructure that is now usable 12 months of the year.\nThank you,\nSimon\n"

        "comment": "This is a brutally short-sighted and regressive move that ignorantly prioritizes outdated modes of transportation over sustainable, efficient, and healthy alternatives. By dismantling existing bike lanes and restricting the development of new ones, the government is not only undermining the health and well-being of Ontarians but also hindering the province's ability to address climate change and reduce traffic congestion.\nBike lanes promote active transportation, reducing reliance on cars and improving air quality. They also contribute to a more livable and equitable city. This proposal is a clear attack on urban planning principles and a disregard for the needs of cyclists and pedestrians. It's time for the government to invest in sustainable infrastructure and support initiatives that promote a greener and healthier future.\nThis doesn't even touch on the harm to local businesses, who never benefit from bumper to bumper traffic on front of their doors, no matter the number of lanes. The provincial obsession with cars is frankly obscene.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently oppose this proposal. Cycling infrastructure, even if it removes a lane of traffic or some parking, enhances vehicle flow by reducing the risk of collision or forcing mixed use of a lane. It encourages more people to cycle instead of driving, reduces the number of cars, and, as demonstrated worldwide, creates a better city atmosphere, increasing property values and making a city more livable.\nThis proposal should not look to make traveling by car \"faster\" but instead seek ways to reduce the number of cars on roads by encouraging other forms of transportation.\nPS. Ford government says it's against government bloat, but proposes additional bureaucracy for municipalities to make improvements for their citizens.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will not fulfill its objectives and reduce gridlock or save me any time. The 413 Highway is not a good investment and Doug Ford's approach to pushing this through without appropriate assessments or justification is bad for Ontario. Doug Ford is increasing red tape and taking away municipalities' ability to govern, especially over things for which they are the most appropriate to decide. Bike lane infrastructure should be governed by the people elected by the people directly effected and the politicians that live and work in the area that will be impacted. Doug Ford's provincial government should not be dictating to all cities and towns in Ontario. Toronto rejected Doug Ford as a mayoral candidate, we do not want him dictating municipal responsibilities, he should not be introducing provincial legislation to take away bike lanes that the City of Toronto has planned and built, it is a waste of money for ALL residents of Ontario to pay for the removal of significant infrastructure and it waste's Toronto residents taxes which were already used to build this infrastructure which will be ripped out by a government that refuses to consider the studies that show that biking infrastructure reduces congestion. Just because Doug Ford wants to drive it should not make travel for everyone else worse.\n"
