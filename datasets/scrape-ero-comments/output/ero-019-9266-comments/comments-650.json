        "comment": "The bike lanes on Yonge and Bloor did not replace a lane of traffic. Lane capacity is determined at intersections, where these roads open up to two lanes per direction - typically one through lane and one turning lane. The previous four-lane arterial setup can be observed today on roads such as Dupont, Bathurst, and Dufferin, where the same thing happens. The bike lanes have not had as much of an impact on roadway capacity on these routes as some might suggest, and this can be observed in the city of toronto road traffic data. There are also stretches of bloor that see more bike traffic than car, so the idea that bike lanes are only used by a select few is also ridiculous.\nIt is also important to note that if these bike lanes are removed, cyclists will continue to use these routes, but will occupy a lane of vehicle traffic instead of the bike lane. This is needlessly dangerous for all parties involved, and will just cause further chaos with drivers being stuck behind bikes.\nAll in all, these changes are a bad idea. Drivers on yonge have the option of parallel routes on avenue road and mount pleasant. Drivers on bloor have parallel routes on dupont to the north and queensway, lake shore, or Gardiner to the south. Although I will concede that continuing the bike lanes south on yonge would have made more sense than university Ave.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is dangerous, expensive, and foolish. It will kill cyclists like me. It is a waste of taxpayer money to take out bike lanes that were just put in- and believe me, as soon as they are gone the community will fight until they are put back in. And it is well documented that adding lanes does not solve the problem of traffic- public transportation does.\n"

        "comment": "This project goes against trying to reduce gridlock. It also goes against climate change initiatives. It goes against encouraging people to be more active. It goes against the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and drivers.\nIt\u2019s not cost effective since the lanes have been built in recent years and it will be very expensive to remove. Any removal will contribute to interfere with traffic which is counter to the idea of reducing gridlock.\nThis is just a political move by the government to divide people on an issue where people should be uniting for: encourage public transport, encourage diminishing gas emissions by decreasing car traffic, encourage healthy and safe exercise by cycling in the city. Removing these bike lanes will have 0 impact. It may actually embolden more drivers to take to the roads. All this is counterproductive. Every major city in the world from Paris to New York City is developing their bike lanes and decreasing car presence. Think of air pollution and our health. Think forward not backwards.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Katerina Downard,\nI am writing to provide feedback on the proposed framework under Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, as outlined in ERO 019-9266. As both a driver and cyclist, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and dangers present on our roads and wish to highlight the critical role dedicated bike lanes play in ensuring safety and encouraging sustainable transportation.\nWhile I understand the frustrations faced by drivers navigating traffic, I have observed many instances where vehicles dangerously zigzag through traffic or parked cars to bypass bicycles, buses or streetcars. These behaviors create unsafe conditions for all road users, particularly cyclists and pedestrians, who lack the protection offered by a vehicle.\nDedicated bike lanes provide cyclists with a much-needed sense of safety, allowing them to travel without the constant threat posed by reckless driving. Moreover, in my experience, streets that are reduced to a single lane often encourage drivers to behave more responsibly, as they must follow the natural flow of traffic, minimizing opportunities for erratic maneuvers that endanger those around them.\nOur city is growing rapidly, and this growth will only continue. It is crucial that we plan for a future that prioritizes alternative modes of transportation, reducing dependency on personal vehicles. Maintaining and enhancing bike lanes is a vital step in this direction. Removing these lanes would not only jeopardize the safety of citizens but also undermine efforts to promote sustainable urban mobility.\nAdditionally, significant public funds have already been invested in the planning, installation, and maintenance of these bike lanes. Removing them would not only waste this expenditure but could also lead to additional costs associated with their removal and potential future reinstatement if demand for active transportation infrastructure grows\u2014as it likely will given current urban trends. It is fiscally responsible to preserve these existing lanes to maximize their long-term value and utility.\nI strongly urge the Ministry to reconsider the removal of existing bike lanes and instead focus on solutions that balance the needs of all road users while ensuring public safety, environmental sustainability, and financial prudence.\nThank you for considering my perspective. I trust this feedback will contribute to a well-rounded discussion on this important matter.\nSincerely,\nConcerned citizen - driver and cyclist\n"

        "comment": "I use the bloor bike lanes daily for a 14km commute to save time and take my car off the road. I stop at businesses every day along my route because it is easy to do so and park and lock my bike.\nYour proposition would endanger my safety, remove my business from local shops, add to my commute time and create more gridlock by adding my car back onto the road. All things that your bill purports to save me from actually does the opposite.\nI live and work in Toronto and riding my bike in a safe bike lane has added to my quality of life. Please do not remove them.\n"

        "comment": "I think it would be a massive waste of time and resources with no gain.\nThe city needs more bike lanes not fewer. If we had a more substantial and fully interconnected bike infrastructure I'm sure even more people would bike which would in turn reduce congestion from getting even more people off the road while also encouraging better health and safer streets. Where do you think the bikers are gonna go when removing these bike lanes? On the street in front of the cars! Slowing everyone down and putting all the bikers in a significantly increased amount of danger from motorists.\nWith more car lanes come more motorists wanting to use said car lanes, therefore resulting in a non-scalable losing battle. Versus bike and transit infrastructure which both let many more people to get around and not bottleneck the city.\nAnd if anything's really causing gridlock on these streets it would be the parked cars, not the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 48 year old mom, and my daughter is 10.  I grew up biking as a young adult  in Toronto, before the bike lanes on Bloor existed.  Back then, there was a lot of chaos and it was quite dangerous for cyclists, and cars, because the bikes had no were to go.  I know several cyclists who were hit by cars when riding.   I have been grazed by a car on Bloor street.  There was also a lot of hostility directed towards me as a woman cyclist, mostly men from cars yelling at me and driving agressively.  I have also seen male cyclists yell agressively at female drivers who mistakenly cut them off. All these incidents happenned on streets where there were no bike lanes.  Bike lanes on Bloor and other main streets have been key to increasing safety for all commuters, especially women and women of colour, who receive a lot of verbal agressiion from men in public society.\nWhen my child started riding her bike about 6 years ago, I was so releived to have her grow up in a time where I know she would be safer as a teen, navigating the city on a bike since there is a bike lane from Runnymede to Yonge steet.  We live near symington, where there's a big dip under the bridge that passes over Bloor just east of Dundas west by the UP station.  This is a praticularly dangerous passage for bikes.  I would not have taught her how to ride on public streets if there were no bike lanes and this would have had a major impact on how we travel as a family and her ability to develop cycling skills, an important form of independance for her as a teen and young woman.  I also know families with boys we want all young people to be safe as they begin to explore the city as independent young adults.\nBike lanes are essential in big cities, and they keep everyone safer.\n"

Another condo on Bloor E. is under construction. Bloor street is a main road in Mississauga which already has a lot of vehicle traffic. Vehicle Traffic will  increase as people occupy these new condos. For safety build bike lanes which share space with pedestrians in Mississauga and Toronto.\n"

Bike lanes are an efficient addition to the traffic flow and are used by many residents for work and /or recreational purposes.  My son uses these bike lanes to bike to work from Jane and Dundas to Bayview and Eglinton daily.\nBikes have a calming effect on the traffic on these roads and therefore increase the safety of those using them.\nRemoving the bike lanes would not have a significant positive impact on traffic flow but would result in an increase in the number and speed of the cars on those roads.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not a solution to the problem of increasing traffic congestion. The solution for a more equitable city and clean air city is to keep the bike lanes in Toronto. Almost every single one of my coworkers bikes to work using Bloor Street. It would be impossible to bike on such a busy street without a bike lane, leading to more cars on the street and more pollution. Every single city biker in a car? Even an extra lane can't fix that.\nLet's look into the future, instead of regressing to where we've been and doing what hasn't worked.\n"
