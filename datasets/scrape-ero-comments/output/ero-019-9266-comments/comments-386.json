        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which introduces unnecessary provincial oversight on local transportation infrastructure.\nThis bill undermines local governments' ability to create effective transportation options.\nAs a regular cyclist, I depend on bike lanes for safe, efficient travel.\nPrioritizing safety should take precedence over maximizing vehicle capacity on roads, especially when bike lanes can prevent accidents and save lives.\nWell-designed bike lanes benefit drivers, as they keep cyclists in dedicated lanes and out of the way of traffic. When I drive, I feel much safer knowing cyclists have their own space.\nBike lanes also play a vital role in supporting public transit, as they make it easier for residents to reach transit stations.\nLimiting bike lane projects ultimately hinders transit effectiveness and overlooks the importance of creating viable alternatives to driving.\nTo genuinely address traffic issues, we should be expanding\u2014not restricting\u2014safe, accessible transportation options.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government shouldn't be so intrusive in municipal politics. They did not accurately survey the residents of the regions they hope to remove bike lanes for. I have used the Bloor street and Yonge bike lines to get to work regularly when the weather has permitted it. The Yonge bike lane north of Bloor is a necessity, despite it disappearing at Eglington. The other streets do not provide good alternatives. Mt. Pleasant is even more dangerous. Without a bike lane, I am forced into car traffic which puts myself and drivers in danger.\n"

        "comment": "I severely disagree with the proposal by the Ford government to remove bike lanes. As someone who both bikes and drives in the city, I find that the bike lanes improve road usage for both groups. In the absence of these bikes lanes, bikers will still use the road, although it will be much more dangerous and difficult for both bikers and drivers. From the perspective of drivers, the bike lanes make driving easier because it ensures that they don't have to maneuver around bikers while driving. For bikers, it provides a clear and safe path to their destination. Furthermore, it is unclear whether remove bike lanes would actually limit congestion. Many individuals bike to work or school, instead of using a car. There is thus a case to be made that bike lanes, by promoting alternative forms of transportation, also help reduce congestion.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, the Ford government should invest in projects that actually help reduce congestion, such as improving the TTC. Not only would investment in public transit achieve this end, but it would also support environmental sustainability which the current suggestion does not. In addition to affecting the livability of the city, this proposal would promote car usage at the cost of our environment.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous! Is there a reason other than corruption as to why more money is being spent on removing accessible infrastructure? Removing bike lanes will increase congestion for cars and KILL drivers, bikers, and pedestrians alike with increased collisions. Shame on you Doug Ford and the people who would let this happen.\n"

        "comment": "This is stupid. Bikes transport more people per square meter of road utilization than car lanes. Additionally, these bike lanes do not reduce car lanes on these roads. I use the university bike lane to commute to the hospital for work, removal of this bike lane would either push me into more dangerous situations, where I would block cars from driving by requiring sharing the lane, further slowing down traffic. Alternatively I might choose drive myself if I felt sufficiently unsafe, having an even greater impact on the burden of car traffic along that stretch of road.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a horrendous overreach by the provincial government, why does the provincial govt. decide what cities get to do with their streets? Adding more red tape to providing safe infrastructure for EVERY road user WILL get people injured and killed, due to them not having adequate and safe infrastructure.\nAs both a cyclist and a driver, I would prefer to give cyclists their own dedicated ways and lanes, as opposed to having to wait for a safe time to overtake, because in many cities, there are people (like myself) who will cycle regardless of if there's infrastructure or not.\nThe provincial govt. should not have any authority on how a city manages it's road network, outside of provincially owned highways.\nAs a resident of Ottawa, I say NO to bill 212, and encourage anyone who cares about people on our streets to do the same.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. We need more bike lanes, not fewer. Personal vehicles are incredibly inefficient relative to bicycles. They take up more space, put more wear and tear on our already-crumbling roads, and are harmful to the environment and individual health. This move is short-sighted and not backed by science. It will not have the stated impact on grid lock and will only serve to further endanger cyclists. This is overreach on the part of the province, adding additional, unnecessary bureaucratic interference with city planning. There are very real problems for Ontario to focus on (healthcare and housing for a start). Focus your efforts there. We won't be voting for any supporters of this ridiculous bill.\n"

I cannot afford to drive and, since the new bike lanes were put down during the pandemic, have been biking as my primary mode of transportation all year round. Active transportation has changed my life. In addition to enjoying the exercise, not being beholden to bus schedules has substantially decreased my time in transit, increasing the number of home visits I can do with patients who are not able to make it to hospital for appointments and making it easier to visit and spend time with friends and family. I am deeply concerned about the impact that losing safe and reliable bike lines will have on my ability to live happily and work productively in the city.\n"

Bike path networks are one way to make this easier for millions of Ontario residents. By making it more difficult for people to use bike networks, you are only increasing the use of cars, further clogging up roads and increasing carbon emissions across the province.\nBike lanes are also safer for everyone, and simplify things for drivers. Cyclists cutting into traffic instead of having a dedicated space will absolutely cause collisions.\n"

As a taxpayer, I also see issue with my money being wasted to remove public infrastructure that is completely viable.\n"
