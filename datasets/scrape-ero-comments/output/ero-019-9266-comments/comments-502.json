What i do notice is that I am no longer super stressed about sharing the road with cyclists, and that pedestrians are not in the street as much too (although I am still careful to look out for both).\nI also think it\u2019s not appropriate for the Ontario government to step in on a regional/municipal issue such as cycling lanes. It should be up to the individual local governments, as it is now.\nWould it not be more prudent for the Ontario government to focus on province-wide issues, like improving the healthcare system?\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes not only creates less freedom of choice of transit for the people of Toronto, but it also takes money out of taxpayers pockets. The bike lanes were constructed with these funds and the removal would make the time, money, and energy used to build the lanes redundant. I understand that this is being done to solve traffic congestion issues, however, the current bikers on these paths would still be using the streets which would no longer be safe for them and would most likely continue the traffic congestion.\nPlease reconsider what sorts of events are actually contributing to traffic congestion and do not remove bike infrastructure. This is only a temporary solution to a subject that requires more thought and research as to what would really solve these issues.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a citizen and tax payer of Ontario, residing in Toronto. I am a professional working at multinational company and have mobility, yet choose to live in and pay taxes in this province. I use the Bloor Street bike lane from Lansdowne to Avenue twice a day every day including throughout the winter to visit a gym that I choose to patronize. I also patronize businesses along my route. Cycling is the most efficient, healthiest, and lowest carbon option for me. I also have a personal vehicle which I use to visit family outside of the city on weekends. The most gridlock I witness on my drives is outside of the bike lane network.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes is not based on factual arguments, and will not support any of the acknowledgement statements that the Government used to preface this proposal nor the objective of reducing car travel times.\nThe removal of bike lanes will jeopardize the safety of non-car drivers and at an unnecessary cost, all for negligible societal benefit. Personally, I do not want to have to pass anymore ghost bikes on my rides - there are enough on my route already.\nIf the Government of Ontario insists on playing games like this, I am serious about taking my cards away to another more forward thinking jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "I have only recently started riding my bike in Toronto again as I did when I was younger.  I could leave my car at home because I felt safe on those bike lanes.  Safe bike lanes on main streets take cars off the street, slow traffic speeds which means that fewer people in accidents will be badly hurt or killed and make the city liveable.  They should not be removed, nor should cities need permission to construct them.  Time, energy, and money needs to be spent on cutting ghg emmissions, building health care capacity and building more multi-family coop and supportive housing.\n"

More bike lanes lessens the need for cars on the road and is healthier for our citizens and allows more freedoms of movement because now we have more methods of travel. Frankly, removing bike lanes is backwards thinking and will hurt us all in the long run including drivers. Removing bike lanes is limiting freedoms and making it more dangerous to bike. I will have to move somewhere else if Bills like this get passed\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential component of traffic reduction and road safety. Removing bike lanes will, in the short term, create congestion as a result of construction, and will in the long term, exacerbate traffic as cyclists are converted into drivers. This is a well-studied phenomenon of induced demand. The most effective way to reduce traffic is to invest in subways and safe bike lanes, funneling commuters into more time efficient forms of transit and off of the roads. Bike lanes are also important in preventing catastrophic and often fatal traffic accidents. Cyclist safety is a vital part of a healthy city, and needs to be prioritized to ensure that roads are safe for all and traffic is not exacerbated by accident diversions.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the removal of any bike lanes.  I use these daily on my commute and frequently to run errands or attend meetings with clients.  They are important for me to be able to arrive on time and safely.\nThese bike lanes are important for residents of Toronto to able to circulate quickly and easily within the city.  Separated bike lanes expand the pool of people who can safely and quickly commute in town and are key the reducing friction between motorists and cyclists.  I expect the number of people using these bike lanes to steadily increase as they become aware of their convenience.   They have only been in place for a couple of years which is not enough for people to realize their utility.\nThe lanes such as those on Bloor are of particular importance as they are key connectors in creating a network that can allow cyclists to safely navigate across most of the city.  Absent these connectors the remaining bike lanes would be discontinuous and lose much of their value in day to day commuting and utility.\nThe construction of the bike lanes is the result of much study and discussion between politicians and the community and real investment to time and money by all.\nI think taxpayers money can be put to much better uses than to reverse these positive changes.\n"

        "comment": "I have read the proposed Bill 212 and want to comment on three issues: bicycle safety, traffic gridlock, and municipal jurisdiction.\nSafety:  I am 76, a retiree, and regularly ride my bike in mid-town Toronto to do errands, buy groceries, visit friends, attend medical appointments, etc. The introduction of bike lanes along Yonge St, from Davisville down into the downtown area, made my bike rides FAR safer than in the past, just as the Sherbourne St bike lanes had done previously. I make a point of using the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University Avenue, rather than secondary streets without bike lanes, as they are far safer.\nGridlock: We need to provide the public with efficient transit to avoid traffic congestion, not invite more car traffic by removing bike lanes. That the GTA has crippling, costly traffic congestion is not caused by bike use, but by the lack of adequate public transit.  Regular massive traffic jams on major arteries such as the  DVP's traffic are not the result of bike lanes!\nMunicipal jurisdiction: The province of Ontario has no business dictating bike lane planning to the city of Toronto. This is a totally unwarranted interference in the municipality's planning  and management of road infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "As a road user and tax payer in Ontario that both cycles and drives, I am strongly opposed to the bill, for a few simple reasons.\n* Congestion on the road is caused by too many cars, not too many bikes. There is good evidence that the installation of a comprehensive bike lane network shifts road users from car to bikes - and hence reduces congestion. The Bill ignores all this evidence and good planning practice. Thus, it is very likely that the bill will lead to more congestion, not less.\n* The bill takes planning autonomy away from local communities. Good solutions are best found by the local communities and municipalities, not dictated by a provincial or federal government.\n*  Dictating the removal of already established bike lanes causes more disruption, and costs valuable tax dollars. It is simply financially irresponsible.\n* I agree that better provincial planning guidelines for the integration of car, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure are desirable. The proposed bill, however, abandons best established practice.\n"

        "comment": "Let me state that I am very opposed to this proposal.  Municipal roadways are under municipal control,\nand requiring Provincial oversight on what is a municipal responsibility sets a very dangerous precedent.\nIf providing bike lanes is somehow impacting the provincial environmental targets, then there might be some reason for the province to say that bike lanes have a negative environmental impact.  If that were the case, then there might be some argument made for the province to get involved in implementing bike lanes.  However, bike lanes will only encourage and allow more people to use bikes for travelling around our cities, and will therefore will only have a positive environmental impact.  There is no reason for the province to get involved in bike lane implementations in any municipality.  Blaming bike lanes for traffic congestion is a red herring.  As reported by the Toronto Star (c.f. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/do-cycling-corridors-really-slow-traff\u2026) studies by city staff do not support blaming bike lanes for traffic slowness.  There are similar stories from other cities such as New York and Copenhagen  (e.g. https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319).  Removing bike lanes will not magically fix traffic congestion.  Better traffic flow will, and that is a municipal responsibility.  In addition, the increased safety to cyclists provided by protected bike lanes is not dealt with by this legislation.  Rather than the provincial government spending their limited time meddling in municipal affairs, they should find a more fiscally responsible way to spend the $3 billion dollars being sent to provincial residents as a $200 \"rebate\" for each person.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my fervent opposition to the proposed Bill 212 that would seek to remove and restrict bike lanes across Toronto. It is my belief that this legislation would only serve to increase undue provincial red tape and bureaucracy, harm essential transportation infrastructure, reduce the safety of everyone in our city, and waste taxpayer money on eliminating working infrastructure.\n1. Red tape and bureaucracy: The provincial government shouldn't be wasting it's time and resources in adding more red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. Bike lanes in Toronto are overwhelmingly popular and were a large factor in our mayoral race. The provincial government forcing the removal of bike lanes and making it more odious and difficult to build more is not only wasteful but undemocratic.\n2. Harm essential transportation infrastructure: I bike to work from downtown Toronto to the East-end along the bike lanes that Bill 212 would eliminate almost every day. It is an essential part of my commute and takes pressure off of our already overcrowded roads and public transport. Eliminating these options would force me to take the already crowded TTC or drive through the heavily congested streets. Turning bikers into cars would do nothing to reduce travel times, instead it would likely actually increase gridlock and congestion in the city. Research on travel times within the city has shown how removing options like bike lanes only contribute to more congestion. not only is this proposal undemocratic, it is completely baseless and not supported by science.\n3: Safety: Removing bike lanes would only decrease the safety in the city. One of the big reasons bike lanes have been pushed was in direct response to the deaths of cyclists in the city. Removing them seem only to signal that the Ford government has no care for the lives of his constituents. Bike lanes provide more safety to the city not just by protecting cyclists, but also drivers. Cars are much more likely to get into more serious accidents if they don't notice or have to avoid bikers on the streets as opposed to in their own designated lanes, and pedestrians are safer when there are less cars in the city. As a cyclist I've been hit by cars and broken bones due to bad drivers and insufficient bike lanes and the proposed bill would only increase the risk to people like me. Increasing, not eliminating, bike lanes in the city leads to a better city for cars, bikers, and pedestrians alike. The Ford governments proposal to eliminate them seem to show a callousness for the lives of the people in Toronto if it would mean a couple seconds shaved off his commute.\n4. Waste taxpayer money: Much of the bike lanes that are in Toronto would have to be ripped out based on the proposed bill. This is popular, working infrastructure that would have to be removed for no good reason. Removing bike lanes would cost taxpayers money, and increase travel times in the city while construction is taking place, all to remove infrastructure that is already present and popular in the city. I don't want the province wasting my money on spiteful projects that directly harm me!\nI want to see more bike lanes built, not less! I want to see it become easier to build them around the city, not harder! I want the decision about transportation infrastructure to be decided by the people in Toronto, not the province of Ontario!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill as its premise is flawed. Bike lanes form the basis of efficient, reliable, equitable, and ecological transportation in Toronto. They are critical not just for cyclists, but for wheelchair and assisted mobility vehicle users with diverse needs. Given its rapidly increasing population and its high population density, it is a basic geometric fact that there is insufficient space for a majority of its citizens to drive and store their personal cars in the city.\nThe installation of bike lanes is already done after substantial transportation planning and modelling, and study results after their installation almost never supports the idea that they worsen adjacent car traffic. The phenomenon of induced demand has been well-studied over decades, and the idea that bike lanes cause gridlock has been disproved in dozens of studies worldwide. Instead, there is substantial evidence that bike lanes in urban areas either do not affect or can slightly alleviate vehicle traffic due to their efficiency and the reduced potential for conflicts with other road users.\nThis bill is not only ignorant of these facts, but fails to grasp the irony that its framework is likely to result in the opposite effect - increased congestion, longer travel times, and greater traffic injuries.\nOn top of this is the concerning overreach of provincial oversight into city planning and development. Cities in Ontario have the most informed data on their local infrastructure and the most active and vested interest in acting on that data to the benefit of their citizens. Every planning problem is complex and nuanced, and each municipality should have the freedom to build the transportation infrastructure that fits their unique needs the best. The blanket one-size-fits-all framework proposed in Bill 212 robs cities of their ability to make and apply informed infrastructure decisions that fit their needs best.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be in charge of such local issues as bike lanes. the people whom use the lanes belong to and are governed closely by the cities making them a much more prudent judge. Along with this it is simply adding bureaucratic red tape as the city would need to devise and propose a bike lane (same as before) and then have the province approve it which is simply adding steps.\nFurthermore, the province is deciding to remove existing bike infrastructure which saves lives and encourages ridership for the sake of car drivers comfort and convenience. The safety of citizens should never be less important than comfort of another as that is a quick way to choosing favourites.\nfinally the removal of bike lanes will lead to bikers rejoining traffic lanes rather than being separated. this will cause more traffic than was ever present before because those whom rely on their bike after so many years of use wont give up that easily.\n"

It has greatly reduced the reliance on motor vehicles. It has reduced the amount of residential car parking within new developments, in part to bike lanes and accessible transit options. Stop deflecting from the actual cause of congestion, which is the glacial move to improving public transit into downtown. If you start tearing up bike lanes we are going to regress twenty years in our infrastructure and housing problems.\nMarc G.\n"

I've been a bike commuter in Toronto for over ten years and it is factually much safer with all the bike lanes being built. Being able to bike safely across the city is what makes Toronto such a great city. Toronto City Council has adopted an ambitious strategy to reduce community-wide greenhouse gas emissions in Toronto to net zero by 2040 and building bikes lanes is part of how we get there. Climate disaster is imminent and we must start transitioning now before it's too late. The provincial government has no business meddling in municipal affairs like this. What a disgrace of a government. Doug Ford's record is nothing but shameful: defunding health care and education, selling off Ontario place for a private luxury spa, selling off the greenbelt to his greedy developer friends. Why are people in positions of public office when they don't actually care about the people???? SHAME ON YOU!!!\n"
