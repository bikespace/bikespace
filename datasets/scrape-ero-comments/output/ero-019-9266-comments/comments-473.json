        "comment": "Hello!\nI think this law should not be passed.\nFirst, it violates the main democratic principle of separation of powers and gives the province control over the municipality's sphere of influence. If our state claims to adhere to democratic processes, it cannot, in good faith, pass legislation like this.\nSecond, I believe the bill authors did not consult with urban planning specialists. European cities' experience clearly shows that building more car lines does not solve traffic problems. Motivating people to use bikes and public transport - does.\nLastly, this law would devalue the progress of building the current networks of bicycle paths. And add more complications and bureaucratic work for municipalities to build bike lines. Not to mention safety concerns, when bike people will have to share the road with cars, leading to potentially more accidents and even more traffic jams, when car drivers would want to pass them.\nAdditionally, lower-income people cannot afford to own a car, and bikes are the only affordable and accessible option, especially in cities without a strong public transportation system.\nThank you!\n"

        "comment": "This bill will greatly affect my options for mobility, as my disabilities prevent me from driving, requiring me to use alternative transit methods, such as biking. If this bill is passed, I will be at an even greater disadvantage when needing to commute compared to someone without any disabilities that may impair driving. Driving is also a much more expensive option that many people I know are not able to afford, so I'm sure there are many others like me who also will be negatively affected by this Bill.\nPlease rethink passing this bill, as it will harm many already oppressed individuals and will likely end up causing even more traffic once cyclists are forced back into vehicles for their own safety due to the lack of safe infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing in support of furthering bike lane development projects within Toronto, especially in the downtown area. Even as predominantly a driver in east Toronto, between my own experience and of those I know, dangerous situations resulting from a shared road are deterring people from biking in the city and are adding more drivers to the road, further increasing problem. More bike lanes would decrease traffic while still enabling better access into downtown.\nThanks for your attention.\n"

So where is the data on bike lanes and congestion.  What has been trotted out so far (1.2% ride bikes) is so wrong that it is laughable.  If I can't trust the data why would I support the bill?  Bike lanes and usage is very local issue.  Mr Ford, stay in your lane!\n"

        "comment": "Happy to hear it. I don't doubt that safety need to be improved for cyclists, but bike lanes just seem to breed a mentality that rules no longer apply to bikes. Rules must be clearly established for both vehicles and cyclists to make driving safer for everyone. I'm tired of the pure vilification of the most prevelent method of transport on our roads, along side of the do no wrong special rules for bikes to blithely pass traffic over and over while a vehicle must carefully drive often out of their lane just so a cyclist can feel safe, all to just have them pass back at a red light that they ignore for their safety.\n"

        "comment": "I do not believe eliminating bike lanes will improve traffic times.\nIf biking is no longer a safe option, then those people may resort to driving or taxi/uber. Increasing road congestion another way, rather than their perceived congestion occupying the bike lanes.\nI no longer live in the city core, but when I did, I would never ride my bike as I felt unsafe with the already limited bike lanes. My cousin and best friend, however, live in the city and both would consider their bikes to be their main mode of transportation. Both have also been involved in accidents. Lucky for them, relatively unharmed. Such accidents will only increase without more protected bike lanes and the potential removal of already built bike lanes.\nReading that the well established bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge and University are vulnerable to this purposed bill; I feel this is a kick at the knees to all the progress made towards making Toronto safe for cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians.\nI don't doubt the immense planning and unique considerations which go into city planning, particularly transportation.  I am a voter who would greatly consider a candidates stance on making my city safer for all modes of transportation, and improving infrastructure to promote a healthier and greener way of living. It becomes disheartening when the decisions of someone I voted into office are delayed, dismissed, or reversed by a group outside the limits of the city.\nI do hope all the comments on this bill are considered genuinely.   The proposed red tape against a developing a city to meet the needs of the people is concerning to many. More so, in my opinion, than the insignificant traffic delays the bike lanes are accused cause.\n"

The traffic has not complete and it is clear to see these decision are not being made with he future in mind, but are a impulsive reactions to something that isn't liked.\nI also do not support a government that feels the need to override municipalities. I feel my tax dollars are being wasted for paying 2 people. One grown adult that plants saplings and a toddler that can't resist pulling them up.\nPlease, please, please keep the bike lanes, I need them to get to work safely.\nConsider investing that money into additional transit in the city. I look forward to my first protest.\n"

        "comment": "I am one of the lucky few in Mississauga who uses bike lanes on 80% of my 8km commute. Luckier still I have access to an electric bike. A 15 minutes driving commute turns into an 18minute cycling commute. It is so much more relaxing than driving, and helps me curb my C02 emissions. The  20% of the trip on road is almost enough to dissuade me from biking. I get passed too close if I'm too close to the curb and I get honked at if I'm practicing vehicular cycling (even when right turn lanes make this the safest way to proceed). I bike along Ridgeway drive near Dundas street which is a 50 zone that turns into a 60, where people drive 70. On my lunch break 2 weeks ago I recently saw a pickup truck driving at 120km/h+ up and down Laird road (a 50 zone). There would be no time to react if he came around a corner and found a cyclist in front of him turning left, instant death. If I didn't have the mobility to easily whip my neck around to check for cars often I wouldn't even risk my current low dosage of road cycling. I'm very grateful for the bike infrastructure that exists, please don't destroy it.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a shortsighted and misguided approach that dismisses the value of bike lanes and undermines Toronto\u2019s efforts toward building a healthier, more efficient, and more environmentally sustainable city. Removing essential bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue ignores the clear benefits these lanes provide\u2014not only for cyclists but for the city and its residents as a whole.\n1. Economic Costs:\nCycling infrastructure is one of the most cost-effective transportation solutions for urban centers. Studies consistently show that bike lanes reduce wear on roads, lower maintenance costs, and decrease the strain on public transportation systems, saving cities millions over time. The proposal\u2019s focus on expanding motor vehicle lanes runs counter to this reality and would force Toronto to pay more in long-term costs associated with road wear, increased pollution, and higher healthcare costs related to car-centric urban planning.\n2. Increased Congestion and Pollution:\nIronically, this proposal claims to reduce gridlock, yet removing bike lanes will do the opposite. By encouraging more car traffic, the city will experience more frequent and severe congestion, leading to higher emissions and environmental degradation. Biking is a proven method to reduce road congestion, taking cars off the road and ensuring that both cyclists and drivers can reach their destinations faster. Expanding car lanes will encourage car dependency, clogging Toronto streets even further and taking Toronto backward on environmental progress.\n3. The Health and Safety of Residents:\nBike lanes are more than just road dividers; they are essential for the safety of thousands of cyclists who rely on these routes daily. Removing these lanes is a reckless disregard for public safety. Not only does it increase the risk of accidents for cyclists, but it also contributes to lower air quality, which impacts everyone\u2019s health, especially pedestrians and nearby residents. Furthermore, the exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act is alarming; it suggests a willingness to ignore significant environmental and health impacts for the sake of expediency.\n4. Fiscal Responsibility:\nBike lanes save cities money. Less car traffic means reduced road repair costs, fewer emissions-related health issues, and less money spent on expanding roads to accommodate increasing numbers of vehicles. Cities like Toronto benefit from a mode of transport that requires no fuel, no emissions, and minimal infrastructure upkeep. This proposal overlooks the substantial cost savings associated with biking infrastructure in favour of outdated, car-dependent urban planning.\n5. Contradiction with Broader Environmental Goals:\nThis proposal claims to care about environmental implications while pushing for expanded vehicle lanes\u2014a move that\u2019s fundamentally at odds with sustainable urban planning. Toronto and Ontario have committed to reducing emissions and addressing climate change. Removing bike lanes undermines those goals by prioritising cars over clean, sustainable, and active transportation options. If Ontario is serious about climate resilience, it should be expanding its cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\nIn summary, this proposal is not a solution to gridlock; it\u2019s a recipe for increased congestion, higher costs, and compromised safety and environmental health. Rather than dismantling critical cycling infrastructure, Ontario should be expanding it, supporting a shift to cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options. The focus should be on creating a city that supports all forms of transportation\u2014where bikes aren\u2019t an afterthought, but a priority in building a resilient future for Toronto.\n"
