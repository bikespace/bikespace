Removing these bike lanes will disproportionately affect vulnerable communities and take away one of their main modes of transportation to get to work, shop, and contribute to the economy.\n"

        "comment": "I rely on the Bloor St bike lane to get to and from work safely and quickly. Every day, all year, I ride from East York down the Danforth, across the Don Valley, crossing Yonge, Bay, and University, before arriving at my workplace. This bike lane is literally a life saver, protecting me from cars and trucks. It\u2019s also the only direct route from my home to my workplace and back. There are no side streets that will get me across the Don Valley. Removal of the bike lane would force me to drive to work, adding yet another car to our congested streets. There is an enormous amount of research about \u201cinduced demand,\u201d which tells us that adding lanes will only prompt more people to drive, ultimately increasing congestion and commute times. We want to induce demand for cyclists because it will mean fewer cars on the road, which will benefit those who need to drive. Please do not take away Toronto\u2019s ability to add cycling infrastructure, which protects vulnerable road users while providing alternative means of transportation that lessens traffic. As someone who also drives occasionally, I hate sharing a lane with cyclists. Driving is much more comfortable and safe if cyclists have their own dedicated lane. Forcing drivers to share the car lanes with slower, more vulnerable cyclists will further slow down traffic. It will also dramatically increase the likelihood of collisions, too many of which will be fatal. My daily commute along Bloor is full of cyclists. Many of these road users will not disappear if the lanes are removed. They will be forced on to the roads with cars, slowing the roads down and causing accidents. Please respect the expertise of Toronto\u2019s city planners and keep Toronto\u2019s bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about the recent legislation in Ontario proposing to prohibit new bike lanes and review existing ones in favor of expanding car lanes. This move raises serious issues related to urban planning, environmental sustainability, and public health.\nFirstly, prioritizing automobile traffic over sustainable transport options appears to contradict global trends, where cities are adapting to the challenges of climate change. Expanding car lanes is likely to encourage greater vehicle use, perpetuating traffic congestion and worsening air pollution, with adverse effects on urban air quality and public health.\nFurther, overlooking the importance of cycling infrastructure disregards extensive research showing the benefits of bike lanes. They support active transportation, helping reduce car dependency and promoting healthier lifestyles. Cycling infrastructure also enhances road safety, reducing traffic accidents and creating a safer environment for all, including pedestrians.\nThis approach risks undermining smart urban design principles that foster vibrant communities. Cities prioritizing cycling and public transit over car traffic typically experience improved accessibility, reduced congestion, and enhanced quality of life. By potentially dismantling existing bike lanes, this legislation threatens to erode progress in creating pedestrian-friendly spaces, impacting residents' overall well-being.\nWith pressing challenges from climate change, public health issues, and urban sprawl, this legislation may be short-sighted, favoring short-term solutions over sustainable, long-term strategies. Rather than restricting bike lanes, Ontario should focus on expanding and enhancing cycling infrastructure, supporting a more balanced and sustainable transportation system.\nI urge you to reconsider this proposal in light of these factors.\n"

        "comment": "THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!  It is absolutely evident that these bike lanes have caused a lot of grid lock in the city, and it's a joke to sit in grid lock only to see the bike lanes completely empty!\nI am 45 years old, born in downtown Toronto, now living in south Etobicoke.  I have been biking since kindergarten, I have not once had an accident or any interaction while respectfully sharing the road with cars.  Bloor street was much safer to ride along BEFORE the bike lanes were installed.\nAlso to note that in the Queen/Lansdowne intersection, this past summer/early fall 2 way roads on the residential streets around Parkdale Public School have turned to a single 1-way route for more empty, unused bike lanes.  This has also created ridiculous grid lock at the Queen/Lansdowne intersection.\n***On October 31st CP24 was showing an aerial view of one of the congested routes with bike lanes.  They were following a cyclist who made a dangerous move of going around a car already in the middle of a right turn well before the cyclist was at the intersection.  I'm flabbergasted that the media doesn't educate the public on how to safely bike on city streets, let alone not indicate that the cyclist made an illegal traffic move.  I clearly remember learning bicycle safety in elementary school.   I'm wondering if the ministry of Education could put bicycle safety back into the elementary curriculum since cycling is such an important issue to the city of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes reduce congestion. It's as simple as that. If we want more lanes then why don't we get rid of street parking? Every bike lane we add leads to fewer cars that don't need any local parking and fewer people who need on TTC.\nFurther reliance on cars is a step backwards. It limits transport options for people. Taking away bike lanes and moving them to less busy roads will only create further traffic. Reducing lane space on smaller lane streets will lead to congestion on those streets and lead to more complicated and dangerous traffic conditions for bikers.\nToronto needs safer transport. With the delays to more subway lines, increased car traffic, and several roads under construction, reducing the number of bike lanes will only add to congestion. With the number of pedestrian and biker deaths and injuries in the city, we actually need more bike lanes, not fewer. This is a decision that should also be left to municipalities.\nThe province is taking a step back with this legislation and should strongly consider making further amendments to empower cities to better manage traffic, rather than taking their power away.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a toddler tantrum. I'm in opposition to it and the planned removal of existing cycling infrastructure anywhere in the GTAH.\nAll data points to how having full cycling networks has limited impact of helps improves car travel times as less people drive and more cycle. Not only is it better for the environment, having a cycling network in a global city attracts residents, it strengthens the local economy as cyclists spend more than car drivers in smaller urban stores.\nMore connected cycle lanes are required, not less. Years of research across the world supports the following points:\nReduced Traffic Congestion: Contrary to popular belief, adding bike lanes can actually reduce overall traffic congestion. By providing a safe and efficient alternative to driving, more people will choose to cycle, thereby decreasing the number of cars on the road. This shift can lead to smoother traffic flow and shorter commute times for everyone.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Promoting cycling over driving has significant environmental advantages. Fewer cars on the road mean reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. This is a crucial step towards combating climate change and creating a healthier environment for all residents.\nHealth and Well-being: Encouraging cycling has substantial health benefits. Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improve mental health, and enhance overall well-being. By making cycling safer and more accessible, we can promote a healthier lifestyle for our community.\nEconomic Advantages: Bike lanes can boost local economies. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses compared to drivers. Additionally, the cost of maintaining bike lanes is significantly lower than that of maintaining roads for motor vehicles, leading to long-term savings for the city.\nSafety Improvements: Dedicated bike lanes significantly enhance the safety of cyclists. They reduce the risk of accidents and create a more predictable traffic environment for all road users. This is particularly important in urban areas where the interaction between cyclists and motorists is frequent.\nSupport for Sustainable Transportation: Investing in bike lanes is an investment in sustainable transportation. It aligns with global trends towards greener cities and supports the development of a comprehensive, multi-modal transportation network that includes public transit, walking, and cycling.\nCommunity and Quality of Life: Bike lanes contribute to a more liveable city. They encourage outdoor activity, reduce noise pollution, and create a more pleasant urban environment. This enhances the quality of life for all residents, making our city a more attractive place to live and work.\nThank you for standing up for what is right.\n"

        "comment": "This is so wrong-headed. We have known for a very long time that widening roads or adding more lanes for cars does not reduce traffic congestion.  Roads are a public space. Priority should be given to those modes of mobility that utilize that space more efficiently. A bus can move over 50 people and only use as much road space as three SUV's. A bicycle only takes up as much space as the trunk of a car. Catering to cars is a recipe for more traffic congestion.  Cities that are vibrant and prosperous know how to entice people to leave the car at home by providing choices and that includes bike lanes. Wake up it's not 1950.\n"

Bike lanes are very important to the safety of cyclists and providing an alternative and clean form of transportation. Removing them is a step backwards to addressing climate change which I do not see enough action on from this government. Instead of wasting time and money on studying tunnels under the 401 please build more transit and leave the bike lanes alone. Perhaps it is also time for renegotiation of the 407 contract - a highly underused highway due to cost. Lastly, as a driver, I like the separation of cars and bikes for their safety and my piece of mind not to hit them while sharing lanes. Please try and be Progressive Conservatives on this matter.\n"

These lanes are newly built and increase safety for cyclists, pedestrians and motor vehicles.  It would be a huge waste of taxpayer resources to tear up these bike lanes and would increase -- not decrease -- traffic congestion in the city.  This is a massive overreach of provincial jurisdiction.  These taxpayer resources should be allocated to matters squarely within the jurisdiction of the provincial government that are currently underfunded and poorly managed -- such as health care, public schools, and getting the Eglinton LRT running.\n"
