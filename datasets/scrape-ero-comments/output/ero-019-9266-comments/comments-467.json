        "comment": "This bill seems aimed at maintaining a status quo of car-centric thinking in this province. This is not a forward-thinking policy. Adding lanes of traffic for cars to use increases the number of cars in those lanes. It prevents those who want to use alternate means of travel from having the free choice to do so. This bill will see that gridlock is increased, not the reverse. It's not the place of the provincial government to add controls on how local governments want to control traffic. Fewer bike lanes makes the roads more dangerous for everyone. Drivers find that segregated cycling lanes are preferable to cyclists sharing the road with cars. This is poorly supported policy. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "There are several issues with this proposed legislation and the talking points associated with it, not the least of which are the misguided notions (not supported by evidence) that bicycle lanes increase car traffic congestion and also reduce business volume at enterprises along their routes. Indeed, experience in many other locations in fact shows the opposite to be true.\nWhat bicycle lanes do provide, however, is a safer environment for citizens - many of whom are also car drivers - to enjoy the benefits of cycling, an activity good for their health, their pocketbooks, and the environment. At a time when Ontarians are concerned about the failure of the health care system, the rising cost of living, and disaster relief following extreme weather events, it seems foolhardy to dissuade people from choosing a mode of transportation that addresses all three. And it is even more egregious to expect those who cannot afford motor vehicles or bus fare to pay for this misguidedness with their lives because of a lack of cycling infrastructure.\nWorld-wide, cities that cater to people rather then to cars are universally acclaimed to be more desirable places to live. Why is this government seemingly intent on making Ontario less desirable?\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation goes against all available data regarding transportation needs within cities. It also goes against all proposed emission-reduction measures, works against an increase in sustainable modes of travel through modal-share. The provincial government SHOULD NOT be meddling in these LOCAL issues. These decisions should be left to municipal governments who are best suited to manage the needs of locals. If the provincial government wishes to manage these roads in an economically and environmentally unsustainable manner, they should upload these roads back to the province as provincial highways (as many of them previously were).\nAs a driver, and occasional public transit user and cyclist, the removal and prevention of the installation of new bike lanes in many instances is not a good idea. Cyclists should be separated from vehicular traffic for safety reasons and to increase the cycling mode share (which leads to reductions in congestion). As a driver, it is also extremely frustrating when sitting in traffic behind cyclists or having to pass them.\nCycle lanes are also important to accommodate those who cannot drive (such as children and the elderly) who may cycle to different destinations. This proposal would diminish and reverse much of the progress that municipalities have made to increase road safety.\nIf this proposal is approved, I will find it hard to support this government any longer. This will be done with a heavy heart as someone who has strongly supported this government since the last election.\n"

We cannot afford this backsliding in sustainable transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Hi I live in Whitehorse, Yukon, but grew up in Ontario and visit my brother and his family in Toronto often. I do not support the proposed Bill 212 for the following reasons:\n- Adds a bunch of red tape for municipalities to navigate. The provincial government should be helping municipalities reach their goals for safe convenient transportation. Bill 212 is heavy handed and takes away power and representation at the local level without a clear reason why (i.e., why is the bike lane on Bloor something that rises to the level of provincial jurisdiction? Usually there needs to be a clear reason for this upgrade, and a bike lane that took about a month to build and is in the heart of a City is not that. i.e., it doesn't connect to a 'provincial level or scale' network like the Highways, Electrical Grid, Railways, etc.).\n-Including ripping out the existing Bloor, Young and University lanes as a provision of the bill is a really top down big government thing to do. Why would a decision, to build the lanes, which was done with municipal level approvals now be subject to removal based on new provincial level rules? This is not in the spirit of the fair and appropriate division of power and responsibility amongst the governments.\n- Cycling is growing in Toronto and the Bloor bike lane project, which I've used and find super helpful when I'm in Toronto, and that my brother uses frequently. With more connectivity I think a bigger share of trips could be done with bikes in Toronto. Bloor street is busy with bikes all the time when I go visit.\n-Car travel on Bloor has never been fast, and never will be. It is a bustling  business and residential corridor. People are getting out the subway, cars, off bikes, and walking to a multitude of amazing destinations for food, commerce, services, hotels, bars, and theirs or their friend's residences. This is a good thing, and rationalizing car movement through this area should not be prioritized. Car travel is just too space intensive for the amount of productive economic activity and valuable space that is along that corridor. Better to focus on transit, walking, and yes, cycling infrastructure, as these are more compatible with this type of (awesome, vibrant, productive) urban space, and they take up less valuable space per traveller than cars by a long shot.\n- Typically changes to major public infrastructure are contemplated and carried through an iterative and integrated process of feasibility studies, planning, public and rights holder engagement and consultation, and design. This bill just goes right to 'the solution' without any of the steps.  Just like any snap decision, I bet there will be some unintended consequences. When it comes to removing safe infrastructure this means more deaths and injuries for vulnerable road users, i.e., cyclists, and making traffic worse in the long run because the added car lanes will induce more driving, while removing the bike lanes will induce less bike trips, and more car trips.\nI am concerned that the added car capacity achieved with the lane removal will be filled quickly with more cars looking for a faster route through the busy city, quickly erasing any improvement in car travel in a few short years. In the mean time cyclists will die and be injured in higher numbers, and these areas will be less vibrant and less free to use.\n-\n"

I have biked bloor street for many years prior to the bike lanes and it was so scary. The bike lanes have such minimal impact on car commuters while protecting the lives of cyclists.\nI cannot see myself voting for the conservatives again if this is the kind of backwards policy they choose to push through.\n"

The Conservatives claim that they do not believe in \"big government\", but this legislation makes it clear that is nothing but empty rhetoric.\nIf you want to improve traffic, invest in public transit, remove on-street parking, pass legislation to make construction sites accommodate their own parking needs, or implement any number of evidence-based and common sense solutions.\nShould the lanes be removed, people will die, traffic will get worse, and you will own every spilled drop of blood, broken blood, and lost life.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely disappointed in and opposed to this legislation.  It is well understood in the field of urban planning that increasing road capacity does not improve congestion due to induced demand (1).  The most effective way to reduce congestion is to provide viable alternatives to driving.  By removing and limiting protected bicycle infrastructure on main streets that provide direct routes and easy access to destinations, the Ontario government will fail to improve traffic flow by reducing the viability of cycling as a mode of transport.\nPlacing bicycle infrastructure on secondary streets will limit access to local businesses located along main streets, depriving these businesses of the economic benefits of cycling activity.  Studies have found that visitors to Bloor St. spent more money following the installation of bike lanes in 2016, and that individuals in North American cities (including Toronto) spend more money in commercial areas when they arrive by foot or bicycle than by car (2,3).  In New York City, retail sales increased along commercial corridors after the installation of bike lanes (4).\nAdditionally, placing bicycle routes on secondary streets results in less direct routes and limited access to destinations, reducing convenience for individuals travelling by bicycle.  Therefore, individuals travelling by bicycle will likely continue to use main streets \u2013 only without the separation and protection provided by bicycle lanes.  As a result of this, cyclists will travel among motor vehicles and will be at an increased risk of injury and death, while potentially slowing motor vehicle traffic.  In Canada, 73% of deaths by cycling collisions involve a collision with a motor vehicle (5).  By removing bicycle infrastructure on major corridors, the Ontario government will be directly responsible for increased injuries and fatalities on these routes.\nSources:\n1.\tSpeck, J. (2018).

        "comment": "Re: Bill 212, ERO number 019-9266, Posted by the Ministry of Transportation\nDear Doug Ford and Prabmeet Sarkaria,\nI live on the western side of Toronto, not too far from Christie subway and I cycle a lot, all year. It is my preferred method of travel in the city of Toronto. I also use the TTC extensively, walk quite a bit and from time to time, I might use my motorcycle to get around.\nPlease leave the bike lanes alone. I use the University Ave., Yonge street, and parts (Old Mill to Danforth) of the Bloor St bike lanes extensively and am so much safer because of them. It\u2019s also quick, easy and convenient to not have to zip between different side streets to get from point A to point B to point C.\nThis removal of existing bike lanes idea in the city of Toronto seems like an extremely knee jerk and misguided response by a provincial government to appease a small section of the Ontario electorate who screamed the loudest.\nFor your government this seems to be a fait accompli, no matter what comments are submitted or what studies would show, no matter the potential health and lives of Torontonians affected by this.  It seems your government has already decided that the possible decrease of a few minutes off of a 40-90 minute car trip to suburbia by people who don\u2019t even live in Toronto and of course would never use a bike lane here is more important than the people who actually live in this city! You\u2019re going to make our lives worse by having more cars - so more pollution and more risk  - less bike lanes on easy to navigate and direct routes like Bloor, University and Yonge. Where will the replacement bike lanes be built? How easy, seamless and safe will it be compared to what currently exists? Why not show us the replacement plan? Have any other cities in the world done this? If so, please reference them and show how and why your bike replacement plan is viable.\nWhether one voted for Olivia Chow or not, she won the election by promising, among other things, to at least continue the mandate that had begun in earnest by her predecessor of building more safe bike lanes, certainly not removing them. And you certainly didn't campaign on doing this, so to have you decide, without even attempting to come up with any sort of compromise on any section of the three aforementioned bike lanes, strikes me as fundamentally unfair and undemocratic to the people of Toronto.\nGreat cities around the world lead in public transportation and bike lanes. They don\u2019t remove them or shuffle them off to side streets.\nPlease do the right thing and leave cycling infrastructure planning and implementation to the municipalities and their constituents. It\u2019s our right!\nThank you,\nMichel\n"
