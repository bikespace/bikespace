        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nAfter 25 years of biking around this city, I finally felt safe when I moved to the Bloor/Runnymede area and the separated bicycle lanes on Bloor Street were complete. An accomplished and safe rider, the only 2 accidents in 25 years were caused by 1) a pothole and 2) a snack track on an access rode who blew a stop sign and hit me ON THE BIKE PATH.\nI have watch traffic in this city slow to a crawl and I can tell you it's not because I can safely ride to work everyday on a bicycle. It's because there are too many cars and not enough mass transit options. Cars are the one's that hold up buses and streetcars at intersections. Cars are the ones that hold up bicycles and pedestrians on turns. Cars are the problem, not two wheels or two legs. Cars are the problem.\nThere is so much quality information to support bicycling infrastructure in large cities. It promotes fitness and health, sense of community. In the Bloor West village corridor, vendors have found that sales improved with the installation of the bike lanes.\nWe need a premiere that will support infrastructure decision based on facts, figures and expert knowledge, not one that says whatever it takes to maintain popularity. I can attach article after article, case study after case study to support this opinion, but I'm also going to appeal to you on a more personal level. Please help me stay safe as I travel daily by my preferred method of transportation: my. beloved bicycle.\nPlease leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

Removing bike lanes won\u2019t make bikers disappear, they will still need and want to bike around the city to work, on errands, to get places, etc - but removing bike lanes on busy streets makes it dangerous for bikers. Cars do not leave enough space around bikers when passing them on the road. To leave half a lane of space around a biker means that lane isn\u2019t useable by cars anyways, and that road is reduced by the same 1 lane except there\u2019s no protection around bikers like cement barriers and reflective poles. Biking is great physical activity that keeps citizens healthy and biking is so much better for the environment! Don\u2019t try to discourage healthy biking by making it dangerous again.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto with my family, and I cycle to work every day to provide for them. I rely on the protected lanes on bloor and university to make sure I get to and from work safely. This proposal, if removing bike lanes is carried out, will directly endanger me, and greatly increase the risk of my family losing a father. If the Government would like to accomplish its mission of making Ontario a place for families to grow, this proposal directly contradicts this objective.\nFurthermore, elements of this proposal directly contradict the Premier\u2019s beliefs. Specifically, in April of 2024, Premier Ford stated, \u201cI believe in letting municipalities determine what is good for their communities and what is not good for their communities.\u201d This proposal directly infringes on this municipal freedom held by the Premier by creating more red tape for municipalities instead of removing it to build what is appropriate for their communities.\nIn review of the data, I am extremely disheartened to see that pandemic era data, when everyone was in Lockdown, was used as the baseline for making the case that traffic congestion grew, and then disingenuously blaming cycle lanes. The Government should be making policy based on appropriate data, instead of twisting inappropriate data to create an incorrect narrative.\nI believe in getting Ontario moving. However, the proposal as it stands fails to appropriately consider the non-automobile modes of transport that people rely on every day to feed their families, and make Ontario a strong economy.\nI sincerely hope the Government either rescinds this proposal, or amends it in recognition of municipal freedoms and the safety of Ontario\u2019s population.\n"

As a person in their 20s living in Toronto, already dealing with increasing cost of living and unreliable public transit, the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and Avenue have improved my quality of life dramatically. Young people are leaving this city in droves, and if the bike lanes are removed I will certainly join their ranks. In 6 years you have made this city unliveable.\n"

The decision to waste tax payer dollars - by removing bike lanes that were just completed - using additional tax dollars to do so, is inept governance.\nRemoving bike lanes will not help congestion. There are NUMEROUS studies that showcase the addition of lanes does not help congestion. It is clear every member of this administration makes decisions similar to a gambling addict - based on pure emotion and feelings - instead of based on evidence (e.g. closure of the Science Centre).  Ford\u2019s decision to remove bike lanes will directly impact and increase deaths of cyclists, and further add to congestion (from bikers opting to use cars instead of bikes because they feel unsafe, or by slowing down traffic by being forced to use a full car lane).\nWhat an incredibly irresponsible and idiotic decision by the Conservative Party - one that illustrates why I will never again vote for this party for the Ontario government.\nIf this goes through, every increased death, will be directly on the hand\u2019s of the Conservative Party personally.

        "comment": "This bill is absurd and should not be passed.\n1. Bike lanes do not cause congestion - motor vehicles do. Motor vehicles are an extremely inefficient way to move people. We should be actively encouraging people to move to other forms of transportation (i.e., walking, bikes, public transit) by building the infrastructure to facilitate those other modes. This is the ONLY way to reduce traffic congestion - give people viable alternatives to driving. Giving the province the ability to block bike lanes that remove lanes for vehicles will only encourage more people to drive and result in worse traffic (the problem this bill is meant to help).\n2. This is a massive overreach by the province. Requiring approval for these local initiatives will slow down progress on building infrastructure that allows people to get around without a vehicle.\nI urge everyone to vote against this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Comment on the Proposed Bill Restricting Bike Lanes in Ontario\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill that would grant the provincial government authority to block the installation of new bike lanes and remove existing ones on municipal roads, especially when it involves the removal of a vehicle lane. This legislation is a misguided approach that overlooks the multifaceted benefits of bike lanes and undermines municipal autonomy.\nIneffectiveness in Improving Traffic Flow\nContrary to the belief that removing bike lanes will enhance traffic flow, evidence suggests otherwise. Bike lanes encourage more people to opt for cycling over driving, effectively reducing the number of cars on the road. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion but also maximizes the efficiency of existing road space. Eliminating bike lanes would likely force cyclists back into cars or unsafe riding conditions, increasing traffic volume and negating any perceived benefits of additional vehicle lanes.\nSafety Concerns for All Road Users\nBike lanes are essential for the safety of both cyclists and motorists. They provide a designated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents and conflicts between different types of road users. Removing these lanes increases the risk of collisions, injuries, and fatalities. Safety should be a paramount concern, and this bill compromises that by making roads more hazardous for everyone.\nEnvironmental Impact\nEncouraging cycling through the provision of bike lanes contributes significantly to environmental sustainability. Bicycles produce zero emissions, and increasing their use helps reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In the face of growing concerns about climate change, policies should promote environmentally friendly transportation options rather than diminish them.\nHealth and Well-being Benefits\nCycling is not just a mode of transportation; it is also a form of physical exercise that promotes health and well-being. By making cycling safer and more accessible, bike lanes encourage a healthier lifestyle among residents. Removing these lanes could discourage physical activity, leading to negative public health outcomes and increased healthcare costs in the long run.\nEconomic Advantages\nCities with robust cycling infrastructure often experience economic benefits. Local businesses can see increased patronage from cyclists who are more likely to stop and shop than motorists. Additionally, the costs associated with road maintenance can decrease due to reduced wear and tear from fewer vehicles. Eliminating bike lanes could, therefore, have unintended negative economic consequences.\nErosion of Municipal Autonomy\nMunicipalities have a better understanding of their local needs and priorities. Granting the province authority over bike lane installations undermines local governance and disregards the input of community members who advocate for safer, more sustainable transportation options. This overreach sets a concerning precedent for provincial interference in municipal affairs.\nConclusion\nThe proposed bill is a step backward for Ontario\u2019s transportation, environmental, and public health goals. It fails to consider the comprehensive benefits that bike lanes offer and instead opts for a short-sighted solution that will not improve traffic conditions. I urge policymakers to reconsider this legislation and focus on enhancing, rather than diminishing, cycling infrastructure for the betterment of all residents.\n"

As a car driver, from the city of Toronto, I fully support the bike lanes as they make it easier to get around while driving as all road users have clearly defined spaces.  Additionally, highway expansions (413 specifically). will not reduce traffic, and time would be better spent fixing the 407 and building public transit.  I absolutely do not support this bill adding additional red tape, wasting time and resources.\n"
