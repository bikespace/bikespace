Its dangerous.\nThis feels like a sick joke being played on the good people of Toronto. My 71 year old father rides his bicycle in the city and I don\u2019t want to see him crushed to death by an F150.\nThoughtful city planning is the way to move forward; more bike lanes, more pedestrian streets, more third places. Less big ugly roadways.  We need to work together to build better public transit and pedestrian corridors, not the other way around.\nWhat happens when we waste all this energy to remove bike lanes and nothing changes, or even get worse? The next government in power spends our money to reverse the damage\u2026 take a look at Europe and try to learn something. SMH.\n"

The Bloor bikelane has been one of the greatest additions to my safety the city could have possibly undertaken.\nI will still ride to work, daily, but if the lane is removed I will do so in traffic. I don't ride fast, and I'll ride even slower on account of greater fear for my safety.\nI'm not sure how me, riding slowly, will help drivers get where they are going faster. I do know that me, riding in a seperate bikelane, allows cars to dictate the speed of traffic.\nIf you want to help drivers, keep bikelanes.\n"

We want to get more people out of cars and into active transportation. Even if bike lanes cause congestion to cars \u2013 and I think this is not borne out by any studies \u2013 it would still be preferable to build more bike and pedestrian infrastructure. It's the car drivers that are causing air and noise pollution and who are involved in the deaths of approximately1,000 Ontarians every year.\n"

        "comment": "Bike infrastructure is a critical component of the transition to a low carbon/carbon neutral planet. Dedicated bike infrastructure REDUCES traffic rather than increasing it, and typically are less costly than vehicle infrastructure is to maintain. If the provincial government is serious about reducing traffic for drivers, then they need to provide drivers with safe alternatives. Bogging down municipalities with the cost of studies and then delays as their requests are reviewed is - in my opinion - the worst way to better road congestion and manage traffic. After all, what happens to the people who use the lanes getting removed? They're going to keep biking but now they're sharing the road rather than having their own. Traffic and cost concerns aside, removing bike lanes will make roads slightly more dangerous for drivers and far, FAR more dangerous for bikers.\n"

For those who do not have the option to drive as they may not be able to afford a car or have other restrictions, the roads will become more dangerous. Removing bike lanes will almost certainly get people killed.\nThis proposal morally disgusting, endangering lives while prioritizing saving a few minutes of time (which won\u2019t even happen regardless) for those in cars.\n"

It's not been shown that this will generate anywhere near the amount of money it will cost to pay for the worker-hours too implement and oversee this system.

        "comment": "As someone who doesn\u2019t own a car, biking is my primary mode of transportation, and it\u2019s essential for my daily commute. Doug Ford\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes at Bloor St and University Avenue is not only baffling but also a step backward in making our cities more sustainable and accessible. These bike lanes are crucial for safety and mobility, and removing them would make cycling more dangerous while pushing people back into cars, worsening traffic congestion and pollution. I can\u2019t fathom why we\u2019d dismantle infrastructure that promotes healthier, more eco-friendly transportation.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, we should be focusing on improving the quality of public transit and active transportation options like cycling. Investing in better transit and cycling infrastructure is key to reducing congestion and making our cities more livable. Quality public transit should be the priority, ensuring that people have reliable, efficient, and accessible alternatives to driving. By supporting these modes of transportation, we can reduce car dependence, cut down on emissions, and create a more connected, sustainable city.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Doug Ford truly understanding the importance of bike lanes when it seems like he doesn\u2019t personally experience what it\u2019s like to navigate the city by bike. Biking requires safe infrastructure, and without it, people are forced into cars or unsafe situations on the road. If more decision-makers regularly relied on active transportation like cycling, they\u2019d see firsthand how vital it is to create safe, accessible spaces for all modes of transport\u2014not just for those behind the wheel.\n"

That would likely be a better use of resources than reversing progress on already built bike lanes.\n"

I do not want my tax dollars to be spent ripping out bike lanes that have JUST been put in. More construction will exacerbate the issue of traffic, and there are other ways to mitigate congestion in the city, but that is also Toronto\u2019s responsibility as a city. This is a bill that seems to also be trying to push in other items that are not helpful to Toronto, and especially others in Ontario. I  distressed to see legislation like this being tabled.\n"

I pay ridiculous amounts of taxes to the province personally and from my business, and I expect them to be put to productive use, which is NOT THIS. This province is hurting for housing and healthcare, not your obsession with bikes.\n2) As a driver, I want bikes in dedicated bike lanes. I do NOT want to have to worry about them jumping around traffic! Keeping them in dedicated bike lanes ensures safety for everyone and keeps their erratic behavior away from cars. Reality is we will keep getting more bike riders, time to adapt.\n"

Numerous studies have found that adding car infrastructure like highways and lanes, and wider roads only induces more people to drive, making traffic worse.\nThis government claims to be opposed to red tape and is introducing more unnecessarily. This government claims to care about people's time and improving people's commute and is trying to pass legislation that will make things worse. It's completely non-sensical and a waste of time and effort. I'm embarrassed to be represented by this government. The facts and statistics and studies are all there.\nStop trying to take us backwards and let people choose how they want to safely move through their city. Safer cycling infrastructure means more people riding bikes. More people riding bikes means fewer people in cars. Fewer cars on the road means less congestion and better traffic flow. Enough of this nonsense. Do better.\n"

Having bike lanes and incentivizing alternatives to car sounds like it would actually help with gridlock.\nWhy the province wants to put the safety for cyclists at risk so that cars can arrive to their destination 2 mins faster baffles me. Absolutely ridiculous proposal\n"
