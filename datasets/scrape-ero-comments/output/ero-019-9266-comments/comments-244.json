        "comment": "The current administration is trying to solve gridlock by adding more lanes and more highways, while at the same time, with this bike lane ban, restricting the actual solution.\nThe only solution to car traffic is viable alternatives to driving. Period. For short trips within a neighborhood that means sidewalks, bike lanes, and inner-city transit. For longer trips across town, that means more bike lanes and more transit. And for trips between cities that rely on these congested highways that certainly means more transit.\nCars don't scale. Look around the world and you'll see that cities with population densities like the GTA, like Paris, have recently had to reprioritize in the same way.\nI implore the government to break free from its status quo bias that is reacting to busy car highways by adding more car capacity. This is a dead end. Instead the government should be encouraging the construction of transit and bike lanes. And YES protected bike lanes should exist on main streets. If restricted to secondary streets they prove less efficient, and fail in their goal to be a viable alternative to driving a car.\nMixed mode infrastructure everywhere. That's the solution to gridlock. It's going to take courage for you break the cycle though. You can do this.\n"

Additionally, bike lanes have been a huge success to get more people to bike, reducing traffic congestion, and increasing exercise for many people. Removing bike lanes will have a huge safety impact, likely resulting in serious injuries or deaths to people specifically due to this legislation. For everyone's sake, please don't let this bill become a law.\n"

This is not the province's responsibility and unless the province's intends to take over all aspects of city planning, this will not result in cities that better satisfy all resident needs.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the only scalable way to address traffic is to reduce the number and density of cars. This means prioritizing alternative means of transportation, including mass transit and, yes, bikes.\n"

It is extremely well established that investing solely in auto infrastructure induces more demand on roads and does nothing to alleviate congestion. Enabling safe and viable alternatives to driving gets cars off the road, and is the only way to meaningfully improve traffic in high density areas. Transportation is not a zero sum political game!\n"

It is a ridiculous idea to remove them. Bikes will still be on the road, and bike lanes allow them to navigate traffic safely. Why not focus on more important things that are affecting Ontarians, such as Healthcare or education? I'm sure our municipal governments are more than qualified to make the decisions on bike lanes in their cities.\n"

        "comment": "I drive my car at least ten times for every trip I take on my bike. I live along Bloor West and drive within Toronto to run errands and visit my parents across town in the Beaches. I drive routinely out of the city to my office in Mississauga.\nWhen I drive, I am careful of the cyclists alongside me. For a variety of reasons, they have chosen, or had little choice, to go with this method of transportation. They are vulnerable, being barely protected human bodies on the same road as the multi-tonne steel vehicles capable of going at high speeds in an instant. Life is sacred, and too many times this year have we seen cyclists die on the streets of Toronto this year due to unsafe cycling infrastructure. The protected bike lanes along Bloor save lives. When I do get on my bike and have the option of taking the bike lanes along Bloor, I feel protected and glad they are there. If I have to take a route with no bike lanes, such as along Dundas or Dupont St I feel like I am taking a much greater risk with my life or bodily safety.\nMore condos are popping up all over Toronto and other cities, increasing population density. One more lane of traffic won't do as much for congestion as providing the safe option for more people to take a bike instead. I'm not just making that up, it's been repeatedly studied, which I'm sure government policy professionals would look at as well when making bills. See link below.\nFrom an environmental perspective, do we really need to look into if cars or bikes are better for the environment? Common sense would provide the answer. We should be encouraging more people to get on the seat of a bike rather than in a car.\nAs a driver who gives a damn about my neighbours' safety, please stop blocking bike lane implementation as is proposed in Bill 212 and leave the existing bike lanes alone. If Ontario continues to go down this anti-bike lane route, more cyclist blood will be on the hands of this government.\n"

        "comment": "This is the most ridiculous bill. The last thing Ontario needs is for there to be more administration to deliver essential infrastructure upgrades. Further, the removal of the ability for municipalities to decide how to best serve their own communities is anti-democratic at best. If municipalities can\u2019t decide to put in something as simple as a bike lane, what point is there in having local government? A truly disappointing power grab which is set to leave our communities worse off.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely horrifying proposal - not only has it been proven that more cyclists on the road alleviates gridlock more effectively than adding by car space, this is an affront to the autonomy of municipalities. The people who know and understand the needs of their towns and cities are the ones on the ground, not a provincial overseer far removed. As we face a climate crisis, the idea of removing the ability for people to circulate efficiently and safely without adding to our heavy carbon output is foolish. I urge you to consider the safety of people who bicycle (and will continue to bicycle!) beyond the mere annoyance of traffic. Improvements to our public transit and cycling networks would serve this province far better than ineffective measures aimed at getting more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal, because the proposed policy is not evidence-based. Bike lanes do more than keep riders safe- they encourage more people to ride bikes, which reduces traffic. Every cyclist on the road means one less car in front of me on the road causing traffic. Bikes take less space than cars.\nThis is common sense.\nIt is also supported by data that suggests commute times are currently only minimally affected by bike lanes. As more and more people feel safe riding bikes instead of driving, those of us who have to drive will have more and more room on the road.\nThe best way to reduce traffic congestion is actually to fund safe, reliable, affordable public transit. If transit was better people would use it more. Again, this will reduce traffic.\nMaking more roads doesn't reduce traffic, getting people out of their cars does.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI recently learned about the proposed Bill 212, and I am strongly in favour of it for two key reasons.\nFor years, I relied on transit and cycling for local travel, only using my car for longer trips. However, this changed when I became a father. My children attend two different schools with similar start times, which also coincide with my work hours. Taking transit for these cross-town trips would add an entire hour to my commute, making it 1.5 hours in total, whereas I can complete the same route by car in about 20 minutes. However, when vehicle lanes were removed to add a bike lane, this trip went from one of consistent speed with few stops to several areas of stop-and-go traffic. What also concerns me is that in these high-congestion areas, there are more instances of pedestrians crossing between stopped vehicles, making these spaces feel less safe (as I\u2019ve observed in Hamilton).\nAdditionally, most bike routes I encounter seem to be designed for experienced cyclists like myself, rather than for children. In several locations with new bike infrastructure, I find myself having my kids ride on the sidewalk because many of the designs are too complex for young riders. Features like lane neck-downs often push cars into the bike lane or cyclists into the car lane, creating risky situations. Many designs require concentration, yet when in motion, road features should allow for quick, intuitive decisions.\nI feel that some bike advocacy groups take an overly anti-car stance. I am pro-bike and support expanding bike infrastructure, but I also recognize the many situations where people genuinely need a car. This includes parents like myself, as well as individuals with physical disabilities who rely on assistive devices in their vehicles, making transit challenging and cycling unfeasible. I support adding bike infrastructure, but not if it penalizes those who need a car to get around.\nFurthermore, cycling cannot be considered a sustainable mode of transport if it creates congestion. Bill 212 is well-aligned with the need to ensure genuine equity and to make certain that sustainable travel methods are not inadvertently worsening congestion and emissions.\nI fully support expanding our infrastructure, but when congestion builds, it doesn't make families like mine suddenly decide to ride the bike or bus- it only pushes otherwise patient drivers to make decisions out of frustration, often cutting through neighbourhood streets. This creates additional hazards for families like mine who are cycling to parks or schools. Bill 212 will help prevent this from continuing.\nThank you for considering this perspective.\n"

Redirecting bike lanes through convoluted neighborhood diversions is not the solution. Before bike lanes we still rode on Bloor, unsafely. Now, we and our kids and ride together. Please don\u2019t take that away.\nMore people riding bikes is better. Adding more space for cars has been proven to only increase traffic.\n"

It is so unnecessary for the province to be controlling municipalities and will add another layer of bureacracy when adding bike lanes. The process will become much slower amd harder and that is NOT what Ontarians need. We need more bike lanes to reduce bike traffic and add safe bardiers between high speed roads and pedestrian sidewalks. The province has no place in governing these aspects of municipalities, thats ridiculous. As a Torontonian, this will potentially increase street traffic, make streets less safe, and will not bring the infrastructure expansion that we need.\nPlease leave these decisions to the towns and cities that they are affecting.\n"
