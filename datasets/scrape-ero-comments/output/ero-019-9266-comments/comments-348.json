We already have processes for this. There cannot possibly be a whole-province-level interest in what individual municipalities choose to do with their roads.\nThis extra red tape aside, removing bicycle lanes without traffic studies to support a significant reduction in travel time is a waste of taxpayer's money.  Again, I can't understand why a government that is committed to reducing waste and the tax burden is even considering spending millions of dollars on this when there are so many more pressing issues facing us.\n"

        "comment": "I am horrified that Doug Ford wants to tear up the beautiful bike lanes that have been established in the City of Toronto over the last few years. These bike lanes, in combination with the generous provision of sites to pick up public bikes, are well used, and necessary to encourage people to get out of their cars and use public transit and bikes. Any measures to \"decrease gridlock\" just lead to more people travelling in cars and shortly thereafter, more gridlock - there are many studies establishing this in other cities around the world and in our own experience. Tearing up bike lanes won't help gridlock.\nI'm also completely opposed to the province having jurisdiction over decisions about whether to install bike lanes or remove them, over the wishes of the people who actually live in the city concerned. This is anti-democratic to its core.\nI speak as a fully employed senior who works downtown in Toronto. I avoid using my car whenever possible and get around very efficiently by walking and using the TTC. If the present bike lanes had been established when I was younger, I would have used them, but biking in traffic was always too terrifying for me to attempt in the past - these lanes are exactly what we need to get people like my younger self out of cars.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. I cycle on the Yonge cycle tracks about 6 days a week. If the cycle tracks are removed I will drive my car instead. Gridlock will get worse, not better, say the experts.\nI have researched the development proposals along Yonge between Bloor and  the block north of Davisville. There are 27 towers proposed with 8667 residential units. They will have parking for 2792 cars and 9380 bikes. Some of that parking will be for retail, such as the Canadian Tire site. That means that more than 5875 residential units, about 11,750 people (assuming 2 people per residence) will be using public transit or active transportation to travel along Yonge. Bottom line, there will be a huge increase in people wanting to get around by bike.\nWhere do we cyclists travel to? I do most of my shopping on or close to Yonge. Also, my dentist, doctors, financial adviser, bank and some restaurants are along Yonge. It would do absolutely no good to put the bike lanes on residential streets. Besides, there are no north/south residential streets close to Yonge between Bloor and Davisville. By the way, I am 79 years old.\n"

        "comment": "Do not spend tax dollars to remove any existing bike lanes!  That is a colossal waste of time and money and moves our city in the wrong direction. Climate change should be a top priority and more ways to get people out of their single driver cars should be your focus. More transit options, more pedestrian friendly zones and more bike lanes make cities more livable. Removing bike lanes won't eliminate gridlock, it will increase it. The result will be more traffic as bikers will drive when there is no safe way for them to commute by bike. Without bike lanes, cyclists die, or they ride on the sidewalk, creating issues for pedestrians.  I am a cyclist and driver. I carpool to work as it is not feasible or safe to bike. When travelling locally in and around my neighbourhood, I bike.  I use bike lanes regularly to run my errands and do my groceries.  Bike riding is good for the environment, and my health and it is a much nicer way to experience the city.  Please spend our money on education and healthcare. Removing and limiting bike lanes is not a priority for most people in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Studies have shown that cities with protected bike lanes see significant increases in bike ridership. This demonstrates that when people feel safe and supported, they are more likely to choose cycling over other forms of transportation.\nSafety: Bike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents with motor vehicles. This increased safety encourages more people to consider cycling as a viable mode of transportation.\nHealth and Fitness: With safer routes, more people are likely to take up cycling, which promotes physical activity and improves overall health.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Cycling reduces carbon emissions and helps decrease traffic congestion, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable urban environment.\nEconomic Impact: Cities with well-developed bike lanes often see increased local business activity, as cyclists are more likely to stop and shop locally.\nCommunity and Culture: Bike lanes foster a sense of community among cyclists and can make cities more livable and connected.\nMore people cycling in a city can lead to decreased vehicular traffic. Studies have shown that cities with robust cycling infrastructure often experience less traffic congestion and improved road safety for all users. Here are some reasons why:\nReduced Car Trips: When more people choose to cycle, there are fewer cars on the road, which directly reduces traffic congestion.\nEfficient Use of Space: Bicycles take up less space than cars, allowing for more efficient use of roadways and reducing overall traffic density.\nInduced Demand: Building more roads often leads to more traffic, a phenomenon known as induced demand. Conversely, creating bike lanes can encourage cycling and reduce the number of car trips.\nTraffic Calming: Bike lanes can act as traffic calming measures, slowing down car traffic and making streets safer for all users.\nEnvironmental and Health Benefits: Increased cycling reduces pollution and promotes healthier lifestyles, which can lead to broader societal benefits.\nShame on the Ontario government for considering disallowing future bike lanes and exceptionally for considering removing existing lanes. This is a HUGE WASTE of tax-payer money!\n"

        "comment": "I cannot believe how much time and money is being spent by the provincial government to overturn the wishes of the citizens of Toronto. This whole exercise just illustrates how unserious Doug Ford is about tackling real issues such as health care and education. Spending my tax dollars to remove infrastructure that I supported (via voting for my municipal councillor), is a slap in the face and will be remembered during the next provincial election. Quite frankly data has shown that the dedicated bike lanes on Bloor are not causing congestion for commuters to downtown. We will still have cars lined up along Bloor W after the lanes are ripped out. Only then, we will also have bikes and cars sharing lanes, which data and time has shown to be more dangerous for both. This law is foolish, unnecessary, and a huge overreach by the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "I don\u2019t agree at all with this proposed legislation. I walk down Bloor Street everyday and I see the bike lanes in use. They make it safer for cyclists to get around without being seriously injured or killed by drivers. Why do you as a government care only for drivers? Shouldn\u2019t human life be prioritized over convenience for drivers?\nFurthermore, I have read the evidence that says that bike lanes actually increase sales in local businesses, not hurt them as you claim (CBC News, 2024). The evidence also shows that bike lanes actually reduce congestion. So, removing bike lanes to add more car lanes is not the solution to congestion. Why not focus more on improving public transportation? Additionally, the money spent removing the bike lanes would be an egregious waste. Why are you prioritizing spending government money on undoing infrastructure instead of focusing on health care, education, or housing (all issues that are severely underfunded)? I ask you to reconsider and remove this legislation before it leads to serious injury or death for Ontario citizens.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of downtown Toronto who frequently walks, bikes, takes public transit, and drives, I am deeply concerned about the recent discussions surrounding the removal of bike lanes from our city streets. The assertion that bike lanes cause gridlock is not only unfounded but also overlooks the true causes of traffic congestion in our city. This argument lacks credible data and fails to consider the multifaceted benefits that bike lanes bring to our urban environment.\nGridlock and Its True Causes\nThe primary cause of gridlock in downtown Toronto is not the presence of bike lanes, but rather the pervasive construction activities that dominate our streets. Major infrastructure projects, building developments, and road repairs are a constant sight in the city, significantly disrupting traffic flow. These necessary but often poorly managed construction projects create bottlenecks and detours, leading to congestion. Blaming bike lanes for gridlock is a misdirection that ignores the root problem.\nThe Benefits of Bike Lanes:\nPromoting Sustainable Transportation: Bike lanes encourage the use of bicycles as a viable mode of transportation, reducing the number of cars on the road. This shift towards sustainable transportation not only alleviates traffic congestion but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment. A study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) found that protected bike lanes can increase bicycle traffic by up to 75% while decreasing car traffic [source: NACTO Protected Bike Lanes].\nEnhancing Safety for All Road Users: Dedicated bike lanes provide a safer space for cyclists, separating them from motor vehicle traffic. This separation reduces the risk of accidents and conflicts between cyclists and drivers, creating a safer environment for all road users, including pedestrians. A study published in the \"American Journal of Public Health\" showed that installing bike lanes on city streets can reduce the risk of injury for cyclists by up to 50% [source: Teschke, K. et al. (2012). Route Infrastructure and the Risk of Injuries to Bicyclists: A Case-Crossover Study].\nSupporting Public Health: Encouraging cycling as a mode of transportation promotes physical activity, which is essential for maintaining public health. Regular physical activity helps prevent chronic diseases, improves mental health, and boosts overall well-being. Bike lanes make cycling more accessible and appealing, encouraging more people to incorporate it into their daily routines. According to a report by the World Health Organization, increased cycling can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes [source: WHO Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT)].\nThe Lack of Credible Data\nDecisions to remove bike lanes are being made without any credible data to back up their validity. There is a lack of comprehensive studies or empirical evidence suggesting that bike lanes are the primary cause of traffic congestion. Policymakers must base their decisions on reliable data and consider the broader impacts on urban mobility, public health, and environmental sustainability.\nA Call for Informed Decision-Making\nAs a downtown Toronto resident, I urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the removal of bike lanes. Instead of dismantling infrastructure that promotes sustainable transportation and safety, efforts should be directed towards addressing the actual causes of gridlock, such as construction activities. Informed decision-making, grounded in credible data and a holistic understanding of urban dynamics, is essential for creating a livable and efficient city.\nIn conclusion, bike lanes do not cause gridlock. The congestion we experience is largely due to ongoing construction projects. Bike lanes are a critical component of a sustainable, safe, and healthy urban transportation network. Removing them would be a step backwards, undermining the progress we have made towards a more livable city. Let us focus on the real issues and work together to build a better Toronto for everyone.\nSincerely,\nM. McLean\n"

        "comment": "First and foremost,\nYOU are not my Premier! However I do believe in our \"somewhat\" democratic system. So I recognise your government's rule.  But it has become increasingly clear that you are still \"BIG BUTT HURT\" by not being elected Toronto's Mayor in 2014.  You and your government like to pride themselves on \"small government\" .... hands off.. \"par exemple\" with regards to establishing a province wide decree forcing cities to build \"fourplexes,\" and I quote\n\"I believe in letting municipalities determine what is good for their communities and what is not good for their communities,\" ..... \"I am going to leave that up to each municipality to decide because they know better than the province and the federal government,\".  Note that these comments were made less than 8 months ago.\nYet here we are, seven months later and your government proposing legislation that completely contradicts aforementioned claims. And YES  I am talking about the Bike lane issue.  WHO are you Ontario Government to A) say municipalities need your sign off for construction of bike lanes  and then to further be authoritarian B) try to pass legislation to remove existing lanes.\nYOU hide behind the guise of GRIDLOCK and commute times....which is such a straw man argument.  What causes congestion is A) not addressing the housing issue where in people can't afford to live in the cities they work, B) the fact that city planners 20 years ago couldn't foresee our lack of infrastructure and need for larger highways and more subways and commuter lines (not on you alone) C) Your dumb brother eliminating the car tax. D) your government extending a gas cut subsidy.  CITIES are a product of the people that live in them and build them 24/7, they are not meant to be a Mon -FRiday 9-5 drive through for commuters.  More should be done to encourage the use of Metrolinx, Carpooling and public transit usage. BIKE Lanes are not the problem, your kowtowing to \"single occupied, suburban living, commuting car drivers\" along with subway line construction that is 20 years too late, plus the lack of any incentive to encourage transit is the congestion problem.   These are my rebuttals and I offer the premier to debate me publically as soon as possible.  That is of course you truly are about being for and hearing all Ontarians.\n"

The new lanes have turned biking into the safest, fastest, and cheapest option for me to get around downtown.\nFrankly, the expanding bike infrastructure is one of the main reasons I'm considering staying in Toronto long term. It's a sign that infrastructure planning in Toronto is finally considering the people that have to live and walk around in it. If the government of Ontario is willing to rip up a decade of infrastructure improvement to score some cheap political points that's a clear enough signal for me to leave the province for good.\nFurthermore, a government that's been incapable of delivering any major infrastructure projects during its tenure has no business trying to get a say in municipal road infrastructure. This government should first figure out how to deliver the Eglinton crosstown and the Ontario line before engaging in more infrastructure work.\n"
