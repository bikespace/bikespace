        "comment": "Encouraging cycling is the one of the best thing any government can do, the science and logic is clear and proven.\nPeople safely cycling to work, school, shopping, entertainment and restaurants is good for their health, the environment and the economy.\nSafe cycling saves governments money by reducing health care costs and reducing wear and tear on roads caused by heavy vehicles.\nFewer cars on the road reduces congestion, bicycles take up 1/10 the space.  Providing a safe space for bikes takes large motor vehicles off the road.\nDon't waste tax dollars removing bike lanes, spend that money building more bike lanes like other successful cities around the world.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is an inappropriate waste of resources that will worsen the conditions it purportedly seeks to address, and make getting around more difficult for Ontarians, regardless of which mode they use. The removal of bike lanes is not grounded in any evidence and is likely to increase vehicular congestion (especially given the significant increase in cycling in Toronto, Ottawa and other large cities since the pandemic).\nPlanning for local transportation infrastructure should be primarily a municipal responsibility, and the unnecessary involvement of the Province will create inefficiency and reduce the ability of municipal governments to meet public needs in appropriate and responsive ways.\nI am also opposed to the concurrent legislation which will remove the Environmental Assessment process for Highway 413. The introduction of these two highly politicized pieces of legislation at the same time is less than transparent. In different ways, they undermine the environmental health of Ontario and privilege the interests of a small group at the expense of the overall wellbeing of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes won\u2019t resolve car congestion. That\u2019s an issue on every main street in the city whether there\u2019s a designated bike lane or not. The issue is the public transit options are limited and unreliable forcing city dwellers to cars and bikes. As population density increases the only transit option between the two that will maintain or reduce the level of traffic is bikes.\nRemoving the bike lanes on Bloor, one of the highly used designated bike routes, will reduce safety and only make traffic worse as bikers will not feel safe and be forced to cars and inefficient public transit. The proposal to remove the bike lanes on Bloor is quiet frankly shocking and would be a bad use of tax payer dollars.\nWe need to keep bike lanes in the city and continue to work to make biking a safer option. It is the most efficient way to get around the city as an able-bodied person. The more people who choose biking as transit will mean a reduction in car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I used to drive to work every day, just another vehicle on the road containing a single occupant because the transit system here in London, Ontario does not enable me to drop my boy at school and make it to work on time. There is a now a bike lane that I can take to work, and I use it every day. Drivers still have exceptionally wide lanes to drive along, and I and the other cyclists that I see daily on my commute have a safer commuting experience. Doug Ford really needs to \"stay in his lane\" as it were and stop micromanaging cities that are actually trying to improve life for their residents. Tearing up bike lanes--similar to the EV charging stations that Ford tore up and ultimately replaced many of--is a big step backwards. I don't want Ford's meddling to force me back into my car and really wish our local bike lane network could be expanded.\n"

        "comment": "This bill - when pertaining specifically to bike lanes - does not follow the majority of the research and studies done that focus around the social and economic impact of bike lanes and cyclists. The bill wants to make it harder for municipalities to self govern and plans to upload those duties to the provincial government when deciding how to implement bike lanes if a traffic lane will be impacted. When bike lanes are added there is an economic increase in the surrounding businesses as it is much easier to hop off a bike and into a shop than it is to find parking and then find your way to the same shop. This also has the ability to take motor vehicles off the road to help reduce gridlock.\nIn a year (2024) where we have had more cyclist fatalities than the past three years combined (2021-2023), does it make sense to reduce or eliminate protected bike lanes and cycle tracks that separate not only cars and cyclists, but also cyclists and pedestrians. Allowing Ontarians to have options when deciding how they want to traverse the cities they live in.\nGetting rid of bike lanes will just put bikes in the regular lanes and be a part of traffic causing more congestion as motor vehicles must give one meter space (measured from the extreme right of the motor vehicle to the extreme left of the bicycle) to pass safely according to the Highway Safety Act (Section 148 sub-section 6.1) which will turn the right most lane into a pseudo bicycle lane as cars would have to bob and weave around cyclists leading to increased potential for accidents with motor vehicles and cyclists but also motor vehicles and other motor vehicles.\nAs for the inclusion of the Highway 413 parts of the bill, they seem to be placed in there as the real reason for Bill 212 while the bike lane is deflecting and preying on the divide of cyclists, pedestrians, and motor vehicles to garner support. While at the same time allowing Highway 413 to be built with minimal restrictions including the lack of the democratic process outlined in Part II in the Environmental Bill of Rights \"despite the proposal being a type of proposal for an instrument that is classified by a regulation made under that Act (Environmental Bill of Rights).\" - Bill 212, Schedule 3, Section 13. Suppressing the voice of Ontarians and how they can shape their communities.\nAnd, as I read this, this provision would allow unlimited expansion of Highway 413 and no part will require the Environmental Bill of Rights Part II to be recognized. Allowing no recourse for Ontarians to have their voices heard if Highway 413 gets extended and impacts more of the Greenbelt and farmland than what is outlined currently. Reducing farm land when the cost of living crisis including groceries does not help Ontarians support each other by buying from local farmers and Ontarians will be forced to shop at large grocery retailers that will have to bring in food from all over the world and creating gridlock in the way of trucks moving all of those goods from shipping yards to warehouses and then to grocery stores.\n"

        "comment": "Keep the bike lanes and expand cycling infrastructure across the entire city. It is safer to have bike lanes and it will reduce emergency room visits and strain on the health care system. Not only that, but it is healthy for people to cycle and get exercise! It builds friendships and social support during a time of mental health crises and loneliness. It supports alternative business models and will improve the economy. It allows people to frequent more businesses and attractions in a more efficient way because you have dedicated laneways to get places expediently without interrupting traffic and causing accidents. You don't have to worry about parking lots either! Cycling is an important part of world-class city life. Every major world class city in Europe has robust cycling infrastructure because it benefits the people who live there. It is good for tourism, cuts down on people operating motor vehicles under the influence, and helps people appreciate the natural world and fun that living in a multicultural vibrant city has to offer. People from all over the city should be able to access bike lanes from their front doors all the way down to the heart of downtown Toronto. Cyclists should be able to safely ride from Rexdale to Blood street and the Danforth if they want. We must adapt with the times and make the important choices that will make this city more liveable for its taxpayers. We have been getting caught in endless cycles of stagnant wages and unaffordability, at least let us get exercise without being hit by cars!\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontarian who relies on bike lanes for daily commuting, I strongly oppose this bill proposal. Removing bike lanes from municipal roads would undermine years of progress toward creating safe, sustainable, and efficient transportation infrastructure in Ontario.\n1. Safety for All Road Users\nBike lanes provide a crucial buffer between cyclists and motorists, reducing the risk of collisions. Eliminating bike lanes would force cyclists into vehicle traffic, endangering both groups and increasing the likelihood of accidents. This would also discourage people, including families and children, from choosing active transportation, which should be encouraged for public health and environmental benefits.\n2. Support for Green and Active Transportation\nOntario has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable urban development. Bike lanes enable more people to choose cycling over driving, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. This proposal contradicts these goals and moves us away from the future we need to build.\n3. Economic and Health Benefits\nCycling infrastructure has been shown to support local businesses by increasing accessibility and foot traffic. Moreover, cycling contributes to healthier communities by reducing reliance on cars, lowering healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles, and improving air quality.\n4. Equity and Accessibility\nBike lanes provide affordable and accessible transportation options for Ontarians, especially in areas where public transit options are limited. Removing this infrastructure disproportionately affects low-income individuals who rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation.\nI urge decision-makers to consider the long-term impacts of this proposal on safety, sustainability, and equity. Rather than dismantling bike lanes, we should be expanding and improving them to support a greener and healthier Ontario.\nSincerely,\nDia\n"
