You know, that the only way to solve crushingly busy highways and roads is to get people off them. Make active and public transport even more attractive by making it easier. This way, the roads will free up. You can't keep on adding lanes. Listen to the urban planning experts, please.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 would be a total step backwards for Ontario. I live in Hamilton and this bill would negatively impact my everyday life. I do not have a car and cannot take public transportation, so I have to ride my bicycle everywhere I need to go. I ride my bike to work, to grocery shop, to the library, to doctor appointments, to the dentist, to social events. That means I have to ride my bike on main roads to get to work, doctor's appointments, grocery stores, social events. Having bicycle routes away from the main roads adds unnecessary time and length to my commute, which is already challenging. I feel like Doug Ford is targeting low income Ontarians with this bill, as not everyone can afford a car with insurance or even a monthly bus pass.\nInfrastructure for bicyclists saves lives. It is scary enough riding a 30lb bicycle on the same roads as vehicle weighing more than a ton. There are plenty of studies proving that bicycle lanes do not increase traffic time. I think Doug Ford should ride a bicycle a few kilometers to complete a couple of errands to experience the cyclists point of view. I will continue to be vocal about this important topic.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to express my displeasure with this bill.  Firstly, it seems like a municipal affair that the province has decided to intervene in, something that is against the conservative value of small government -- probably one of the most compelling reasons to vote conservative.  It also seems senseless on so many other levels; it is using tax dollars to remove quality infrastructure, and it is actively making the development of alternative transportation options harder.\nAs a young Canadian, the cost of living is already high and being able to get around town without spending 10s of thousands on a car + gas, maintenance, and insurance is extremely valuable.  Unfortunately, it isn't really safe to bike in a lot of cities and towns in the province so I would have expected the province to be trying to move in the opposite direction of this bill.  Helping to put fewer cars on the road by giving people more options is how you fix traffic and make roads safer.\nBest of luck, I hope this idea fails.\nCheers.\n"

In fact, they improve it. They also improve businesses. The BIA on Bloor is in FAVOUR of bike Lanes.\nThis legislation is going to:\n - Cause people to die\n- Be worse for business\n- Not improve traffic\nThis total lack of logic is not something I'm surprised by from this government, but it is nonetheless, disappointing.\nDoug Ford should \"stick to his knitting.\"\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives and reduce traffic congestion. Studies around the world have proven that bike lanes reduce traffic. Canadian cities are already lagging far behind European cities in terms of pedestrian, cycling, and public transit infrastructure. Removing bike lanes will not solve any traffic congestion problems. The theory of induced demand shows that more lanes actually lead to more cars. Ontario can and should be a model of excellent urban infrastructure for the rest of Canada. This proposal will bring us backwards, not forwards. It\u2019s upsetting to see the Ford government blatantly ignoring the evidence in favour of bike lanes (for all people - drivers included). The government would be far better served completing transit projects on time to reduce construction instead of wasting taxpayer money ripping up existing, safe bike infrastructure.\n"

Bike lanes save commuters so much time, its a greener alternative and they should be provided safely. There are even city bikes for gods sake!!\n"

        "comment": "The premier's decision to remove bike lanes in a major metropolitan center, bike lanes which provide safety and ease of transport for thousands of Torontonians seems both illogical and vindictive.\nThe number of studies that were conducted, and pilots run before construction even began on bike lanes on major routes was exhaustive and to throw all that work away for drivers who have alternate means of getting around downtown seems to be an incredible waste of taxpayer money.\nIf the premier wishes to focus on reducing congestion his time and money would be better spent addressing the many transit projects in limbo currently (Eglinton Crosstown, Finch West LRT) instead of riling up anti-cyclist sentiment in a community which uses these bike lanes every day and is already in danger due to lack of cycling infrastructure.\nShame on Doug Ford and shame on the provincial conservative government.\n"

        "comment": "I've been able to follow most of this government's policies, but this one is completely backwards. Bike lanes get people off the roads. My partner and I came from midtown Toronto, where, thanks to the installation of bikes lanes, we hardly needed to drive our car, and hardly did.\nNow that we're in North York, the roads are too dangerous for biking so people are speeding on the sidewalks. I've been hit by an electric bike on the sidewalk.\nThe community is thrilled with the construction of bike lanes. We can't wait to stop driving our car for trips under 5km.\nDo what you want with the gridlock on the highways. Please stay out of our cities. Incentivize transit and bike lanes if you really care about traffic. That's how world class cities function.\n"

These lanes are critical for cyclist safety, preventing accidents and saving lives. Eliminating them will do nothing to reduce traffic congestion\u2014bike lanes encourage efficient transportation by giving cyclists a safe alternative to driving. This bylaw not only wastes public resources spent on the new infrastructure but also jeopardizes the safety of countless residents. I strongly oppose this reckless measure and urge the government to reconsider in the interest of protecting lives and supporting a safer, more accessible city for everyone.\n"

The hundreds of people that use the bike lanes every hour will either use cars now and add to the traffic, or bike on the road as is their legal right when there is no bike lane.\nWhy don\u2019t you use your time doing your provincial job - maybe try to fix our dismal health care or affordable housing crisis.\n"

This proposal is a shameless way to shove through Highway 413, a highway that no one wants and will only enrich construction companies. More highways only result in more cars. As a citizen of Ontario, this proposal is insulting and a waste of everyone\u2019s time, energy and money.\n"
