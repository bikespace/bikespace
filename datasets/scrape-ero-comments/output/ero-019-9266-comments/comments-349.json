Stop wasting yours and our time and more importantly the money we don't have with useless ideological distractions and get back to work fixing the much much bigger problems at hand.\nAren't conservatives supposed to be hand off type of party? Stay in your lane and concentrate on issues affecting us on a much larger scale.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto, indeed, has a traffic problem. Reducing bike lanes and thereby widening streets is not the answer to gridlock.  Wider and more traffic lanes, as study after study has shown, invite MORE traffic. The answer to reducing gridlock requires a multi-pronged approach:\n- more GO transit\n- more buses\n- more subways\n- more trains\n- GO train between Kitchener and Toronto\n- enhance pedestrian opportunities\n- more bicycle lanes\n- divert traffic out of downtown and the 401. Buy the 407 back\nAs much as possible, encourage all forms of transportation that minimizes use of the car. Fewer cars leads to less gridlock.\nSupporting and using alternate forms of transportation will go a long way in reducing fossil fuel use and achieving climate goals. In this time of increasing numbers of floods, droughts, tornadoes, and resultant disruptions to peoples' lives, this is imperative.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is shortsighted and an active danger to me and others in my community. The proposal only cites the need for drivers to go wherever they want to quickly, but fails to mention other road users who want and need the same. People on cycles also need to go wherever they need to quickly and safely, and this proposal acts against that.\nAs for requiring provincial approval for new installations, this would make sense if the province owned the road. Why is the province meddling in something that the city should be managing? The city knows best for their own roads, because they are accountable to all stakeholders for a road, including those who don't just drive through the area. They also consider the needs of residents and locals, who may not necessarily drive on that road but instead walk, cycle, or take public transport.\nThe proposal to specifically target Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St in Toronto is particularly ludicrous. I live, work, and go out to those streets, especially those areas with cycle lane installations. Having lived in Etobicoke for over 20 years, I can genuinely say that these areas have all improved drastically after the cycles lanes went in. Those places have less noise from cars, more options to get around, and have a more pleasant environment than when cars dominated those places. A Progressive Conservative government committing to regression on a project that made a street much more pleasant than before while also wasting taxpayer money to rip up infrastructure is an irony that is impossible to miss here.\n"

        "comment": "The decision to add or remove bike lanes should not be made at a provincial level and with no regard for the research into their viability that exists. The City is best placed to understand the dynamics of traffic. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion; construction is. And the existence of bike lanes makes my commute to downtown from the west end much faster and safer. Drivers are already careless in terms of the rules of the road and their concern for pedestrian and bike safety. Without lanes for bikes to ride somewhat protected, it will be much more dangerous.\nAlso, what a waste of money to put in bike lanes that more and more people are using, just to rip them out. You should not blame bike lanes for bad infrastructure design and policy.\nHistory will not look favourably on the government that removes bike lanes in favour of cars. Especially not at a time when our climate is changing because of, among other things, greenhouse gases to which driving is a significant contributor.\n"

What evidence does the government have to suggest that: 1) motorists want to drive in the same lane as cyclists?; 2) that cyclists and motorists using the same lane will reduce congestion?; 3) that the shared use of lanes will be as safe as separated traffic? How many cyclists are expected to die as a result of these changes?\n"

The Bloor bike lane is also the only way my son can get to high park on his own from our house (ossington to high park).\nThere has been no concrete evidence put forward to support this bill, or on the impact of the businesses and residents affected by this bill with the decision to remove existing bike lanes that taxpayers have paid to install and regularly use. There is no evidence on the impact of this bill to even reducing congestion, and there is no thought of its impact on the environment. The audacity of this bill being put forward and having specific arteries in Toronto targeted in order to fulfill a personal agenda of the premier is clear evidence of a government that doesn't work for everybody, and stinks of corruption.\n"

What data is being analyzed to understand whether the associated costs will generate a proportional return for Toronto citizens? Why are none of these studies/data mentioned?\nUntil the Ministry can do professional work for the benefit and safety of the Toronto population, I'm against spending taxpayers' money on this.\nKeep the bike lanes until real work is done to understand the leading causes of congestion and how to resolve the problem in a future-proof way.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is concerning for cyclists in Toronto, as it overlooks the critical benefits bike lanes bring to safety, sustainability, and affordability. Bike lanes are essential to the city\u2019s transit network, providing an affordable, eco-friendly commuting option that eases congestion and reduces emissions. Removing these lanes would push more people into cars, driving up gridlock and pollution\u2014ultimately working against Ontario\u2019s goals.\nBike lanes on key routes like Bloor, Yonge, and University have also boosted local businesses and improved safety for cyclists and pedestrians alike. Research consistently shows that protected lanes encourage cycling, lowering car dependency and reducing transportation costs for many residents. By shifting decision-making power from local governments to provincial oversight, this proposal threatens Toronto\u2019s ability to design transit solutions that meet local needs and support affordability.\nInstead of dismantling progress, we should invest in expanding cycling infrastructure, creating a safer, greener, and more affordable city for everyone.\n"

I don't even bike myself, but I'm begging the government: Please do not take away the bike lanes from my neighbourhood.\nThe stretch of Bloor near me has never worked better. The street feels so much safer with the bike lanes on it. This is a family neighbourhood, with lots of small children and elderly people walking around. The bike lanes help insulate the sidewalks they use from cars, and the bits of curb separating the lanes make it easier to cross the street safely.\nThere are also a ton of local restaurants in the area who rely on cyclists to deliver their food. Giving those delivery drivers a dedicated lane means they're not blocking up a lane of car traffic or driving down the sidewalk.\nPlease respect our neighbourhood and leave our main street alone. The bike lanes work and we want to keep them.\n"
