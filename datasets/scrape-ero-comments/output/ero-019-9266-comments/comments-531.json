        "comment": "I use bike lanes. I live in downtown Toronto. I do not own a car. The removal of these critical, widely used bike lanes would be a net negative, reducing the quality of life for myself and thousands of others in Toronto. Such a removal would just be an extension of provincial government overreach, and another reason helping convince me that I should permanently move out of Ontario.\nI am highly educated, top 10% income earner, and I would wager that many that feel the same would fall in the same cohort. Alienating and losing us would be a significant loss for the province -- which is already experiencing increasing brain drain -- a loss both in terms of tangible tax revenue, as well as the more intangible benefits of having an educated, diverse, urban population contributing to the province's economic output.\nBike lanes save lives. Bike lanes are inevitable in a rapidly developing, dense urban city. Enacting policy to further entrench car dependency in our cities is extremely myopic, and will not serve to reduce congestion from single-occupant automobiles, but rather just increase the capacity for such, and consequently, increase province's emissions per capita.\nThe province should instead focus on encouraging alternative transportation methods to reduce congestion, such as public transit, walking, and yes, biking, while also leaving municipalities decades long investments into infrastructure intact.\nIf the provincial government wants Ontario to be \"open for business,\" it should recognize that Toronto is already behind when compared to other \"world-class\" cities; objectively regressing in our infrastructure will do the opposite of what we want to do in order to provide a compelling case for businesses, engineers, academics, artists, etc., to want to come to Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is draconian and an incredible overreach of provincial power. This bill would do nothing to solve grid lock and instead promote worse traffic across the entire province. Forcing municipalities to request approval from the province for something as trivial as a bike lane would simply discourage any new bicycle infrastructure, a fact that I\u2019m sure is not unknown to the authors. Never has adding an extra lane solved traffic. I urge that this bill be rejected and its supporters take a hard critical rethink of their position.\n"

        "comment": "This is a matter that is best left to local government to address. The proposed legislation is a constitutional overreach that is, on its face, paternalistic. It is made worst by the fact that it ignores city-building best practices, data and the needs and desires of local residents, such as my partner (an ER doctor at the hospitals on University Avenue who uses the bike lanes, including to respond to urgent calls) and myself (a professional who uses bike lanes every day to commute to work).\nBefore the bike lanes downtown on Yonge, Bloor and University, we didn\u2019t feel safe enough to bike. By removing them, these changes will lead to slower and dangerous commutes, which will impact cyclists. These changes will also impact the people the cyclists who are serving, who may be a sick child or senior citizen in an emergency room.\nWe implore you to remember this fact as you weigh the implementation of this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing in response to the requests for feedback regarding Bill 212.\nWith all due respect, this rather aggressive and reckless approach to the removal of bike lanes is not a sustainable solution, and it will do very little to address traffic congestion in the long-term due to the known concept of induced demand and the bulky geometry of motor vehicles.\nWhile there may be temporary relief to traffic flow should the bike lanes be removed, the reality is that many downtown arterial curb lanes outside of peak hours had previously been occupied by parked vehicles, effectively reducing the road's capacity to a single lane in each direction at most times (see any Google Street View imagery of Bloor prior to 2016).\nMoreover, there was no guarantee that a parking space would be available at any given moment, well before the bike lanes were installed. For those who absolutely must be driven to their destinations along Bloor and Danforth, for instance, there are already many public parking lots parallel to the corridors and ample parking available within a 250-metre walk along perpendicular streets.\nFor those who are unable to cycle, it is also important to consider that the vast majority of commuters along those corridors are situated underground rather than on the roadways. The double-tracked subway lines along Bloor-Danforth have a capacity of 500,000 passengers (https://web.archive.org/web/20221128201644/https://ttc-cdn.azureedge.ne\u2026), whereas a 2-lane road can often only accommodate 43,200 vehicles per day, but only under uninterrupted traffic conditions (https://youtu.be/kqOxBZJ6c1g?si=ZoXptxdjb34SEWtG). Most urban traffic counts fall short of this figure dur to frequent stoppages, and most cars also contain only a single occupant during peak hours.\nRestoring an additional vehicular lane for the sake of parking availability or throughput will do little to improve upon the current status quo. Even if restored, vehicular through traffic will not patronize local businesses any more than cyclist or foot traffic. Due to the difficulty of finding legal parking spaces on a regular basis, it is much easier to facilitate cyclist/foot traffic, particularly in the dense, walkable neighbourhoods within the central city, and the data often shows that increased patronage from patios generates much more revenue than a stationary, empty vehicle (https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/11/22/torontos-curbside-patios\u2026).\nShort of demolishing existing buildings or sidewalks to create more lanes, it is simply not practical to continue to encourage private motor vehicle use in Toronto. The city's streets simply do not have an adequate supply of space to accommodate a further influx of motor vehicles, be it in live lanes or on-street parking, therefore alternative modes of transport must seriously be considered. This is the only solution to traffic congestion.\nIt is also important to note that most adult cyclists also happen to drive regularly, yet they continue to choose not to cycle in the city due to safety reasons, The residents of Toronto should be given fair, viable alternatives to driving, and the removal of bike lanes has a direct negative impact to the viability of cycling as a mode of transportation within urban areas.\nDecision-makers should also consider the deaths of 6 cyclists in Toronto in 2024 alone, many of which are preventable with proper, protected cycling infrastructure (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/30-road-deaths-in-2024-vision-ze\u2026). In recent years, dangerous driver behaviours have become increasingly prevalent, with abrupt swerving, distracted driving, and even intentional collisions being major causes for concern.\nMany cyclists, particularly commuters, are not only trying to reach their destination on time, but they are also trying to reach their destination in one piece without the unnecessary added security of 1500 kg of metal to transport a single occupant.\nRelegating cyclists to circuitous, indirect side streets further cements cycling as a merely recreational activity and not a viable alternative to driving, not to mention there are little to no such routes crossing freeways such as the 427 and 401, or ravines such as the Humber and Don River Valleys.\nCycling also happens to be a mode of transport with a low barrier to entry, due to a considerably lower mandatory principal and no recurring fuel/insurance costs associated with vehicle ownership.\nRemoving existing protected bike lane infrastructure would further raise this barrier to entry and will continue to label it as a mere pastime for experienced sports cyclists rather than casual riders trying to reach their destination safely.\nIn a modern-day urban environment, the choice to choose the safest and most efficient mode of transport should be prioritized, not the convenience of motor vehicles. This is the premise behind \"complete streets\".\nIn conclusion, as an urban cyclist, commuter, and occasional driver, I implore the government to reconsider what is quite frankly a regressive approach to solving congestion.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "As as a driver myself, I understand the frustration of the traffic delays on our roads today.\nI do not agree that removing or restricting bike lanes is answer to the problem.\n1. With the removal of bike lanes, cyclists will face reduced safety on the roads. We need to make our province safer, not more dangerous. Imagine getting a call that YOUR 13 year old daughter was killed while riding her bicycle. This is a devastating situation that happened just 2 days ago, however it is not an isolated incident (links below).\nRemoving or preventing safety measures that could prevent these incidents is unconscionable and the Ontario government will be responsible for future fatalities\n2. To combat unsafe road conditions cyclists will have a few options options: ride on the sidewalk, or move into the traffic lane.  Cycling on the sidewalk is illegal, and already a problem that becomes dangerous for everyone.  However, they don't move fast enough to functionally integrate into car traffic and thus will further delay our roads.  Finally, they may opt to join the traffic lane in a vehicle.  If the road is determined to be too unsafe to cycle on, we will add countless additional vehicles to the road.  The video below gives an idea of how much that would impact our already slow roads.  Honestly, the better the cycling infrastructure, the less traffic congestion we will face on the roads - this has been tested across multiple global studies (epub below)\nGiven that this is proven a life or death matter, I will consider this as a key issue for future elections\n"

        "comment": "A few weeks ago, I travelled to Toronto from my home 2 hours north, visiting Queen's Park to speak to MPPs about our healthcare system. I parked my car at a friend's house in Parkdale and used Toronto Bike Share to ride downtown to my hotel. During my 2 day stay, I made multiple trips by bicycle including on University Ave., Bloor St. W. and College St. to meetings, and to return to Parkdale. The trips I took were efficient and the cost to use the bike share economical.  I enjoyed seeing Toronto streetlife and interacting with other people. There was one less car on the road for those trips as a result.\nI routinely cycle for shorter trips where I live and use the bike share system and bike lanes when I travel to the 'City'.  My experience has been consistently positive. The cycling infrastructure where I live, in other Ontario cities I have visited, and especially in Toronto, has improved significantly in the past decade as has the ridership.\nMy experience commuting by bicycle, has been that riders are very courteous and recognize that everyone else, like them, is trying to get somewhere safely and efficiently. Along University Ave., College St. and Bloor Street in the late afternoon on Monday Oct. 21, the bike lanes were busy as were the traffic lanes but everyone was moving. There were noticeably more electric bikes on the streets and, as it was the only option available on one occasion, I had the opportunity to try one while in Toronto. I enjoyed the trip.\nRemoving bike lanes, as is being proposed by Bill 212, is misguided in my opinion and not supported by evidence.  Bike lanes do not cause congestion, cars do.  Cycling is a transportation option that is affordable, good for personal and social health and reduces space demands and wear/maintenance costs on roads. Local businesses benefit from increased movement of people in proximity to where the money is spent. A personal motor vehicle is expensive to own and operate which many people cannot afford. Parking personal vehicles uses up valuable space which could be used for other purposes (such as housing) and is an opportunity cost. Bike lanes are safer for cyclists and help separate bicycles and pedestrians, which is better for all.\nTraffic planning and road design needs to take into consideration many factors to ensure that people can move about efficiently.  These decisions should be made by those with expertise and based on evidence.  Bill 212, and in particular the addendum to arbitrarily identify Bloor St, College St. and University Ave for removal, is not based on evidence and will waste tax dollars unnecessarily.\nEnsuring transportation planning decisions are based on factual information, and made by people with the knowledge and understanding of the multifactorial implications of how people move, is necessary if we are to get people where they need to go. The interactions between infrastructure design, societal health, our environment and our economy (People, Planet, Prosperity) need to be taken into consideration. These design decisions should be made by planning experts in consultation with local municipalities, and not politicians.\nThe provincial government should stay in its own lane, or perhaps trying riding the bike lane. Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock or save people time and is a distraction from addressing the real issues - sprawl, inadequate public transit and a societal dependence on an expensive, unhealthy mode of transport for daily activities. Cycling will not be for everyone however bike lanes are part of the solution to getting people safely where they need to go.\n"

This bill solely reflects a car-centric and individualist ideology that reflects the needs of suburban dwellers when accessing the city through means that are currently most convenient to them. To truly reduce gridlock in the GTA, we need better intercity transit options. In lieu of the time, energy, and money invested in this bill, the province should be investing money in GO transit and other transit agencies across the province.\nComplete streets and the biking infrastructure on Bloor, Yonge, and University are reflective of the needs of the residents of the City of Toronto, with the needs of not only current residents but also future residents in mind. What's also astonishing is how the removal of these bike lanes would  contradict the city and province's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMost importantly, the removal of bike lanes will put vulnerable road users at a greater risk of injury and death. To be considering this bill following the deadliest year for cyclists in the city shows a blatant disregard for the safety of cyclists. To prioritize the convenience and time of some over the wellbeing and lives of others will be remembered as a terribly selfish abuse of power.\nI urge the province to reconsider this bill.\n"

The use of bike lanes has been proven to reduce emissions, reduce car congestion, increase people's health through an active life style, make for safer streets through less deadly collisions, and more.\nMoving away from these bike lanes is the wrong thing to do. It is a backwards move to generate more car friendly infrastructure. We should not create a higher incentive for people to bring personal vehicles into the most densely populated areas of a city. It should be a place for business and people, not cars.\nIf anything wants to be changed, it has to be done through actual data driven decision. This bill specifically targets some bike lanes without any in-depth analysis of the issue.\nThis bill shows a complete lack of understanding of the people's need when travelling around the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a net positive for any city, regardless of the population.\nI urge you to review this decision and take inspiration from European cities instead of American cities when doing urban planning.\n"

        "comment": "As a matter of concept and principle, there is a reason why decisions about the day-to-day functioning of cities is made at a municipal level and not by the province - local government is closer to the day-to-day realities of its residents and best able to respond to them. Municipal representatives are also more directly responsible to their citizens. The province should not be overturning the will of the people of Toronto as expressed through their elected representatives, not that it has stopped this government before. Perhaps significant matters of grave provincial and national import - such as ensuring the citizenry has enough housing - would warrant such an intrusion. I believe on this subject, however, that the Premier has indicated he believes municipalities know best. But apparently having enough houses so that people can live in Toronto is not as important as bike lanes on three streets in the city. If the Province really wants to reduce traffic in Toronto perhaps it can finish the many-years overdue Eglington Crosstown it is responsible for.\nThe Minister has repeatedly asserted that this is an \"evidence-based\" policy. Beyond some spurious and out of date census data, he has not produced anything of the kind. Meanwhile BikeShare Toronto continues to break records for daily use and tens of thousands of cyclists use safe, secure bicycle lanes every day. Also curiously absent from any discussion or debate on this matter is how many more Torontonians will die each year from avoidable bicycle accidents on account of the province's capriciousness. Perhaps that doesn't count as \"evidence.\"\nThe purpose of a city is not to enable faster through-traffic for suburban commuters, it is to create a livable place for the people that reside it. This proposed legislation makes a mockery of this. I would suggest there must be some better culture war wedge issues the Premier and Minister can gin up to waste taxpayer money and make citizens lives worse, but I suppose they are already trying a bunch of those too. This is is a disgrace.\n"
