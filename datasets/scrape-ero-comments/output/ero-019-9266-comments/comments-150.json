        "comment": "1. This legislation will cost the lives of people trying to bike from place to place who will be in greater danger of being struck by cars.\n2. This legislation will not reduce gridlock. Removing a few bike lanes will come nowhere close to meeting the latent demand for increased lanes of traffic. You have to meet that demand with sustainable, regular, and reliable forms of driving alternatives (which will have the knock-on effect of actually reducing the amount of drivers on the road and reducing gridlock).\n3. The province should leave municipal decisions to municipalities and their ELECTED governments. It is very undemocratic for the province to step in on this issue and it subverts the will of municipal residents.\n4. Why, when there are so many issues in Ontario including an underfunded healthcare system, is the province engaged in the drastic inefficiency of ripping up an existing project, wasting both the money initially spent on the bike lanes and the money spent to take them out?\n"

Let cities build their infrastructure as they see fit, for the people that live there. If people outside of those cities have issues with getting where they need to by car, then the solution is to build better mass transportation solutions rather than make things more difficult and UNSAFE for the LOCALS that LIVE there.\n"

        "comment": "This is such a terrible idea. This is backwards thinking. While every other city in this world builds more cycling infrastructure, you're removing it. We need more cyclists and bike lanes, not fewer. There are plenty of reasons to support cyclists:\n- Cyclists will keep using their bikes. But now they won't be protected anymore and even more cyclists will be killed by cars and trucks.\n- You will also harm the enviroment further by promoting car dependency.\n- The footprints of bicycles and bike lanes are a lot smaller than those of cars.\n- Cyclists support small businesses much more than car drivers. Car drivers shop at big box stores where they find convenient parking spots.\n- Not everyone can afford a vehicle, e.g. students, they need a mode of transportation too.\n-Removing existing bike lanes causes additional and totally unnecessary costs.\nPlease, please, PLEASE: You need to PROMOTE cycling, not trying to prevent it.\n"

        "comment": "No reduction in traffic will be observed by removing viable alternatives to motor vehicles. Counter-intuitively, this will instead exacerbate the problem, for the same reason that adding additional lanes only temporarily alleviates issues. The phenomenon is known as \"induced demand\" and is well-studied.\nThat's for those who choose to switch from using a bicycle to using a car: for those who choose to continue to use a bicycle, they'll no longer have a dedicated lane and will have to share the lane with other cars, forcing all vehicles to move at the speed of the average cyclist.\n"

        "comment": "The idea that removing bike lanes would help ease congestion is a laughable and illogical excuse for provincial government overreach. Why are we so concerned with bike lanes when it has been objectively shown that active transportation and accessible public transportation are actual solutions to traffic issues? Let alone the environmental and safety impact of having fewer cars on roads. And why is this coming from the provincial government?\nI do not understand why the focus isn't on reducing the number of cars on roads, as that would actually help with gridlock. The provincial government does not seem bothered by that and wants to stick to induced demand. What is it with this government's need to make decisions based on anything but actual data?\nPlease stop meddling in municipal politics to implement absurd policies for what feels like the sole purpose of getting a headline.\n"

        "comment": "I'd like you to consider the needs of all road users in a balance way. Even among staunch bike lane detractors in Etobicoke centre, there are those of us, who do not share the view point of the vocal group of Kingsway residents.\nAnd not all of us who are cyclists and walkers, and subway users have been motivated financially or politically in any way. We just think it is healthier to move your body, especially as we age.\nI am a driver and the car user, but I do not drive into the city. I try not to drive on Bloor Street and if I happen to find myself in my car on Bloor, I do not automatically get enraged that I am a little slowed down by the existence of bike lanes.\nI understand that the drivers' population and the number of cars have grown exponentially in Toronto and no matter how many more lanes for cars are added it will not solve the gridlock.\nThe only way is to encourage more alternative to cars transportation. Therefore it is important to make MORE not less bike lanes, to build the infrastructure so when the mass of cars reaches the critical point, people will finally start using bicycles and transit.\nAlso for safety of the cyclist, the separated full lanes are crucial. Forget the half assed lane on Royal York. It needs to be widened so cyclists like myself aren't almost brushed against by buses. It is literally terrifying to ride on that stretch of Royal York where the bike \"lane\" is half size.\nWe do not longer live in the 1960s. Our city has to adapt, and yes, the change has come to the enclave of Etobicoke.\nIn order to motivate and encourage people you need to form alliances with schools (why kids here do not cycle to school is mind boggling) and health practitioners who will all tell you the same thing: move your body. Isn't everyone counting the steps already?\nWe need infrastructure in place so when people change their minds and decide to be healthy it is there for them.\nWe need more bike lanes:\nalong Eglinton east to west\nalong Yonge all the way north from Bloor St.\nalong Royal York all the way north from Bloor St.\nWe need more Bikeshare stations everywhere especially north of Bloor.\nTo the detractors at that meeting who whistled and booed and made rude comments about speakers being bought by cycling advocates, I say: open your eyes, get out of your car. Nobody paid me to cycle, I do it because I like it and I love the bike lanes of Bloor. They made it possible for me to do 40+ trips this summer. I cycled to:\n1. Music garden on Harbourfront to hear a concert\n2. Tree festival in Marie Curtis park where I volunteered\n3. 3 times to see a film at the TIFF festival downtown\n4. many times partially to work. I can't go the whole way as there is no bike lane past Davisville on Yonge St. Badly needed.\n4. and countless other times to commute to downtown Toronto without having to use my car\nPlease keep the bike lanes everywhere they are already and make more of them. Leave the car at home.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible plan that will further contribute to our growing traffic, health care, and environmental problems. Please stop wasting taxpayer money on this nonsense and focus on the solutions we really need: public healthcare, education, and transit.\nThe only real long-term solution to the traffic problem (in Toronto, Ottawa, and beyond) is effective transit and improved infrastructure for active transportation.\nReview active transportation plans in the Netherlands and make note of the low prevalence of lifestyle related illnesses (e.g., heart disease, type 2 diabetes) and mental illness (e.g., depression) in their population as compared to Canada and the United States. As our population continues age, we need long term solutions to reduce the burden on our health care system.\nThe best bang for our buck is active transportation.\nThe following excerpts are taken from Fishman et al., 2015 (see attached):\n\u201cThe Netherlands is widely regarded as a world leader in active transport, particularly cycling with 16% of the total road network dedicated to cycle paths. A third of all trips under 7.5 km are cycled.\u201d\n\u201cPhysical activity is increasingly regarded as the \u2018best buy\u2019 in preventative health measures and walking and cycling represent one of most effective methods of building physical activity into daily life, whilst at the same time reducing CO2 emissions, air pollution and congestion caused by motorised forms of transport.\u201d\nDo better.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are crucial for many residents. They're not just a luxury but a necessity, especially for those who can't afford cars. Most people using the bike lanes in Toronto are not using it for recreational purposes but to get safely to work and school. Delivery drivers, people on limited budgets, and others rely on bikes and public transit to get around. As the cost of living rises, more people are turning to these alternatives.\nBike lanes can help reduce traffic congestion. The more cars on the road, the worse the traffic becomes. It's a vicious cycle. By encouraging people to bike, we can break this cycle, reducing congestion for everyone.\nInvesting in bike infrastructure is important. It benefits our health, safety, and environment. It's not just about convenience but also about addressing our city's challenges. Bike lanes are a practical solution that can improve Toronto. We need all levels of government to work together to make this happen.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is absolutely ridiculous. The provincial government has absolutely no authority to dictate what municipalities do with their roads or bike lanes. This is a huge overstepping of the provincial government's jurisdiction. The Planning Act states that the Province's interest is to \"the orderly development of safe and healthy communities\", \"the promotion of development that is designed to be sustainable, to support public transit and to be oriented to pedestrians\", and \"the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to a changing climate\".\nVehicle-only streets are a significant risk to the safety and health of communities both from an environmental health perspective (air pollution, noise pollution), as well as a road safety perspective - at least six cyclists and twelve pedestrians were killed by drivers in Toronto alone.\nRoad diets (Reducing the number of lanes to make more room for other road uses and pedestrian realm) greatly increase community safety and health, promote alternative means of transportation which REDUCES CAR TRAFFIC by having fewer people drive, and reduces noise and air pollution, positively contributing to reduction of GHG emissions.\nThe province should NOT be given the authority to dictate whether a municipality may add, remove, or replace car lanes in their own community. The municipality has the ability to decide based on its own community needs and impacts what course of action should be taken when implementing a cycling lane.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Minister,\nAs a physician who has served the people of Ontario for over 3 years, I feel compelled to address the recently proposed policy requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval before implementing new bicycle lanes that necessitate the removal of an existing lane of traffic.\nIn my professional capacity, I have witnessed a distressing surge in traumatic injuries and fatalities resulting from collisions between motor vehicles and cyclists. During my tenure here, the number of cyclists admitted to emergency rooms with life-altering injuries\u2014or worse, who have lost their lives\u2014has increased at an alarming rate. These are not mere statistics; they are individuals whose lives have been irrevocably changed, families torn apart by preventable tragedies.\nThis trend is symptomatic of a broader cultural issue: an antagonistic relationship between motorists and cyclists. Cyclists are inherently more vulnerable road users, lacking the protective barriers afforded to those in vehicles. By enacting policies that hinder the development of safe cycling infrastructure, we exacerbate this vulnerability and perpetuate a cycle of hostility and misunderstanding on our roads.\nThe proposed policy poses several significant concerns:\n1. Compromised Safety for Cyclists: Limiting the creation of dedicated bike lanes forces cyclists into regular traffic lanes, increasing the likelihood of accidents. This not only endangers their lives but also places additional strain on emergency medical services and healthcare facilities.\n2. Worsening Traffic Congestion: Contrary to the intention of reducing gridlock, integrating cyclists into vehicular lanes may actually impede traffic flow more than dedicated bike lanes would. Cyclists traveling at lower speeds can cause delays, leading to frustration among drivers and potential road rage incidents.\n3. Damaging Community Relations: Policies that neglect the needs of cyclists can foster resentment and deepen the divide between motorists and cyclists. This antagonism detracts from the sense of community and mutual respect that is essential for harmonious coexistence on our roads.\n4. Negative Environmental Impact: Discouraging cycling by making it less safe undermines efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote environmentally friendly modes of transportation.\n5. Economic Costs: The long-term healthcare costs associated with treating injured cyclists, as well as the economic impact of lost productivity, far outweigh the short-term benefits of maintaining additional lanes for motor vehicles.\nI urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider this policy in favor of a more balanced approach that prioritizes the safety and well-being of all road users. Possible alternatives include:\n- Investing in Comprehensive Cycling Infrastructure: Develop protected bike lanes that do not compromise existing traffic lanes but instead create a safe, efficient network for cyclists.\n- Implementing Road Sharing Education Programs: Educate both drivers and cyclists on road safety and the importance of mutual respect, reducing the cultural antagonism that currently exists.\n- Promoting Multi-Modal Transportation Solutions: Encourage the use of public transportation and cycling as viable alternatives to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact.\n- Data-Driven Decision Making: Base infrastructure decisions on comprehensive data analysis, considering not just immediate traffic flow but also long-term societal benefits and costs.\nIn conclusion, while the goal of reducing gridlock and improving transportation efficiency is commendable, it should not come at the expense of cyclist safety and community well-being. The proposed policy risks exacerbating existing problems and creating new ones, ultimately detracting from the quality of life for all Ontarians.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter.\n"
