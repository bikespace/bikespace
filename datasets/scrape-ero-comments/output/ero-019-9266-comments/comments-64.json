Municipalities have the resources to make local decisions, and this represents an egregious overreach by the province to legislate something that is simple not required.\nAdditionally, we need to refocus on preventing privitsation of healthcare, the hwy 413 monstrosity, science centre closure and corruption going on within the legislative body currently.

Worse, it will increase accidents and put cyclists at risk. This isn\u2019t a theory, this is evidenced by a multitude of studies. It\u2019s one thing to refuse to put in new bike lanes, but pulling out existing bike lanes is a colossal waste of taxpayer money.\n"

I use the bike lanes every single day and have vastly improved my commute time, productivity, and happiness. Grid lock is on accoutn of too many cars not too few highways. And on account of years or underpolicing traffic violations, such as the Toronto classic where people pull into the intersection instead of waiting until there is space for their vehicle on the other side; blocking the intersection is worse than a bike lane. Adding more freeways s only going to turn Ontario into cold weather Los Angeles, where the average commute time is over 2x that of Toronto, which is already the longest commute time in canada.\n"

This latest attack on cycling infrastructure is so clearly the provincial government\u2019s attempt to scapegoat vulnerable road users for an issue caused by their failure to meaningfully address real issues Ontarians face. Traffic issues caused by forced urban boundary expansion without investment into public or alternative transportation options will never be offset by making cycling less safe. It is not backed by any data or science. It is Conservatives again showing they\u2019d rather deflect blame to an imagined enemy rather than govern responsibly.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic is a problem in downtowns everywhere. However, removing bike lanes is not an appropriate solution to traffic problems. City planners and traffic experts agree, and the evidence usually shows, that bike lanes improve traffic: by allowing more cyclists to use the road, and by safely separating them from car traffic, both cyclists and cars can travel faster and safer.\nRemoving bike lanes from arterial streets will force the cyclists into the road, where they will take up more space and cause more drivers to drive more slowly to ensure their safety. Cyclists who no longer feel safe on their bikes may return to driving cars, adding even more traffic to the mix.\nThe only way removing bike lanes makes sense as a solution to traffic congestion is if we also remove cyclists entirely\u2014but that\u2019s not possible. Cyclists are entitled to the road, and bike lanes ensure a safer and faster experience for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed Bill 212 is simply outrageous! A Bill can't discriminate one modal of transportation over others. The streets need to provide room for all modals and car lanes shouldn't be getting it all. If all roads accommodate vehicle occupants safely, why shouldn't roads accommodate cyclists safely as well on the largest number of roads as possible? Biking is a greener, environmentally friendly and healthier way of communing for a large number of Canadians and this could be attainable for even a substantial larger number of people if the bicycle network were expanded to every minor collector, major collector and arterial roads in all cities throughout the province. The province should always promote the addition of bike lanes not the opposite. What surprises me the most, is how much public budget is being wasted on something that any planner in the world would be ashamed of.\nWith all my respect, shame on you!\n"

Progressive legislation in installing bike lanes is what reduces traffic congestion among other things like investment in public transit. Nobody who lives in Toronto wants these bike lanes removed except those who aren't even living in downtown and drive everywhere. We shouldn't be building our city for people who don't live here. The bike lanes are for the people, we need them to stay. Use my tax money to build more! Not take away the ones that get used all day, every day.\n"

Bike lanes are desperately needed in major cities, and Ontario is home to some of the largest cities in Canada (and, in the case of Toronto, North America). We must increase bike infrastructure to efficiently serve the increasing population\u2019s travel needs. Private vehicles simply take up far too much space and increase gridlock for transit vehicles, which should be the province\u2019s priority. This bill is counterintuitive and extremely wasteful.\n"

Additionally, by cycling, I reduce the number of cars on the road by 1, while reducing my carbon footprint. Often times depending on construction and congestion, my commute is shorter on a bike.\nIt should be entirely up the the municipality on how best to implement bike infrastructure to best serve the community.\nIf cycling infrastructure along my route to work is removed, I will be force to a) ride in traffic slowing down vehicles and increasing risk to myself or b) pay more money (gas, parking etc) to drive to work and contribute to congestion and climate change.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which seeks to impose provincial approval for the construction of municipal bike lanes that involve the removal of vehicle lanes. This bill undermines local decision-making and disregards the proven benefits of cycling infrastructure in reducing congestion and promoting sustainable urban development.\nThe assumption that bike lanes cause traffic congestion is not supported by evidence. According to research, bike lanes can actually help ease traffic congestion. In New York City, for example, the installation of bike lanes on a major thoroughfare resulted in a 35% decrease in travel time for motorists. Similarly, cities like Paris have experienced a significant reduction in car use and a corresponding increase in cycling. These examples demonstrate that promoting cycling infrastructure does not hinder traffic flow but rather encourages more efficient transportation systems.\nFurthermore, studies show that the concept of \"induced demand\" applies to car traffic: the more lanes you add, the more cars fill them, leading to increased congestion. In contrast, bike lanes offer an alternative that can help mitigate the volume of vehicles on the road. As David Simor, director of the Centre for Active Transportation, aptly put it, if bike lanes were the main cause of congestion, highways like the 401 and Gardiner Expressway would be clear, which they are not.\nBike lanes also contribute to overall public safety. Reducing vehicle speeds on roads with bike lanes can significantly lower the likelihood of traffic fatalities and injuries. As Dr. Ray Tomalty from McGill\u2019s School of Urban Planning pointed out, slowing down traffic is not necessarily negative\u2014it saves lives.\nAdditionally, promoting cycling infrastructure is crucial in the fight against climate change. With fewer cars on the road, emissions are reduced, contributing to Ontario\u2019s environmental goals. The long-term benefits of supporting bike lanes, from improving public health to fostering safer streets, far outweigh the perceived short-term inconveniences to motorists.\nGiven these points, I urge the Ontario government to reconsider Bill 212 and allow municipalities to continue making decisions about bike lane construction based on local needs, safety, and sustainability. Centralizing this approval process at the provincial level only hinders progress and undermines efforts to create healthier, more efficient cities.\n"
