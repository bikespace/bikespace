        "comment": "This is an absolutely ridiculous piece of legislation. Our local businesses have IMPROVED because many more people are willing to walk along Yonge street without the worry of a car driving too fast inches from the sidewalk.\nThe province has much bigger things to worry about and fix and to stop interfering in the city of Toronto. Ripping out the bike lanes will add years of construction to streets that JUST finished being blocked. Doug Ford should instead just tell us which buddy is getting the construction fees for this ridiculous project.\n"

        "comment": "Given that urban roadways are limited in width and rarely extendable, bike lanes necessarily take up some of the space formerly occupied by cars. However cyclists deserve as much consideration as do drivers and need space to ride safely.\nIt has taken us decades to get bike lanes in Toronto and it would be unconscionable to undo that work.\nKeep existing bike lanes and add new ones where appropriate, based on real data.\n"

        "comment": "This is a nonsense bill aimed to punish the woefully underserved bicyclists even more. My question is - why are you driving in downtown Toronto if not to simply torture yourself? The transit and bike system is robust enough for any commuter to comfortably avoid driving in terribly narrow and congested downtown. Gridlock is an issue because individuals are either ignorant or overly stubborn with the pains of driving downtown and the impacts they have on the environment, local traffic, and overall downtown ecosystem.\nI\u2019m tired of the Ford government shortchanging conscious individuals in favour of the suburbanite hivemind that threatens to destroy city culture, safety, and community health.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to formally oppose the proposal to remove bike lanes in Toronto, a measure that disregards both traffic data and community safety while undermining municipal governance.\nFirstly, the assertion that bike lanes contribute to traffic congestion lacks evidence. Studies consistently demonstrate that bike lanes reduce congestion, especially when they encourage a shift from short car trips to cycling. For instance, Carnegie Mellon research shows that dedicating lanes to micromobility, like bikes, directly alleviates car congestion by reducing vehicle miles traveled and emissions. Similarly, research on bike-sharing programs, such as Washington, D.C.\u2019s Capital Bikeshare, indicates a measurable reduction in traffic where bike infrastructure exists . Local and international data both show that bike lanes effectively manage and decrease traffic volume, challenging the assumption that cycling infrastructure worsens congestion.\nMoreover, this year marks the highest rate of cyclist fatalities in Toronto's recent history, underscoring an urgent need for safety. Removing bike lanes will only exacerbate these dangers by pushing cyclists into shared vehicle lanes, a risk compounded by Toronto's dense and high-traffic environment. It\u2019s worth noting that bikes are legally recognized vehicles, meaning that in the absence of designated lanes, cyclists are entitled to use full car lanes, which could further disrupt traffic flow while endangering their safety.\nAdditionally, this issue oversteps provincial authority. Decisions regarding city infrastructure should rest within the jurisdiction of local government, particularly on roads like Highway 11 and Highway 5, whose maintenance costs were shifted to the municipal level under the Harris government. The Ontario government's involvement in the management of these municipally controlled streets represents a fundamental overreach and disregard for local governance, suggesting a provincial agenda rather than a focus on Toronto\u2019s best interests. Premier Ford\u2019s intention to reimburse the city solely for the removal costs of bike lanes compounds this issue; fair reimbursement should encompass the full costs of planning, development, and construction, not just deconstruction.\nRemoving these bike lanes ignores both historical precedent and extensive evidence on traffic dynamics, ultimately serving to weaken municipal autonomy, reduce urban safety, and misdirect funds away from valuable infrastructure improvements. I urge the Ontario government to reconsider this proposal in favor of evidence-based policies that enhance, rather than inhibit, urban mobility and safety.\n"

        "comment": "Issues like this should be left to the Toronto residents, council, and mayor to decide, not the province.  This and other issues like the reduction of Toronto council seats in the run-up to an election make me wonder if Mr. Ford is simply just sour at losing the job as Mayor of Toronto and trying to find a way to be mayor without being mayor.  Mr. Ford should stay in his own lane, pun intended.  His actions current and past show he doesn't care about democracy.\nThank you,\nAnonymous Scarborough resident\n"

        "comment": "There are many egregious elements to this proposed law, not the least of which is that it will do nothing in the long run to reduce the traffic congestion it pretends to be about. However I will register my opposition to this proposal simply by saying that municipal decisions should be left to municipalities who know their constituents, have consulted on the construction of lanes and use of street space and wish to provide safe methods of travel for residents who can not or choose not to drive places. The removal of bike lanes will result in people dying. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto. I own a bike, a car and have a Presto card to use public transit. All of these are forms of transportation that I use regularly and daily. Bill 212 seems to be a complete overreach of the provincial government. I would understand there are some challenges we face with congestion but I would argue that those issues will exist when you remove the bike lanes as more people will just drive and you are faced with the same problem. If there are some roads that are a problem in the city then you should be working with the city and looking at the studies that were conducted. The fact of the matter is there are more people and more cars on the road. Providing safe, alternative ways to get around the city are critical to reduce traffic. Taking away these bikes lanes won't make traffic go away or reduce traffic. But is certainly will introduce more problems for cyclists and increase injuries and deaths among cyclists. Balance is key for the future of this city. I've travelled in many cities where bike lanes and cars can coexist with ease. Get rid of the bike lanes and people won't feel safe, and they won't cycle. With affordability issues increasing, less people will be able to afford cars. You are creating a whole new set of problems. Invest in public transportation and bike lanes and what you may find is our traffic will reduce. Stop playing politics and start caring about the people of this province.\n"

The government should scrap this before it goes any further.\n"

        "comment": "Mr. Ford, I really hope you read this comment and all the others seeing how much you seem to care. This proposal is completely not thought out and ignores the actual experts. The data you use to back up your logic is either completely of date or completely made up. Mr. Ford, you did a great job listening to the experts in regards to the COVID-19  pandemic and I implore you to once again listen to the experts in active transportation on how much better for the health and safety of the pubic bike lanes create. What happened to the progressive in progressive conservatives? Instead of constantly destroying things build things up instead. Ripping up bike lanes will not stop people from biking on those roads, it'll just make it more dangerous for drivers and cyclists to do so. We all love Toronto and hope you will try to consider what all Torontonians want, not just a few.\n"

Some of the bike lanes on Davenport are already fantastic.\nGiven that I ride the Go Train into the city, I love the option of being able to take a safe trip on Toronto Bike Share to get to places I normally would not have access to on the TTC. I love that I feel protected from traffic when I go on a walk. I love that bicyclists don't feel unsafe and wont choose to ride on my sidewalk.\nI am not a resident of Toronto, but I am a resident of Ontario who relies on traveling to Toronto. Not only is it terrible policy to prevent new bike lanes, it is a horrific and abhorrent waste of my hard earned tax dollars to spend money demolishing bike lanes.\nI am a suburban resident. Focus on expanding transit frequency, service and improving operations rather than tearing down good infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is infuriating. Once again, the province is meddling in municipal affairs which are not its concern. And specifically in Toronto, which is the only city whose streets are specifically mentioned. The City of Toronto is a large, sophisticated entity well capable of managing its own affairs.\nThe premise of the legislation is wrong on virtually all accounts: bike lanes are NOT responsible for grid lock. You can thank construction as well as the ever increasing number of cars for that. The idea that bikes should take alternate routes belies geography. Simply pull up a street map of Toronto and tell me what alternate route exists to Bloor. There are none.\nIf the Minister is looking to help with gridlock and transportation in Toronto, he should focus on Metrolinx's ongoing, years-long bungling of the Eglinton LRT. There you have a real problem that 100% belongs to the province and which the province alone can fix. Can you please focus on cleaning up that nightmare of a project which is causing real harm to Toronto instead of distracting yourself with nonexistent problems that are not your purview.\n"
