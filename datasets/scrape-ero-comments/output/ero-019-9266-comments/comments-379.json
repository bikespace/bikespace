        "comment": "All actual evidence says that removing bike lanes will NOT improve traffic in any real way. Please stop using wedge issues to bolster your perceived political fortunes, especially around this issue.\nOther cities are installing cycling infrastructure and seeing positive results across the board, but here in Ontario we are now going backwards. Look at Montreal, or Paris for example. They are doing it right.\nBusiness owners along Bloor are actually in favour of the bike lanes, so maybe listen to them instead of aggrieved suburban commuters who can't bear to take a few minutes more to drive downtown, when they should actually be taking public transit.\nYes, Toronto was built around the automobile. That's the problem. We now have too many people driving, too many cars on the road. You could double the width of every road in the city and traffic would still be an issue, so removing bike lanes will not have the effect you claim it will and you know it.\nI live in Scarborough, a not very bike-friendly part of the city. I drive when I have to, I cycle when I can, and I take public transit or bike when heading downtown. The bike lanes have opened up areas of the city to me that I would never drive to and are hard to reach by transit. Please leave the existing lanes alone and install more. It will be good for our city.\n"

        "comment": "This bill, while framed as a progressive, environmentally beneficial act on behalf of Ontarians is very much a step backwards in the grand scheme of making Ontario a better place to travel. Inducing more citizens to be reliant on the automobile to get around for daily trips is not going to save everyone time and money. This is clearly a bill that is attempting to stoke a cultural divide that the premier is passionate about.\nThe proposal to require provincial approval for the removal of traffic lanes on roads which are not provincially regulated is a serious overstep of authority. This will add significant delays to already delayed projects. Most of these projects, despite being framed by the Ministry as unsafe and a nuisance to drivers, actually increase safety for all road users. This fact is conveniently left out of the description of the bill. As someone who drives a motor vehicle for most of their weekly trips and who uses the O'Connor street corridor in Ottawa regularly, I have no desire to see these improvements removed and/or made more difficult to implement in the future.\nI recommend that the staffers at the ministry learn more about road safety through a modern lens and stop pushing divisive legislation that is clearly not backed by real-world data.\n"

It is a huge step backwards in terms of quality of life in our biggest city from a long term perspective and a very, very real safety issue in a short-term perspective.\n(I urge you to look at videos featuring cycling in Oulu, Finland, which has harsher winter climates than Toronto.)\nMy son regularly takes the GO to Toronto and often brings his bike, or uses bike share once there. The law your government is proposing to save a few minutes commute to those contributing to traffic congestion at the expense of my son's safety on the roads and discouraging real congestion relief is so, so regressive and backwards looking,\nI worked on Bay street for two years (18 months in Oakville) and I drove there only once. I used public transit and did not contribute to the congestion whatsoever. Your government is doing an amazing job with Metrolinx, why the huge step back now?\nSure, I also get a bit peeved about cyclists slowing me down a few seconds every now and again, but from what I understand there is no credible research that bike lanes are a contributor to gridlock. They provide a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly alternative to the congestion caused by cars in Toronto. If you build it they will come.\nSince my son often cycles in Toronto and given that six cyclists have died this year on the streets of Toronto, I would like to ask you, as my member of provincial parliament, what is your position is on this very important matter. Do you support removing and not expanding infrastructure that protects the safety of those who actually help in reducing gridlock by not driving cars?\n"

As a taxpayer, I am against this.\nThe province has not consulted with the city, and has not waited for data on how the lanes are actually used.

They do not require the parking spots that take up valuable road space.

I am a driver and I find this ridiculous.\nWhen I drive downtown, I much prefer University Avenue over Bay or Yonge due to the separation of bikes in their own lane, making driving much smoother. In comparison, Bay and Yonge are complete chaos with bikes weaving in and out of traffic and illegally parked cars. And surprise, they also receive congestion.\nAlso, the removal of bike lanes will cause people to stop cycling because they don't feel safe, me included. That means they will shift to cars or taxis/rideshares for their trips, which nullifies the removal of bike lanes.\nThis bill is unbelievable and I can't believe we are wasting taxpayer money on removing infrastructure that makes people feel safer and provides a faster way for people to commute.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Government Official,\nI am writing to express my deep concern regarding Bill 212, which proposes to remove or restrict bike lanes in Ontario, particularly in Toronto. As a frequent cyclist in downtown Toronto, I believe this action would be counterproductive to reducing traffic congestion and could potentially worsen the situation.\nRemoving bike lanes would significantly impact my safety and that of many other cyclists. Without dedicated lanes, I would feel far less secure riding on busy downtown streets. This loss of safety would likely force me, and many others, to opt for driving instead, thereby increasing the number of cars on the road and exacerbating traffic congestion.\nI strongly believe that maintaining and expanding bike lanes is a more effective solution for reducing traffic. Here\u2019s why:\n\t1.\tBike lanes improve traffic flow: Studies have shown that bike lanes can actually help reduce congestion. Research from Carnegie Mellon University found that if just 10% of short car trips during peak afternoon travel were replaced with micromobility options (like bikes), it would decrease vehicle miles traveled by more than 7,300 miles a day.\n\t2.\tBike lanes promote safety: The presence of bike lanes has been shown to reduce traffic speeds and improve safety for all road users. A study by Rutgers University found that installing a bike lane resulted in a 28% decrease in average maximum speeds and a 21% reduction in average speeds for vehicles making right turns.\n\t3.\tEconomic benefits: A 2019 report on the impacts of bike lanes on Bloor Street found that local businesses reported getting more customers since the lanes were installed.\n\t4.\tEnvironmental impact: The Carnegie Mellon study estimated a 2.76% reduction in emissions if short car trips were replaced with micromobility options.\n\t5.\tEfficient transportation: Bike lanes can provide faster commute times for some individuals. For example, one Toronto resident reported reducing their commute from 50 minutes via public transit to 25 minutes using an e-bike on separated bike lanes.\nContrary to the belief that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion, evidence suggests that building more roads actually encourages more people to drive, leading to increased congestion. As urban planning expert Lewis Mumford aptly stated, \u201cAdding car lanes to deal with traffic congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity.\u201d\nInstead of removing bike lanes, I urge the government to consider:\n\t1.\tExpanding and improving bike lane infrastructure to encourage more people to choose cycling as a transportation option.\n\t2.\tInvesting in public transit to provide efficient alternatives to driving.\n\t3.\tImplementing smart traffic management systems to optimize traffic flow.\n\t4.\tEncouraging flexible work hours or remote work options to reduce peak hour congestion.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that maintaining and expanding bike infrastructure, along with promoting alternative transportation methods, is more likely to effectively address Toronto\u2019s traffic challenges while providing additional benefits to the community.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,\nConcerned citizen\nSources:\n\t1.\tCarnegie Mellon University study on micromobility and traffic reduction\n\t2.\tRutgers University study on bike lanes and traffic speed reduction\n\t3.\t2019 report on the impacts of bike lanes on Bloor Street businesses\n\t4.\tToronto resident\u2019s commute time reduction using e-bike\n\t5.\tNew York City Department of Transportation study on Columbus Avenue protected bike lane\n\t6.\tChicago Department of Transportation study on Kinzie Street protected bike lane\n\t7.\tPhiladelphia study on buffered bike lanes on Spruce and Pine streets\n\t8.\tHarris et al.

        "comment": "I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed in the provincial governments lack to accountability and committment to the citizens of Ontario. Doug Ford and his cabinet's overreach in his attempts to remove the bike lanes of Toronto with Bill 212 (ERO number 019-9266) is an absolute slap in the face to not only the people who live in Toronto such as myself, but those who live outside of the municipality as a diversion from pressing issues he should be focusing on. Doug Ford should be spending taxpayer dollars addressing the critical failures of his government including but not limited to the crumbling state of healthcare and the perpetual delays on the public transit projects to name a few. Instead, he decides to play pretend as mayor to the city of Toronto when he has zero understanding nor experience on the benefits these bike lanes provide and how they are critical to saving lives, reducing automobile collisions, and keeping the citizens of Toronto safe. Instead of trying to rip out bike lanes, prioritizing completing constructions projects that close lanes and congest traffic, and improving public transit, which are evidence-backed, should be the focus. As someone who has had loved ones seriously injured due to being hit by vehicles, both as pedestrians and cyclists, I do not wish that grief on anyone. Bike lanes save lives.\n"

        "comment": "I am absolutely 100% opposed to removing bike lanes. Toronto has FINALLY been making strides in the past years to become a modern developed city, adding additional ways to get around that aren\u2019t just owning a car, and to try and back track on this is not only misguided but a huge waste of time and money.\nUrban planning research is abundantly clear about this. Bike lanes don\u2019t make traffic worse but make it better. The only actually way to reduce car traffic is to provide viable alternatives that are actually comparable in time, ease of use, and cost. Bike lanes do this. They make it fee safe to actually ride a bike on busy streets, and the density of people transported in a bike lane vs in giant vehicles, most often with only one passenger, is unmatched.\nHaving spent a few years living in Germany before returning to Ontario, I know how incredibly lovey it it is to live in a city that actually supports alternatives to cars. Not everyone wants to spend or can afford $50,000 on a giant box of metal, though the way we build almost all Ontario cities makes this a near necessity. Not everyone wants to live in sprawling suburbs with giant parking by lots and streets which are unsafe to bike or walk along. Many many people want to live in denser, walkable/bikeable/transitable cities where they can easily get around their local neighborhoods in a safe manner. Bike lanes help with all of that.\nI don\u2019t think we need to push them into every single city in the province. But to immediately start backtracking on one of the only cities in this entire province, one of the only places one has the possibility to live the life I described above is unacceptable. Leave the city alone. Let it decide what\u2019s best for itself. Let\u2019s the people who actually live there, not the people who just drive through, but the people who actually live there make the choice for themselves.\nDo Not Remove the Bike Lanes.\n"
