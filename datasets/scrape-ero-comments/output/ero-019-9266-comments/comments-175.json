It's yet another highly damaging policy from Ford that will be terrible for people, the environment, congestion, and the vibrancy of cities. It increases accessibility for many. Ford should worry about more important problems than bike lanes. This is a municipal matter.\n"

It makes 0 sense to me in any capacity given the state of the world.\nToronto should be a city where people can comfortably get around without prioritizing cars any more than they already have been for ages.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not increase congestion, they provide a safe corridor for cyclists that takes them out of the path of drivers, while reducing the number of cars on our streets, the pollution in our air, and the burden on our overtaxed transit system.  Bike lanes are essential to the safety and efficiency of BOTH cyclists and drivers.  Getting rid of bike lanes will not get decrease congestion, it will only put the lives of cyclists in danger and make driving more hazardous and frustrating for drivers as cyclists are forced back into the general street traffic.\nAs a driver, I feel so much safer with cyclists separated from the main road, not weaving in and out of traffic.  As a cyclist, bike lanes are essential to making the city feel safe enough for me to traverse on two wheels.  Before the Bloor bike lanes were installed, I would not bike to work, the fear of having to merge with drivers in rush hour traffic going under dangerous overpasses with no shoulder and very low visibility was too much of a risk, and too many near misses on my bike had me avoiding it entirely.  Now I regularly bike down Bloor at any hour, any day of the week.  The Bloor bike lanes have been an amazing addition to the city, only outdone by the fully separated lanes added to stretches of college and University.  It is amazing to have modern infrastructure being added to the city of Toronto, and it would be an unforgivable waste of money to tear up the hard work that has been done to implement these lanes.\nWe have the data, we know that bikes are good for business (https://documents.ottawa.ca/sites/default/files/documents/con056212.pdf), we know that bike lanes REDUCE congestion rather than increasing it (https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026), why would the Conservative government want to do something as fiscally irresponsible as removing valuable infrastructure at such a cost to tax payers?\nEvery person on a bike is one less person riding our overburdened transit system or driving a car and adding to the congestion in the city.  Encouraging cycling is the best way to reduce air pollution, reduce noise pollution, reduce cars on the street, and encourage exercise for people living in the city.  If we make the city streets safe enough for the people that want to bike, it will free up the streets for the people that want or need to drive.  Toronto is expanding rapidly and it is unrealistic to think that we can design this city only for drivers, that one extra lane of traffic is somehow going to fix the congestion problem inherent to big cities.  Look to any major European city, look at Paris, look at New York.  Do we want to be moving backward?\nWe want a city that is designed to keep everyone safe, to keep everyone moving forward, please don't rip up the progress we've already made.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is harmful to the environment, ineffectual at reducing traffic, and dangerous for cyclists. By taking away new bike lanes and limiting new ones being made, more people will be driving to work rather than choosing an environmentally friendly way of commuting like cycling. This is because it had been demonstrated time and time again that cycling on the shared road with cars causes cyclist injuries and deaths. Would-be cyclist commuters would not feel safe biking on streets such as Bloor along side cars. With people choosing cars instead of cycling, more cars are on the road, and more congestion happens.\nWhy would we want to encourage more cars spewing greenhouse gas emissions on the road at a time when climate change is ever present and escalating? Why are we valuing the speed of car travel over peoples lives? Also, why do cars need to travel at such speeds going through downtown in the city anyways? These areas are suppose to have slower traffic for safety reasons.\nThis proposal is routed in backwards and misguided thinking and needs to be stopped.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is intended to reduce gridlock by making more lanes available to drivers. However, the available evidence tells us that increasing or decreasing the number of lanes on a road does not have any long-term impact on traffic. This is because the number of drivers on the road is in equilibrium with the cost to drivers of being stuck in traffic. Increasing the number of lanes temporarily reduces traffic, which shifts this equilibrium in a way that induces drivers to drive more.\nFurthermore, removing bike lanes and replacing them with vehicle lanes will only make traffic problems worse. Bikers are (legally) entitled to use an entire vehicle lane when riding on the shoulder would compromise safety. In urban areas (where bike lanes are found), riding at the extreme right of the road would almost always compromise safety. This means that this proposal will likely lead to bikers riding in the same lanes as cars, which is both dangerous for the bikers and causes delays for the drivers.\nThe evidence shows that this proposal will only make the problem of gridlock worse. Resources spent removing these bike lanes would be better spent maintaining infrastructure and making alternatives to driving more attractive so roads are saved for people who need them.\n"

        "comment": "The existing Ontario government's, and Conservative Party's, core value claims to be the removal of red tape and small government. There is an entire Minister for this role. Yet, this Bill 212 propsal is going against that value completely. The province needs to remain focused on activities within their jurisdiction, not interfering with municipalitiy's decision making.\nThis Bill is going to grind progress to a hault for city street safety. Municipalities do not make decisions around bike lanes lightly. They go through due diligence to obtain public opinion from the communities that these changes impact. Ultimately, it's the municipal's communities that serve to benefit from this process. Its the city's community members that provide input into their day-to-day spaces. External opinions from commuters shouldn't play a *more* significant role yhan those who live in that space.\nThe Provincial Conservative's cannot knowingly make decisions that benefit these communities with this Bill, unless that is, that the Province intends to duplicate the effort already spent by the municipality to do this discovery and analysis work and duplicate the tax dollars spent (paid by other Provincial ridings that aren't even impacted by this spending!). Further, if the province's decision results in bike lane removal, this is just going to increase commute times further with construction, increase spending by undoing recent comstruction work, remove road safety for non-car users, and remove any chance for long-term analysis to be done on the usage and the benefits of the bike lanes.\nThis Bill does not benefit the Province of Ontario. Rather it is using our tax dollars to intervene in large city's own decisions. It creates more red tape and bureaucracy, which goes against your party's claimed values. And it doesn't truly consider the communities that are ultimately impacted by bike lane and city infrastructure. It instead focuses on possible inconveniences for commuters.\n"

        "comment": "It is astonishing that the Conservative Party believes they can pass a bill based on zero factual information. Both the premier and the minister of transport have made statements that are untrue, easily verified by numerous studies. That their base may be galvanised to vote for them based on this erroneous information is perhaps the main intent for putting forward this bill. It appears that the premier and transport minister have decided to pay lip service to the massive problem we face with climate chaos, whilst following a disastrous course, throwing good money after bad on road construction schemes that are doomed to fail.\nNumerous cities in numerous countries have implemented progressive multi mode transportation systems, Toronto in particular would benefit immensely from a properly planned, consistent and contiguous network of bike lanes.\nPlease review the networks implemented in successful cities such as Montreal, London UK, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Copenhagen (indeed all of Scandinavia). Let us acknowledge that there is a way forward, not just digging a deeper hole.\nToronto, in common with most of our larger cities, is already at capacity for private vehicle traffic. Adding more lanes, especially if we lose bike lanes, is only going to exacerbate the problem. The ludicrous sums this government is putting in to roads, would be far better invested in continuous improvement of public transportation and cycling infrastructure, which will actually reduce congestion. Of course, a sure way to reduce private vehicles causing traffic congestion is to implement congestion fees and tolls, while improving the availability of public transit.\nPlease note, thorough planning and coordinated implementation are critical to successful results. The haphazard design and implementation of Ontario cycling infrastructure is problematic, in that vulnerable road users will not use infrastructure that does not meet their needs. The planners in Toronto are vastly more qualified than either the premier or the minister of transport to plan for the future of Toronto transportation, the province has no business whatever interfering.\n"

        "comment": "How many lanes do we need to add for cars until theirs no traffic? Adding more lanes never works, there are plenty of studies.\nEvery person on a bike in a bike lane is not in a car on the road, that improves congestion. Every person on public transit improves traffic congestion. If bike lanes are removed, cyclists will bike on the road and take the lane for safety, creating more delays for drivers.\nThis isn\u2019t a cars vs bikes thing, it\u2019s a make it better and safer for everyone thing. Stop trying to distract from the real issues. Ford is only doing this because bike lanes worked as a polarizing issue in Ottawa, for which the progressive candidate got screwed by suburban voters and their hatred of all things that aren\u2019t roads for their cars.

Removing the ease of bike lane construction and wanting to remove already placed bike lanes will do nothing good. We should be trying to create sustainable and safe cities, not doing meaningless crap like this that won't do anything except give developers unnecessary money.\nAnd that's not even mentioning the exemption of the Environmental Assessment Act in this Bill. The government should be working to protect nature while also benefiting the people of Ontario. Construction of Highway 413 does neither, and once again only benefits private contractors.\nI seriously question the judgement of our Premier and this government. It's disheartening to see that they do not have the best interests of the people or environment at heart, and only work to pander to the uneducated and selfish.\n"
