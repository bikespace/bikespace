        "comment": "I am a regular bike commuter, it is my main source of transportation in Toronto. I have been actively riding for over 30 years.  I remember the old days riding on Bloor without bike lanes. It is so much safer with bike lanes.Everyone has a place on the street.\nMy only complaint with Bloor Street bike lanes is too many bikes in the lanes. Obviously this is at busy times. No one can credibly say the lanes are not used, or they are not busy or they are not safer.\nCheap political posturing should not win over the safe and efficient movement of thousands of commuters who are biking. Those bike lanes are heavily used and a positive step forward to providing safe ways for Toronto residents to move around the City.\nAnd yes, I commute year round. I commuted 25 years ago when there was no plowing of bike lanes, The plowing of bike lanes makes it possible for more people to ride year round.\nDare I say it is common sense to keep them. Let\u2019s continue to ensure that cycling is a safe alternative to walking, the TTC and especially the 1 person, 2 ton car - taking more space than any other mode of movement.\nWe are not going anywhere, keep cycling safe. and let\u2019s all try to get along and get where we need to go.\n"

        "comment": "I think that this proposal will lead to devastating effects in Toronto. Although the goal is to reduce traffic and wait time commuting by car, I do not believe adding lanes will significantly reduce traffic as more people will be motivated to drive, and more people will HAVE to drive as bike lanes will be removed. This leads to less safety on the roads for bikers, more congestion due to an increased need for vehicles, and millions of dollars being spent on a useless plan instead of investing the money into healthcare or social services where it is much more strongly needed.\n"

        "comment": "I don't support this Bill 212.\nI believe most, if not all, of the Province's points of view are flawed and biased, and they follow either statistics and/or data that are skewed or merely anecdotal.\nThe need to build priority highways has nothing to do with local transportation. Also, the province responsibility is not only with drivers and businesses, but with people... including pedestrians and cyclists who chose to either commute or simply... move using different means than a car (the most inefficient mode of transportation in dense urban areas)\nThe decision also affects more people than it helps. And it is an absolute imposition from car drivers over not drivers. If we prioritize drivers so much we should heavily tax them.\nThis is a terrible decision, not well thought, and just reflective of the poor leadership we have in the Province.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes saves lives,  Cycling is an affordable means of transportation, Cycling contributes to an overall improvement in fitness, health and well being unlike cars.  Cycling along Bloor, Danforth is more accessible by bike than car.  I live in the Beach, and often will cycle along Harbourfront, up the humber to Bloor West for Lunch, and and back home along Bloor and Danforth bike lanes and a weekend cycle trip with friends.  Without bike lanes, I would not frequent Bloor or Queen West as I do now.  Toronto needs to understand cycling is for all.  At 63 yrs of age, I'm blessed to be able to ride a bike as free as I do.  We need a bike lanes for the future of the city. Even large corporations such as FedEx have a cycling delivery team.  Cycling lanes are not a congestion issue, Cars and single occupants are a congestion issue.  Compare the sq ft space of a care single occupant to a bike sq ft. space to roads.  Simple no question.  Doug Ford needs to focus on real issues of Education, healthcare, housing, and environment.  Not bike lanes.  We don't need anymore GHOST BIKES in toronto.  We need infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I think that pulling out bike lanes on Bloor Street is a ridiculous and expensive undertaking. The bike lanes are used consistently and as a resident of the area and frequent driver, biker, walker on Bloor street the traffic situation is unchanged from before there were bike lanes. Bloor Street is not a key commuter artery for folks from outside Toronto core and therefore would not help resolve the gridlock on the Gardiner, 427, 401 and DVP. Please do not create yet another construction project where we don't need it. Please just leave the bike lanes alone and focus efforts on getting the cross-town LRT moving. The bike lanes allow for a safe movement of cyclists and give folks an alternative to TTC and the car.\n"

        "comment": "As a motorist (not a cyclist), I believe bike lanes are safer for everyone.  I feel very nervous when a cyclist is riding alongside me, while I am driving, and even more so when a cyclist is wobbling in front of me while riding uphill.  Removing existing bike lanes and prohibiting more of them will not solve congestion, since it is largely caused by construction projects, many of which are for building badly needed housing.  People are not going to stop cycling, so let's keep everyone safe as possible.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a resident of Toronto, Ontario to express my opposition to the Government of Ontario's proposed amendment to the HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT.\nSpecifically, I ask that the government reconsider and remove the the proposed change to require Ministry approval before municipalities may construct bicycle lanes in certain circumstances, and to require municipalities to provide the Ministry with information, including information relating to bicycle lanes.\nI am deeply concerned about Bill 212 on the following grounds:\n1. Health and Safety: cyclists on the road in large cities are vulnerable and at risk. This year alone, five cyclists have been killed so far in Toronto \u2014 more than any other year since police started keeping such records in 2006. As the province recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians, I fail to understand how the removal of protections for vulnerable persons on the roads will aid in meeting the stated goal of reducing congestion. Removal of bike lanes will only result in more accidents and deaths, and the evidence demonstrates this fact. Prioritizing the health, safety, and wellbeing should be a key priority of the provincial government. I am deeply disappointed to see that the elected representatives in this province are not taking this seriously.\n2. Environmental impact: As we see the increasingly devastating impact of climate change and a warming planet it is disheartening, disappointing, and impractical for the government to take actions that will only discourage Ontario residents from opting to take low and zero carbon modes of travel.\n3. Economic cost: Removal of existing bike lanes is a waste of time and taxpayer money which will only result in more unnecessary disruption to traffic flows.\n4. Infringement of the province on municipal matters: The Ontario government should focus on matters of  provincial concern such as health and education and allow the elected representatives at the local level to make decisions that fall under their purview.\nIn summary, I am deeply disappointed to see my elected government proposing these changes that will not support the health, wellbeing, and quality of life of their constituents, and ask that Bill 212 does not go forward as presented.\n"

        "comment": "I commute to Toronto\u2019s \u2018Hospital Row\u2019 for work, and >90% of my trips are by bike. The bike lanes are well used and the bike lock-up facilities at the hospitals are regularly filled to capacity, even now in mid-November. In addition, the Bike Share stations surrounding the hospitals are heavily used. The bike lanes are needed to protect users from serious injury and death.\nUniversity Ave was down to one lane and gridlocked for 9 months due to construction. The project is finished and the street is working very well for all users: cyclists, pedestrians, drivers, as well as the subway below. Removing the University Ave bike lane will cost taxpayers millions, cause many months of terrible construction-induced gridlock, and is unlikely to make traffic move more efficiently when completed. Many cyclists will choose to drive and this will contribute to more traffic.  Removing bike lanes means more cars, more pollution, more congestion, and more frustration for all road users.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes is an expensive non-solution to a non-problem, that costs taxpayers while reducing public safety.\n"

Our population cannot handle this many cars anymore you're wasting our tax dollars on a reality that no longer is possible based on the population of Toronto, Many families with their kids bike together and it should be safe for them too.\nOn a daily basis I have cars race me to the crosswalks. Bikes almost run me over because they have to bike on the sidewalk to avoid cars, and just recently on pape seen a cyclist get hit.\nHelp make it safer for everyone to have passable bike lanes!\n"

If we cannot all agree that the lives saved are worth the few minutes of time potentially added to a drivers commute then there may be no agreement reached.\nSafety is paramount here.\nDo not pretend to care about your children\u2019s lives when you send them out on their bike to school if you cannot acknowledge the impact these lanes can have on a single life.\nRider volumes will only grow if we stop attacking the people who support them.\nThere\u2019s an interview of Vincent Price being asked what the scariest thing about Toronto is, his answer: the Traffic.\nThat answer predates bike lanes, so I wonder exactly why we believe that these lanes are to blame for the cities problems. Once more people continue to feel safe using them, and their friends invite them to ride, we could see this city grow into a beautiful less polluted place.\nKEEP THE BIKE LANES\n"

        "comment": "Everything about this proposal is disgusting. As a Toronto resident that lives off Bloor and works on university Avenue at one of the hospitals I can't believe removing these lanes would even be considered. It's made businesses more vibrant and accessible, it's encouraging people to bike and exercise, it's safer for people that bike (myself included), and safer for drivers that don't have to be concerned with striking a person biking that shares the same lane (also me when I drive). There are literally no negatives to the bike lanes and as a tax payer it's gross that either the city or province will be footing the bill to install then un-install these lanes to make traversing our roads more dangerous for everyone.\nAnyone that thinks this is a good idea or supports removing these lanes or blocking future biking infrastructure is trying to punish Torontonians. Who ever pushes this reckless agenda will have blood on their hands when people end up getting hurt because of their poor decisions.\n"

        "comment": "It is short sighted to remove bike lanes from Toronto streets without further studies.\nDo the bike lanes cause the congestion or is road construction a big factor?  Could a bike lane work for  bike traffic in two directions, therefore providing more space for car traffic?? Can reduction of space allocated to parking be investigated? Is there no value given to the safety for cyclists?\nCyclists are using the lanes. The are often as busy as car traffic.\nIs it not a gross waste of funds to rip out bike lanes and pay for changes needed to restore the road?\nHave these and other questions been fully investigated? Has there been any consultation with the public? This bill strikes me as a knee jerk reaction which has not been fully considered.\n"
