Thousands like me bike through the lanes listed for removal and we all depend on them to be safe. This bill has false information meant to direct the frustration on traffic gridlock to appeal to something that is completely irrelevant. If you really want to improve traffic then invest more in public transit and learn from European countries where they are known for excellent city infrastructure, walkable, and liveable cities. Research and evidence show that bike lanes do not negatively impact traffic flow and they save lives. Those who support this bill will be politicians who are happy to use taxpayers money to then create harm for those same taxpayers. Doug Ford please leave Toronto alone. Leave bikers and safe road infrastructure alone. Say no to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "regarding part 12 municipal by-laws and bike lanes:\nI am writing as a citizen of Ontario to inform the legislative assembly that I oppose this bill.\nThis bill suggests to manage municipal roads which are normally outside the provincial jurisdiction by requiring provincial approval of bike lanes that would remove a traffic lane. By mandating approval for the design of municipal road the provincial office would add an additional layer of red tape, not remove it for the 444 municipalities in Ontario.\nBike lane projects already take years to implement without this additional layer of provincial oversight which cannot be better equipped to understand either the traffic aspects (as the plans are already reviewed by traffic engineers through environmental assessments) or the local aspects (as the EAs and detailed designs are reviewed by local council and local people) than the layers already in place. If approved these plans may still take years to be built due to the time for detailed design, relocation of utilities and procurement construction. In essence, the construction of bike lanes face the same struggles that the ministry is attempting to alleviate in this bill for the priority highways.\nMy municipality has just approved an Active Transportation Masterplan that oversees the next 20 years of active transportation in the city and would build up bike lanes on more than 50 unique roads, often requiring the reallocation of parking lanes or travel lanes (e.g. reducing 4 lanes to three including a dedicated turning lane, to fit bidirectional bike travel in the roadway). I think I live in a pretty average municipality, if every municipality was like mine, that would be a conservatively estimated 22,200 files to look through. Or 1,110 a year if it was evenly spread over 20 years. How many people will need to be hired to review these projects?\nDesignated bike lanes are a crucial aspect of the design of complete streets and vision zero policies that improve the safe operation on highways (roads, avenues, streets, boulevards, squares, bridges). Separated bike lanes improve the safety for bikes, pedestrians, and cars. Injury risk for cyclists is reduced by 30%-40% when using a bike lane (e.g., Harris et al., 2013; Paolos et al., 2015). This improved safety increases the use of active transportation which reduced traffic and gridlock. When people feel unsafe, they are less likely to choose active transportation (or public transportation) and thus will lead to more people in cars and thus more gridlock (R\u00e9rat & Schmassmann, 2024).\nRemoving bike lanes that are already built would be a huge waste of this time, effort, and money in addition to the time, effort, and money it would take to rebuild the road. When accounting for the risk to safety by removing bike lanes, and the increased vehicle traffic by removing bike users, it would be ill-advised to remove a bike lane that has already been built and is being used. Any money that might be used to remove a bike lane would be better spent investing in public transportation which could actually reduce gridlock by removing single-occupancy vehicle traffic.\nProvincial oversight of bike lanes is not related to designating priority highway projects or required for the \"building highways faster act\". This aspect will slow down the construction and improvement of highways and I believe will work to increase gridlock not reduce it.

        "comment": "Bill 212 is not based on any data or evidence, and would be a detriment to efficiently moving people around Ontario due to the following reasons:\n- Bill 212 will not solve congestion on Toronto's streets. The answer to car congestion is not to encourage more cars on the road (that's completely illogical) - the answer is obviously to provide people with viable, alternate options to cars, such as bike lanes and transit. When these alternate means are invested into, people will use them - and this is what will reduce the amount of people in cars.\n- Bill 212 will result in more cyclist injuries and deaths. Removing bike lanes means bikes will have no choice but to mingle with cars in unseparated lanes, creating a higher chance of incidents.\n- Bike lanes have been proven to be a boon to businesses, with cyclists more easily able to stop along their way to visit local businesses.\n- It is a complete waste of money to remove existing infrastructure that was only recently installed. This is not a good use of taxpayer money, we should be investing this in things like better transit, healthcare, and housing.\n- Bill 212 circumvents environmental assessments for development - this is not a sustainable way to develop things, we absolutely need to be considering the environmental impact of current decisions to protect the future of our spaces.\n- The idea that the government can kick people out of their homes with short notice to build these highways is ridiculous and an abuse of power. There is no evidence these highways will actually improve anything, so to be able to uproot lives for this is unacceptable.\nAny government that believes in this bill is clearly unfit to make decisions for this province - if this were any other job that wasn't related to government or these protected roles, this sort of incompetence would be grounds for dismissal. It's baffling that the leaders of this province believe this bill will actually be a benefit to Ontario when there is no evidence to support this. None of these should be priority issues when there is so much else that needs dealing with. What we are seeing is corruption, and Ontarians will not stand for this. We should be conducting a thorough investigation into the people behind this, to uncover and expose the fraud and kickbacks involved, as that is truly what is happening here.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal is not aligning with the goals of the Government of Ontario.\n1. Removing the bike lanes is not the same as \"build[ing] priority highways\", it will not save time for the drivers - adding more lanes does not fix traffic problems, removing the bike lanes will make it worse for businesses - making them less accessible to people who would have otherwise biked to said businesses.\n2. Accidents will likely be more frequent without these bike lanes - bikes will be driving on roads with cars; in my experience so far, not all drivers or bikers know how to share lanes safely.\n3. Bike lanes allow for the connection of people throughout the city. So many people who live in Toronto don't have cars (they are expensive and there's no parking anywhere). by removing bike lanes, you're cutting off a relatively safe option for people to get from one of the city to another.\n4. The Highway 413 point is irrelevant to removing bike lanes.\nSince none of the bullet points on the proposal details are being satisfied, I would like more clarity as to why this is even being suggested? It will result in less connectivity, dangerous commutes, and less customers for businesses.\nPlease, please, please, please reconsider.\n\"You're nervous when there's no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when t comes to bicycle riders.\" - Doug Ford\n"

The traffic is caused by way WAY too many cars on the road and NOT the bike lanes.  It is absurd to blame car congestion on cycling infrastructure.  These bike lanes were long overdue in Toronto and removing these lanes is going backwards.  There should be less incentives for car commuting in Toronto and more investment in transit and cycling infrastructure.  People who choose to drive their cars into the downtown core when other options are available shouldn't be catered to.  And decisions regarding changes to downtown city streets shouldn't be made by car-centric suburbanites.\n"

As other large cities in countries around the world successfully work toward creating walkable and bike safe communities with good transit, the out of touch Government of Ontario is heading into the dark ages with its car centric mentality.\nOur streets are full of rushed, angry, selfish car and truck drivers who lack any compassion for building safe communities. They don't stop at stop signs, speed through lights as they turn red and have little patience for pedestrians and cyclists crossing at intersections. These are the people that Doug Ford is giving into. And whether there are bike lanes or not, those impatient drivers are still going to drive like that and without bike lanes there will be more deaths and accidents on our streets.\nAs the mother of two daughters who live along the Bloor Street corridor and who use cycling and walking as their means of transportation, I am appalled by the stupidity of the Ontario Government.\n"

Our complex recently got 2 bike rooms installed by our landlords, and they're already full. That means that for the rest of us in cars, there is less traffic. We see this development as a huge positive to our community - fewer cars in our neighbourhoods and more people walking means that those who need to use cars (the seniors and those with accessibility needs) can get where they need to go by car faster.\nThe lanes benefit us walkers, too. They shorten the crossing distance for those of us who are slow walkers (like myself) and they make walking just feel nicer, having cars and exhaust a bit further away. They have greatly improved the quality of life of us living directly here.\nSome days, it seems our travel times by car are a bit longer. We gladly take that in trade for the safety for walking and biking members of our community. With the huge developments coming to the Yonge and Davisville area, we simply cannot fit more cars here - we need folks to choose bikes, and these lanes encourage that.\nI beg you to reconsider your ideas here, and consider that the local people in this neighbourhood voted for, asked for, and rejoiced in the installation of these lanes. They increase of safety, prevent road violence, and encourage a modality shift that is necessary for the huge developments coming here.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed amendment to Bill 212 that will give the Province oversight over the installation of bike lanes in municipalities and the authority to remove bike lanes installed in Toronto.\nThe restriction and removal of municipal bike lanes, in addition to being a waste of tax dollars and a jurisdictional overreach on the part of the Province, would obviously actively harm the environment by incentivizing more Ontarians to choose car travel over far more space efficient and carbon neutral modes of travel, like cycling. Furthermore, although creating more lanes for cars to use might slightly reduce congestion on those roads over the short-term, immediately after the removal of the bike lanes; due to the well-studied phenomenon of induced demand (https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/), it is virtually assured that congestion will return as more people are incentivized to use cars as their primary mode of transportation.  Therefore, it would be far better, in terms of easing traffic congestion within Ontario\u2019s dense urban centers, to encourage more people to ride bicycles through the implementation of safe, curb protected cycling lanes.\nIn fact, there is a great deal of evidence that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by making it more feasible for citizens to choose cycling, a far less space-intensive mode of transportation, over driving (https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-09-03-bicycle-path-data\u2026; https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-09-03-bicycle-path-data\u2026; https://content.tfl.gov.uk/understanding-and-managing-congestion-in-lon\u2026). The unfortunate fact of the matter is that cars are not a viable way to move dense urban populations around within urban cores \u2013 there is simply not enough space in urban cores to accommodate the number of cars that would be needed to allow the majority of urban residents (as well as those commuting into and visiting the city) to use cars as their primary mode of transportation.\nCities such as New York and London are working to greatly expand their cycling networks because evidence shows that this is a great benefit in terms of public health and efficient traffic circulation (https://content.tfl.gov.uk/understanding-and-managing-congestion-in-lon\u2026). Bike lanes also lead to the increased profits for businesses on the roads where bike lanes are installed (https://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/10/06/salt-lake-city-cuts-car-parking-\u2026; https://content.tfl.gov.uk/walking-cycling-economic-benefits-summary-pa\u2026)\u2013 for example, the first protected bike lane in Manhattan resulted in a 49% increase in revenue for businesses located next to the cycling route (https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-09-03-bicycle-path-data\u2026; https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-09-03-bicycle-path-data\u2026). Given that Toronto is growing in population and seeking to become a world class city on par with cities such as New York and London, it stands to reason that we should be emulating their evidence-based solutions to traffic problems, rather than doing the opposite and moving Toronto backwards, as seems to be the aim of Bill 212, at least as it relates to cycling lanes.\nBike lanes also protect the livelihoods of Ontarians by protecting cyclists and pedestrians from vehicular manslaughter (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667091724000013), facilitating physical fitness in the midst of an obesity epidemic, and reducing carbon emissions, thereby improving urban air quality and slowing climate change. Therefore, entering this amendment into force and removing  bike lanes will virtually guarantee that more Ontarians will die unnecessarily, and will also contribute to the need for increased spending on healthcare and climate change mitigations, without producing any long-term benefit in terms of traffic circulation.\nGiven the rapidly increasing ridership and expansion of Toronto\u2019s Bike Share program , as well as statistics indicating that bike lanes are well used and usage continues to grow (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2023/pa/bgrd/backgroundfile-240804\u2026), it is clear that a growing number of Torontonians are choosing cycling as a primary mode of transportation as infrastructure additions and improvements make this choice safer and more convenient. Additionally, given the cost-of-living crisis affecting all of Ontario, and particularly Toronto, it is important that low-cost means of transportation, like cycling are supported to allow people unable to afford a car a viable means to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this legislation because it ignores the safety of road users and it is not based on facts and data. Gridlock is extremely frustrating but this proposal will not help. The gridlock on the 401, Gardiner, DVP is much worse than on city streets and yet there are no bike lanes there.\nThe proposal does not consider the safety of road users. A primary goal of any road should be the safe and orderly movement of all road users, not just one category of users.\nAt a macro level, the proposal is interfering in the local administration of cities by duly elected officials that are much better equipped than the province to understand local issues.\nThe key relevant statistics have not been considered by the province. These key statistics are:\n1. Average speed of motor vehicles at various times of day. It would appear that the average speed of motorized traffic after the bike lanes installation is still above the speed limit. Speed has to be considered not only at rush hour, but at other times of day.\n2. Average time of travel. According to a Toronto Star article, the variation in the average time of travel in various sections where bike lanes installation has been completed is either marginally up or down depending on the section.\n3. Collisions, deaths and injuries. There have been pedestrians, cyclists and motorists injured and killed on those sections of road and the bike lanes are only one of the artifacts installed to make the roads safer for all.\n4. I have lived in Toronto for more than 33 years, and roads have been congested long before bike lanes. Vehicles travelling Southbound on University, for example, have only 2 lanes to go under the train tracks and one lane to get on the Gardiner. More lanes upstream are therefore useless since the bulk of the traffic is getting on the Gardiner.\nThis is bad legislation that is increasing friction between road users and will lead to deaths and injuries.\n"

Bike lanes also help alleviate congestion by encouraging people to cycle instead of driving, which ultimately benefits all road users, including motorists.\nCities worldwide have demonstrated that investing in bike-friendly infrastructure leads to healthier communities, reduced emissions, and vibrant local economies. Removing bike lanes takes us backward, prioritizing cars over people and progress.
