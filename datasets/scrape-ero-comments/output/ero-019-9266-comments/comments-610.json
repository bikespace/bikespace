        "comment": "Removing already established bike lanes in Toronto is going to lead to people being killed.. there are already proven studies that show that bike Lanes reduce vehicle usage and increase travel times by getting cars off the road. Why are these studies not being taken into account? We should be moving towards more sustainable cities and transportation and this is a step backwards.\nWhy are other factors not being taken the account? Such as the fact that Uber has put tens of thousands of additional personal vehicles on the road... Or why is there not more enforcement of cars illegally parking on streets, parking and bike lanes, putting on their four-way flashers and blocking traffic on main roads to pick up a food delivery.. removing bike lanes that keep human being safe is not going to make traffic less congested... Bad drivers are still going to illegally stop and park, it's not like that problem is going to be solved, what will happen is human beings will be killed from this decision as they will have to mix with traffic...everyday I witness cars illegally turning at the intersection of yonge and eglinton in midtown toronto, blocking through traffic because they are not paying attention to the no turn signs...the bike lane on Eglinton this location is not causing traffic congestion, it's the driver's blocking their own traffic by not paying attention and following the laws of the road... it's extremely dangerous and saddening that this is the direction that my government is taking us, a government that's supposed to represent all citizens.\nThere are studies that show that bike Lanes decreased travel times and ease congestion by giving people more sustainable Transit options why is my government that supposed to represent me, not taking to account these studies? Why are we not using actual data and science in making these decisions?\nWhy are we so slow to open up public transit projects, projects that would take more cars off the road...the Eglinton LRT going into its 15th year of construction is a sad and pathetic joke and makes the city look like a laughing stock... Infrastructure is not kept up with the recent population explosion and this is unacceptable.\nI hope there is a reconsideration of this proposal...let's not move backwards in becoming more sustainable...we used to be proud to say Ontario was the place to grow...let's not lose that\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the largest wastes of money the government has proposed second only to selling Ontario place.\nthis bill will put Toronto back at square one when it comes to cycling.\nI beg you do not remove our bike lanes.\nI was assaulted after a driver ran me off the road and then got out of his car to yell at me. since then I have exclusively used protected bike lanes to travel not only to work but to almost any appointment in the city.\nBefore we had these bike lanes, it was bumper to bumper traffic, after they were installed it was still bumper to bumper and after they are gone it will again be bumper to bumper.\nthere is no reason to remove these bike lanes. while the most simple logic says that yes it would improve commuting time the reality is, much like with the 413 highway, the increase would be negligible. in 2016 the jarvis bike lanes were taken out and during the traffic study after the fact the time it took to travel north and south bound INCREASED.\nPlease, bike lanes keep bikes moving. meaning they are not slowing down cars. keep women and children safe and give them a place to safely travel the city, and are what make our city one of the best to live in.\nthere are seldom to no votes to gain that do not already support you by taking away these bike lanes and the party whom will proceed you will likely just spend the money to put them back in. instead of spending the money on ripping out work thats already finished. give it to our hospitals that are vastly under staffed and underfunded\n"

        "comment": "As someone who drives several times a week and also bikes occasionally, I am not in support of the framework for bike lanes within this bill because of several reasons.\n1. This adds more bureaucracy/red tape for cities in Ontario who want to introduce alternative modes of transportation. The city should have the power to decide what works best for the city and its residents based on evidence from studies without needing to ask the province for permission\n2. Removing existing bike lanes specifically the ones in downtown Toronto (Yonge, University, and Bloor) that were built with the support of the city's studies and data should not happen as it's wasteful to remove, and not in agreement with the city. Instead of encourage more drivers in the city, there should be more investment into public transit and alternative transit options. That way people can get to their destination quickly and without the need of a car. Removal of bike infrastructure does not take into account non-drivers who depend on that infrastructure to get to their destination. I personally would bike to more places if there was more bike infrastructure available.\n3. Related to the above point on bike infrastructure is safety, removal of bike lanes will make it more dangerous for bikers. Bikers will still be biking on the road, but now together with cars since bikers are not allowed to bike on the sidewalks by law. That is why I am hesitant to bike to places close by but too far to walk to because I don't feel safe biking on the roads that don't have any biking infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against Bill 212.\nIf the province intends to reduce gridlock there are many far more effective ways to do this than by endangering many Toronto residents who cycle to work or school. For example, provide funds to the city to better enforce existing street parking laws. Furthermore, this is a jurisdictional overreach. Municipalities are responsible for city streets and should be the ones to determine how street space is used.\nAs a car driver who frequently uses Bloor Street and University Avenue  I appreciate having separated bike lanes and I do not believe that the impede motor vehicle traffic. Instead, they make the streets safer for everybody.\nAs a downtown resident I would prefer to see more people using bicycles for many reasons including traffic congestion, health, and public safety. This will only happen if bicycle lanes available. Children and teenagers should be able to cycle to school without breaking the law by going on sidewalks or risking their lives by mixing with cars on busy streets.\n"

        "comment": "I have a number of thoughts about bike lanes.  These are based on the fact that I have driven a car in Toronto for 35 years and have also ridden my bicycle regularly for that same time and daily (10km commute each way to and from work downtown) for the last 10 years in all seasons, typically missing less than 10 days a year.\nWe need more bike lanes not less.\nRemoving existing bike lanes is not the answer, especially in Toronto.  They reduce traffic overall and they are truly an example of if you build it they will come.  This is especially true as the bike lane infrastructure becomes more and more connected.  They are necessary to promote safe cycling.\nTraffic on major arteries was a problem well before bike lanes.  I remember driving a car down Bloor West in 1988 and taking forever to get across Bloor even though it was two lanes.  At that time it took me longer than it takes me now, driving a car.\nThe only real way to manage car traffic is to provide more viable alternatives both from a time taken perspective and a cost perspective.  Public transit is key, including GO trains with more regular coverage further a field like St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Guelph, Kitchener etc, subway and bus network, LRTs UPX and more services like it.  Building on our existing bike infrastructure and ensuring that it is connected is also critical to promoting safe cycling.  The growing number of city bike stations and use of city bikes supports this argument\nUsing side streets on the main arteries like Bloor, University and Yonge does not work very well.  I have tried that and it gets complicated with other side street traffic calming measures like one way streets or having to zig zag to continue in the direction that you're interested in.  Often the destination is on one of the major streets so you end up back on that road regardless.\nIn my many years of cycling I have spent a significant amount of time cycling on major roads that did not have bike lanes on them at the time and it is challenging and can be dangerous.  I am a defensive cyclist and have still had many, many close calls.   Only my defensive cycling and a guardian angel has kept me from serious injury or collision.  Using bike lanes as they've come on line in the areas that I cycle have made close calls much fewer and have made the cycling much safer and more enjoyable.  I have also noticed significantly more cyclists taking up cycling as the bike lane infrastructure grows.  We definitely need keep existing cycling infrastructure and invest more in and grow that cycling infrastructure.  Increasing popularity in pedal assist bicycles (electric) is going to make investment even more critical and the positive impact even more rewarding.\nRather than reduce bike lanes how about prioritizing getting the Eglinton Crosstown operational - it should be done and if there are issues on who's going to pay for it lets get those resolved and move on. Every day that it isn't operational is costing everyone money.  Lets figure out how to speed up the completion of the Ontario line, build it in phases and get it up and running etc. etc.  Let's leverage the 407 better before building the 413.  That would be less expensive and have a much more immediate positive impact.\nCars are not the answer for our future transportation needs within the city.  This is true with or without bike lane infrastructure.  Our city is growing, condo buildings are going up with less parking requirements along routes that aren't as well serviced by public transit as they will need to be.  Dupont is an example of this, Kipling and Bloor, Dufferin and Bloor, Parklawn and Lakeshore, the list goes on and on and I'm only naming west end projects because that's where I live.  More and more people, both immigrants and migrants from other areas of Ontario and Canada will be moving to GTA and filling these buildings and more (the housing shortage is real and will continue to be a challenge). Bike lanes can only help this situation.\nWe are at a turning point in Toronto, have been for a number of years.  Ideally we would be further along with a more comprehensive and efficient public transit network than the one that serves us today. Bike lane infrastructure has helped!  The future success of our city and our province on the international stage is very dependant on how we invest in our infrastructure today.  With proper investment in that infrastructure for the future Toronto can be a healthy and vibrant hub of communities supporting all sorts of industries, businesses, institutions of higher learning, sports, arts and leisure pursuits.  Proper investment to me means focusing on significant focus on public transit accessible by all (housing is another topic and equally as important) and significant investment in connected bike infrastructure is also critical to that future vision of Toronto.  If we don't do it, it is quite possible that Toronto will be a car based mess when it comes to getting from point a to point b leading to a lack of productivity and it (the City of Toronto) being overlooked as a destination city for urban migration and major growth opportunities.  We have to decide what kind of city we want Toronto to be.  I think I've been clear on what my choice would be.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me for further comment or involvement.  Thanks.\n"

I am a driver due to disability, but bike lanes benefit EVERYONE through better air quality, greater efficiency in getting people around the city, etc. Ripping up existing bike lanes would be costly and disruptive, and STILL wouldn't improve travel times for cars.\nThe Ontario government needs to back out of municipal business and start paying attention to their actual responsibilities: healthcare, schools, transit. When will we get more family medicine doctors? When will air quality and infection control be improved in schools through better ventilation/filtration/highUV?

        "comment": "I don't understand the rationale of removing these bike lanes. The people using them are commuting to work, the grocery store, etc. just as the motorists do, and if the lanes are removed, they will probably be forced to either bike amongst the cars in the car lane or to drive a car themselves. Neither of these options should appeal to drivers, and neither option will improve the commute for drivers. The best way to improve traffic flow is to provide alternative methods of travel, not to encourage there to be more cars on the road. It's also a significant waste of money to remove these lanes after they were already installed.\n"

        "comment": "I am an employee of the University Health Network (UHN) and am writing to state that the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue, as has been proposed, will directly impact UHN staff by increasing the risk of accidents for the large number of hospital employees who routinely bike to work, and by worsening congestion for those who drive.  This is to say nothing of the incredible traffic disruption that will attend the actual decomissioning of the bike lanes, which have only barely been completed.  City officials have estimated removing the lanes on University Avenue will require reducing traffic on that street to a single southbound lane for 9 months.  I would remind you that the installation of these bike lanes was endorsed by the CEOs of the very hospitals located on that street.  The uproar that will attend the construction delays of removing them now will be deafening.\nMore importantly, however, the removal of these bike lanes will result in public health effects that will be felt by all citizens, and in a manner contrary to our mission as a healthcare organization.  The ActiveTO Midtown Complete Street Pilot, for example,  demonstrated that the installation of protected bike lanes on Yonge Street between Bloor and Davisville resulted in a dramatic and sustained increase in cycling along that corridor, an increase that is continuing to trend upwards, and which has had negligible effects on car commute times, and no measurable effect at all on transportation times for ambulances or other emergency vehicles.  This shift from driving to cycling for commuters results in a reduction in traffic pollution which studies have shown have measurable effects on population rates of acute respiratory and cardiac events in adults, as well as cancer diagnoses.  The overall effect revealed in this model was that for every 1000 individuals aged 20-64 who take up cycling as their usual means of commuting, population mortality decreases by 17.5%.   The benefits of decreased traffic pollution are even more dramatic in children.  In a birth cohort study, every interquartile range increase in traffic-related air pollution was associated with a 30% increase in a diagnosis of asthma and a 20% increase in ear, nose and throat infections in first four years of life.  Prenatal and postnatal exposure to various air pollutants has also been associated with reduced cognition, attention problems, and autistic traits in childhood.  Pooled estimates from a meta-analysis indicated a 12% greater risk of preterm birth per 10-\u03bcg increase in particular matter per cubic millimeter of ambient air.\nWhen one factors in the medical benefits of mitigating further climate change, an issue which the World Health Organization has declared \u201cthe biggest global health threat of the 21st century\u201d, it would seem incomprehensible that we would allow limited tax dollars (approximately $75 million, according to a recent report by the City Manager) to be wasted removing bike lanes which are clearly serving their purpose of encouraging active transportation.\nNo one will benefit from this pointless exercise, least of all your government,  Please reconsider\n"

        "comment": "5 reasons to reject this bill:\n-Prevent government overreach by rejecting this bill that forces municipalities to have to provide documented proof to a higher level of government that bikes lanes will not remove lanes for motor traffic.\n-Municipalities are going broke from having to maintain and replace infrastructure from decisions made decades ago; bikes cause much less wear and tear on roads, giving municipalities more time and money to address this. Removing the existing infrastructure will instead cost millions.\n-Getting cars to go as fast as possible should not come at the cost of providing safer infrastructure for active forms of transportation. The latter decreases overall health care costs, as providing more active transportation options and removing the exhaust from cars improves people's health.\n-Bikes, especially combined with good transit, is a cost-efficient way for citizens to explore their city; more money in people's pockets allows them to frequent and spend more at local businesses.\n-Getting as many people out of their cars as possible allows other drivers who actually need to drive get more quickly to their destination; see induced demand.\n"

        "comment": "We need to invest in more bicycle infrastructure, not less. This legislation seems to assume everyone travels by private automobile and only auto drivers need to get somewhere fast. Data and studies have shown that more lanes dedicated to car traffic induces demand and serve to encourage more car traffic, not less. You'll be grid locked again in no time. This has been proven the world over. This legislation further scapegoats cyclists in being blamed for an issue that they are not to blame. Cyclists serve to reduce congestion, pollution and ease of traffic. But this legislation serves to punish them as it will potentially discourage some people for hopping on their bike to commute instead of hopping in their car. This legislation is politically driven, and short sighted.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, my name is Vincent and as someone who commutes on a bike often, this bill is distasteful, wasteful of gouvernement funding and feeling distrustful if this bill does go through.\nRemoving bike lanes doesn't fix traffic since adding a lane just increase more people on the road and doesn't reduce the amount of people who goes on it. Anytime we add a new lane, it reduces the traffic for a week, then there's more people than ever before and it's worst after. Look at any new lane \"upgrade\" in United States, it causes more people to go on the road and creates *more* traffic than necessary.\nIf people are complaining about bike lanes *existing* on the road, the next thing that people and yourself will be complaining about, is that bikes being are now *On* the road, which in turn, will cause more traffic and more accidents, which will also increase more traffic, and the cycle goes on.\nIf you really want to reduce traffic, keep the bike lanes and instead of removing them; expand the bike lane network so that they can be off the road as much as possible so the drivers can just worry about the cars on the road instead both bikes and cars. The only time drivers should pay attention to bikes is when they are crossing the road like pedestrians.\nHere's an example on \"How a city died by limiting transportation to just cars\":\nIn the U.S. there's a small city names \"Bamberg\" where they severely limited pedestrian crossing the road and made sure that cars could travel faster, it turns out that the city died shortly after adding a fence between streets.\nKeep the bike lanes for safety reasons, financial reasons and the freedom of choice of transportation.\n"
