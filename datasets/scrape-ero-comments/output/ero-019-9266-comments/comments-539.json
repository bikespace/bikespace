        "comment": "Bike lanes in a country like Canada are absolute nonsense. One can use a bicycle for only a few months in a year due to the weather just like a motorcycle. If anything, the bike lanes only add to the gridlock issue especially in colder months. In some way the government\u2019s unsustainable immigration policies and poor infrastructure and urban planning contribute in a big way to gridlock. Once again this is  just another political move by inept and bloated government bodies that will waste tax payer dollars (and possibly generate kick backs to people in govt). Bike lanes do nothing for gridlock. The plan is laughable and reeks of political corruption. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Congestion in downtown Toronto will not be solved by removing bike lanes and I do not believe that alternative bike lanes will be placed efficiently or ever. This is a broken promise in the making. Getting rid of established bike lanes is not the way to build a better transport system. Adding more bike lanes and giving funding to public transportation is what will take cars off the road and improve congestion, not encouraging more use of cars by removing bike lanes first. Alternative systems of transport take additional cars off the road so that the people who truly need to drive aren't gridlocked. A few lanes here and there in Toronto is not going to do anything to fix its massive gridlock. You need to run more trains.\nAlso, the province should not have the final say over bike lanes in any city. My city can decide for itself how many bike lanes we want to have. This infringement on personal decisions is not what I would expect of a conservative government.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who is planning travel to Ontario, the removal of existing bike lanes will make me reconsider or alter my plans. Studies have shown that dedicated bike lanes increase bike ridership and decrease motor vehicle usage- thereby cutting down congestion for cars and reducing emissions. Additionally, changes to road layout made to accommodate bike lanes can actually positively impact motor vehicle traffic flow as well. Having dedicated bike lanes signals to me that a city is more easily traversable, either by car or by non-motorized locomotion, and is a selling point in a destination.\nPlus, the amount of construction disruption that would be needed to remove the bike lanes is enough to either move my plans or scrap them.\n"

Cars worsen congestion as they take up huge amounts of space and pollute. There is a place for cars, but only as a secondary mode of transport to other modes that naturally accommodate large volumes of people. Improving bike, pedestrian, and transit infrastructure is the only way to make it faster to move through Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Immediate Action Is Urgently Needed to Protect Ontario's Environment from the Impending Threat of Highway 413\nAs a concerned Ontario resident, I am deeply troubled by the potential long-term effects of Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. This bill, if enacted, could lead to the destruction of vital habitats, disruption of local ecosystems, and increased pollution, all of which could have lasting and severe consequences for Ontario's environment.\nThe Ontario government's push for Highway 413 appears driven by political and economic motivations, despite the significant concerns raised by environmentalists, urban planners, and local communities. The questionable long-term benefits of the highway in addressing congestion issues raise serious doubts about its necessity and effectiveness.\nConstruction Industry and Economic Development: The project has strong backing from some sectors that stand to benefit financially, such as construction and real estate. Building a new highway often stimulates local economies through job creation and boosts real estate values in the areas it will serve. Proponents argue it will create construction jobs and help businesses transport goods more efficiently, even though studies suggest this may not significantly relieve congestion.\nSuburban Development: The highway would open new areas for suburban development. Proponents envision it as a catalyst for economic growth, primarily as it would facilitate further expansion of the Greater Toronto Area. However, this sprawl could increase long-term infrastructure costs, exacerbate urban congestion, and reduce green space.\nPolitical Support: The government likely believes that Highway 413 appeals to suburban and rural voters who may view the highway as a solution to transportation issues and an investment in infrastructure. The idea of additional infrastructure often has a favorable political appeal, even when the benefits are questionable or heavily debated.\nProvincial Autonomy: By fast-tracking environmental reviews, the Ontario government aims to streamline processes it views as bureaucratic, asserting its autonomy and aligning with its broader political stance of reducing what it sees as federal and environmental \"red tape.\" However, this approach clashes with federal responsibilities to protect endangered species, watersheds, and Indigenous heritage sites.\nContradictory Evidence on Benefits: Studies have shown that Highway 413 might only save commuters seconds on their journeys compared to investments in public transit alternatives, which would likely provide better long-term congestion relief. The environmental cost and estimated $6 billion price tag have made opponents question whether the project is worth the financial and ecological expense.\nLocal advocates and environmental groups argue that investment in public transit, rail expansion, and improving existing roadways would offer more sustainable and impactful solutions without the extensive ecological costs. With mounting opposition, federal intervention has become critical in determining whether Highway 413 proceeds or is reconsidered in favor of more sustainable alternatives. This external oversight is crucial to ensure that the best interests of all Ontarians are served, not just a select few that stand to profit.\nMany Ontarians like me are looking for the provincial government to do the right thing and re-design Highway 413 for a full environmental assessment. This is crucial to ensure and uphold our shared responsibilities for species at risk, other wildlife, waterways, and protected lands.\nYou will likely prioritize Ontario's environmental future over the provincial government's current path, which appears driven more by political and economic motivations than by the best interests of Ontarians. Studies suggest that Highway 413 won't solve congestion issues but will jeopardize valuable ecosystems, encourage suburban sprawl, and waste billions in taxpayer funds\u2014all while destroying significant green spaces and habitats. This potential devastation to our environment is a grave concern for experts, local communities, and environmentalists who advocate for sustainable alternatives, such as public transit and rail expansion, to address our infrastructure and environmental needs better. Conservation is the way forward, not destruction.\nYour immediate action to prioritize a full environmental assessment for Highway 413 is crucial to prevent irreversible damage and move towards a more sustainable future for Ontario.\nThank you for your time and attention to this critical matter.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr. Sarkaria and Mr. Ford,\nI am a frequent driver in the GTA, as well as a user of our region's growing cycling infrastructure, including the protected lane on Bloor Street. I\u2019m reaching out to express my opposition to this bill, which would have serious negative effects on our community by worsening traffic congestion, limiting residents' transportation choices, and increasing costs for Ontario taxpayers.\nThe framework for bike lanes in Bill 212 would contribute to increased gridlock across the province. Currently, a significant and growing number of Ontario residents depend on safe, designated bike lanes as an alternative to driving. This option reduces the number of cars on the road, helping to alleviate traffic. If these lanes are removed, many cyclists will have no choice but to drive, further crowding our roads and worsening our traffic problems. Data from cities, both in Canada and globally, that have expanded cycling infrastructure consistently shows reduced congestion and improved travel times for all, including motorists. This is common sense, since bicycles and other mobility aids take up significantly less space than cars, and roads can fit more people when those people take up less space. Reverting to a time when roads like Bloor Street had lanes crowded with parked cars instead of moving people will only increase delays and frustration for everyone.\nAdditionally, bike lanes support financially responsible choices for everyone. Cycling provides an affordable, independent means of transportation, which is particularly valuable as fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance costs continue to rise. Reduced car congestion also means less wear on roads, lowering long-term maintenance costs and helping Ontario taxpayers make the most of their hard-earned dollars.\nThis bill overlooks the benefits of safe cycling options in easing traffic, supporting individual choice, and reducing costs. Instead, it would lead to greater congestion, limit mobility, and raise unnecessary expenses for residents, municipalities, and the province.\nI urge you to oppose this bill and to champion policies that give residents the freedom to choose their transportation, enhance public safety, and alleviate traffic congestion for everyone.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nA Mississauga resident\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and cyclist, I think this is ill-conceived legislation. In urban areas, the focus should be on moving people, not just private cars. More space efficient modes -- cycling, walking, scootering, public transit -- hold the promise to move far more people for a given piece of road network.\nSo, the notion that the default answer for repurposing an existing lane dedicated to vehicles for a more space-efficient mode should be \"no\" is exactly what you *don't* want to do if you're aim is to keep people moving in cities.\nThat said, planning should be data driven. I have no issue in having a requirement to show that bike lanes are being used and that the shift in lanes from vehicles to cycling (for example) is successfully moving more people. If lanes aren't successful, though, urban planners should have options. Perhaps changes are needed to encourage cyclists to use this route. Or perhaps this route will be underutilized until it is connected to other parts of the cycling network. Or -- in some cases -- perhaps a route is ill-conceived and just won't work. Let the data be the guide.\nThere will never be a way to accomodate never-ending growth of use of private, often single occupancy private vehicles in dense urban centres. Measures like this one, biased towards that mode, will always be doomed to fail as there is no way to significantly increase the road capacity in dense urban areas to accomodate limitless growth. The only way forward to to use the roadway more efficiently (intelligent traffic systems, smarter planning and encouraging more space efficient nodes).\n"

        "comment": "I do not think that this act is specific enough in its criteria for when existing protected bike makes merit being removed.  That is expensive process, in both people's time and taxpayers money, and this government should put more effort into clarifying these criteria.\nSecond, I do not think this legislation considers either the safety of cyclist commuters, nor the impact on cities' economic prospects adequately.\nThe premise here, that removing bike lanes at the expense of mixed traffic lanes is better for reducing commute times for drivers, is assumed rather than demonstrated.  Studies by local BIAs show that bike lanes have helped businesses along streets with these lanes, is the government justified in reducing their customer base at the expense of a possible reduction in commute times for some?\nIn short, this bill seems like it is not ready to be made law.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, this is the worst proposal I've heard for alleviating congestion and \"reducing gridlock\". I live in Toronto (Fort York) and am often unable to use my car due to intense gridlock in my neighbourhood. Unfortunately, the transit options are limited to streetcars and bus which are also subjected to traffic. I would love to be able to use a bike as my main source of transportation but I feel that the risk to my safety is to high. Although there are bike lanes in my area, the network isn't well connected and would require me to, at times, shared the roads with cars. Removing bike lanes only adds to congestion, causing would be cyclists to drive their cars and expose the cyclists still brave enough to bike unprotected alongside to increased risk.\nThis is an incredibly regressive proposal that directly goes against many transit studies. Instead of evidence based solutions that have been tried and tested across many international cities, the \"solutions\" proposed by the Ford government are founded solely on its desire to meddle in municipal politics.\nOther Solutions:\nCongestion Charges (London, UK)\nIncrease segregated bike lanes (Copenhagen, Amsterdam)\nTolling the Gardiner to encourage transit use\nIMPROVE TRANSIT (increase the frequency and speed of GO Trains/Via Rail)\n"

        "comment": "In a city where the cost of living is very high, I not only rely on biking to help get me places but also to help manage expenses. Toronto is a major city. It is unrealistic and unproductive to think its design should be optimized for allowing cars to drive around the CENTER of the city quickly. Instead, the city should be investing in and incentivizing people to use public transportation (TTC, Go), walk, and bike. It is so incredibly short-sighted to think bike lanes are the cause of Toronto's congestion rather than a part of the solution. I will be encouraging all my friends both within and outside the GTA to vote against the Conservative Party if they move forward with this provincial overreach into a domain that Torontonians and their local municipal government should have a say and control over. Not to mention, they are making bad faith arguments that use incredibly outdated data.\nBike lanes save lives. Don't kill me with this mistake.\n"

        "comment": "This bill goes against the advisory of city planners and is a counterproductive project that will only serve to worsen traffic conditions. Bike lanes actually reduce traffic congestion due to people switching their method of transportation, resulting in fewer cars on the road. The destruction of existing bike lanes will only cause worse problems both immediately due to construction and long term as adding more lanes to traffic does not significantly reduce crowding. Overall this is an ill-advised and poorly thought out bill that should not be passed.\n"
