        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212 and my disappointment in our provincial government.\nThe items in this bill do not move Ontario forward to build a safe, sustainable and accessible transportation system for all of us.\nLook around the world and you will see cycling infrastructures in many countries like The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and more.  This is not only a very essential tool in combating the climate crisis but also creates healthy and livable cities.  Limiting the development of bike lanes and increasing the number of car lanes does not do this.\nCities across the country like Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver, Fredericton and Ottawa have all invested in cycling infrastructure.  Our cities will fall behind if you pass this bill.\nBike lanes provide a safe way for cyclists to travel in urban spaces, reducing risk of collision and promoting a healthy, active lifestyle.  If bike lanes are removed and reduced, cyclists will be forced to cycle on the roads in car lanes with cars, competing with cars for space.   Cars are weapons.  Cyclists are not.\nBike Lanes also contribute to the solution for Climate Change.  There has never been a more critical time to support sustainable transportation and cycling has zero emissions.\nThe province of Ontario should allow municipalities to manage their own bike lane infrastructure without interference, as local governments are best positioned to understand their unique transportation needs and priorities. Municipalities work closely with their communities to design streets that support safety, sustainability, and accessibility, making them more capable of implementing effective bike lane solutions. Provincial restrictions on bike lanes would not only hinder local innovation but could also disrupt progress toward creating healthier, more livable cities that meet the specific needs of residents.\nI'm sure you have supporting documentation from various Biking groups, the University Health Network and more.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this Bill as it is in contradiction with reducing greenhouse gas emissions to reduce bicycle commuting. Additionally, I strongly oppose the government trying to overstep by taking land from individual Ontarians to build highways and taking away individuals\u2019 rights to fight any such action with the Expropriation Act. The Bill cannot pass.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes encourage commuters to leave their motor vehicles at home. Currently 75% of the population commute in private vehicles. The city of Toronto is not adding any new roads so space is fixed. Fewer bike lanes will force more people to commute by private vehicle. In a region like the GTA adding 50,000 new residents every year, there is no space for 75% of the population to commute by private vehicle.  Governments need to be encouraging activate transportation, including building bike lanes not removing them.\nThere is no conclusive data to show that bike lanes reduce motor vehicle travel times.\n"

        "comment": "Why is the premier of the province messing about with municipal streets? Aren't city streets municipal and not provincial territory.  Also, if you remove bike lanes, two things will happen. Either the number of cyclist will remain the same and there will be more vehicle/cyclist accidents, or those cyclist will start driving again and further increase the congestion issue by increasing the number of cars. There are plenty of studies that show that bike lanes have a positive influence on congestion. Removing them would be counterproductive to achieving the expected outcome and a total waste of tax payer money.\n"

        "comment": "Ford, I am speaking to you, and all those who support your proposed plans, directly. I am demanding your most undivided attention because it appears you are not listening to your constituents as a whole.\nIn the last few months we have seen a horrific rise in cyclist deaths on the streets of Toronto. The streets you propose to slash bike lanes from, Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave., are major paths north, east, south and west, making your plan that much more devastating. Devastating to those who rely on biking as a means to get to work, to school, to see friends and family, and to above all remain mobile in the city at a cost effective rate. You claim these proposed plans is to reduce congestion on the roads, but where is the consideration for cyclists alongside motorists? It is because there has been none, you fail to see how this puts cyclists in harms way. Since cycling regularly in the city for the past three years, I have had numerous brushes with motorists, fortunately none have resulted in serious injury or death but nonetheless the genuine threat to cyclist safety is ever present. This is because motorists already fail to pay attention to cyclists coming and going, the removal of bike lanes will only further put cyclists at greater risk of injury and death. Say, these proposals are passed, a true oversight and failure of your government, where and how do you propose cyclists travel? Do you propose we share the lanes with motorists? This would only add to congestion, no?\nI implore you to think rationally and with consideration to all who live in the city, your proposal has displayed a blatant disregard for everyone on the road and it is important you begin to see why that is wrong.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontarian who bikes as his primary mode of transportation, I urge the government to reconsider this nonsensical anti-bike lane legislation. Getting the province to micromanage the expansion of bike lane networks is the consequence of an outdated worldview that cars are the only viable mode of transportation.\nAs this CBC article details, more bike lanes get more people biking, in part because of the reduced risk of getting hit by bad drivers. (To say nothing amout the fact that it opens up biking to less able people, such as kids and the elderly.)\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nInduced demand goes both ways: build more highways, and more people will drive because it looks more convenient. Likewise, build more bike lanes, and more people will bike. These former Ottawa residents do a great job explaining the benefits of inducing public and active transportation in this short video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wlld3Z9wRc\nThis other video of theirs from Montreal proves that an integrated bike network can move more people than cars during rush hour, with a counter showing the numbers, if you wish to skip to the end:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F_B0HtewDU\n"

        "comment": "Ford's Highway Robbery: Bill 212 Paves the Way for Land Grabs and Ecological Destruction!\nI am writing to voice my opposition to Bill 212, as it raises serious concerns about environmental and property rights protections. One provision, in particular, prohibits registered owners from applying under the Expropriations Act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land expropriated by the Minister for priority highway projects. This change poses significant issues for affected landowners who may be forced to relinquish their property with inadequate flexibility and potentially insufficient time to make necessary adjustments or relocations.\nThis kind of fast-tracked, rigid approach undermines fundamental property rights while potentially facilitating projects that could have long-term negative impacts on Ontario\u2019s natural landscape and biodiversity. It prioritizes expedited infrastructure development without adequate checks and balances or consideration for environmental and community well-being.\nI urge the government to reconsider Bill 212 in its entirety, seeking a more balanced approach that respects landowner rights, upholds due process, and adheres to robust environmental standards. We must protect Ontario\u2019s environment and our communities through thoughtful, sustainable planning.\n"
