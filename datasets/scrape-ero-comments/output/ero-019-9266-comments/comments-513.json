Which in fact study after study suggests literal the opposite is true, as this will encourage more cars in our street. The provincial government should be focusing on investing in public transit and bike lane infrastructure to encourage people off the roads and prioritize pedestrian and cyclists safety.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident, homeowner, and taxpayer, I believe Bill 212 is a waste of provincial government money. Bike lanes are not installed with some bizarre agenda. They have been planned and investigated and discussed and voted on by municipalities. This bill proposes that the province should second guess all of this work and imposes more bureaucracy. Is the government's plan to spend more money and create more delays for the people of Ontario? I find this embarrassing from my provincial government.\nAs a driver, I want separated infrastructure so I can focus on driving safely for all road users. Bike lanes (in particular, separated lanes) give us all a clear zone to move in and avoids putting anyone who chooses to cycle into traffic with cars. I wouldn't want my nephew going to school or my mother heading to a doctors appointment to be forced into a lane with cars, let alone trucks, trailers, and larger vehicles. If the goal is to decimate cycling in Ontario, then perhaps this plan makes sense.\nAs a year-round cyclist that lives in the suburbs, I choose to leave my car at home because it is a healthy and CHEAP option. I go from point to point on my own schedule. I save more than two hundred dollars per month on fuel and parking. A removal of bike lanes will only make me have to reevaluate this choice, leading to more traffic on the road and impacting the affordability of my daily life. But even a delay in building proper infrastructure will increase the chances that I become an Ontario fatality statistic, devastating my family, community, and workplace.\nBill 212 should be scrapped. It is unnecessarily dividing our province, has no data to support it, and will lead to injuries and deaths. Voting in favour of this bill is choosing to make our province a worse place to live. Let's work on projects that actually save time by getting more cars off the road by encouraging cycling and public transit, and build homes near workplaces rather than constantly sprawling.\n"

In the last 4 years I have taken over 1,100 bikeshare trips and almost 150 carshare trips on the very roads and bike lanes targeted by this bill. As a Toronto resident, cyclist, driver and citizen, I strongly opposite both portions of this bill and continued provincial meddling in municipal matters.\nThe bike lane removal proposal defies basic math and observed data:\n\u2022\tBike Share Toronto alone is projected to serve almost 7 million trips this year. Converting those trips back into car trips would dramatically increase congestion.\n\u2022\tSystem ridership has grown 20% annually as more new riders feel safer in the growing protected bike lane network. Every year the growing bike lane network shifts trips to a form which uses less road space.\n\u2022\tRemoving bike lanes would force these trips back into cars, creating more congestion.\n\u2022\tEach bike trip converted to a car trip requires significantly more road space not just while moving, but also while parked. Every finished car trip occupies a car-sized space in the city that's not available for any other use.\n\u2022\tDocumented evidence shows that removing bike lanes increases driver-caused cyclist injuries and deaths, directly contradicting Vision Zero goals.\nPutting it simply: removing or slowing the growth of the bike lane network means fewer safe cycling options, more car trips, more congestion, and more injuries and fatalities, which this government considers an appropriate appetizer and diversion ahead of the main course: expediting a new highway through environmentally sensitive lands that would allow a few friends to make a few billion paving over the Greenbelt.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nThank you for providing me the opportunity to share my thoughts on this bill. As the bill itself states, the intention here is to reduce gridlock, and save businesses time and money. This is something we can all agree on - it's just common sense. Another important goal of this bill is to reduce the number of accidents and connect people. For too long we have been divided by our lanes, and it's time to finally bridge the gap.\nTo achieve these noble goals, the following is a list of actions I believe the city must take:\n- Create induced demand by building more lanes to get more cars on the road\n- Prevent cycling from constructing enough infrastructure to reduce the necessity of using a car\n- Disregard environmental factors (rushing or skipping impact studies entirely is strongly suggested)\n- Spend taxpayer money undoing something that was already recently completed\n- Weaponize legislation to create big government that dictates local affairs (not typically a Conservative value, but in this case I'll overlook it!)\n- Discourage cyclists by threatening them with a vehicle that weighs ~3000lbs\n- Promote local businesses by allowing cars to zoom right past them on their way home to Etobicoke (can someone say free advertising?)\nAnd the list goes on. While I do like the idea of reducing traffic, I can ONLY in good conscience support this bill if the above measures are taken. For that reason, I do not approve of this bill (yet!).\nBest wishes,\nA concerned citizen\n"

From your house to queens park it would mostly be bike lanes and then you are one less car off the street! Sounds like a good thing to me! Research shows the best way to reduce traffic is to provide alternative options. Bike lanes are that option. They also provide safety for fellow bikers. If you want to change anything then add more bike lanes, add better public transit, give people options to not drive! Taking away bike lanes might open a lane but it just forces people who do bike to go back to a car and you end up with just as much traffic. Please protect our bike lanes and the safety of riders on our Toronto streets!\n"

        "comment": "The bicycle lane restrictions are very shortsighted and fiscally irresponsible. It steps on the democratically elected municipal governments and makes me, as a taxpayer, driver and bicyclist, pay doubly for (in municipal taxes) bike lane studies and installs, then again (in provincial taxes) for either their removal, or their review. This increases bureaucratic friction and costs, something a truly conservative government should oppose.\nFurther, cyclists are a boon to cities. Making cycling safer and more efficient leads to a more vibrant and liveable city, allowing for increased density, lower pollution and urban temperatures, lower healthcare costs among other benefits. As a former resident of Toronto, anecdotally I can attest that the Bloor St. corridor is essential to cycling travel.\nIn short, I am extremely opposed to both the general direction and the specific implementations of the proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed addendum to the framework that would require the removal of sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto. As a concerned citizen and advocate for sustainable urban development, I believe that maintaining and expanding bike lanes is crucial for the well-being of our city and its residents.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes and return them to motor vehicle traffic is based on the assumption that adding lanes for cars will reduce congestion. However, extensive research and data have shown that this approach is fundamentally flawed. The phenomenon known as \"induced demand\" demonstrates that increasing road capacity by adding lanes often leads to more traffic, not less. When new lanes are added, they tend to attract more drivers, ultimately resulting in the same or even worse levels of congestion.\nIn contrast, bike lanes offer numerous benefits that align with the goals of reducing gridlock and improving the quality of life for Ontarians. Here are some key points to consider:\nReduction in Traffic Congestion: Bike lanes encourage more people to cycle instead of driving, which can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road. This shift can alleviate traffic congestion, especially in densely populated urban areas like Toronto.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transportation. By promoting cycling through dedicated bike lanes, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, contributing to a healthier environment for all residents.\nSafety: Dedicated bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. This is particularly important in busy areas like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, where the volume of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic is high.\nHealth and Well-being: Encouraging cycling has significant health benefits. Regular physical activity, such as cycling, can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improve mental health, and enhance overall well-being.\nEconomic Impact: Cities with robust cycling infrastructure often see economic benefits, including increased local business activity. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses, contributing to the vibrancy and economic health of the community.\nThe proposed framework also includes an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act, which raises concerns about the thoroughness and transparency of the decision-making process. It is essential that any changes to our transportation infrastructure consider the long-term environmental and social impacts.\nIn conclusion, I urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Instead, I advocate for the continued support and expansion of cycling infrastructure, which aligns with the goals of reducing congestion, improving safety, and promoting environmental sustainability. By investing in bike lanes, we can create a more livable, healthy, and prosperous city for all residents.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "This letter is submitted on behalf of the Safe Travel Planning Committee at Woodroffe Avenue Public School in Ottawa, Ontario. The committee consists of a group of parents who strive a) to promote active modes of transportation (walking, cycling, etc.) for students and b) to work with the school community, other community members and City of Ottawa staff to make these modes of transportation as safe as possible for children and families. We strongly oppose Bill 212, which would enable provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads requiring removal of a traffic lane and for existing ones, where a traffic lane was removed.\nOur Safe Travel Planning Committee wishes to instill in our children a love of walking and cycling to school that will carry through to adolescence and adulthood. Active modes of transportation offer students physical health benefits and a sense of independence and community, as they allow students and families to connect with neighbours at a pace where human interaction is still possible. Moreover, they help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with driving to school.\nOur committee has documented concerns from many parents in our school community, who have expressed that they would love to have their kids walk or cycle to school independently. Unfortunately, they hold back due to concerns about road safety. One commonly requested solution is more protected bike lanes. In Ottawa as in the rest of Ontario, there is a need for more biking infrastructure, not less. The provincial government should be working with municipalities to find ways to promote cycling, rather than displaying an antagonistic attitude toward it.  We are deeply concerned that, while cities worldwide are embracing opportunities for active transportation, our own municipalities face obstacles like Bill 212, which overlooks the compelling evidence of the benefits of biking for our community.\nCity of Ottawa staff are familiar with our neighbourhoods, streets and traffic patterns, and understand where bike lanes will serve to increase bike use and reduce gridlock, all while increasing safety for cyclists. They are best-placed to decide where bike lanes are needed and appropriate. We believe that Bill 212 is an inadequate and misguided approach to managing and approving the development of cycling infrastructure in Ontario municipalities. This legislation fails to address the critical needs of our communities and undermines the potential for safe and effective cycling solutions. We encourage you to reconsider Bill 212 and prioritize collaboration with municipalities to develop robust active transportation infrastructure. By working together, we can create safer, more efficient pathways that benefit our communities and promote sustainable mobility for all.\nThank you for considering our submission.\n"

Mean while people who do bike (which to be very clear, does NOT impact car traffic times) will be put in more danger from bike lanes that are removed.\nLast week I was chased by a driver of a pick up truck for biking down a road like I have my whole life.\nI was scared for my life.\nThese are direct outcomes of Premier Doug Ford's rhetoric.\nSo, in addition to making gridlock WORSE (I'm sure whoever reads these knows what induced demand is), residents of Ontario will be injured, and at worse, lose their lives commuting by bicycle.\nThis is not even to mention the evasion of required environmental assessments for highways.\nThis disgusts me to my core. To destroy the land that we will very much need in the next 50 years for farmland, for a highway that (once again) will not result in less gridlock.\nRobert Moses in 1940's New York kept building and building highways, and destroying everything else.\nI fear history is repeating itself.\nI stand so strongly against Bill 212 it's hard to put into words. Not just because of the obvious corruption of the proposed highways, nor the obvious political points removing bike lanes in Toronto scores in the suburbs, but because of the obvious intense health detriments to all in Ontario.\nI weep for the future of our province and it's people.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this bill and believe it will harm Canadians. I can tell you that I and many others will continue to ride our bikes on the streets and you will see how you are actively endangering the lives of Canadians. I promise you that if the existing bike lanes (that were expensive for the tax payer to build, and will be expensive for tax payers to remove) were to be removed that traffic flow will not improve. If we are really trying to improve traffic flow, we need to divert people out of cars in urban areas, they are simply the least efficient mode of transport considering their size to transport capacity ratio, especially when people are mostly driving alone which is crazy. Buses and the subway are incredibly efficient and improving their networks is what will take a chunk of people out of cars, creating more space on the road for the remaining car users, creating better traffic flow for all users of the road. Removing the bike lanes that already exist will cause detrimental damage since a demand has already been created for it, many people including myself rely on this network that currently exists. Without it some people will be forced to ride cars instead which as mentioned above are the least efficient mode of transport, further worsening the flow of traffic on streets, they are also a heavy financial burden on people (of which there are many) when considering high gas prices, insurance etc. Others may be moved onto the currently existing bus and subway networks which are already strained at times, worsening transportation flow everywhere. Others like myself will continue to ride despite the removal of safety, increasing my likelihood of injury or death. I like to think myself as an open minded person and always to view things from multiple perspectives, this however, I just don't see any benefits to this one.\n"

Second, bike lanes are one of the best safety measures for both drivers and cyclists. As someone who commutes by both bike and car depending on weather or mood, bike lanes will benefit me either way. As a diver I want cyclists safely out of my way, and as a cyclist I would like to be safe away from cars.
