        "comment": "LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS of the two largest cities in Ontario:\nTORONTO's population increased by 176000 since 2020;\nOTTAWA's population increased by 44000 since 2020.\nCar ownership in Canada (Ontario data not found in my cursory search) is 707 vehicles/1000 people.\nUsing these data, the number of cars on the road INCREASED by roughly:\n124432 in Toronto, and\n31108 in Ottawa.\nAdmittedly simplistic stats, but maybe this has something to do with congestion instead of a few bike lanes?!\nWe need to encourage people to use alternate modes of transportation. Making cycling less accessible, congestion will only keep getting worse. Cyclists that feel unsafe riding on roads without bike lanes may well go back to driving their cars, thereby increasing what this short-sighted proposal is meant to alleviate - namely, congestion!\nAnd please keep in mind, cyclists, like motorists, often look for the easiest and most direct route to their destination. Diverting cyclists on a roundabout detour to avoid certain roads is as welcome by them as it is when it happens to drivers. I don't see why cyclists are primarily targeted for alternative routing when it's much easier to do for a driver, i.e. less energy expenditure.\nThe mindset of car primacy and dependency is an archaic and backwards way of thinking. This bad habit has to be overcome for a future that's better for everybody and the planet.\n"

To suggest that building effective infrastructure to support more active transport action at a time when we are facing a climate crisis, a health care crisis as well as costs of living. Would it not make more sense to support cities to create more infrastructure to better support active living and commuting?\nThis is such a disappointing and clearly pandering proposal.\n"

I used to have weekly interactions where I would be almost hit by cars on my daily commute or when getting around the city on errands. Now that there are more bike lanes, I almost never have issues with cars anymore, and neighbourhoods with them are calmer and safer.\nBike lanes need to stay on main roads because the street grid is not designed for bikes on through streets--I used to try to avoid the main roads before bike lanes were put in, but it just doesn't work in most places.\n"

How can he do such a thing without depending on Mom and Dad for a lift simply because  the province is holding up necessary changes to deepen local municipal interconnections that doesn't involve a vehicle and provides a decent amount of confidence that they're SAFE.\n"

Why not use that money to build better transit. We need more bike lanes not less. More bikes means less drivers meaning less congestion. This is not post war car driving suburbs. It\u2019s 2024 and the only way to improve gridelock with Ontario growing is to get people out of cars. This government has done a lot of stupid stuff since they\u2019ve been in power but this might take the cake. Pandering to some rich people in a part of Toronto and making streets deadly.\n"

        "comment": "This is probably one of the most idiotic proposals any provincial government could be proposing in the year 2024. It is patently false on all accounts and is written by a government that is so car-brained it flies in the face of all modern urban planning.\nFor starters, bike lanes do not cause congestion they ease it. For every cyclist in a bike lane, that's one less car on the road. Multiply it out and do the math, it's simple. This legislation would create substantially MORE congestion and would be an utter waste of taxpayer dollars.\nYour government is supposedly against red tape as you are literally creating MORE of it with this lunacy. Municipalities will have to waste time and resources to justify bike lanes ALREADY INSTALLED. Talk about red tape indeed. It would be funny if it didn't have such drastic consequences if enacted.\nEmergency response times DO NOT get worse because of bike lanes. You only have to ask Toronto emergency services for your answer. Pick up the phone and ask them or just watch the multiple videos of them saying as much on YouTube. Go on, take a look right now, I'll wait...\nCool, now let's move onto businesses and how they benefit from bike lanes. Tell me, who is more likely to shop at a local business. Someone speeding by in a car or a cyclist passing by at a slower speed??? Perhaps you could Google this answer too! I'll save you the effort, businesses do better with bike lanes nearby as cyclists are far more likely to stop and shop. It's simple, more bike lanes leads to more business! What a concept!\nI could continue on and on and on but you already know deep down this is an incredibly dumb piece of legislation. If your government passes it, I will be leaving this province once and for all. I won't live in a place that spits in the face of good, modern, planning. I'm in school for urban planning and I hope you know that this is a running joke amongst us. This government is a clown car and it is truly embarrassing to be living in this province with garbage like this on the horizon.\n"

I do not wish to live in a province where our streets are designed for the comfort/convenance of people who chose to travel by car, while people who chose to consider the environment, their neighbours, and their own health are put at risk due to poor/nonexistent bike infrastructure.\nIt is a myth that more lanes for cars somehow reduces traffic congestion. The main cause of congestion is car dependency. While it may appear to increase vehicular traffic, adding bike lanes provides an alternative to car transportation by creating an additional transportation option thereby taking cars off of the road.\n"

The only solution to car traffic is viable transportation alternatives, such as active transportation and public transportation.\nThe proposal wants to get people where they need to go faster, which in reality it won't as induced demand will lead to the same amount of congestion due to the same bottlenecks.\nNowhere in the proposal is there any mention of safety for people outside of cars. As the population grows, as well as the proliferation of large cars such as SUVs and pickup trucks, along with distracted driving due to use of cell phones, it is becoming increasingly dangerous to be outside of a car, and drivers are increasingly more impatient thus causing traffic, accidents, injury and death.\nI would like this proposal repealed as this also adds an unnecessary level of bureaucracy to any municipalities who would like to improve their cities by impleting safe transportation networks.\n"

Allowing the province to enforce reviews is clearly an attempt by Premiere Ford to hurt cities like Toronto and Ottawa where they have managed their roads in ways that he finds personally inconvenient as a driver. As a resident of Toronto, I say stay out of our city and let us run things the way that we know works!\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is bad and should not go through. The way to fight gridlock is not to give more of our public space to cars. Numerous urban development studies across the world have amply demonstrated that when you add lanes of traffic, the only thing that changes is the volume of cars that eat up those lanes of traffic. If this government actually wants to decrease gridlock across the province, the only evidence-based way to do that is to increase investment in public transportation as well as bike infrastructure, so that there are alternatives for transportation that people can reach for beyond a car, which is the most space-inefficient way of moving large numbers of people. This proposal will not accomplish any of its stated goals, and is merely artificially increasing barriers to non-car transportation for the sake of pandering to the premier\u2019s political constituency.\n"

        "comment": "The only way to reduce vehicle congestion/gridlock that is backed by data is to give people viable alternatives to driving. Slowing down the construction of cost-effective alternatives like bike lanes, which cost less to build and maintain than vehicle lanes, can only contribute to gridlock. I do not support the proposal to introduce provincial oversight over bike lane construction that only acts as a veto. If the government is serious about involving itself in municipal decisions about bike lanes then it should also be proposing routes that it finds meet its criteria.\nThe proposed highway 413 only serves to funnel more vehicles into already-gridlocked highways. Vehicle occupants wish to travel to destinations which cannot support the volume of vehicle traffic they already face, and constructing more lanes to handle the traffic volume requires taking valuable surface area from these destinations. I do not support the proposed 413 and I would instead like to see the government propose highway alignments which can bring existing traffic volume to new destinations which are not already congested.\n"
