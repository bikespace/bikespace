Municipalities are more than capable of planning their infrastructure and can assess the viability of options for active transportation options without the need for provincial involvement.\nWhy does the province think that adding another layer of bureaucracy is a good thing?  It\u2019s redundant and costly, and will undoubtedly hinder the ability of municipalities to provide active transportation options\nThis bill is not based on any research or data a should not be passed\nThis is a step backwards in providing an ecologically responsible option for public transit\n"

All research surrounding bike lanes and their impact on traffic is positively in favour of bike lanes. Building roads just increases the number of cars. It never reduces the traffic. Building bike lanes, on the other hand, not only reduces traffic and increases the success of local businesses but also reduces emissions.\nWhat an incredibly ill informed and thoughtless move this government is making.\n"

        "comment": "Preventing the construction of bike lanes that remove a car lane will not save anyone any time. It will cost everyone more time. Every cyclist is a potential car not on the street. Doesn't matter if there's 2 lanes when you still have added congestion from the extra cars on the street. Not to mention that cyclists won't completely go away if you do this. Those without the means to drive will still cycle, but now they'll be on the road. So they're in more danger. Even if you don't care about the lives of cyclists, accidents where a cyclist is hit cause congestion cause a car blocks off a lane anyways. So what will cyclists do to avoid this? Use their right to take the full lane. Then the entire lane gets to go at the speed of the cyclist. That means even slower traffic.\nThe only surefire way to reduce congestion is to reduce the number of cars on the road. It needs to be safe and convenient to walk, bike and take the bus so people don't need to drive everywhere. Cyclists being forced to ride on the sidewalks if they're not brave enough to take the lane means walking is less safe which means less pedestrians. That means more cars for short trips again increasing congestion. If you make biking safe and convenient, make it easy to walk places and for longer trips keep transit moving smoothly you can reduce the number of cars on the road so even if there was only one lane there's still less congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This reads like a bad-faith bill with a misleading, performative description phrased to imply that bike lanes lead to grid lock and wasted time in traffic.  Putting more red tape barricades in the way of communities trying to progress away from car dependency by demanding data justifying the change while providing none of its own that suggests this would be beneficial to the communities it would affect.\nWe don't need a car to get around Ottawa and that is good for everyone whether they realize it or not.  It's easy to find studies that find bike lanes reduce traffic congestion and fatalities, just take a look.\n"

The BRAND NEW University bike lanes are my and thousands of others' safest route to and from work. Ripping them out immediately after they've just been finished because of the Ontario premier's bizarre beef with Toronto specifically is the most nonsensical thing I have ever heard. And this bill buries the intention to bypass important environmental regulations to undercut Canadian engineers for highway 413 at the bottom of the 'details' section. It doesn't come up once in the summary, which is unacceptable.\n"

To install the will ultimately make gridlock worse taking away the transportation choices from residents and forcing more car centrality on our province\u2026 this is a nonsense bill being set forward to polarize Doug fords voter base and distract from the healthcare crisis and housing crisis he has done nothing to fix. On top of that why are we\u2019re creating a blanket control over the whole of Ontario when the focus here is clearly Toronto (which is a whole other issue of why the province is meddling in Toronto as well)? Different communities have different transportation needs and should not be strong handed by the Province.\nThis bill needs to be killed or we are moving backwards while the rest of the world moves forward.\n"

        "comment": "This is yet another proposal that shows that the current Ontario government doesn't understand the first thing about managing traffic. Study after study has shown that the only way to improve traffic is to encourage people to use transportation other than cars, and that increasing the number of car lanes is at best a very short term solution that is prohibitively expensive. Replacing car lanes with bike lanes improves\n- traffic thoroughput\n- liveability\n- safety\n- environmental impact\nAt a very low cost. This is such an easy solution to traffic that the Ontario government is not only not pursuing, but is actively prohibiting without any evidence. Why can't the Ontario government hire a single urban planner with any understanding of urban planning, instead of just following the whims of the uninformed\n"

In fact, this proposal would put almost all of the projects in the city of Ottawa's Active Transportation Master Plan at risk.\nThis legislation undermines good transportation planning, and we are concerned it will make it more difficult to build bike infrastructure that can reduce the number of deaths and catastrophic injuries on our roads. It will also put all of the city\u2019s goals to mitigate climate change at risk.\nWe want common sense policies \u2013 to get from Point A to Point B safely and securely whether that\u2019s on foot, by bike, by bus, by train, and by car. Bicycles are part of traffic and deserve space on our roads.\nI am totally opposed to the provincial governments over reach in meddling with efforts municipalities are carrying out to make it safer for their citizens to bike safer.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the proposed legislation. Assessing transportation and traffic is a question for individual communities and bringing the province into it is heavy handed and unnecessarily bureaucratic.\nIn addition, placing responsibility for traffic on bike lanes, rather than the number of cars on the road, makes no sense. Every person who chooses to cycle rather than drive reduces traffic and makes more space for those who really need to drive to their destination. Making it harder for communities to encourage people to take alternatives to cars will not reduce gridlock. It will make gridlock worse.\n"

Building houses further and further out from the places people work without investing in multi-modal transportation networks is the problem. We do not have reliable transportation options and so people are left with few options other than driving their car to get to work. More cars, less bike lanes puts PEOPLE at risk. I do not support this proposed legislation and it is an insult to the people of Ontario who care about the planet and are trying to make a difference with thoughtful actions to reduce carbon emissions in our daily life.

        "comment": "This is such a backwards way of thinking. Bike lanes save lives and they reduce congestion. The only way to reduce traffic is less cars on the road. We do this through high quality, effective public transit and improved capacity for cycling and walking. We cannot sustain more and more cars, the city is growing and we need modern solutions. This policy is both dangerous and ineffective at reducing congestion. It is also a huge government overreach. Toronto should be able to decide how to use public space without the Ontario government stepping in. This focus on bike lanes is a distraction from the fact that Ontario has failed to complete important transit projects. I fear for the massive negative implications this policy will have for the people of Toronto.\n"
