        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212. As a recent transplant to Toronto from Los Angeles, California, I chose to settle here because of its vibrant, walkable, and bike-friendly downtown core. Bill 212 threatens to undermine these defining features, reducing the quality of life for Torontonians and all Ontarians alike.\nHere are my primary concerns with Bill 212:\n-Unnecessary Bureaucracy and Costs:\nBy introducing a provincial review process for existing bike lanes, Bill 212 would create unnecessary red tape, adding inefficiency and wasting public funds. This approach greatly contradicts the principles of fiscal responsibility and streamlined governance - principles that this provincial government purports to operate under.\n-Ineffective Traffic Management:\nExtensive research shows that removing bike lanes and adding car lanes does not reduce congestion. Induced demand means that increased road capacity leads to more traffic, not less. The most effective way to alleviate congestion is by investing in alternatives to driving, such as cycling infrastructure.\n-Compromised Safety for All Road Users:\nRemoving bike lanes will not eliminate cyclists from major streets; it will force them into shared traffic lanes. This creates dangerous conditions for cyclists and drivers alike. Dedicated bike lanes keep all road users safer by reducing conflicts and ensuring predictable traffic flows.\n-Essential Urban Infrastructure:\nFor many residents, including myself, bike lanes are as vital as sidewalks and public transit. In a dense city like Toronto, cycling is an efficient and sustainable mode of transportation, making bike lanes indispensable.\n-Impact on Delivery Riders and the Local Economy:\nBike lanes are crucial for delivery riders who support Toronto's economy by providing quick service to restaurants and customers. Removing these lanes endangers their safety and disrupts their ability to work efficiently. Delivery riders deserve safety and consideration in the same way that regular commuters do.\nToronto\u2019s bike-friendly infrastructure is a cornerstone of its identity, contributing to its livability and sustainability. I urge you to reject Bill 212 and prioritize investments that enhance, rather than erode, Toronto\u2019s active transportation network.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government must forget the 1950's and its now out-of-date push for more highways and use of the automobile as main vehicle of transport.  Both its pollution and misuse of land is a disaster for both our current and future needs.\nCarving the 413 out of the greenbelt would allow permanent destruction of farm lands, threatened  species  and the wetlands needed for drinking water to prevent future flooding caused by climate warming.\nMicro control of cycling bike lanes is an infringement on local and community control of this efficient, low carbon, low cost transportation system.  Former Toronto city planner, Jennifer Kiesmet, said the when a municipality reaches a population of 3 million people, it could no longer count on vehicle traffic as a viable source of mass transportation.\nI urge that this bill be dropped to protect our local democratic rights and our future climate survival by ending plans to block a Federal Environmental assessment of of the land degrading highway 413.\n"

This is a step backwards for our beautiful city and province and a stain on the country as a whole.  Do you ever travel to city's where cars ARE NOT the priority?  You know, I think they call them 'world class' cities?  Don't you think Toronto deserves to be one?  I can tell you this - nobody EVER has stated a city is 'World Class' because of the ease at which cars / SUVs can  traverse the infrastructure at a greater speed, endangering the safety of the masses of cyclists and pedestrians.  Do you think an Urban centre / City should just be a bunch of highways?  I just don't get the logic here.  This very bill has me strongly considering leaving the city I've loved my entire adult life, and the province I was born in.  Shame on you.\n"

        "comment": "I am a citizen of Ontario approaching my 80th birthday.  I move around the city by walking, cycling, public transportation and driving a car.  I use all modes on a regular basis.\nSafe, functioning, well-signed cycling routes and lanes are a boon to me whether I am walking, cycling or driving.  We need more, not less, opportunities in Ontario to cycle safely.  It is good for my health (mental and physical) and is an activity that promotes healthy social interaction.\nI have travelled and lived in many parts of the world and have experienced many different ways people move around urban areas in both Europe and Africa. Bicycles and the infrastructure that supports them is part of the transportation in modern cities everywhere.\nIn Ontario we should be learning from the best, not reverting to a less sustainable past. I think that it is sad that this bill proposes to make the movement of people better and faster, but will in effect prioritize cars over all other forms of transportation I can choose.\n"

        "comment": "This is yet another example of provincial over-reach into municipal jurisdiction, of bullying, of disregarding the safety of those who do not own cars, of putting people's lives in danger, of pretending that air quality, climate change and a more livable city don't matter. I drive to Toronto when I go because there is still very little GO Train service (which is shameful and where the 28 million dollars they are going to spend ripping out bike lanes should be spent) and as a driver I appreciate having safe, designated areas for cyclists instead of having them in multiple lanes. This plan is ignorant, backward looking, meant to appeal to GTA voters and not the people who actually live in Toronto. I want to see studies, proof and evidence before they start ripping out lanes that actually make a lot more sense than encouraging more cars when we need to focus on getting people out of their cars.\n"

        "comment": "Dear representatives,\nAs a twenty-five year old who was born in Toronto and have lived in this city my entire life, I feel the deep sense of urgency to plead you to consider the wellbeing of EVERYONE in the province, and keep all bike lanes. This is not a drivers versus cyclists war. This is about the future of the city, and having bike lanes is how we accomodate increasing populations. Using bike lanes, especially the ones that are proposed to be reomoved, have significantly bettered my wellbeing. Removing these lanes will nearly eliminate my mobility, greatly increase my time in traffic and commuting, and lower my quality of life. The congestion that drivers and cyclists alike have been dealing are often from the construction. It is not the integration of bike lanes. Removing these lanes using tax-payer dollars, that were built using tax-payer dollars, just don\u2019t make financial nor economic sense. Bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, and alike, need to stay and I present to you the supporting points. Additionally, the decision of whether bike lanes should be built, should be decided by municipals and their representatives, who best know the roads and whether these lanes are needed- not the provincial government. Making bike lane approvals a provincial issue would create unnecessary bureaucracy for the decision making of municipal issues.\nThe high density population of Toronto makes commuting difficult, and whether there are bike lanes or not, drivers hae to leave a minimum of 1 meter of space between bikers and the cars. What is the width of the bike lanes? The bike lanes help maintain that safe distance using a physical/visual barrier that keeps both drivers and cyclists safe and minimize collisions. That 1 meter of space will have to be maintained in all circumstances, so how does removing the physical barrier change how much space is available for cars? These bike lanes are in the downtown core that see cyclists at all hours of the day, unlike suburbs where the presence of cyclists is rare, so it will not reduce traffic congestion. More accidents from having no physical barrier, making it easier for cars to hit cyclists, will create more congestion when medical attention is needed. This will create more strain on the healthcare system and cost more taxpayer money while decreasing the well-being of the general population. More sick and disabled people also lower economic output of this province and country.\nPersonally, I much prefer to be driving where there are bike lanes instead of driving in the same lane as cyclists for the safety of everyone, as well as efficiency due to not needing to slow down and pay extra attention to not hit a cyclist. And many drivers are also cyclists, especially in the city centre. Cycling is faster than driving and taking the TTC, and just makes more sense when travelling short distances, like many trips are in the city. Cycling is also used in combination with public transit for a trip, again, due to being faster than driving or taking the streetcar to a subway station or to a car that I will carpool in. It lessens the congestion when I bike in the city. If cyclists do not feel safe cycling five minutes to the grocery store, than taking a car could be the next option. If all cyclists did this, this would only create more congestion which could easily be solved by NOT removing the current bike lanes. More cyclists also fit in one bike lane than one car lane. If these cyclists became drivers, the same issue of bad car traffic congestion still persists.\nBiking in the city is faster than taking the TTC and driving for me, and this has helped my physical and mental health be better than it has been in many years. It is thanks to bike lanes, that allow me greater mobility, making it easier and faster for me to commute to work, commute to quick dental appointments, spend at restaurants with friends, visit new places in the city. However, all of this is contingent on the existence of bike lanes, because it is unsafe to bike in the same lane as vehicles due to the hazards such as road rage, careless driving, and visibility issues. It is also not feasible to only bike on residential streets if the bike lanes on University, Yonge, and Bloor are removed because residential streets are often not straight like the previously mentioned streets, and would lead to much longer travel times. This eliminates one of the major benefits of biking- time efficiency. Without the current bike lanes, cycling is simply not a mode of transportation that I can rely on.\nBike Share Toronto also has data on the rapidly increasingly popular usage of their services over a few short years, and my family is one of the happy customers of this service. Their data is an indication that having the combination of bike lanes and access to bikes that are affordable and efficient, an in demand mode of transportation by citizens.\nAll around, removing bike lanes does not align with responsible economic efficiency nor city planning for efficient transportation of the population. Please, please keep the bike lanes to make this a livable city, and keep the development of bike lanes as a municipal issue, which would help with the efficiency of decision making.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto on major roads is not only a waste of taxpayer resources but a vindictive play that doesn't consider the Toronto citizens that use alternative forms of transportation.\nBike lanes are about safety. Removing bike lanes will not alleviate car traffic and will only compound congestion. Reports have already been published that prioritizing car transportation will not alleviate traffic.\nThis move is pathetic, vindictive and wasteful.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this proposed legislation for a number of reasons:\n1) time and time again it has been proven that adding a lane of traffic does not appreciably affect commute times. There is no evidence that the addition of the bike lane on Bloor has added any commute time (beyond that that the whole city experienced with increased volume)\n2) I fundamentally disagree with the provincial government interfering with things that are clearly municipal issues. Before installing bike lanes municipalities do the due diligence to ensure their location minimizes effect on traffic and, I think municipalities are best situated to make these decisions as those who have the most local knowledge.\n3) removing bike lanes just makes things more dangerous for cyclists and more difficult for cars. Without bike lanes, bikes will be forced to bike on the road, which, given the passing requirements (1m) means that cars will need to move to the other lane anyways. Bike lanes protect cyclists lives and also make cars lives a lot easier.\n"

        "comment": "I am sending this letter to voice my opposition to the proposed Ontario Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024.\nI. Highway 413 Act\nQuestionable government dealings & actions around this project.\nA 2021 Toronto Star report claims 3300 acres of land surrounding the alignment is owned by a few property developers. To append, \u201cmost of the developers in the group are also prolific PC donors, contributing at least $813,000 to support the party since 2014\u201d, said the report. With the presence of the highway, these properties may be reevaluated as residential property, with its value skyrocketing following suit.\nThe Highway 413 Act additionally gives the Province the power to expropriate privately-owned land along a highway without the chance to appeal. The implications are worrying, especially when considering that the term \u201chighway\u201d is very loosely defined by the Ontario government. To the point where all roadways are considered highways.\nHighway 413 will be devastating to the environment.\nThis Act will grant the Highway 413 project an exemption from having to conduct environmental assessments. An extremely careless move, considering that the current route of the proposed Highway 413 would cut through parts of the Greenbelt, impacting almost 30 federally-listed endangered species of animals.\nHighway 413 is not the best option.\nHighway 413 will cost Ontario billions of dollars to construct and additional money to maintain regularly. Give it a few months after it's open to the public, and Highway 413 will inevitably fill up with traffic, just like with any other highways in proximity, except for the 407, because demand will eventually match supply, if it is not constrained. Why not find ways to get people to take the nearby Highway 407 instead of erecting an entirely new highway?\nInstead of building the 413, the Province should ideally massively expand public transportation, both local level transit and long-distance services. Public transit moves more people, being a comparatively cost-effective alternative to building a brand new highway, all the while being environmentally friendly and convenient. A new double-tracked rail line with state of the art railway technology and rolling stock costs dramatically less than a highway of the same length, it will have the same, if not more capacity while taking up a tenth of the footprint.\nII. Bicycle lanes\nMost of the arguments on bicycle lanes covered in this letter are based on this Bluesky thread by journalist Matt Elliott. https://bsky.app/profile/graphicmatt.bsky.social/post/3laud6pusb22j\n1.        Converting bicycle lanes to car lanes will not speed up traffic.\nThe idea of eliminating bike lanes in an attempt to ease traffic congestion is essentially incorrect and not backed up by any data. Actually, studies and historical data have shown that eliminating bike lanes will not lower traffic. In fact, Toronto has removed bike lanes in the past for car lanes, case in point: Jarvis Street, 2011. The city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion.\nFurthermore, construction work will block and reduce usable road space significantly, bottle-necking every form of traffic on that street (cars, transit, bikes, etc.). Ironically generating more congestion for the tiny sliver of chance that traffic will speed up when it is done.\n2.        Government overreach - Toronto disagrees, Province is going to do it anyway.\nThe Annex is a neighbourhood that will be affected by the Bill, it currently benefits greatly from the protected bike lanes on Bloor Street. In fact, the installation of these bike lanes directly correlated to a business boom in local stores. Given that fact, the neighborhood\u2019s BIA strongly opposes the Province\u2019s bike lane removal.\nOntario Bill 212 was discussed during a Toronto council meeting on November 14th, during which a vote among elected municipal councillors was held to determine whether or not Toronto would oppose the Bill. This vote passed 21-4 in favour of opposing Bill 212. It is clear that the City of Toronto does not want to remove existing bike lanes, and any attempts to do otherwise is undermining local democracy.\nProponents of this Bill have deceitfully used exaggerated data to argue for the removal of bike lanes. In particular, the claim that only a measly 2% of Torontonians regularly bike. This claim is frequently parroted by Doug Ford and Prabmeet Sarkaria to any form of criticism of the bill. However, it is based on an outdated source, far before the installation of much bike infrastructure. Of course the car-centric suburban neighbourhoods with abysmal non-automobile infrastructure will have fewer people willing to bike compared to more pedestrian and bike friendly areas, the 2% figure fails to consider differences in biking levels between different areas. We do have evidence to suggest the addition of bicycle lanes impressively elevates bicycle traffic on a street, some recorded as high as 656% increase in bike traffic, as stated by a City of Toronto report.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not get rid of any bike lanes in Toronto. Internationally, this city has started to receive accolades for the way cyclists are supported. Why change that now?\nI do not have a car, I go to work on my bike or on the TTC. My bike is far more reliable than the TTC at this time.\nBikes are a healthy way to travel. Cyclists are not polluting. We are getting exercise. The bike lanes take up very little space on the roads. The TTC is stressed in Toronto as it is, and traffic in this city is awful. Those problems will worsen if people like me can not bike to work and have to take the TTC or drive. And where will all those additional cars park?\nPersonally, I do not bike on any city streets without bike lanes, I don't feel safe. I can get to most areas of the city biking only on streets that have bike lanes. If major bike lanes are removed, many cyclists will continue to bike along those major routes, but they will have to bike in the road with the traffic. That is within our rights, but it is unsafe for cyclists. And cars will not like having bikes traveling in the traffic as we will slow them down.\nThe outcry over this has been enormous. Don't get rid of any of Toronto's bike lanes. Take all the money that would be used for getting rid of perfectly good bike lanes and use that money to improve transit. Or any number of city issues. Bike lanes are not an issue or a challenge for this city right now so please don't waste money on this.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, there will be an increase in fatalities. As prepared as politicians may be to accept that fact, I don't think they will accept it well if their family members or friends are one of them.\nThis is a world class city.

This data predates the installation of key bike lanes on streets like Bloor and University and fails to reflect the needs of nearby residents. The Ford Government should use recent data collected after the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor and University of residents who live close enough to use them. Please see the first link below for more details on these numbers.\n- Wasteful Spending: Removing existing bike lanes would waste Toronto taxpayers' money and fail to address the genuine causes of gridlock.\n- Cyclist Safety Concerns: With cyclist fatalities at an all-time high, removing bike lanes would exacerbate safety issues, disproportionately affecting those who cannot afford to drive and rely on cycling as their primary mode of transportation.\nAs the city grows, so too will vehicle traffic. The solutions to reducing congestion lie not in removing or preventing the establishment of bike lanes but in supporting reliable alternatives such as public transportation, walking, and cycling.\n"
