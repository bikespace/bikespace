        "comment": "As a resident of Etobicoke-Lakeshore, I feel betrayed by my MPP Christine Hogarth and Premier Doug Ford. Bill 212 is a regressive plan to double-down on car-centric planning, something that directly contradict's the Province's own climate and planning goals. I am a resident who used to drive to work everyday to the Bloor and Sherbourne area. Since the extension of the Bloor Street protected bike lanes I now feel safe enough to commute by cycling or a combination of cycling and subway. That is one less car on Bloor Street or the Gardiner, every day. I fear this government has not contemplated the implications of removing life-saving infrastructure that ultimately removes cars from the road. Having cars and bicycles share road space has proven to be a deadly combination. Six cyclists have lost their lives this year in Toronto as a result of driver's actions. This bill signals that the life of a cyclist is worth less than travel times for cars. Decades of research has shown that we cannot continue to add car lanes to address congestion. Induced demand is a concept this Government has shown to either not comprehend, or be willfully ignorant of. As our city densifies, automobiles become the least efficient mode of transport, both in terms of capacity and how much space they occupy. This Government should instead focus on delivering the long-stalled transit lines currently under construction in Toronto. Ripping out recently built infrastructure should go against every Progressive Conservative political instinct, as it is fiscally belligerent and nonsensical. I fear this Government no longer possesses such instincts, and instead is fuelling a wedge issue with an upcoming election in mind.\n"

It gives far too much power without oversight to the Provincial government and will politicize the construction of highways and, mostly importantly for me, the construction or (even scarier) the de-construction of bike lanes all over the province. In an era of climate change we must do more to reduce the use of personal vehicles and encourage the use of clean transportation, namely cycling. We owe it to our children and grand-children. DO NOT ALLOW THIS POWER GRAB BY THIS GOVERNMENT  !\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes is deeply flawed and wasteful. It shows a clear disregard for taxpayers and fails to address the real issues affecting workers and businesses. If the government truly wanted to improve gridlock, it would invest in public transportation and reduce dependency on cars, rather than eliminating infrastructure that supports sustainable transit options.\nCars are inefficient, costly, environmentally damaging, and a poor long-term investment. Instead of doubling down on car-centric infrastructure, the government should prioritize high-speed public transit for both people and goods. This would benefit Canadians and businesses by offering faster, more reliable, and sustainable solutions.\nIf the government acknowledges the problems caused by accidents and road closures, it should focus on de-prioritizing cars, not entrenching reliance on them. Similarly, any interest in digital connectivity has no logical connection to removing bike lanes.\nBuilding a new highway or removing bike infrastructure will not solve the underlying issues. Instead, we need policies that make alternative transit options more appealing, practical, and accessible.\nThis proposal lacks foresight, stinks of conservative sell-outs and should be thrown out entirely.\n"

        "comment": "Wrong Direction: Ontario's Misguided Transportation Planning\nThe transportation department's decisions are deeply concerning, particularly their approach to reducing cyclist accessibility and safety. The Greater Toronto Area's highways are already severely congested, yet instead of addressing this, Ontario is planning to build new highways near Bradford while GTA commuters remain stuck in ever-worsening traffic.\nFor decades, we've lost countless hours of productivity due to overcrowded highways. Rather than implementing effective solutions, the current plan seems to encourage more car dependency by expanding the GTA's reach north of Bradford with costly and unnecessary highway projects. Making matters worse, reducing cycling infrastructure will likely force more people to drive, further contributing to congestion. These decisions seem to contradict basic transportation planning principles and common sense.\n"

I personally bike to work only if I know that my route has bike lanes which make me feel relatively safer in a city that is really not otherwise bikeable.I have been impressed by how many more bikes I see on these routes. A mixture of better public transit and bike lines on key streets relieves traffic, is environmentally friendly and is forward thinking. Please leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "I am registering my strong disagreement with this proposal. At a time when we should be facilitating decreased use of cars to decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality and decrease dependence on fossil fuels, this proposal is retrogressive and represents a step backward. \"Sustainable cities of the future will be those where transport options that do not depend on fossil-fueled private vehicles are the norm\". Removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto will use money that could better be used elsewhere (education, health, housing) and the construction required to remove bike lanes will have detrimental environmental impacts. Furthermore, the proposal to remove bike lanes in Toronto and to require provincial approval for bike lanes in all municipalities oversteps the mandate of the provincial government.\nTraffic congestion does not result from bike lanes. It does result from:\n- lack of workable alternatives to the car, including networks of CONNECTED bike lanes and efficient public transportation\n- blockage of roads by road construction projects, building construction that spills into traffic lanes, closure of traffic lanes to provide parking space for workers, failure to open up traffic lanes that no longer need to be closed\n- delay in completion of construction, including that of public transportation lines\nBike lanes keep cyclists safe. They also make it easier for traffic to navigate streets used by vehicles and cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Honorable Ministry of Transportation,\nThe passage of Bill 212 \u2014 the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" \u2014 is a deeply disappointing legislative move that prioritizes vehicular traffic at the expense of vulnerable road users, especially cyclists. Your decision to limit municipalities' authority to expand and maintain bike lanes risks endangering countless lives and undermines years of progress in safer urban mobility.\nToronto's recent wave of cyclist fatalities paints a grim picture of the dangers your bill exacerbates. A 24-year-old cyclist lost her life on Bloor Street this year, forced to merge into traffic due to a construction obstruction in the bike lane, only to be struck by a large truck. This tragic death is a vivid example of how incomplete or blocked bike infrastructure leads directly to loss of life, highlighting the life-and-death importance of consistent, unobstructed bike lanes.\nThe statistics are damning: Toronto's cycling deaths in 2024 have already surpassed totals from the last four years combined. Dump trucks and other heavy vehicles on poorly managed or inadequately separated cycling routes create fatal risks that could have been mitigated through more robust bike lane protection. Your bill's undermining of these critical safety measures is a dereliction of duty to the public good.\nStudies and ongoing incidents illustrate that cities with comprehensive cycling infrastructure see reductions in traffic fatalities, improved air quality, and vibrant local economies. Fewer bike lanes mean greater traffic congestion as more citizens opt for cars, perpetuating the very gridlock you purport to reduce. This bill leaves Toronto\u2019s cyclists \u2014 and all those across Ontario \u2014 exposed to a legacy of preventable tragedies on our streets.\nWe urge you to reconsider the sweeping, counterproductive measures in Bill 212 and commit to policies that truly prioritize safe, equitable transportation for all Ontarians.\nSincerely,\nA Concerned Advocate for Safer Streets\n"

        "comment": "This is gross provincial overreach and impugns on people's abilities to elect local politicians to represent their interests. The bike lanes in Toronto are supported by the local community and city council has recently voted to reject this proposal, showing the provinces misstep in trying to enforce these changes.\nFurthermore, bike lanes play a large part of reducing traffic in cities, not creating it. It's clear to see that the large amount of space taken up by cars both on the road and while parked causes much more traffic than relatively tiny bikes that are using these bike lanes. By removing these bike lanes in favour of lanes for cars, the Ford government will be creating more traffic not only in the streets that it is removing the bike lanes from, but also in other parts of the city as well.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my outrage at Bill 212\u2019s petty, ignorant, and irresponsible assault on existing and future bike lanes in Ontario.\nThe Province must keep its hands off municipalities\u2019 bike lanes because:\n1)\tBike lanes save lives. Every year Torontonians die getting around by bike due to car-centred infrastructure and culture. If the Province removes existing bike lanes, and quashes the new ones that are needed, there will be even more cyclists\u2019 blood on Toronto\u2019s streets.\n2)\tThe planet is on the brink of irreversible climate catastrophe. Even if bike lanes did significantly slow down motor vehicle traffic \u2013 and they don't (see below!), our precious little commute times will become an irrelevancy when an unhinged climate destroys infrastructure, and the fabric of society unravels into a dystopian world. Motor vehicle travel accounts for huge amounts of emissions (and yes, e-vehicles are a part of this, through every stage of their manufacturing and delivery process, and the destructive road system needed to support motor vehicles, often occupied by a single person.)\nCycling, in contrast, is the most efficient form of urban transportation. It is the future of cities. Cycling reduces lethal pollution (and thus healthcare costs), staves off climate catastrophe, reduces gridlock \u2013 every cyclist is a potential driver, especially for local trips! \u2013 and creates healthy neighbourhoods that people want to live in \u2013 not drive through.\nIt has long been clear that for Premier Ford, Toronto is just a commuting route. This is not what the people of Toronto want. Bike lanes have vastly increased cycling volumes, and many more people would replace a significant portion of their local driving trips with cycling if infrastructure and culture made it safe to do so.\n3)\tLike pedestrian zones, bike lanes attract young brains and talent to cities. They greatly enhance the quality of life for young and old. Bill 212 takes Ontario in the opposite direction of the great cities of the world \u2014 Paris, London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Dublin, Montr\u00e9al, and on and on. Bill 212 shoves Ontario into a backwater.\n4)\tBill 212 demonstrates and enables unacceptable overreach by the Province. Municipalities should have the right to choose urban design and infrastructure that works for them.\n5)\tPerhaps the most enraging thing about Bill 212 is that ripping out bike lanes will NOT significantly reduce commute times. This has been shown over and over, and was included in a report by Toronto City staff presented to City Council Nov. 14, 2024.\n6)\tThe City of Toronto has confirmed that removing the bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge Avenues, which is one of the purposes of Bill 212, would cost the Ontario taxpayer around $48 million, and also sink the $27 million investment of installing the lanes in the first place. It would also require nine months of construction-related lane closures that would make car travel times much worse in the near term. And after all this, as noted above, the impact on driver travel times after the lanes are removed would be minimal. (See staff report presented to Toronto City Council on Nov. 14, 2024).\n7)\tIf Queen\u2019s Park is serious about reducing road congestion, it should levy a hefty tax on single occupancy of cars, and invest in a public transit system throughout the GTA that is so excellent and well-connected that even the affluent will want to take it, as one finds in many European cities.\n8)\tThe \u201cdrivers vs. cyclists\u201d mentality that underlies Bill 212 is petty, ignorant, and unacceptable. Most people who use a car would love to be able to swap it out at least sometimes, but hesitate because of unsafe infrastructure. Almost everyone who gets around by bike understands the need for some motor vehicles.\nI have lived in Toronto for some 36 years. At this point in my life, I could buy any car I wanted. But I have always chosen to get around by bicycle, for health and environmental reasons. Although I am now a senior, since the creation of some decent bike lanes in the city \u2013 notably the flagship ones that Doug Ford wants to rip up through Bill 212 \u2013 I have been getting around by bike more than ever \u2013 to shop, to go to classes, concerts and shows, to visit friends and family, to deliver meals on wheels as a volunteer. My travel times have decreased because of these bike lanes \u2013 why do cyclists never enter into the Ford government\u2019s calculus of so-called \"commute\" times?\nBill 212 is not bad policy and bad governance. It must be repealed.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not go ahead with this bill. It goes contrary to all the evidence that shows that bike lanes do NOT contribute to motor vehicle congestion. Removing existing bike lanes, or making it more difficult for municipalities to install new ones, will actually increase car traffic and congestion: the more lanes you open, the more cars you attract. More cars on the road with fewer safe options for cyclists also increases the risk of injuries to cyclists at the hands of careless drivers.\nIt's a shame the Ontario government is pandering to suburban voters, and spending money on more and more roads, instead of following the evidence-based approach that improves travel and transportation for everyone. Please build fewer roads, and instead put our (my) public funds toward smart, safe, environmentally friendly transportation networks: bike lanes and public transit.\n"

We need more bike lanes, not less!\nAll the data I've reviewed clearly shows that over time (within a year) bike lanes reduce congestion, get people fit and boost the local economies where those bike lanes are, not to mention the impacts on reducing our carbon footprint.\nI spent the better part of my career working in Montreal and rode to work and back on dedicated bike lanes and paths. Roughly 1/3 of my colleagues did the same (even in winter because the bike lanes get plowed before the streets do!) The city has over 1000 KM of bike lane infrastructure. Those lanes have removed many vehicles from the road, particularly during working hours. Their traffic is still terrible but not from bike lanes. It's from constant construction.\nI just returned from The Netherlands and we could learn a thing or two about creating a cycling culture within our cities.\nThis is an early pre-election ploy and is absolutely ridiculous legislation.\n"
