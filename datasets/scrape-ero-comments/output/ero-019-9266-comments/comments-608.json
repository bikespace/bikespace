        "comment": "I'm appalled at this proposal. Myself and my family (including two children under age 10) regularly use the bike lanes to traverse the City of Toronto, including those that are immediately targeted for removal (without any sense of if/when alternatives would be provided). The Ministry staff who are working on this proposal must know full well how counter-productive it is, how politically motivated it is, and how unsafe the results will be. It is shameful to see politicians selfishly ignore the abundant evidence. This move will not ease traffic congestion, it detracts from the viability of the cycling network in Toronto that is only just coming together, and only serves to make vulnerable road users more exposed to risk. It is a cynical move that tramples municipal democratic decision-making in order to create a political wedge issue at the expense of the safety and well-being of families like mine. These lanes are vital infrastructure and they must be maintained. Their removal would be a wasteful step backwards that will make using the public roads worse for both people who choose to cycle and people who choose to drive motor vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock or save time, and increases danger to all road users.\nI am a driver, cyclist and pedestrian. I am greatly concerned that this bill has been drafted according to misinformation and special interests of a small group of people who have misrepresented the facts of Toronto's gridlock.\n1. Toronto's gridlock is not caused by bikelanes\nThe Globe and Mail recently highlighted the actual bottleneck areas in the city, which were all tied to highways, not surface streets.\n2. Bike lanes actually improve response times for emergency vehicles\nToronto's fire chief and various studies have spoken about how emergency response times have been improved with the presence of bike lanes.\nFurther, the bike lanes on University Ave were requested by hospital staff to support their staff in getting to work safely.\n3. Bike lanes take up too much space\nWith approximately 5600km of roads in Toronto, Toronto has 215.5km of cycle tracks and bike lanes - less than 4% of streets. Further, on those streets, the bike lanes typically occupy ~25% of any given street, leaving only 1% of actual road space given to cyclists. The proportion is especially notable as even with the increases of the last few years, less than 1% of road space in the City is dedicated to bike lanes.\nCycling infrastructure gives options to people so that they can get around the city safely without taking the car. The city has been built up around major thoroughfares, which are frequented by many because they efficiently connect the different parts of the city, are the locations of many local and small businesses, and feature many of Toronto's notable attractions.\nI have ridden bikes in Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa and Kitchener. It is obvious in each city the difference in safety that bike lanes make, and the increase in use that safe cycling infrastructure enables. Ultimately, this bill will remove safety infrastructure and delay or stop its implementation, which means it is a bill that endangers the lives on Ontarians.\nI frequently ride my bike up the Yonge St bike lanes, and I often have thought about the fact that bike lanes could have helped to prevent or lessen the deaths of the Younge Street van attack in 2018. Bike lanes protect cyclists, but they also protect pedestrians.\nI urge you to withdraw this bill and allow municipalities to continue making decisions for themselves.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is utterly ridiculous!  Urban bike lanes are not in the jurisdiction of the provincial government, as they are, and should remain, a municipal matter.  In addition, this is a huge step backwards in every respect.  Every modern and forward-thinking city in the world makes accommodation for alternative transportation.  More cars is not the answer to the world's problems!\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make our city safe , are environmentally friendly, and actually reduce car congestion. As some who drives and bikes regularly, I see first hand how critical it is to have divided bike lanes. Bloor, Yonge, and University will not stop bikers from using those streets to commute. By removing divided bike lanes, the Ontario Government is intentionally putting Toronto citizens at major safety risk. Not only will removing bike lanes INCREASE traffic, but it will also increase the number of accidents between bikers and drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this proposal. Requiring provincial involvement/approval for any municipal bike lanes is not only a gross overstep of the provincial government into municipal matters, but also will absolutely not solve the issues of traffic congestion and gridlock it purports to - all it will do is discourage people from cycling and put those who continue to do so at greater risk, while traffic in cities like Toronto continues to be untenable.\nResearch shows that dedicated bicycle lanes do not cause increased traffic congestion AND that that building roads with more lanes for cars does not reduce congestion: more car lanes only encourage more people to drive (source https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319).\nProtecting Toronto\u2019s bike lanes is also of personal importance to me, as both a cyclist and a driver.\nCycling is often faster than driving and as such it\u2019s an option I value greatly. The addition of bike lanes on major Toronto streets has made cycling safer, easier, and more enjoyable for casual commuting cyclists like me. However, I would not cycle on major streets such as Bloor or Younge without a protected lane, and not being able to use those major arteries significant limits where I can safely travel on a bike.\nI am also a daily driver, and having bike lanes makes me more comfortable sharing the road with cyclists, knowing they have a designated space and ideally are protected. I do not want an extra lane for cars. Removing protected bike lanes will not stop cyclists from using those roads, it will only make it far more dangerous for them to do so.\nThe province of Ontario should stay out of municipal affairs and focus on real, proven solutions to improve traffic congestion that are actually within its mandate, such as supporting municipal efforts to expand public transit, for example by getting the Eglinton Crosstown completed and investing more in the TTC.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for taking my feedback into consideration.  I am a Registered Professional Planner working in Ontario who has experience in Toronto and the broader GTHA region, as well as a resident of Toronto who is immediately impacted by this Bill and the proposal/potential to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street (I live on Bloor Street West). A such my feedback reflects both some professional opinions and my own frustrations as an individual and local resident of Toronto.\nThe main culprits of congestion are CARS, and to get to the root of the issue the Province needs to develop policies and invest in strategies that get people out of cars and using other means of transportation. There are simply too many cars. This Bill\u2019s focus on highways and demonizing bike lanes is counterintuitive to the intent of the Bill in reducing gridlock and saving people time.  Bike lanes are part of the SOLUTION and I urge the Province to treat them as such and instead seek ways of encouraging them and reducing barriers to their implementation. PUBLIC TRANSIT is a critical piece to the solution as well, instead of focusing on getting drivers (who are usually one per vehicle) anywhere faster, the focus should be on people. Ontario needs vastly improved regional transit and local transit and cycling networks to support them. I urge the government to explore how they can move along critical transit infrastructure projects as a priority over removing bike lanes and promoting highway construction which will only encourage more car ownership and use. In no way does this Bill do this, and as such will not solve for congestion in any sustainable way. Better transit also means less congestion in urban areas like mine from drivers commuting in from the outer suburbs.\nAs a Bloor West resident in Toronto, I rely on the incredible bike lanes on Bloor and other streets to keep me safe (and they are enjoyable too). I am a regular user of the Bike Share system and I am also an occasional driver and our bike lanes keep everyone safer.  I have been hit by cars in the past on streets without bike lanes and this is not uncommon, if you take time to talk with anyone who bikes in this city, you will understand how common it is and this experience makes new cyclists hesitant to adopt it. I often am told by friends, families, or communities I consult for work that they will not bike anywhere without a bike lane. Along Bloor we have shops, daycares (I see daily parents are biking with their kids to daycare and school in my neighbourhood on Bloor), homes, parks, schools, and more that benefit from having a safe bike lane separated from car traffic. Bike lanes are imperative to giving people other options aside from driving to get around. With this in mind, I don\u2019t feel the proposed Bill has Ontarian\u2019s interests in mind (especially those in Toronto where the broader region is trying to access), only cars and drivers.\nAside from the physical safety risk this Bill poses, it places the burden of car congestion and other health impacts (like air quality from vehicle exhaust and general quality of life) onto urban communities. I pay a high cost to live in Toronto, in a walkable and bikeable neighbourhood, close to my daily needs so I don\u2019t rely on a car and can make sustainable lifestyle choices. I understand that cars will always be a part of our transportation system and there will always be congestion, in fact congestion is an important factor in shifting people\u2019s behaviours (which is a GOOD THING, yes I said it, congestion can be a good thing sometimes). The broader region is still very much car-oriented and dependent and many choose to commute into Toronto neighbourhoods like mine often because there is no viable alternative with public transit. This Bill sends the message that the Provincial Government does not care about urban communities and our quality of life and rather cares more about their car driving constituents. I urge the Province to rethink their approach to solving congestion and working with suburban municipalities to become less car-oriented and encourage fairness in sharing the burden of change that is NECESSARY to move our region and province forward to becoming more sustainable and climate resilient.\nAs someone working in land development and pushing to build more homes faster, adding another level of bureaucracy to oversee development with bike lanes is completely nonsensical and counter to the Province\u2019s alleged commitment to removing red tape (accelerating public transit projects would be far more effective). Bike lanes are also an essential infrastructure, as with sewers, electrical, etc., especially in a City like Toronto that is actively minimizing parking for new development (doing their part to reduce the number of cars on streets contributing to congestion). We need infrastructure like bike lanes to discourage car ownership in urban areas, period. This Bill does not acknowledge this, and therefore puts the convenience of drivers at the expense of the safety and quality of life of those moving into areas planning to not rely on a car, and will be expecting to walk and cycle with some expectation of safety.\nI urge the Province to listen more to the experts in the field and data that demonstrates the value of bike lanes and improved public transit, and why catering to car dependency is NOT a good idea.\nFinally, I want to concur with the City of Toronto\u2019s recent statement to the Province titled \u201cRespecting Local Democracy and Cities\u201d dated November 13, 2024 (which I have attached here). The Province\u2019s proposal regarding bike lanes is a clear overreach and in my opinion undermines the principles of our democracy. Toronto voted in a pro-cycling mayor, and the Province\u2019s proposal is an attempt to override what power voters have in local politics.  At a time when trust and belief in the political system is at a low, this is not a good thing.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "A poor thought out proposal that will only increase traffic. Before the lanes went in the curb lanes were all full of parked cars anyway. This will cause several more accidents with people riding bikes and push even more bikes and scooters into sidewalks which create more accidents. The provincial government should stay out of municipal affairs such as this. If they are to interject they should propose a city wide cycling network update that shows how removing the existing will significantly improve traffic and where the proposed lanes would go and how those would benefit pedestrians and cyclists. This seems like an attempt to attach themselves to a hot button issue to gain support from voters ahead of the election.\n"

We don't have a car (which helps the overall congestion )\nAlso, this opposition to bike lanes is a scapegoat for our traffic problems. Cars cause congestion. Parking causes congestion. Drivers that don't follow traffic rules and block intersections or make illegal turns cause congestion. On Adelaide Street, where protected lanes, dedicated turn lanes, and proper signalling has made my commute so much safer and improved traffic flow because everyone has their own space and their own turn.\nI understand that bike lanes are not popular for people who prefer to drive everywhere. But popularity should not inform policy and Infrastructure.\nIn addition, this is an overreach by the province to interfere with city decisions. And this will waste money I'm bureaucracy (something the premier has said he is trying to fix), and in undoing work that has already been done\nFinally, on the topic of bike volume as an argument against lanes, we don't apply this logic to any other road infrastructure. We build roads to connect points and to allow people to get where they need to go. Consider all the residential streets that are empty much of the day!\nParticipating in this consultation feels futile because we have a government that does not consider the broad range of citizen needs.

Therefore I vehemently disagree with this proposition to use taxpayer money to seize taxpayer land and build infrastructure that is not for the taxpayer.\n"
