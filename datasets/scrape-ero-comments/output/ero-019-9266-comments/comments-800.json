        "comment": "The underlying philosophy for this Bill 212 is fundamentally flawed! Your government is concerned about a specific class of citizens - \"Drivers\" - at the expense of ALL citizens - \"people\". You claim to be a government \"for the people\" but your own bill aims to elevate drivers, and disadvantage many others who use active transportation and public transit. You would be better to get traffic flowing for PEOPLE, instead of your absurd fixation on just DRIVERS. A significant problem in our complex society is that too many people are single drivers commuting long distances in vehicles that take up large areas of our public spaces. Active transportation (bikes, scooters, etc) take up less space, but do so at the cost of less physical protection on the vehicle. Instead, that protection is often built into safe road design. Furthermore, human density on public transit (buses, subways, etc) use our limited public space to carry MORE people. On a related note, we also need SUSTAINABLE housing policies that allow people to live closer to where they work if they choose! Encouraging MORE sprawl, and MORE long commuting with this abhorrent highway is not the answer.\nIf your argument that bike lanes cause congestion was correct, we would see less congestion elsewhere. Yet in Scarborough, where I live, there are very few bikes lanes, and just unbelievable traffic. While we do drive, my wife, my son, and my self use transit, and cycling on a fairly regular basis. ALL THREE OF US, have had \"near-miss collisions\" while cycling in mixed traffic on Scarborough roads in the LAST THREE MONTHS! And the premier IGNORES the fact, that Toronto geography forces cyclists onto primary roads, since secondary roads are commonly blocked by either railway tracks or ravines! For example, I biked from Victoria Park to Morningside, on the north side of the 401. While I was able to travel much of the route on side streets as the Premier suggested, I was forced by two railway tracks, to endanger myself biking up Kennedy, and along Shepherd until I was nearly to Morningside. Unless the premier is willing to build a LOT of pedestrian bridges connecting secondary roads over existing ravines and railways, cyclists have no choice but to enter regular roads, potholes and all. Similarly, if I want to travel south, I must go on the main streets of Pharmacy, Victoria Park, Warden, or Birchmount to cross the 401 and the railway tracks. Premier, there IS NO OTHER ROUTE ON SECONDARY ROADS!\nBy the way, there are NO bike lanes on the 401 but it is packed every day, while the 407, a PARALLEL route, sits largely empty. Shame on you for ignoring the obvious. We simply have TOO MANY CARS.\nYou have had 8 years to work to solve these problems. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING to solve them.\nWe are desperate to move MORE people, MORE efficiently. your bill will NOT do that. In fact, a government that claims to be \"the most transparent and accountable\" actually plans to HIDE from The People by exempting 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act entirely, instead doing lip service to our vulnerable environment through limited studies focused on \u201clocal environmental conditions\u201d and whose findings on \u201csensitive natural or cultural heritage matters would be kept secret\u201d. It is absolutely shameful.\nI am hopeful that my comments will make an impact on this assessment, but given the high level of corruption and ignorance of data that we see from this government it is likely that the Premiers developer friends have much more significant impact. Time to change your slogan to \"Doug Ford: For the Developers\".\n"

        "comment": "Research shows that bike lanes do not cause congestion. But what does cause it is the lack of affordable and realistic alternatives, such as well-planned and well-funded transit. Try putting operating funding into transit instead. But leave the bike lanes. In fact, please encourage them, because they are a great alternative to driving.\nThank you!\n"

        "comment": "As many have observed, the main reasons for congestion are the widespread construction of new buildings and the Queen Subway and, sadly inadequate transit. Bicycle lanes are not a cause, as shown in several studies. Torontonians elected a mayor and council largely in favour of extending bike lanes. I grant that the rollout may have gone a mile too far into the suburbs, but in large part, the lanes provide a much safer space for bicyclists, reduce cars on city roads, and make the cyclist's journey faster.  Removing bike lanes is not a solution - the costs to taxpayers to undo the work could be directed to many better ways to ease congestion.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto and Ontario, I write in strong opposition to Bill 212. I am a Senior Scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children and Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. I commute by bicycle daily to the University-Hospital core, and perform errands via cycling. I routinely use the bike lanes on Danforth-Bloor Ave, and the newest bike lanes on University Ave. The planning of safe lanes for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists should remain within the jurisdiction of the municipality, to align with their short-term challenges and long-term development goals.  Toronto is developing for high-density. Safe lanes for diverse commuting options, including cycling, are essential for Toronto's trajectory into a world-class, densely populated city.\nWhile there are many benefits to providing safe lanes for bicycle transit, I highlight 3 pertinent to the proposed removal of EXISTING bike lanes on University Avenue by the University-Hospital core.\n1) Recruiting the best and brightest to live and work in Toronto. My decision to move to Toronto from the US (and instead of opportunities in cities such as Dallas, Manhattan, etc) was motivated by the high quality of urban life in Toronto. One feature I noted was the expanding network of bike lane infrastructure, and it is an essential component for promoting Toronto as a world-class city. We use this feature to attract the brightest and most innovative medical researchers to come to work and live in this area. As judged by our bicycle garage, several doctors, researchers, medical and graduate students, and health care providers SickKids commute by bicycle year-round. The new University Ave bike lanes  immediately signal to recruits that there is also an investment by the city and province in the health, safety and efficiency of their employees' commute to the hospital.\n2) These bike lanes greatly enhance the commuting options for hospital workers, patients and visitors.  For those who wish to cycle to reach the University-Hospital core, they will have access to safer transit by bicycle while reducing the number of car trips, and parking demand. I work with PhD-level graduate students who opt to commute by bicycle, as it is more economical and time efficient. Their safe transit to/from work is one of my top concerns.\n3)  The NEW and WONDERFUL bike lanes in the University-Hospital core have significantly improved the flow of traffic for cyclists, pedestrians and motorists, and reduced risks of accidents. University Ave has high traffic of pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists.  Before unprotected bike lanes, University Ave was chaotic and dangerous as cars had to navigate cyclists and pedestrians for drop-off of patients and passengers. The NEW bike lanes on University Ave now provide marked drop-off areas, and ample space for the passengers to exit the cars.\nI have been commuting by bicycle for 10 years. The expansion of clearly marked bike lanes has increased the number of cyclists, and reduced the number of car trips - the most significant factor in reducing congestion. Investments in bike lanes strengthen the mutual safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.\n"

        "comment": "Please stop wasting time and money on this absurd proposal and do not remove the bike lanes. I'm sick of this government spending all its time and energy trying to micromanage Toronto. You are the provincial government and you need to start acting like it.\nThe cost of removing the bike lanes is not only itself a waste of my tax dollars, but also wastes the money already spent on installing them. Leave the bike lanes alone and put that money and effort into projects that actually have an effect on reducing gridlock like completing the metrolinx projects that are years behind schedule. Bike lanes aren't causing gridlock but the lack of transit is.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea. Clearly this bill uses bike lanes as a wedge issue, to distract from the fact it enables government to expedite the building of expensive highways.\nThere is no logical, historical, or evidence-based reason for this bill to target bike lanes. Instead, this bill will make traffic in cities worse.\nIf this bill is passed, my wife and I may consider both driving cars, thereby causing more traffic for everyone.\nPerhaps the government should stop trying to divide Ontarians with bike lanes as a wedge issue, should stop trying to make developers rich by paving over our farmland with useless highways, and should instead focus on actually trying to govern.\n"

        "comment": "I am unhappy that taxpayer money is potentially being wasted on this when health care and education need funding. I don't have or want a bike, but the bike lanes are important as they keep cyclists safe and out of traffic. Having cyclists on the road slows traffic too, the lanes make everything run smoothly. I really dislike how issues related to highway 413 are attached to this bill. The two issues are completely unrelated and this comes across as being exceptionally underhanded.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes removed an important alternative to car travel- that is the ONLY WAY to reduce gridlock in a growing province. We can only open up our streets so much as we add cars. We need viable alternatives like bikes and transit.\nRemoving bike lanes also reduces bikers because it reduces safety. People are less willing to risk it. And why should anyone be asked to risk their lives while biking in the city? Lives are on the line.\nBiking is accessible, good for you and good for the planet. Adding more lanes for cars has NEVER solved gridlock long term. This is a shortsighted move that works against the long term health of the province and its residents. Why are we considering moving backwards in time towards something that has never been proven to work?\n"

        "comment": "Please do not take the easy way out. Please do not abandon your responsibilities to the environment, and ALL people of Ontario. Please think of the future generations who will inherit this land. We have opportunities now to help save the planet and its inhabitants (people and animals alike) and preserve it for those future generations.\nOntario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

Essentially, the bike lanes have done three things to our community:\n1. Disabled Emergency vehicles from responding to calls and getting people to hospital. I have been behind an EMS vehicle three times this year and watched them not be able to move to get to their call.\nI ask you to remove the lanes to save lives!!!\n2. I have lived in the area for over 20 years know many of the local business owners. All of the owners have told me they have experienced a significant downturn in revenues with it taking 20 minutes longer to get to their own business because of the gridlock. Many local businesses barely survived COVID and now face the same financial challenges thanks to the City's decision on bike lanes. I ask you to remove the bike lanes to save our local business!!!\n3. The bike lanes have turned a beautiful and accessible street into an incredibly ugly mess. Bloor street is now lined with cement curbs, metal ramps at every corner, posts and flags littered along our street. This hardly encourages people to visit our beautiful area. I ask you to remove the bike lanes to bring back the natural beauty of our neighbourhood!!!\nThank you for caring enough to fix this mess!!!\n"

        "comment": "I would like to register strong concerns regarding the bike lane-related provisions in Bill 212. \u00a0I am a resident of Toronto and travel frequently by bicycle on Bloor, Yonge and University (especially Bloor from Royal York to Jarvis). My car use is minimal.  I cycle year-round in Toronto \u2014 as do many friends and family, here and in Montreal and Ottawa.\nI have attended three \u201cghost bike\u201d rides so far this year. I have spoken directly to loved ones of cyclists killed on Toronto roads. I have heard first hand the sorrow and pain caused by these senseless and preventable tragedies.\nToronto\u2019s population and the volume of housing (particularly on Bloor West) is growing rapidly. The number of people needing to move along these important corridors will be far greater in years to come. Nonetheless, the vast majority of cars that I see (again, on Bloor, Yonge and University) have only a single occupant. \u00a0I am very concerned that too many people are using cars instead the TTC or bicycles \u2014 and that too few people share their car rides when they must use a car.\nUnless there are safe, convenient lanes for cyclists, the volume of those riding will not increase to the level needed to meet Toronto\u2019s rapid growth. \u00a0Countless other cities, including those with harsh winters, have proven that safe, convenient bike lanes are necessary to relieve the gridlock caused by excess car use.\nI expect the Provincial Government to provide appropriate leadership \u2014 leadership that takes into account both science and a vision for the future. \u00a0The City of Toronto has made a strong investment into the Complete Streets Initiative \u2014 with appropriate expertise, research and vision.\nPlease do the right thing and support the Municipality in this important work, including by withdrawing or substantially amending Bill 212. Existing bike lanes must be preserved and the overall bike lane network expanded and improved.\n"
