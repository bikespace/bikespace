        "comment": "Hi,\nI am not sure why the province is trying to control Toronto bike lanes. There would be more cyclists in Toronto if the streets were safer to bike in, and if there were more linked networks throughout the city. I live on the border of North York/Scarborough, and the reason I don't cycle except on trails is that I am too fearful to ride on the streets. The streets with bike lanes are better, but still a far cry from European cities, for instance, who have bike lines completely separated from traffic, and from pedestrians, making it safer for all. Please expand the bike friendliness of Toronto, do not take away the few steps we've made to get there.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is directly counter to several priorities of the Government of Ontario.\n1)It is counter to the focus on Transit Oriented Communities, which promotes using transit and active transportation for short trips.  The proposed corridors for removal encompass Major Transit Station Areas (MTSAs), which included the removal of parking minimums.\n2) Ontario's \"Connecting the GGH\" plan includes a goal to Incentivize more sustainable modes of travel\". This proposal counters that goal.\n3) This approach will not promote Vulnerable Road User safety, and lead to more aggressive driving, counter to the goals of the MOMS act (Moving Ontarians More Safely), 2021.\n4) This proposal also adds red tape and burden to government decision making. It will slow down development and hurt businesses and muncipal plans get stuck in red tape.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes creates a less safe environment for drivers and a slower pace for drivers. I think most drivers would agree that it is WAY more stressful sharing a lane with a biker than it is when they have a separated space. Removing the bike lane won't get rid of all the bikers, instead it will just slow down the second lane of traffic to accommodate them. From a driver perspective, they should be more interested in removing parking on high traffic streets than removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver, cyclist and a pedestrian in downtown Toronto. Removing bike lanes, particularly those that get heavy use, won't send cyclists to other streets; it simply makes things more difficult and stressful for drivers and more dangerous for cyclists. Cyclists are already getting seriously injured while using bike lanes. Removing them entirely will kill people, point blank. An incredibly short-sighted policy that does not actually meet the needs of people who are using these major arteries on a daily basis.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. While the goal of improving transportation infrastructure is commendable, I have serious concerns about the implications this bill has on property rights and the judicial process, particularly regarding expropriation.\nThe bill proposes amendments that would remove essential procedural safeguards in the expropriation process for designated projects. Specifically, Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 aim to expedite expropriations by eliminating hearings of necessity and adjusting possession dates, effectively sidelining property owners' rights to fair consultation and compensation.\nIt is deeply troubling that a government, over which since the Greenbelt debacle an odour of corruption floats, is positioning itself to bypass judicial scrutiny in matters of expropriation. The controversies surrounding the Greenbelt have already eroded public trust, raising questions about transparency and accountability in land development decisions. In such a context, granting the government greater powers to expropriate land without adequate oversight is not only inappropriate but also poses a risk to the principles of democracy and justice.\nExpropriation is a profound exercise of power that must be balanced with the rights of individuals and communities. The judicial process serves as a critical check to ensure that expropriations are conducted fairly, justly, and for the genuine public good. Removing or weakening these safeguards undermines property rights and could lead to abuse of power.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions within Bill 212 that diminish the role of judicial oversight in expropriation processes. It is imperative that any efforts to improve infrastructure do not come at the expense of fundamental rights and democratic principles.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I hope that you will act to ensure that the rights of Ontarians are protected.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to register strong concerns regarding the bike lane-related provisions in Bill 212. I am a resident of Toronto and travel frequently by bicycle and car on Bloor, Yonge and University (especially Bloor from Royal York to Jarvis). I cycle year round for transport in the city and use my car less frequently for larger grocery runs and to transport hockey equipment.\nI have attended three \u201cghost bike\u201d rides so far this year. I have spoken directly to loved ones of cyclists killed on Toronto roads. I have heard first hand the sorrow and pain caused by these senseless and preventable tragedies.\nToronto\u2019s population and the volume of housing (particularly on Bloor West) is growing rapidly. The number of people needing to move along these important corridors will be far greater in years to come. Nonetheless, the vast majority of cars that I see (again, on Bloor, Yonge and University) have only a single occupant. I am very concerned that too many people are using cars instead the TTC or bicycles \u2014 and that too few people share their car rides when they must use a car.\nI am also concerned because data shows that when you build safe cycling infrastructure it encourages more people to travel by bike.  Taking these lanes out will discourage people from biking.  Every person on a bike is a potential person in a car.  Removing the bike lanes will most certainly increase the volume of cars on the road.  The solution to gridlock is FEWER cars on the road, not more cars.\nUnless there are safe, convenient lanes for cyclists, the volume of those riding will not increase to the level needed to meet Toronto\u2019s rapid growth. Countless other cities, including those with harsh winters, have proven that safe, convenient bike lanes are necessary to relieve the gridlock caused by excess car use.\nI expect the Provincial Government to provide appropriate leadership \u2014 leadership that makes evidence-based decisions.  And the evidence is clear, bike lanes are safe, move more peope with greater safety than automobile only, and are necessary for a vibrant growing province.\nPlease do the right thing and support the Municipality in this important work, including by withdrawing or substantially amending Bill 212. Existing bike lanes must be preserved and the overall bike lane network expanded and improved.\n"

Having cars slow down and give space to bicyclists is going to be a bigger problem then keeping the current bike lanes. Not to mention, tourist that rent bikes in Toronto\u2019s downtown core now have to share the road with cars in an unfamiliar city. In addition, municipalities should be able to decide if and where bike lanes are put in. It should not be dictated by a provincial government official that has never rode a bicycle in the area. What ultimately solves car congestion is giving people safe alternatives. Removing bike lanes is unsafe.\n"

It makes no sense to rip out lanes that are heavily used such as downtown Bloor Street and University Ave. In some suburban areas without a lot of cycling uptake it doesn\u2019t always make sense to replace a lane of traffic.

I commute to work daily, navigating streets with and without bike lanes, and I feel significantly safer when bike lanes are present. Unfortunately, I've experienced multiple accidents and injuries on roads without proper bike infrastructure.\nTragically, my high school friend, Alex Amaro, lost her life while cycling on Dufferin Street\u2014an accident that might have been preventable if bike lanes had been in place. This personal loss highlights the urgent need for safer cycling conditions across the city.\nFor these reasons, I strongly oppose Bill 212.

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

Removing bike lanes is actively, willfully destructive.\n"
