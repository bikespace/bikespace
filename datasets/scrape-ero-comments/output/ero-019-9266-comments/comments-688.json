After being late a couple of times due to the TTC subway and bus delays, I was introduced to Shared City Bike by my colleagues who work in the City.\nCycling in the City of Toronto changed my life. I used the bike lane to go to work on time, to get to my grocery store without paying for Transit which is not on time, to go to City Parks to play sports, to meet friends and build new social circles.\nI even bike in the winter, even though the snow is piling up on the bike lane to go to work, while those people who can afford uber, or Privileged to drive a car passing me with a dust of wind.\nCycling lane is important for the City of Toronto, it is not just a transportation infrastructure for millions of cyclist to go to places safe and on time, it is also a Social Infrastructure that provide opportunities for younger generations, new immigrant, less advantageous group who cannot afford a car like me to go to work on time, to save money for food and shelter, to meet friends without spending additional money on transit.\nIt is short sighted and narrowed minded for the provincial government to remove bike lane, with the intent to win votes from the privileged suburb group. Cycling, as an established culture in Toronto, should be a model / pioneer, that show cases the possibilities of active transit for the suburb dwellers.\nDear Provincial Premier, please fix your mistake and apologize to the people in Toronto by cycling down to City hall from Queens Park with our City Mayor Olivia Chow. (use the shared city bike please you don't need a new bike)\n"

Stop incentivizing motor vehicles in a city that has no infrastructure to support them. Bike lanes are the future of transportation and are a vital and necessary part of the wellness of our city.\n"

        "comment": "If you want to reduce gridlock and save people time there are far better means of doing so than encouraging more more cars to enter city centres.\nBuild a public transfer infrastructure. The planet can not sustain growth in vehicular traffic.\nIf you are concerned about accidents (who isn't), how about licensing cyclists (in particular e-cyclists) and enforcing laws which promote safety for everyone?\nThe City of Toronto has made admirable progress improving infrastructure for cyclists. How can it be that the government of Ontario is going to demolish this progress? It would be a great step backwards and looked back upon in the future as a terribly shortsighted action.\n"

Bike lanes are effective, are safer, and they reduce congestion.\nThe cost of removing the bike lanes goes beyond the infrastructure cost, it will also cost more lives and increase the cost of the health care system when dealing with people affected by accidents.\nRemoving bike lanes will make more people choose driving again, inevitably causing more congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The idea that bike lane closures will reduce gridlock shows how disconnected many of our political representatives are. Gridlock will not be reversed by removing bike lanes in these KEY locations. In fact, the opposite will now happen as motorized vehicles and bicycles will now share these common lanes if this bill goes through. It is clear that this is meant for either optics to appease suburbanites or a purely personal proposal by Ford and his cohort to alleviate their own traffic head aches\u2026 but in both cases, residents of the city that is will impact are not considered.\nGridlock is caused by the never ending construction in this city. Gridlock has been recently exasperated by the Gardner lane closures. Gridlock is caused by more individuals commuting because it\u2019s far too expensive to live in the city. Gridlock is caused by a tragically underfunded and mismanaged inner city transit system. Gridlock is caused by the unprecedented amount of lyft/uber drivers which is only an issue because of the accumulation of all aforementioned faults in the city\u2019s infrastructure.\nBike lanes provide a safe, reliable, environmental positive way to commute across the city for our residents. And if that simple fact fails to even make a representative ponder, then you solidify the idea that government does not serve us. This is still a city. It\u2019s not an amusement park for suburbanites to flock to on occasion, or just a gathering point for the daily commuters. There are far more layers to this that need to be considered, thought about and debated over than just throwing on a bandaid solution that will fail miserably in the end anyways. And then what\u2019s next? A bill to get rid of street cars?\nThis bill does not have the future in mind. This bill only considers the now.\nAlso, It\u2019s well known that the public discourse about the bike lane closures masks the rest of the horrendous violations against the rights of the very people Ford claims to be servicing.\nIf this goes through, which it inevitably will, expect more accidents and outrage. Expect more division. As apparently non-Toronto citizens have superior wants and needs to the actual residents of the city they are entering.\nReflect on that. Ford is a guest.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a resident, driver, and cyclists in Toronto, I strongly disagree with the proposal to remove bike lanes in our city. These lanes are vital for ensuring cyclist safety, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting environmentally friendly transportation. Eliminating bike lanes would hinder our efforts to support sustainable and healthy commuting options. I urge you to prioritize long-term benefits for our community by preserving this essential infrastructure.\nPlease reconsider this initiative, urging your government to take action in consideration of the feedback of this proposal.\nSincerely,\nYi\nResident of Toronto\n"

I commute to work on the Bloor bike lane every day, and I work in hospitals where I treat trauma patients, including patients who have been involved in car on bike collision. It is vital to have protected bike lanes and absolutely ridiculous to consider that removing a bike lane and adding a lane of parking, or putting bikes back into lanes of traffic, will reduce congestion. Please leave the decision-making regarding municipal streets to municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I believe Bill 212 will be harmful for the residents of Toronto, and not fulfil its aim of reducing gridlock. Adding bike lanes induces demand and results in more people cycling to work, therefore reducing the number of people driving to work and reducing the number of cars on the road and easing gridlock. We know that the increase in cycling infrastructure is followed by more people commuting by bike. A 2019 study on cycling by the City of Toronto found that in 2009 29% of Toronto residents used a bike as a means of commuting, and in 2019 44% of residents used a bike to commute. We also know that when people are not commuting by bike, they are most likely commuting by car. The same 2019 study asked cyclists how they commute when they are not riding their bike, and 43.9% of them said they drove alone to their destination. Removing bike lanes will therefore encourage more people to drive and fewer people to cycle, increasing gridlock and traffic. This also leads to the release of more greenhouse gases and is worse for the environment.\nBill 212 will also be dangerous for residents of Toronto. Cyclists will be forced to ride more among cars, and are unlikely to change their established commuting routes, and this will inevitably lead to more collisions and injuries for cyclists. Pedestrians will be less protected from cars and more at risk of injuries from collisions with cars.\nThe implementation of Bill 212 is also an egregious overstep of provincial powers. The majority of Toronto residents are against Bill 212, are in favour of bike infrastructure, and utilise the bike lanes in the city, yet the province is proposing to make its own decision about Toronto's roads and forcing Toronto to financially contribute to the removal of bike lanes they fundamentally want to keep. Cycling is also a highly localised form of transportation which occurs mainly within city limits, and is outside the scope of provincial politics.\nFinally, cyclists are people with families and friends and children who want them to be able to safely get to work. This bill puts cyclists in harms way in pursuit of aims it will not achieve. As a Toronto resident I strongly oppose this bill and what it will do to our city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make Toronto a more livable, traversable, healthy, and safe place to live. I am 36 and have been biking as my main mode of transportation for 20 years. I use cars for long distance travel only. Cars are not the right solution for high population density areas like Toronto.\nI cannot say enough positive things about the bike lanes on Bloor and University. It is so dangerous to bike through these areas without bike lanes. Having clear arteries for bikes helps cyclists and drivers avoid dangerous interactions and helps keep our city moving.\nIt is unreasonable to remove these excellent pieces of infrastructure and there is simply no convincing evidence that adding a driving lane to these roads will improve traffic or become anything but another place to illegally stop, disrupting both car traffic and cycling. I would like to add that illegal parking, ride share and taxi stops are also tension points between cyclists and drivers as without a bike lane cyclists are pushed to the curb as most drivers do not respect the legal right of cyclists to take a lane for their safety.\nFinally, the province should not be making decisions about Toronto's city infrastructure. The City of Toronto knows that cycling is essential transportation for all ages and income levels, and that bike lanes keep cyclists and drivers safe.\nPlease do not throw money away destroying good infrastructure for bad reasons!\n"

        "comment": "Cycling safety and sustainable infrastructure is paramount to a growing modern city and should not be diminished, to the contrary it should be further supported.  Removing bike lanes by all statistics will not be solving these corridor's traffic issues, it will only serve to diminish the quality of life for those who choose to live in the downtown and not have cars as our primary means of transportation.  The provincial governments overreach into clear democratic municipal operations should not be tolerated, nor should 100's of millions of dollars to replace well designed cycling infrastructure. This is another indication of the Ford Governments willingness to purchase votes on ill founded opinions / polling and another overreach to further diminish the quality of environment and urban life for those who call City of Toronto their home.  Please let municipalities govern their own cities.\n"
