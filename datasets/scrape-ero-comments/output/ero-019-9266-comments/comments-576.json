        "comment": "I have lived in Summerhill since 2016. We chose to buy in this area because of its proximity to other areas of the city around which our lives revolved (work, family, etc). However, since the bike lanes were installed on Yonge, that convenience factor has reversed. It now takes me 15-20 minutes longer to get anywhere than it used to 4 years ago, with most of that time spent sitting in traffic on Yonge or Avenue Road. I feel \"locked in\" by these two thoroughfares that are frequently in bumper-bumper traffic. With two young children, it is impossible to rely on public transit to shuttle them around to their various activities, and thus, driving is a key component to our lifestyle. For this reason, we feel that Summerhill is no longer livable for us, and we are looking to move.\nI believe that bike lanes have a role in a thriving, environmentally conscious city, but they must be placed strategically, and not on main arteries such as Yonge, which was already a relatively narrow street to begin with.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the proposal to remove any bike lanes in the City of Toronto. Studies have shown that bike lanes and other infrastructure that supports active transportation greatly reduces traffic due to less people deciding to drive cars. It is absolutely ridiculous that our provincial government is trying to convince us otherwise, and would spend taxpayer money to remove brand new functioning bike lanes with the aim of reducing traffic congestion. The city and province needs to be investing in public transit, and more bike infrastructure, not reducing either. This proposal to reduce bike lanes will only put cyclists and pedestrians in danger.\n"

        "comment": "It is important to recognize that when these streets had 2 lanes in both directions, that one of the lanes was dedicated to parking, and as such if the bike lanes are to be removed to \"return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\", it is important to ensure that these lanes are NOT used for parking at any time. These streets that currently have 1 dedicated traffic lane in each direction have not lost any net travel volume with the implementation of bike lanes and 1 dedicated lane for parking on one of either side. Basically of the 4 lanes that existed previously, 1 lane was removed to create 2 bike lanes, 1 in each direction. Additionally, local businesses were able to make use of previously road surface areas used to park a few cars, as exterior sitting area. The exterior use of the road surface to bicycles and exterior business sitting area at restaurants increases business for local businesses since cyclists have little or no demands on local parking infrastructure, while increasing business given their \"slow moving\" nature, similar to pedestrians, who are more likely and more flexible to stop at local business as compared to automobiles that generally do NOT stop to find parking and generally are moving THROUGH such business areas NOT providing any business growth or support to local area businesses.\n"

That's not even addressing other costs associated with installing new bike lanes on \"secondary\" streets. The resulting congestion and restricted access to our city's main streets for months is no doubt going to contribute to even more gridlock and increased commuter times.\nThe Conservative government has a fiduciary duty to tax payers. This is fiscally insane and outrageous.\n"

As a cyclist myself, I depend on bike lanes to get around the city. Climate change isn\u2019t a joke and we need to be taking seriously the impact that cars have on the environment. Instead of encouraging more cars we should be rewarding cyclists with safety via bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I urge you not to pass Bill 212.\nI live in Toronto\u2019s east end, and when I first started cycling regularly, Danforth Ave. did not yet have a bike lane. As a cyclist, the street was daunting, with cars moving quickly on the left as doors opened on the right. There was little room for a bike. I would often take the side streets instead, but these were less direct, and I\u2019d find myself stuck at major roads, waiting minutes at a time for a gap in car traffic so I could cross.\nThe Danforth bike lanes have changed my life. I use the lanes to run errands, to get from place to place, and to come home from recreational rides. They offer safety and protection that wasn\u2019t there before. They encourage me to cycle more (and to avoid adding yet another car to the streets). Cycling offers me freedom, mobility, and independence, and allows me to feel a part of my own city.\nI want bike lanes on major roads because major roads get me to where I need to go. Side streets are side streets because they are less efficient for traffic\u2014all traffic, cars and bikes alike. And there are no side streets that could effectively replace the Yonge, Bloor, or University bike lanes.\nWhen I stand at any intersection along Bloor during the evening rush hour, watching streams of cyclists going past, the idea that Toronto\u2019s bike lanes are underused is instantly dispelled. With food couriers out on delivery, parents collecting their children from daycare, and commuters coming home from work, the city is alive and vibrant and beautiful. This is the kind of city that I, and so many other Ontarians, want to live in. Please protect that vision. Please protect Ontario\u2019s bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing bike lanes is obscene for at least three good reasons. 1 ) The wasteful cost of removing such a significant infrastructure, some of it still relatively new. Such a complete waste of taxpayer dollars. 2) Those in the lowest income brackets rely on bicycles out of necessity. Almost no one out riding in a snowstorm is doing it because they love cycling. I have been there, not making enough to pay for public transit, too far from work to walk. Not creating safe space for cyclists is absolutely discriminatory against poor people 3) The very obvious environmental benefits of encouraging cycling over cars. 4) I know I said three but the 401 highway is all the evidence that no matter how many lanes there are, they will be full. A far greater problem creating gridlock is cars blocking intersections. There are two lights near me where almost every single cycle of traffic lights leaves one or two cars blocking the intersection, just multiplying gridlock. Please do not remove bike lanes. They are needed, especially on Bloor St.\n"

Surely there must be a better use of time and money than to bully municipalities into removing already created bike lanes to just push cyclists into the road?\nIn the event that this is passed and those listed bike lanes (and any future ones targeted) are removed the provincial government should understand that every life that is lost of a cyclist is entirely and solely in the hands of the government.\n"

        "comment": "There are a few key reasons why I am greatly opposed to this:\n1. This is blatant overreach: The provincial government should have zero say in how the interior of cities are designed. This a decision that the people of Toronto alone should be making. Ford's proposition of this bill only serves to satisfy his vendetta against Toronto created by the way he perceived he and his brother were treated there.\n2. The density does not support this: Toronto is the single densest city in the province. The car is the least dense method of transportation out of every single option available. There is no fit for solely car traffic in a dense urban area. If we ever want traffic to improve in Toronto, we need to consider transportation solutions that support the density of the city, like trains, buses, and especially bikes.\n3. Unfair to cyclists: Cycling is the second slowest transportation method in terms of top speed next to walking. Cyclists need to be allowed to bike on main roads because every mild increase in distance is significantly larger by bike. If anything, it's cars that should be relegated to side roads because it takes no effort to commute by one. Putting cyclists on side roads is comparable to saying \"You're only allowed to park 3 km away from your work at a minimum\". Drivers complaining about cyclists on the road are a privileged party viewing equality as oppression.\n4. Street layouts for proposed streets: For the streets this bill proposes that bike lanes be removed from have zero side street alternatives that follow the length of the street for a significant distance. As I stated previously, the slight increase in distance for cyclists has a far larger effect than it does for cars and would make cycling near infeasible to most.\n5. Environmental impact: The fact of the matter is that you cannot buy your way out of emitting. We try to switch to electric vehicles as a green alternative to commuting but they emit just as much fossil fuels during their production and the running of power generators compared to a gas vehicle during the same average lifetime period. The only way to emit less is to use less, and a bicycle is an incredible way one can emit less during their commute and benefit their health at the same time. If the Ford government cared at all about reducing emissions, they would allow for and incentivize denser developments and incentivize bike usage.\n6. Cost: The lanes are already there, it's going to cost roughly double what it cost to put the bike lane in to tear them out. This is absurd, and a clear example of the sunk costs fallacy at play. No matter how much money we throw into this issue, letting more cars on the roads is not going to fix traffic. This also plays into the issue of induced demand, proven real around the world, but naturally, the Ford government is too ignorant to acknowledge its existence when it's too busy lining the pockets of the companies that lobbied for it.\n"
