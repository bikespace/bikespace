        "comment": "I deeply disagree with trying to change bike lanes into motor vehicle lanes. With additional vehicle lanes, there increased risk to pedestrians, bikers and other vehicles. The higher the number of people, the higher the risk and more accidents resulting in more delays. The change in lanes and an increased capacity for vehicles, leaves little alternative options. There is only walking or TTC. Increasing capacity for the roads while not also increasing the capacity for turn lanes. With more cars, more travel, the capacity a car holds is much less than bikes. A greater need for parking, cheaper parking or alternatives.\nMajor problems here lie in how poorly the infrastructure to move around the city is. With the 407 being privatised and very expensive to use. I also have great concerns about the idea of a 413 highway as highways do not help with gridlock. The environmental impact and the landownership that will be removed. What we need is the 407 to be back in the public, not a new highway.\n"

        "comment": "Contrary to the suggestion that bike lanes universally worsen congestion, research and case studies prove (time and time again) that well-planned bike infrastructure can reduce overall road congestion. Studies show that bike lanes often encourage a shift from car use to cycling, especially in urban areas. This reduces the number of cars on the road, easing congestion overall. Cities like New York and Vancouver have demonstrated that adding bike lanes can improve traffic flow without significant delays for vehicles. Toronto has benefited from the increase in bike lanes since COVID immensely.\nPlease understand that traffic is not something that can be solved with more lanes. You need to offer alternatives to driving to get less cars off the road. This is a very well studied phenomenon called \"induced demand\". Cars are inherently inefficient uses of space for single occupants (majority of commuters).\nEvidence-based decisions should be something your mandate prioritizes, I encourage the Ministry to consider the MANY peer reviewed studies published on congestion before fueling this unnecessary culture war, which puts actual lives in danger when your political followers take your misleading word as gospel.\nRather than focusing exclusively on congestion, policies should aim to integrate multi-modal transportation systems that benefit all users. This includes public transit, active transportation (cycling, scootering, etc.), walking and carpooling.\nI hope this perspective is helpful and that the Ministry remains committed to fostering a transportation network that balances the needs of cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal completely negates the value of bike lanes and alternate forms of transportation as an incredibly important part of reducing congestion. More cars in a gridlock city will not improve congestion. We need more alternatives- and bike lanes are key for this. Reducing bike lanes won\u2019t stop congestion on the lakeshore, Gardiner, or dvp. This is not the answer to getting places faster.\nWhy remove bike lanes - a 0 emission form of transportation- to add more gridlock. This will do the opposite of what you\u2019d like it to.\nPlease think of climate action, please think of livable cities.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives. As a cyclist who lived in brampton and moved to Toronto I can not begin to explain how much of a difference protected lanes have made for me. I am a young woman and I have never felt safe cycling in my hometown but it was my only way of getting around. Yes, maybe bike lanes have temporarily slowed traffic, however what is the cost of a life vs less than 5 mins added to a commute. There have already been so many cyclists deaths in the province, if anything we need to take action and address the serious road safety crisis occuring on our streets. This bill is also a huge provincial overstep, municipalities know what is best when they build new infrastructure and they should have the say on whether to build new lanes. The province has no knowledge nor local context to make these decisions. Moreover, we must address the serious impact that cars have on the environment. We need to move towards safe and sustainable modes of transit.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes were studied for years before implementation. They have been designed effectively considering all constituents and stakeholders (pedestrians, cyclists, automobiles etc). The arrival of lanes on Bloor has maintained parking and allowed for patios and restaurant businesses to thrive . I was just driving along bloor from Bathurst to parliament and remarked how well designed they are.\nIt would seem that the lanes need to be further studied to (rather than anecdotally based on some driver complaints)  fully assess their impact on the city of Toronto.\nToronto is not a thoroughfare. If Ontarians need to drive (rather than take buses or on GO transit which is expanding widely or via rail) they can access the city via the gardiner, the 401, the 427, the don valley and large roads like bay view and Leslie and the Allen. There is no shortage of access to the city for drivers. Those who live and work in the core benefit from bike lanes from a public health point of view (necessary exercise and safety). As well other commuters in motorized vehicles benefit from the fact that cyclists cycle rather than drive.\nChildren as well who have unprecedented cases of child obesity and diabetes need to feel safe cycling in the city. We need a vast network to make the cycles safe and useable.\nEnvironmentally of course cycling is a clean transport which needs to be a legitimized and supported mode of transport.\nOn my cycle to work I pass by several white bicycles (a memory to cyclists who have died on Toronto streets).   Now there are bike lanes and or stop lights at some of those memory markers. I only wish more lanes and more conscious design to support all municipal needs could be based in evidence based practice.  With milder winters due to climate change cycling is becoming more and more of a realistic 3 almost 4 season mode of transport. Bike lanes create consumer traffic for shops where bike lanes exist. They make economic sense.\n"

The beneficiaries would include many who are simply looking to get further faster versus making bike travel safer & more efficient.\n2) the province should be working towards bettering Ontario, not trying to micro manage a city.\nI live in the city as do my daughter & family who use bicycles as their main mode of transportation. We find the areas where the provincial government appears to want to remove bike lanes operate well for cars & small trucks  and devices designed for bike lanes.\n"

The traffic if backed up from Avenue Road to Duplex Ave going west and now only 1 lane for traffic each way. We need the intervention from the Province of Ontario and common sense here as radical interests are ruining the livability of the city. The bike lanes are used predominantly by uber eats/door dash and ebikes/scooter at high rates of speed and with minimal usage.  This doesn't even account for the winter months when it will not be used at all.  There is no room for emergency vehicles and I see fire truck/ambulance/police struggle to get by the traffic jams.\nI fully support the Ford Government to intervene and remove bike lanes that are not being used the majority of the time.\n"

        "comment": "Replacing bike lanes with traffic lanes would only worsen the problem. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists to get into cars, which take up more room on the roads and increase gridlock. Forcing municipalities to remove their own bike lanes would be a waste of public funds, and the extra traffic lane would hardly have an effect on congestion; it would fill up quickly. In addition, the impact on the environment is quite simple: replacing bikes with cars will only serve to harm the environment. The environmental impact of cars, in terms of air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, is so much worse than that of bicycles, that I struggle to comprehend what there could possibly be to consider about it.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road, and encourage people to take more environmentally-friendly modes of transport. This reduces congestion, allowing the remaining traffic to flow more smoothly. In cities that have well-developed bike infrastructure, such as New York and Copenhagen, this effect has already been observed. If we expand our network of bike lanes, including adding protected bike lanes, people would feel more comfortable and willing to ride bikes rather than cars. I believe that we should spend taxpayer money on making Toronto easier to navigate with a bicycle, rather than moving backwards and removing bike lanes we had built for the very purpose of reducing congestion.\n"

Yes we need bike lanes but not on major arteries, Danforth Ave . for example In my neighborhood has become horrendous for traffic . Emergency vehicles cannot get by very easily. This particular bike lane is under used by the general population and is mostly being used by people on e-bikes delivering fast food orders . The  Eastern Ave. bike lane is the same . The city has not used any common sense whatsoever when installing these. They have only appeased a few people belonging to special interest groups and not the majority of the people , voters and taxpayers. Let\u2019s not forget that we live in a winter climate for 4-5 months a year whe these bike lanes aren\u2019t used at all . The extra expense for maintenance and clearing of these lanes as well as many others would be better spent in a common sense way , housing for instance. The city of Toronto keeps claiming they don\u2019t have the money for projects and programs yet they continually wasting my tax dollars. Some common sense please .\n"

I am a long time resident of midtown Toronto, where I own and drive a car, and also, whenever I can do so without fear, ride my bike. Bikes, as well as cars, are important commuter options here, and I would regularly commute by bike to work if it didn't make me afraid for my life. I know too many people who have been injured by cars when riding their bikes in traffic in this city, and the current work to install bike infrastructure that makes bike riding safer is critically needed.\nIf you truly want to reduce gridlock in Toronto, then please fund better support of alternatives to driving in this town, instead of dropping provincial legislation to reverse long-needed infrastructure improvements, that will further disrupt our roads at the estimated cost of more than $45 million.\n"
