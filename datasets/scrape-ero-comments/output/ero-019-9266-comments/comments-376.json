        "comment": "I am completely opposed to this proposal. The goal of transportation public policy in Toronto and the broader GTA should be to get as many people as possible out of their cars and into public transit and/or when practical, on to bicycles as is possible. The city's streets should no longer be ruled by cars. They are dangerous, polluting (even the green vehicles) and expensive. We should be inducing people to get out of their cars and into buses, subways etc., and on to bicycles in order to better align private and public interests and to support sustainable and equitable mobility. That is how to reduce congestion and the data from around the world support it. This absurd and seemingly ideologically motivated proposal would take us backwards.\nMore specifically, there are very few ways to safely cycle south through central Toronto below Bloor Street (and to be honest, south of Davenport/Dupont). The bike lanes on University Avenue have helped to address that and it is now much safer. One option that has opened up is safer bicycle access to the hospitals on both sides for staff and for visitors. There is still lots of room for automobile traffic on University Avenue and, again, if there are concerns about moving more people through that part of the city, put more money into public transportation and introduce restrictions on private auto use, including congestion charging on private automobiles in the city. On Bloor, in the west end, the extension of the bike lanes through Etobicoke has greatly increased the possibility of safe cycling west of High Park. The bike lane over the Humber River on Bloor is the only safe bridge crossing of the Humber River for bicycles south of Eglinton (other than Old Mill Road which is not practical and also not safe for large volumes of commuter bikes). The introduction of that bike lane was a game changer and the idea of removing it is wrong-headed. The extension to the west provides crucial connectivity to Royal York Road (which also needs an upgrade to the bike lanes) and allows access to the many businesses along Bloor in the Kingsway area. Bike traffic through the area and to those businesses is up. Admittedly, there is periodic car congestion along Bloor in that area since the introduction of the bike lanes, but that is to be expected during the adjustment period. The response should be more parking near subway stations, better bus service along major corridors such as Islington, Kipling and Jane (including bus lanes), and upgrades to the subway service. In general, Etobicoke needs major investments in public transportation and, with it, more bike lanes and associated infrastructure, not less. The Government of Ontario is 100 percent wrongheaded with this proposal.\nI will add that Highway 413 is completely unjustified and runs counter to public interest and existing public policy. There are other ways to move trucks more rapidly through the GTA including the under-utilized Highway 407. More freeways on the GTA periphery means more sprawl and the loss of more agricultural land and green space. That is not what the Government of Ontario should be enabling.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree 100% with the Provincial Government having the authority to approve and remove bike lanes.\nBike ridership in Toronto has increased substantially because of the bike lanes.\nThousands of people ride their own bikes and in addition there is the Bike Share program. You just need to look at the user statistics for proof:\nRidership has grown substantially each year since 2015, when 665,000 trips were recorded. So far this year, riders in Toronto have taken 4.7 million Bike Share trips, already overtaking total ridership in 2022 and fast approaching the 5.7 million mark set in 2023, according to Bike Share Toronto director Justin Hanna.Sep 12, 2024\nWe must have a fully connected bicycle network in Toronto. If any lanes are removed we must ensure alternative routes are implemented first.\nDowntown Toronto is so densely populated and so many people in the downtown area navigate around on bikes.\nI regularly use the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes.\nWe cannot go backwards.\n"

Toronto has the opportunity to continue improving its city infrastructure by building and completing more bike lane projects. The government of Ontario (Doug Ford) should NOT be interfering with the progress that has been made.\nI have been impressed with Doug Ford throughout the pandemic, and I feel that he is a man for the people. However, this has completely soured my impression of him.\nOptically, this appears to be a move to appease individuals who may vote in his favour. This proposal is selfish, and it fails to consider the safety of everybody on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Bikes are an important (and clean!) mode of transportation for many in Toronto.\nRemoving the lanes opens bikers (and car drivers) to more accidents. The lanes not only provide an easy/direct way for bikers to use the roads, it also ensures a safe one.\nAdditionally, removing bike lanes won't necessarily stop bikers from using shared roads. If your concern is with traffic, removing the lanes will force bikers to use the same road as car drivers. Drivers will have to slow down to either follow behind the bike or carefully drive around the biker (something that is not always possible with even minimum traffic). This will cause more traffic.\nPlease reconsider removing these lanes. They're critical for keeping bikers safe & to insure a good flow of traffic for all.\n"

        "comment": "The plans to restrict bike lanes and remove bike lanes is totally out of touch. Study after study have proven that bike lanes are good for businesses and help with congestion, by getting more cars off the road. I strongly condemn this. We are going back in time. It's totally unacceptable. I refuse to see one KM of bike lane removed. Bike lanes should be expanded, not removed. This is a huge overreach of the government. The city should get the final say on where bike lanes go, even if traffic lanes are removed. Bike lanes help make the streets safe for low income people who cannot afford to drive. Through signal timing the introduction of bike lanes can be mitigated. By removing the bike lanes traffic will get worse, since more people will drive. This is probably the worst policy from the Ford government yet. A change in government is desperately needed at the provincial level. Ford has gone way too far this time.\nWe should not be measuring streets based solely on travel time. We should be aiming to make the streets safer for everyone. This conflicts with Toronto's Vision Zero of protecting the most vulnerable road users.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed changes under Bill 212 that would require provincial oversight for bike lane installation and give the province authority to remove existing lanes. This approach undermines Toronto\u2019s efforts to address some of our city\u2019s most pressing issues: congestion, safety, and sustainability.\nFirstly, Toronto\u2019s bike lanes contribute to alleviating road congestion by encouraging a shift away from cars for shorter commutes. With increasing urban density, more residents are turning to cycling as a reliable, faster way to navigate the city. Studies show that one protected bike lane can carry more people per hour than a standard vehicle lane, allowing for a smarter use of road space.\nRemoving these lanes could lead to greater congestion, forcing more people back into cars and further stretching already-crowded transit options. The recent improvements in bike lanes have helped reduce travel times and pollution by enabling people to commute efficiently without adding to car traffic. Cities around the world\u2014like Copenhagen and Amsterdam\u2014have shown us that cities with dedicated cycling infrastructure also see economic benefits, as cyclists are more likely to shop locally.\nAdditionally, the safety gains from protected bike lanes are undeniable. Data from Toronto itself reveals a marked decrease in collisions and injuries on streets with bike lanes, fostering a safer environment for everyone on the road. Removing these lanes would risk reversing that progress, with real consequences for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and even drivers.\nFinally, the move to override municipal decision-making threatens to stifle local innovation and long-term urban planning. Toronto residents and city officials understand the unique needs of our streets and neighborhoods; provincial mandates can overlook these local dynamics and undermine the effectiveness of our city\u2019s initiatives.\nBike lanes are part of a forward-looking, modern city\u2014one that prioritizes the health, safety, and well-being of all residents. I urge the provincial government to reconsider Bill 212 and allow Toronto to continue making strides toward a more connected, sustainable, and safe city.\n"

        "comment": "City planners have long known (and there is a plethora of academic literature to support this) that you can't build your way out of congestion.  The way to reduce congestion is to increase viable choices for transportation.  Separated bike lanes are a proven way to increase the number of people using bicycles for commuting and errand trips.  While this may not be 'common sense,' it is well researched and there is little to no debate about it among city and regional planners (and I have a masters in community and regional planning, so this is within my area of expertise).\nIn addition, this is horrific overreach.  The provincial government has more than enough of it's own problems to solve and given the pace of addressing many of them, not enough capacity to effectively address them.  There is no way the provincial government has the bandwidth to take on issues that can and should be addressed by municipal governments.  Stay in your lane!\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government\u2019s attempt to rip bike lanes from Toronto\u2019s streets is nothing short of a betrayal to the people. They want to take away something that isn\u2019t just about biking; it\u2019s about the freedom to move safely in our own city. Imagine a Toronto where cycling families, young children, and hardworking citizens are shoved back into dangerous, congested roads, all because of a government that sees us only as numbers in traffic, not as people with lives, with dreams, with futures.\nBike lanes represent a commitment to progress, to health, and to freedom from the choking fumes and relentless noise of traffic. They\u2019re more than painted lines on the road; they\u2019re the arteries that give life to a vibrant, thriving Toronto. Destroying this lifeline means pushing us all\u2014young, old, families, and singles alike\u2014back into gridlock, back into pollution, back into danger. Every bike lane removed is a step backward, a step away from a Toronto that can truly be called world-class.\nAsk yourself: whose interests does this serve? Not the people, that\u2019s for sure. It serves a narrow agenda that wants to keep us beholden to outdated ideas, sacrificing our freedom and our safety. We need bike lanes now more than ever. We need leaders who see Toronto\u2019s potential to be a beacon of green, modern urban living, not a relic of smog-filled streets and overcrowded buses.\nLet\u2019s reject this attack on Toronto\u2019s future. Stand with those who want a cleaner, safer, and more connected city. We deserve the choice to move freely, to enjoy our streets without fear, and to protect our city\u2019s forward momentum. Say NO to the removal of bike lanes and YES to a Toronto that values its people and its progress.\n"

They\u2019re holding us back, clinging to an outdated vision of our city that has no place in the 21st century. Bike lanes are not just lines on the road; they are a commitment to safety, health, and the future of Toronto as a vibrant, modern city. If we rip them out now, we\u2019re choosing congestion, pollution, and an endless cycle of car-dominated streets that don\u2019t serve the people. Is that the Toronto we want? Absolutely not.\nSupporting bike lanes is supporting progress. It\u2019s supporting families who deserve safe streets, young people who see a greener future, and every single Torontonian who wants a better way to get around. Removing them sends a message: that we\u2019re okay with putting lives at risk, with prioritizing outdated commuting habits over sustainable solutions, and with keeping our city stuck in the past.\nThere\u2019s no \u201cother side\u201d to this. Those who think otherwise aren\u2019t just against bike lanes; they\u2019re against Toronto\u2019s future. They\u2019re saying no to safer streets, to cleaner air, to a city that\u2019s for the people. And if they succeed, it won\u2019t just be a loss for cyclists; it\u2019ll be a loss for every Torontonian who believes our city should lead the way, not lag behind.\nIt\u2019s time to stand up and say: Enough. We want a city that values people over traffic, progress over regression, and a vibrant future over the smog-filled streets of yesterday. If you\u2019re with us, you\u2019re with the future of Toronto. If you\u2019re not, then you\u2019re standing in the way of everything this city could be. Support bike lanes. Support progress. Anything less is a step backward.\n"

I was riding my bike to work every day, mon to fri ( from Humber River to downtown Toronto) for 20 years (from 2000 to 2020), my husband even longer and still does, our children too,  and we all oppose bike lanes on major city streets. No bike rider i spoke to ever since the bike lanes were installed on Bloor wants to ride a bike on heavily congested streets/roads. We prefer quiet streets with less car traffic and no shops. Major city streets/roads with heavy traffic have countless cars turning in or out to/from side streets every 20 or so meters, with cars often stopped in bike lanes to shop or drop off something, there are traffic lights every 20 m or so on Bloor,  and pedestrians often use bike lane to walk/ jog - all these make bike lanes on major routes unpopular with true bike riders. Whoever planned bike lanes in Toronto was never riding a bike in the city themselves. Majority of bike riders prefer to ride bikes on quiet streets with little car traffic. And when subway stops on Bloor line because of tech issue, how long will take shuttle buses: 2-3 hours from Runnymede to Yonge?!  This is truly unacceptable. Thank you for listening to the majority of Ontarians who think that bike lanes on major city roads cause traffic gridlocks. They are not popular with the majority of hardworking people in Ontario. Keep up with representing the majority and listening what majority of people say. Thank you!!!\n"
