But of course, he's using bike lanes as a distractor from what really matters. If he wants to solve congestion, how about the conservatives get us a date for the opening of the Eglinton LRT?\nThere are many ways to reduce congestion. Toll the roads the city of Toronto just offloaded into the Province. Add a congestion tax to plates registered out of the city. Buy back the the 407 whcich was the worst deal Conservatives have ever made and resulted in congestion getting to where it is today.\nThere's plenty of data available about how bike lanes are improving traffic congestion. The fact that the nimby's who don't even live in the city are making life miserable for the ones who do. Stay out of the city's business and get back to solving actual issues.\n"

Research shows traffic actually moves FASTER with bike lines, because drivers don\u2019t make as many last-minute lane change decisions to deke around parked cars, which is what takes up the curb lane of most roads without bike lanes. Let the cities of Ontario make their own decisions about what\u2019s best for them! This bill is nanny state interference - supposedly the opposite of what a conservative government should be doing.\n"

Toronto's population is increasing, so we should be providing viable transportation options (mass transit and bike especially) instead of encouraging driving at all times.\nThis has turned into a culture war instead of what it should be: A discussion about the health of our cities, our citizenry and the future of our infrastructure.\n"

Residents of this province deserve to have input and control over the management of their local cities and towns.  These decisions, including pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, must remain in the hands of local residents and their elected councils.\nI understand that the MPs in this government are mainly focused on the roads and streets in Toronto because the traffic situation there is untenable.  But BIKE LANES DO NOT CAUSE CONGESTION.  The cyclists who use those lanes are not driving and causing more congestion.  If anything, Toronto should build more bike lanes, more transit and give people more options to travel without a personal vehicle.\nBut this government knows this.  This government has the studies and evidence that show this to be true.  Instead of funding more and quicker solutions to traffic, this government is deciding to go backwards and devolve to 1950s solutions that didn't work.\nPlease STAY IN YOUR LANE and stay out of municipal decision-making.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed framework that would enable the removal of bike lanes in favour of vehicle lanes on municipal and city roads. This approach not only contradicts the growing body of evidence supporting cycling infrastructure but also jeopardizes public safety and the well-being of our communities.\nNumerous studies around the world have shown that bike lanes significantly reduce traffic congestion. For instance, cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, which have prioritized cycling, consistently report lower vehicle traffic and improved mobility for all road users. In contrast, removing bike lanes would  lead to increased gridlock and pollution, undermining the progress we have made toward sustainable transportation.\nFurthermore, protected bike lanes save lives. Research published in the American Journal of Public Health highlights that cities with robust cycling infrastructure experience fewer cyclist injuries and fatalities. In many cases, the presence of bike lanes makes roads safer for everyone, including motorists.\nThe proposed framework risks reversing these important gains, negatively impacting our environment, public health, and the safety of cyclists. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead invest in expanding, not reducing, our bike lane network.\n"

        "comment": "I am an Ontario born and raised driver, cyclist, and pedestrian. I support MORE bike lanes across the province. With this bill the Ontario PCs are demonstrating their utter contempt for citizens of Ontario. Data domestically and abroad continue to show the significant benefit bike lanes have on reducing congestion and helping drivers move quickly while reducing environmental impact and injuries and deaths.\nIf the Ontario government truly wished to reduce traffic congestion, they would prioritize improvements to public transit and alternative forms of travel. The delays in several mass transit projects in Ontario demonstrate the Ontario PCs inability to improve the conditions for Ontario travellers.\nBut as we know, reducing road congestion for drivers is not the real goal here. It's to make Doug Ford feel better about driving to work and to buy votes from less informed citizens about how bike lanes improve traffic conditions and keep people safe.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto will degrade traffic conditions and put vulnerable road users at much greater risk. If the Ontario PCs go through with this bill, you will be directly responsible for the deaths of more cyclists.\n"

As a driver and cyclist, I will often travel by bike instead of car if there is a safe route to do so.\nMaking it harder to develop safe bike infrastructure will encourage driving, which has clear negative environmental impacts. Building additional traffic lanes results in additional vehicles on the road due to induced demand. Building additional bike lanes will reduce cars on the road and reduce the related  emissions and tire wear.\nWe must make it easier, not harder, for municipalities to develop safe and effective bike infrastructure. I am strongly against this proposal as it will have significant negative environmental impacts on our city and province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a waste of time, and taxpayer money. Instead of meddling in city affairs, the province should be focusing their resources on delivering existing public transit projects, funding healthcare, and education. It is fiscally irresponsible to remove cycling infrastructure that has only recently been implemented.\nBike lanes are an important tool to reduce congestion in large cities, and helpful in meeting climate change goals. Encouraging more people to drive cars will only contribute to congestion and pollution.\n> In 2016, the European Commission's CIVITAS program published a study examining traffic congestion that looked at several cities around the world.\n> For example, in New York City, the authors shared figures from the city's transportation department that showed in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes \u2014 a 35 per cent decrease. One of the reasons they cited for the change was the installation of a left-turn lane, which not only kept cyclists moving but also stopped cars from holding up traffic.\nfrom https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and focus on helping more Ontarians other than drivers.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill 212 represents an egregious overreach of provincial government into municipal matters. While this bill is clearly targeted towards limiting the construction of new bike lanes within Toronto, it has widespread impact across Ontario. Introducing new red tape on alternative forms of transport greatly limits the ability for smaller municipalities to make decisions which are relevant to their community.\nNumerous studies have shown that building bike lanes lowers overall congestion and increases net revenues for small business on the corridors where bike lanes are installed. Removing or limiting bike lanes will encourage driving, which means more cars on the roads, and more traffic.\nI urge the government to consider more pressing concerns such as healthcare and completing transit projects. I would be devastated if my provincial tax dollars are used to support municipal construction projects such as removing already established bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely and vehemently against this proposal. The proposal states that the Province's goal is to \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\", yet what you are proposing is at the literal cost of human lives. Bike lanes - and protected, separated bike lanes, make cycling safer for the many Ontarians who bike as part of their essential daily commute and recreational habits. 6 cyclists have died on Toronto roads so far in 2024, up from 1 in 2023. And that doesn't include the many people with serious and significant injuries. Bike lanes are essential in ensuring these numbers don't keep growing. We cannot put the needs of drivers above the lives of cyclists.\nThere is also an issue with the premise of this proposal, which is that drivers are the only ones who need to get where they are going faster. The goal should be that everyone gets where they need to go, and studies prove separated bike lanes help this.\nAlso, the proposition of \"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic\" is completely unacceptable - the Province of Ontario is NOT best placed to make decisions about municipalities. This is why we elect Mayors and City Councillors.\nI am also extremely disappointed to not see the environmental costs mentioned here, when they is an obvious positive impact on the climate to have fewer people driving and more people safely biking. Growing highways and adding more car lanes contributes to climate change in an extremely negative way. By doing so the government of Ontario would be letting its citizens down and not doing its job to protect the environment and steward it for current and future generations.\n"

More cars on the road = more congestion. Having a larger share of the population use bikes takes cars off the road, making it easier for drivers to get around. This is transportation planning 101.\nNot to mention, I thought the whole point of the conservative platform was to provide small government and avoid government overreach. This is a clear overreach. Cities and towns have the capacity to make these decisions without the Province forcing outcomes.\nOverall, Doug Ford is scapegoating and vilifying cyclists while simultaneously gaslighting drivers into thinking there are no negative affects to car dependency. Instead, the province should be implementing measures to reduce car dependency. This is shameful culture-war policy.\n"

I have young children and want them to be healthy, active members of society, and safe bike lanes give them the confidence to get exercise while going to school, sports, etc.\nHarbord Street in Toronto is currently undergoing some construction so its bike lane is closed. Yesterday, while riding in the only lane available, my wife and son were repeatedly honked at by a motorist behind them. On Saturday, I was riding with my daughter in the evening. It's dark this time of year and without the safety of the bike lanes on University and Simcoe, I would have felt much more uncomfortable riding with her in the dark. Without safe alternatives, we put people into dangerous situations.\nI've seen studies that say bike lanes increase business for stores along their routes. Personally, although I have a car and could take transit, the convenience of separated bike lanes makes me more likely to shop at a store where I can ride right up to it and not worry about parking.\nPlease don't take away the safety and access that bike lanes are providing and please ensure cities are able to put them in reasonable locations based on data and growth patterns that align with what we need in our cities.\n"

        "comment": "There is no reason for the province to stick it's nose in this.  Cities and neighbourhoods should always be empowered to make decisions about what their streets look like without provincial red tape.  The province is in charge of highways, and there should be no bike lanes on highways. The cities are in charge of roads, and roads should prioritize local users, making sure it is safe and inviting for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The streets that have gained bike lanes have local businesses and neighbourhoods, they are not areas for cars to just drive through, they are vibrant destinations in and of themselves.  I am sure there are specific implementations that have specific problems, but a ham-fisted top down bureaucratic crackdown is entirely unwarranted and unproductive. If local communities see issues they can work through them with their respective city councils.\nRoads are not just for cars, they are for everybody. I own a car and I drive and I cycle and I walk and I use transit.  I want every option to be available to me when appropriate, and I want every option to be safe. The biggest problem I see when I'm driving is lack of enforcement by local cops (on cars and bikes disobeying the rules of the road), and driving down busy streets without bike lanes or turning lanes. The most pleasant drives inside the city are single lane roads with bike lanes and turning lanes at every intersection. Other roads always have people weaving in and out, and more aggressive drivers and cyclists.\n"

It is insulting to municipalities, who have worked hard to establish their own context-sensitive approach to providing mobility for their residents. And it's insulting to any semblance of equity - to limit safety for residents who want to bike or walk to prioritize the movement of regional drivers and their convenience.\nI urge the Minister to reflect on his own actions and not make municipalities and city residents bear the burden of his poor decision to drive to Queen's Park every day. I urge the Minister to reflect on why he chooses not to take GO Transit, a part of his own portfolio. I urge the Minister to reflect on the thousands of residents who take transit, walk, and bike. I urge the Minister to reflect on the negative external impacts of his actions, and frankly his selfishness.\nThis is undemocratic, going against municipal decision-making. And frankly, this framework is wrong and will not alleviate congestion. More people will die on our roads. So you can drive to Queen's Park (not any faster, as we know bike lanes do not increase congestion.) Please consult with experts in this area.\n"

Traffic has nothing to do with bike lanes and everything to do with the fact there are simply too many cars on the road. We need alternative modes of transportation that are safe and reliable if we want to ease gridlock. Bike lanes provide one of those alternatives. I recently learned that more than 70% of torontonians travel to work each day via car. That statistic is quite simply pathetic. We need to encourage people to bike, walk, and use public transit more than ever, and that won\u2019t happen without significant investment in all three.\n"

This suggests removing some of the limited semi-protected bike lanes that already exist and are not enough as it is.\nThere is no proof that increasing car lanes decreases traffic in any way, it simply leads to more cars on the road driving for longer distances.\n"
