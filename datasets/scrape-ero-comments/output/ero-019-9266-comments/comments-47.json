        "comment": "I support this Bill. Bike lanes have been installed on too many downtown streets in Ottawa, adding to the traffic congestion and reducing short term parking. I believe these lanes increase costs to the City for snow removal too - which leads to increased costs to taxpayers. The addition of bike lanes benefits a very small number of cyclists while negatively affecting a large number of car drivers. I don\u2019t patronize small businesses in the downtown area anymore as it is too hard to find parking and the traffic is so bad. Bike lanes have a negative effect on small businesses, in my opinion.\n"

        "comment": "This is a comment against the proposed bill. The proposed framework is in no way backed by evidence and will likely contribute to increased gridlock and traffic in Ontario's cities over the long term. Adding additional layers of bureaucratic oversight and red tape will also actively move decision-making that affects local communities away from those communities. Bike lanes are being used as a convenient scapegoat for a myriad of other failures of planning and infrastructure investment that prioritizes low density, sprawling cities.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is only going to increase gridlock by encouraging more people to drive vehicles.  Municipal bike lane and traffic calming initiatives like those implemented by Kitchener have demonstrated that they caused no measurable negative impact on commutes, as this bill implies.  On the contrary, they've improved cyclist AND pedestrian safety, as measured by the number of reported incidents.\nIf Ontario really wanted to reduce gridlock it would let municipalities continue to have sovereignty over their road management, and instead focus on making cross-municipality commuter public transit options more appealing, which means better availability, reliability, speed, and reduced cost.  For example, getting a dependable service between Waterloo region and Toronto that is faster than the average vehicle commute would significantly reduce the vehicle traffic between those regions, making more of the existing roadways available for personal and commercial vehicles.\n"

(Paint and plastic posts do not make safe bicycle lane).  Bicycles are smaller and more efficient moving though cities and do not cause congestion so you rarely see more than a few at a time, even though many more bicycles pass through an area than cars in the same time period.  If this bill passes we will have worst congestion in our cities in a few years and there is no amount of extra lanes that will fix it (see induced demand).  Only fast and efficient transit with dedicated lanes and bus first traffic signaling as well as bicycle lanes will.\n"

Besides that there is robust evidence that building bike lanes actually reduces car traffic and improved road safety for all users. We cannot build more roads to improve traffic there has never been a study which shows that more roads will reduce congestion. We must think beyond roads and personal vehicles and support other forms of transit.\n"

        "comment": "As a family living downtown, we rely on walking, transit, bike lanes AND a car to get around.\nWhen the Bloor lanes were fixed and extended westward towards High Park, it was such an amazing way to easily get to work and school (as transit can be unreliable and drivers have gotten quite aggressive).\nThat there is consideration to remove the few lanes we have is beyond disheartening, and reduces our travel possibilities. Being on a bike also allows us freedom to investigate neighborhoods, visiting local businesses that we normally would not if we were just driving through it.\nDriver aggression has gotten so bad, I am now incredibly fearful of my family using bikes when there aren't dedicated, protected lanes. Often this means we just don't go to certain places at all.\nI'm also very disheartened and frustrated that despite all the global research that shows bike lanes help reduce gridlock for all road users, anecdotal evidence is being used instead to make such decisions.\nAs we lose more and more green spaces in the city and province, bike lanes seem to be our final way to avoid polluted cities. Please, please fight to keep them in place.\n"

All research shows that this simply doesn\u2019t work. Ontario should be investing in a dense and robust network of bicycle lanes to encourage this sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. We also have to come up with better public transit solutions. This Bill reflects a myopic view of a complex problem. I strongly suggest the Ontario government step up with evidence-based leadership on this issue that addresses the long game of solving gridlock rather than this short-term measure that will ultimately fail.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill, ERO 019-9266, which seeks to ban bike lanes. This proposal is misguided for several reasons, which I outline below, focusing on its impact on traffic management, quality of life, the economy, and the environment.\n1. Traffic Management and Safety\nBike lanes play a critical role in modern urban planning by improving traffic flow and safety for all road users. Numerous studies have shown that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collisions between vehicles and cyclists, leading to fewer injuries and fatalities. Without bike lanes, cyclists are forced into mixed traffic, increasing risks for both cyclists and drivers and contributing to congestion as vehicles must navigate unpredictably around cyclists.\nIn fact, the implementation of bike lanes has been proven to reduce motor vehicle speeds in areas with high pedestrian activity, making streets safer for everyone. Rather than seeing bike lanes as a disruption, they should be regarded as an essential measure to optimize traffic flow and protect vulnerable road users.\n2. Quality of Life and Public Health\nEncouraging cycling through protected bike lanes has numerous public health benefits. Access to safe cycling routes promotes physical activity, reduces rates of obesity, and lessens the incidence of chronic diseases like cardiovascular ailments and diabetes.\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to a higher quality of urban life by fostering safer streets for pedestrians and creating a more inviting environment for residents. Cities with robust cycling infrastructure often see increased levels of community interaction, social engagement, and a greater sense of belonging among residents.\n3. Economic Benefits\nBike lanes are an investment in local economies. A study conducted on Bloor Street in Toronto found that after the installation of bike lanes, retail sales increased by nearly 4.45% compared to streets without bike lanes, demonstrating a direct economic boost for local businesses. This increase in sales was attributed to the improved accessibility and safety for cyclists, which encouraged more people to visit local shops and spend more time in the area.\nIn addition to increased retail revenue, the study showed that biking infrastructure did not negatively impact vehicle traffic or parking availability in the long term. Instead, it attracted a broader customer base, transforming the area into a more vibrant and economically thriving community. This evidence directly contradicts the notion that bike lanes harm businesses or lead to economic decline.\n4. Environmental Benefits\nThe environmental advantages of cycling infrastructure are undeniable. Transport is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and climate change. Shifting even a portion of daily commutes to bicycles helps to mitigate these issues by reducing car dependency and the associated emissions.\nBike lanes provide an accessible and affordable way to encourage cycling, which has zero carbon emissions and minimal environmental impact. In contrast, banning bike lanes undermines ongoing efforts to combat climate change, directly contradicting sustainability goals and risking the health of our planet for future generations.\nThe proposed ban on bike lanes is a step backward for Ontario. It prioritizes short-term and narrow-minded interests over the long-term well-being of residents, the economy, and the environment. This bill disregards the overwhelming evidence that bike lanes are crucial to developing safer, healthier, and more prosperous communities.\nOntario should be striving to build inclusive, sustainable cities with diverse transport options. Banning bike lanes is not a solution to our current traffic or urban challenges but a regression that will hinder progress in safety, environmental responsibility, economic growth, and quality of life.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this bill and, instead, invest in safe and inclusive transportation solutions that benefit all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I support a province wide approach to transportation management as traffic goes beyond municipal boundaries, however, this bill will add unnecessary red tape to infrastructure that improves safety, reduces the number of vehicles on the road, and requires local expertise. The province should focus on integrating local transit service across neighbouring municipalities, perhaps under the umbrella of GO transit, and leave local safety measures like bike lanes to municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Study after study have proven that adding bike lanes to a street makes for safer streets for adults, kids, elderly and yes, even those on a bike. Plus businesses on those streets see a boost in revenue and business.\nRemoving bike lanes won't do anything but induce demand and have even more people drive, which create more gridlock and traffic. The very things this law is hopping to solve.\nWe should put MORE money into the Eglinton LRT and get that open today. This transit line is an important node in our city network to get people moving.\n1,000,000 people take the TTC along the young line. Instead of catering to their needs. We want to make gridlock worse and help the 25,000 people who drive on the young line with more road space when they are a minority of the users of the road. This is anything but fiscally reasonable.\n"

Communities can decide for themselves what kind of transportation infrastructure best suits those communities.\nIn a moment where the IPCC warns we will over shoot 2 degrees warming and global efforts to reduce fossil fuel use are more needed than ever Ford is attacking one of the cheapest-for-government solutions to climate chaos: adopting bike transportation.\nThere is NO data to support Ford\u2019s attack on bike transport.
