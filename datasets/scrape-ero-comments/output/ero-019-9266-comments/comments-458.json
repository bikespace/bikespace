        "comment": "Has the provincial government looked at other areas that impact traffic flow - specifically ride share operators, food delivery services, poorly funded public transit, chronically delayed Eglinton Crosstown and scofflaw drivers? There are no bike lanes on Hwy 401 or 404 and last check there is plenty of gridlock on these highways. Traffic is worse than prior to the pandemic, and it is short sighted to blame a few bike lanes and think this is a solution. Too much congestion is the result of too many cars on the road.\n"

Cyclists should have as much say in the road network as drivers; developing different modes of transportation is the only way to alleviate traffic. I wholeheartedly disapprove of this legislation and am 100% convinced with much data to provide evidence instead of \"common sense thinking\" that in the future this will make more gridlock and not in fact save anybody time making drivers and cyclists less efficient.\nI encourage the premier and his cronies to actually look at some evidence and read some data driven reports on the success of bike lanes including the ones on bloor and university. They save lives saves and make for a better city and province.\n"

        "comment": "I am 76 years old and ride my bike every day of the year for shopping, errands, visiting my grand-daughters and friends, choir practice, etc. We need protected bike lanes on the major routes I cycle which are the same routes I occasioanlly drive. Bikers and drivers are separated and predictably stay in their lanes. This is better for everyone. My wife was hit by a car when biking to work on a major road without bike lanes and sustained 2 fractured ribs. I fear the same for myself if bike lanes are taken away.  I need to bike for all kinds of reasons, and I'll be on the road with or without bike lanes., summer and winter. Please keep Toronto safe. A minute off drive times is not worth another cyclist's life.\n"

        "comment": "This is not a conservative initiative. This is unnecessary spending that reduces people's choices in transportation options, adds bureaucracy and red tape, and keeps kids inside by not providing them with safe infrastructure to get  to school via bike.\nThe logic that \"fewer people use bike infrastructure than car infrastructure\" ignores the fact that there is far more car infrastructure and it has been around far longer. A core conservative belief is that changes should be slow and practical, so obviously people take time to use bike infrastructure that is new and don't use it if it is not practical.\nPresenting bike infrastructure as a \"liberal\" idea is absurd. Conservatism favours practicality, freedom of movement, reduced red tape and bureaucracy, and saving money. Biking and maintaining and expanding bike infrastructure accomplishes all of these things.\nTorontonians elected Olivia Chow, an avid cyclist. To remove bike lanes from the city of Toronto, that so clearly likes their development, goes against conservative values and is undemocratic. I will not be voting for a conservative that wastes taxpayer money, increases red tape, and limits my transportation options to only driving.\n"

        "comment": "I think it is quite a misguided line of thought to assume that the majority of the congestion happening in the city is due to bike lanes. Much of the traffic we see in Toronto are mostly on streets that DO NOT have cycling infrastructure. Like the lake shore, DVP and the 401. Most of the streets in Toronto DO NOT have bike lanes, it is a leap in logic to then pin the blame of congestion to cyclists when a majority of congestion is caused by OTHER CARS.\nEvery reputable study that has looked at traffic congestion and alternate modes of transport shows that creating infrastructure for non-car transport is the key to a less congested and better city.\nRemoving bike lanes, and creating barriers for safe cycling infrastructure WILL lead to more congestion and DEATHS. It is overt disregard to think otherwise.\n"

        "comment": "As a young person living in Toronto, it is disheartening to see regressive legislature even being talked about. I want to live in a city where we have the choice to use what mode of transport to use, and not to be forced to drive. Our city and province has underfunded transit expansion for decades and our poor city planning has resulted in people having to use a car to fulfill basic needs like shopping for groceries and seeing a doctor. Our government policy has forced a car-centric mindset upon us resulting in only a small adoption of people who use public transit or bike. The bike lane infrastructure was built and paid for, only for us to waste our money to rip them back up again. It's also like we have chose to ignore the phrase \"induced demand\", from both sides of the argument.\nTo reiterate, as someone in their twenties, seeing retirees make regressive decisions about our long term future makes me unhappy, and I want to see a city and world where everyone can make these decisions for themselves and not be forced upon a 50 year old way of thinking.\n"

        "comment": "i do not support this legislation.  bike lanes help reduce car congestion by reducing the number of cars.\nfrom thebikinglawyer web site I noted that:\n\"...bike lanes:\nEMS vehicles are not delayed by bike lanes in getting folks to emergency rooms as confirmed by the City of Toronto\u2019s EMS leads.\nThere is not a petition of 50,000 people against the bike lanes on Bloor. It\u2019s more like 13,000 who\u2019ve signed over several years now and Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition in support of bike lanes is approaching that number in just weeks.\nBike lanes are good for business! They boost sales in areas they are installed, attract higher spending clientele, can increase property values, and even attract talented work forces.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion, they move people around more efficiently, create safer driving routes (less collisions, less congestion), and get people out of single occupancy motor vehicle, which actually are the cause of congestion.\nSide streets are not the answer. Unconnected segments of bike lanes that force cyclists to take circuitous routes on various side streets will not encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes;\nThough facts should prevail, as lawyers for injured cyclists across Ontario, we are deeply concerned about the Premier and Ontario PC government\u2019s floated plans to attack people on bikes through legislation halting bike lane development.\nAs people on bikes this year have been killed in staggering numbers, it seems odd and we suspect painful for the loved ones of those lost, to hear of plans to decrease cyclist safety rather than plans from the government to increase penalties for those that kill and maim on our roads [Vulnerable Road User Legislation].\nIn just one month\u2019s time, we have seen cyclists killed in Belleville, Toronto, Guelph, Elora area, and Niagara. This is to say nothing of the many pedestrians and motorist killed and injured across the province each week.\nWhy then attack bike lanes and the Ontarians that use them? \"\n"

        "comment": "I am in strong opposition to the province removing Toronto City bike lanes. As a taxpayer, and resident of Etobicoke, I cycle frequently and have been hit by parked car doors, and have had hot coffee almost poured on me out of the window of a parked car. It is unbelievable that parking is allowed on city streets, but bike lanes that provides safety for cyclists will be removed.\nOn July 25, 2024 a young cyclist was killed biking in the Bloor Street bike lane, due to an illegally parked disposal bin in the bike lane. While cycling, I see illegally parked cars in the bike lane all the time. Instead of enforcing illegal parking of cars and other items, the province is instead removing these life saving bike lanes.\nI implore the province, to save lives instead of saving motorists a few minutes.\n"

        "comment": "Reasons not to remove bike lanes;\n1. Eliminating bike lanes won't eliminate bikes. Forcing cyclists into the car traffic is not only significantly more dangerous for the riders but also slows down cars even further when they pass the bike.\n2. The car lane you're adding is only going to get filled by parked cars anyway therefore not improving anything.\n3. We don't need more cars on the road. Cars are the most inefficient way to get around in the city. The majority of cars have one person in them, taking up vast amounts of space between human bodies whereas, on a bike or public transit, we are way closer together saving space.\n4. Riding bikes are good for the environment and good for the health of people. Not only is it more efficient to ride a bike time-wise, but it's also keeping people in a healthy state. Maybe Ford needs to think about that.\n5. Instead of having a personal vendetta about them, probably because he's too lazy and incapable of riding a bike himself, he should listen to the experts on this topic.\n"

        "comment": "I've lived along Bloor Street for many years, and the bike lanes have been a game-changer for me.\nWhen I was working a minimum wage job at Starbucks on Bloor, biking was the best and most affordable transportation option for me. When heading to an opening shift at 5 AM, the subway wasn't running, and the night bus or walking were not always great options for a young, solo woman. Biking meant I could easily bike away from the catcallers who cornered me when nobody else was around.\nBut despite this emotional safety bonus, biking itself wasn't always physically safe. I usually had to travel in the narrow \"door zone\" between parked cars and moving cars, which is a precarious place to be. One time, because I was so frustrated with all the people who didn't know how to park close to the curb, I took the left lane on Bloor (as is my legal right). Very quickly, I had a guy driving a pickup truck bearing down on me and honking because he felt I was blocking his way. When I moved back over to the right lane at the stoplight, he rolled down his window, called me a number of racial and sexual slurs, told me how easy it would be to make me roadkill with just a quick turn of his wheel, and then revved his engine to emphasize his point. A number of other cyclists had to come to my defense before he drove away. While this was one of the more egregious incidents, it was by no means an isolated one.\nAfter the bike lanes were installed on Bloor in 2016, it was a dramatically different experience. There was finally space meant for cyclists. When I was in the bike lane, I wasn't \"in the way\" of drivers and in \"their\" space, or at risk of being doored by someone not paying attention, or forced onto the sidewalk because nowhere felt safe (and thus endangering pedestrians). I no longer showed up to work stressed and rattled that someone threatened to kill me on my commute before 9 AM. It's been such a blessing.\nOver the last 8 years, I've seen the Bloor bike lanes become more and more popular, especially as new cycling connections were added to feed into this main throughfare. Sections that were just a little busy when they opened are now chock-full of cyclists -- but this progression takes time.\nI would hate to see us go back to the days before good bike infrastructure in Toronto. I will still ride a bike to work, but will now just have to take the lane more often to ensure my own safety, which will frustrate drivers and cause a lot of conflict.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is very expensive, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. The provincial government could use some of that (tax payer) money from the transportation budget to do some infrastructure maintenance instead of spending it on a whim. There is absolutely zero evidence that bikes are the contributors to more traffic - in fact, there is evidence of the opposite.\nAccording to city staff there are 486 km of bike lanes in the city, opposed to 14700 km of car lanes. 3000% more. (note that bike lanes are narrower, and many of these 486 km are just a painted sign on the road to share with cars).\nDefinitely the problem are not the bike lanes.\n"

Similarly, if more biking infrastructure is created, more people will choose to bike.\nThis is not opinion but proven fact. This decision has nothing to do with reducing congestion and is an overreach and abuse of power by the provincial government. This is not the will of the people and it would be a glaring step backwards to see this move forward\n"

        "comment": "As a fellow cyclist, vehicle owner and pedestrian of Toronto, I strongly disagree to the proposal of removing bike lanes pertaining to Bill 212.\nThe removal of bike lanes will not eliminate the cyclist on the road, but will increase safety and risk to cyclists and drivers as we continue to use the roads as our transportation systems/routes. Designated bike lanes allows for safe flow of road traffic and cyclists to stay within their lanes and reduce and prevent confusion and congestion on the main roads.\n And what about the Toronto bike share? Is that removed as well? The promotion of bike share without the proper and safe route is contradicting.\nUse our tax money to conduct a study of who is using the roads; why and time of use etc. then propose a plan.\n- TTC cost and wait time is too high that people resort to third party drivers (Uber, Lyft etc.) that are clogging the roads. If people felt safe on bikes from proper bike lanes existing and education on using bike lanes through the city it would reduce the need for other transportation services.\n"

Adding red tape to the process of installing new infrastructure, and removing existing infrastructure will force me to go back to driving to work.\nI cycle to work, grocery stores, and hobby/specialty shops which reduces the number of vehicles on the road.\nAs a transportation and traffic engineer, I disagree with the path the provincial government is taking. It adds additional wasteful steps to getting infrastructure approved, it will waste tax dollars to remove already constructed infrastructure. It is not data driven decisions... it's a waste.\nThis bill is clearly a vote buying strategy where it negatively effects a group of people you've assumed would never vote conservative but would help a potential group of undecided votes. It's disappointing that the cycling group is so harshly targeted and left to struggle for a policy that will ultimately make no improvements to commuting as induced demand and lack of alternative travel increases the number of vehicles such that congestion is worse.\n"
