        "comment": "Thorny problems have historically presented themselves throughout our life times.  Such is the issue of fossil fuels and the detrimental impact they have had and continue to present to our weakening environment.  The increasing frequency and intensity of storms, floods etc. can't reasonably be argued against, as to cause and effect.  But, big changes are typically accompanied by resistance, typically by \"the many\", who in their own self interest resist/object, as their own personal habits are impacted by the change.  It is rare, (usually too late), that such change gets implemented. as the consensus of opinions lies with sustaining the status quo.  But someone must muster the courage, to start the Change.  We typically see Governments step in the best interest of the common good.  Without Government taking the lead such necessary changes, they do no occur!\nSuch is the issue with bike lanes.  Adoption/usage is currently low, but proportionately growing rapidly in usage.  Not surprisingly their introduction is angering car drivers whose space (may?) has been impinged upon, ... yet I suspect whats angering them is rather how quickly bikes move towards their destination, (compared to the cars).\nWe in Toronto have deeply embedded problems.  Congestion is certainly one!  The less cars on the road the better.  We need to get cars off the road. Housing is too expensive for many and distances to travell to work et al can be large.  Public transit is not meeting constituent needs, (where's the LRT?).  Back to work demands are forcing workers to travel downtown.  How do they afford it?\nIf lanes are removed, the bike riders will still be on the road, just riding at increased risk, because the other problems aren't going away soon.  During initial stages of rectifying thorniy issues, Governments have to step up.   Such is not the case where a provincial Government sees fit to overrule those immediately responsible for implementation, (The City). It's actually aggregious and on the surface self serving.  We elect City Councillors to deal with such issues and they have, in the best interest of the Common Good.\nThe Provincial Government's stance here is also ironic!  Currently there is a feeding frenzy occurring with Developers promoting and the Province approving construction of what feels like hundreds of high rises, 30 - 40 storeys high.  These building, purporting to be ecologically wise, have severely  minimized auto parking, less than a 100 spaces per building, BUT, they brag, with 400 - 500 bicyle racks.  That's the future, right?  In concert with all the buildings across Toronto, how will these thousands of riders use the Streets of Toronto to move about.  Without Bike lanes the occupants of the new construction, including existing resident/pedestrians will be at risk.\nTen years ago my wife and found ourselves in Amsterdam.  We were amazed at the size/breadth of bike lanes, into the core of the City.  They took up as much space as was available for autos.  There were hundreds on bicycles as far as the eye could see.  I remarked to myself Wow!, this is the future.\nReal change needs the wisdom of Governments.  It's too bad we do not have a Government in Queens park that sees this vision.\nSigned a car driver who is too old to use a bike, who has seen a glimpse of a better future ahead.\n"

        "comment": "Please do NOT remove bike lanes in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure for my family - I regularly bike to work, to get groceries and my family bikes along the Danforth and Bloor Street to get to various stores, restaurants and events. The bike lanes help keep me safe when commuting. They are also a part of reducing carbon emissions as they are an environmentally friendly way of getting around the city. As the weather gets warmer, the biking season is extended. We should not be getting rid of infrastructure that will help us mitigate climate change. For safety, for environmental responsibility, for exercise (part of well-being), for being a cheaper means of transport, I am asking you to please KEEP bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

I use tgg by e bicycle lanes in bloor and university daily to get to work safely. More importantly the bicycle lanes allow my husband , who can no longer drive due to a medical condition, contribute to the errands and taking the kids to various activities on routes that keep him and my kids safe.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the safety of the separated bike lanes i wouldn\u2019t be able to share many of the family duties with my husband, . If they didn\u2019t exist I would be in a car driving to places that we can much more easily bike , contributing to congestion and taking double the time to do it.\nBike lanes allow safe accessible transportation options for many torontonians who don\u2019t have access to a car or who can\u2019t drive .\nPlease don\u2019t force Toronto to remove the bike lanes. It is a fates issue first and foremost\n"

It is clearly evident and understood by urban planners that cycling is needed for safer, heathier and efficient traffic flow.

        "comment": "I live just off of Bloor West and I use the bike lane down Bloor every day to get to school. I can\u2019t afford to take public transit and the bike lane has been amazing to use.\nThis bike lane is always very busy. This means that if we put all of those bikes on the road, the roads would be just as slow (the bikes would take up a lane of traffic anyways) and the roads would be much less safe!!\nInstead of making more room for more cars, why don\u2019t we incentivize people to use bikes by creating safe pathways? Increasing the number of bikers would reduce strain on both the roads and transit systems. Making biking unsafe for bikers will not stop current bikers from biking (financially, I don\u2019t have a choice), and putting bikers on the road won\u2019t solve the gridlock problem.\nAlso, tearing out bike lanes that were recently put in is an incredibly frustrating waste of taxpayers\u2019 money, especially when this is such a controversial thing to be doing!\n"

        "comment": "Submission to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nThis proposed bill is counterproductive and deeply concerning. Evidence from cities worldwide, including leading examples in the United States and Europe, demonstrates that investing in bike infrastructure leads to improved urban mobility, reduced traffic congestion, lower emissions, and safer streets for all users.\nOntario has already made significant investments in bike infrastructure, which this bill threatens to dismantle. This would not only waste public funds but also create additional costs through roadwork disruptions and infrastructure removal. The claim that this will alleviate congestion is flawed; research consistently shows that reducing bike lane availability forces more people into cars, worsening gridlock rather than relieving it.\nFurthermore, this bill reveals a glaring oversight: it entirely neglects the needs and perspectives of non-drivers. Commuters who rely on bicycles, pedestrians, and public transit users\u2014many of whom cannot or choose not to drive\u2014are integral to Ontario's transportation network. By prioritizing drivers to the exclusion of all others, this legislation marginalizes a significant portion of the population.\nThe proposed changes also disregard the proven safety benefits of dedicated bike lanes, which protect cyclists and reduce accidents. Dismantling these lanes will make streets more dangerous, discourage active transportation, and undermine public health initiatives encouraging walking and cycling.\nOntario must look forward, not backward. Modern, successful cities embrace multimodal transportation solutions that cater to drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users alike. I urge the provincial government to reject this regressive bill and instead expand investments in sustainable and equitable transportation infrastructure.\n"

So not only would such an action be counterproductive, it would be outright disingenuous and dishonest. Study after study has shown that making bike lanes available benefits everyone, while adding car lanes makes it worse for all - invites more car traffic and makes riding more dangerous\n"

Removing bike lanes will not improve the flow of traffic, and is likely to have the opposite effect due to the increase in trips taken with a car. These decisions are not being made based on data. People's lives are being put at risk. This is a huge overreach of the provincial government's power.\n"

        "comment": "This misguided piece of proposed legislation will endanger lives, compromise economic development, and increase emissions from transportation. It should not be passed into law. Research has conclusively proven that bike lanes are an asset to communities for several reasons:\n-Economic benefits: small businesses report increases to the number of customers coming through their doors when bike lanes are installed. Cycling is an efficient and cost-effective way to mobilize, especially for the large number of individuals in cities who do not own cars. Removing existing bike lanes would be an incredible waste of taxpayer money.\n-Environmental benefits: In order to meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions, people need safe and efficient alternative to cars. Bike lanes provide that. They are an integral part of addressing the present climate change emergency.\n-Health benefits: Bike lanes keep cyclists safe. Endangering the lives of cyclists for the sake of saving a few minutes of a motorist's time is morally reprehensible.\n-Traffic benefits: Adding back lanes of traffic will not reduce congestion. In fact, the opposite will occur due to induced demand. Additionally, cyclists do not simply disappear where there are no bike lanes. Instead they are forced to share lanes with motorists, slowing down the flow of traffic.\nFurther to these points, the proposed legislation is an egregious jurisdictional overreach. The province should not interfere in municipal decisions about transportation infrastructure.\n"
