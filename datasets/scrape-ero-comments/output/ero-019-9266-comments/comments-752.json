        "comment": "My concerns for Bill 212, 2024 are as follows:\nSchedule 1 Amendment to the Bill from 2021 which prioritizes expropriation of land along highways for broadband projects.  Does this mean highways are being set up for internet connection and cameras to set up tolls?  Will more tolled highways be sold to private owners at a discount like the previous Conservative government did to us?\nSchedule 2  Expediting the construction of Highway 413, Bradford bypass, etc.  Landowners will be kicked off land (possibly prime farmland) with no recourse unless you are a friend of conservative politicians in which case they will reroute the highway around your golf course.\nSchedule 3  Construction and environmental process for highway 413--so it can be exempted from Environmental Assessment Act.  This climate science denying government wants to speed construction of an unnecessary highway at the expense of the environment which will exacerbate floods and cause more habitat loss to species at risk.  Prime farmland and natural habitat need to be protected hence the creation of the Greenbelt.  I am not surprised seven Ontario youth are suing this government for its abysmal climate response considering the direct impact of climate change is worsening with each passing year.\nSchedule 4 Bike lane approval.  This government is adding more bureaucracy to Municipalities which should be encouraging active transportation so we can reduce the extremely inefficient and noisy automobile.\nIn conclusion this Bill will worsen gridlock.  Every time roads are widened in any city no matter what country it is known that there is only temporary relief in congestion before it quickly fills up again.  This well documented phenomena is called induced demand.  Real world class cities like Tokyo, Berlin, Copenhagen, Amsterdam etc. rely on well run and funded public transportation.  What would these cities look like if all their citizens drove cars--they would look like the clogged up embarrassment that is the capital city of Ontario.  Paving more land and taking away bike lanes will make gridlock worse by taking away options to go car free.  Ramming through legislation to speed up the building of highway 413 will cause more environmental destruction as well as divert funds from other modes of transportation, namely public transit.  It seems that the main purpose of highway 413 is to funnel our tax money into the pockets of strategically chosen developers, land owners and investors.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government is getting it wrong on so many levels. When will they realize that more, not less, bike lanes as well as safety and support for those who elect alternative methods of transportation (more environmentally friendly methods) are the answer to road congestion. This bill appears to be an attempt at over-reaching by the province into municipal matters and seems to be a desire to make it more difficult for communities who want to provide green alternatives to their citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes for the following reason:\nStreet parking is not moving traffic along whereas bike lanes are constantly allowing for movement of people\nSustainability - there is no air pollution from cyclists\nHealth - cycling is a great form of exercise and better for our bodies compared to sitting still in a car\nCost - bikes are much more affordable than cars, there\u2019s no paying for parking or gas, and tourists can easily use bike share\nPeople with disabilities use adaptive bikes and technology in bike lanes - the adaptive bikes they drive are often low to the ground and not easily visible to drivers so there\u2019s a safety concern without protected bike lanes\nCyclists will take the full lane if you remove these protected bike lanes and that will slow down traffic much more than safe and dedicated bike lanes ever would\nLarge influx of food delivery drivers will be using car lanes, weaving in and out and around. I don\u2019t think drivers will appreciate this.\nThese bikes lanes were put in place so recently - why don\u2019t we wait 5-10 years to get proper data to measure their impact?\nUsing tax payers money to rip out new bikes lanes does not make sense - why isn\u2019t that money being put towards improving public transit? Toronto will be way behind other world class cities if we remove bike lanes.\nBike lanes are needed to keep cyclists safe and ALIVE. Too many drivers do not respect the minimum 1 m required to safely pass a cyclist. Please think about how many parents take their children to school along the Bloor bike lines. We are risking their lives if we remove them.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

Day after day we hear about cyclists and pedestrians being struck by drivers, why are we removing crucial infrastructure to make the streets even more dangerous? What we need is investment into public transit, safer bike lane networks, and ways to make driving LESS convenient. Toronto is an incredibly walkable city, why should we bend over backwards for suburbanites who only know 6 lane roadways?\n"

I feel the Ontario Conversative Government is quite short sighted when it comes to this.  Anyone who cycles on our streets know the value and impact that cycling lanes have  and the importance to the health and safety of all citizens.  It also does not address any formal study that has been done to improve the congestion in Toronto (specifically).  I find it interesting that the roads in Ontario where there is the greatest amount of congestion are on the 400 series highways and/or those along the lakeshore.  The lack of public transportation and its effectiveness in Toronto is sadly not adequate.  How is it that this government complains about lack of house, cost of living ie rent, groceries and day to day living expenses, but does nothing about improving public transportation as most of those affect the most in our citizens.\n"

The loss of some of the country's best farmland has to stop.  That is reason alone for the measured look at any highway expansion in Southern Ontario.  We are also at significant risk of flooding, with the Humber River particularly vulnerable.  Our 100-year storms are now 5 and 10 year storms, and we remember the losses suffered in Hurricane Hazel.  Any efforts to expand our highway system need to be seen through that lens also.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist who follows the rules of the road by stopping etc., I cycle responsibly to be predictable to others, in particular, cars around me. I also drive and walk in these same areas.\nToronto drivers have a notorious reputation for bad and aggressive driving. The province pits cars against cyclists in it's policy narratives and drivers often purposely taunt cyclists.\nYears ago, I pulled into a driveway to let an aggressive car pass me, it pulled in with me and tried to knock me off my bike!\nI posted a video right after this incident talking about cars needing to exercise ten seconds of patience around cyclists. That video went crazy viral because of how many people in Toronto experience the same types of vehicular manslaughter attempts from aggressive drivers.\nBike lanes saves lives for this reason, they divide the cars from the cyclist allowing both to travel side by side. In the absence of a bike lane, because of how many close calls I've had in Toronto, I'll take the lane which I can rightfully do under the laws of this province. Taking the lane impedes vehicular traffic whereas a bike lane does not.\nGetting rid of bike lanes isn't going to fix Toronto's traffic woes. The city's population and surrounding suburban populations have been exploding. Transit infrastructure has not kept pace forcing more people to drive. The Crosstown was announced fourteen years ago and is still not running!\nThe province should be focused on fast tracking and supporting public transit and more bike lanes to get people out of cars.\nImplement a congestion tax, like in London UK, and use these funds to accelerate transit development.\nPlease leave the bike lanes alone, they save lives.\n"

        "comment": "With the economy being in such disarray, now is the time for less expensive ways for people to get around.\nWhen housing and rentals are at an all time high cost, we need to be realistic in seeing how people will react to such situations. People aren\u2019t looking for a faster way to work, they\u2019re looking for cheaper alternatives, with lower upfront costs and bare bones maintenance. An automobile does the opposite of that and only exacerbates the current cost of living crisis. Those who can bear through these times may do what they want, but those who struggle or can\u2019t, meaning 90% of Ontariens, would love to have a viable alternative. We currently are doing good work in increasing the quality of useful options by adding bikeways in as many places as possible, but there is still a ways to go. Undoing all of that work is an affront I would consider to be nothing less than abhorrent.\nIt is the duty of the provincial government to respond to its citizens and to do proper research to investigate the viability of its solutions. It is clear that no research was done, or that heavily biased research was done, because the findings from other countries, and even findings from local businesses here in Ontario, would show that bikeways have an impressively large positive impact on local sales and general well-being.\nThese studies shouldn\u2019t be something I even have to link here, as you should have those already on hand. If you don\u2019t, then I heavily question the provincial government\u2019s fitness in doing its job. It is the job of the whole system to answer to the issues of the people. If my opinion means anything, then the goals proposed by the government should be immediately revoked and even pushed in the other direction, allowing for faster implementation of bikeways and other non-automobile infrastructure.\nThank you for your time. I hope to see these concerns addressed at once.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving you Time Act and specifically the proposed restrictions on municipal authority to implement bike lanes.  These restrictions will do nothing to reduce gridlock or save time and they interfere with the responsibility of municipalities to design safe roads and build strong local economies.\nBikes are vehicles under the Highway Traffic Act so the right-hand lane of any multi-lane municipal road (excepting 400-series highways) is a lane that is available for use by bikes.\nBike lanes take up half the roadway of a lane that is also available for use by motor vehicles.  As such, within the right-of-way for vehicular traffic, they:\n- allow more space for users of motor vehicles including dedicated turn lanes that facilitate the free flow of motor vehicles not making turns.\n-segregate (generally) slower bicycle traffic which facilitates higher motor vehicle speeds (including by way of requiring fewer lane-changes).\n- provide a buffer between motor vehicles and pedestrians and thus make streets safer and less stressful for all road users (which, in turn, helps small businesses - retailers and restaurants - on city streets).\nWe need smart, forward-thinking solutions to reduce gridlock.  In built-up areas, good transportation alternatives (e.g. transit and bike lanes) concentrate demand for road space and so reduce traffic congestion.\nLet's get Ontario moving, not engage in jurisdictional over-reach and divisive politics.\n"
