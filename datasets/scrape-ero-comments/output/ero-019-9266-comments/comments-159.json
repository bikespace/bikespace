        "comment": "You absolute muppets. This is counter to all evidence, counter to the climate crisis, and counter to common sense.\nHaving people on bikes REDUCES traffic. You will force people into their cars instead. You will CAUSE more traffic and much more knock-on ill health effects from sitting in cars instead of biking.\nIf you want to reduce traffic, make more ways for people to use reliable, clean and safe active transportation.\nI cannot believe anyone elected you people to government. You should be ashamed, and you will, one day, when your grandkids ask you why half the country is on fire.\n"

        "comment": "Weather permitting, I bicycle to and from work, shopping, and all sorts of other activities on a daily basis.  I specifically choose routes to stay in bike lanes and really like the bike lanes along bloor and danforth as that's the majority of where I have to go.  If Bike Lanes are removed, I will continue to ride my bicycle but instead I will be riding in the middle of the car lane taking a whole lane of traffic.  I max out about 20-25 km/h on my bike.  Removal of current or prevention of new bike lines will not reduce congestion.  Bikes lanes help traffic and make the roads safer.  Please don't mess with them.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with what the Premiere of Ontario feels is the right decision. Ontario is plagued with far more important issues.\nThe Provincial government should have no direct influence in any way, shape, or form, what the municipalities do with accordance to bike lanes. Why should he? Him and his staff have already demonstrated that they will go against what is proven to work (with the help of experts, actual data and studies) for the sake of their own narrow views. This feels like a grievous overstep of authority coupled with a lack of understanding.\nThe Premiere and his staff should be focusing their attention elsewhere, like the growing housing crisis, the ever worsening ER wait time and staffing issues, and why we have such a large homeless problem.\nLet municipalities work out what's best for their cities and people considering bike lanes and other transit means.\n"

        "comment": "This bill completely misunderstands the point of adding bike lanes and all it serves to do is justify the addition of more traffic from cars and makes congestion worse in the name of \"self-serving\" people who do not have much imagination or idea of how it really is beyond North America.\nThe point of letting cities and municipalities bring bike lanes into their streets is so that they won't have to constantly be met with red tape and decide how their cities should let their residents go on about their lives without being required to have the car, which in turn can reduce traffic in the long-term, even to work if possible.\n"

        "comment": "I have reviewed the proposed Bill 212, which seeks to further regulate municipal authority over the construction and maintenance of bike lanes. I must express my disagreement with this bill.\nPromoting bike lanes is crucial for addressing current issues such as traffic congestion and ensuring a sustainable future for Ontario. The increase in commute times is a complex issue, influenced by various factors including the rise in the number of vehicles post-pandemic and the growing number of drivers who disregard traffic rules, such as blocking intersections. Regulating municipalities to maintain and build bike lanes does not address these underlying issues.\nFurthermore, bike lanes provide significant benefits to Ontarians, including:\n1. **Supporting Local Businesses**: Bike lanes facilitate easier access for pedestrians to visit local stores, thereby supporting local commerce.\n2. **Safety Buffer**: Bike lanes create an additional buffer between the road and the walkway, reducing the likelihood of fatal traffic accidents and helping achieve Vision Zero.\n3. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Bike lanes improve the connectivity of our city, bringing different neighborhoods together.\n4. **Health and Environmental Benefits**: Biking produces no direct CO2 emissions and encourages physical activity, which can reduce healthcare costs by promoting a healthier lifestyle.\n"

        "comment": "I both live in the neighbourhood, own and work in it. Yonge Street and Avenue Road are a \"NIGHTMARE\"!!. It is impossible to leave the street I live on.. there is no other street available to exit to YONGE ST. No one will allow an exit of cars never mind trying to walk. The e-bikes obey no highway traffic signs ,... they run red lights, they drive on the sidewalks. The fast food delivery cars park anywhere they want obstructing traffic. Add all of this to bike lanes that are not used by bikes you wonder who is actually using them.\nEmergency Vehicles take forever to get through the traffic trying to negotiate both cars and blockage by vehicles and Cafes on the street. Yonge street is a virtual parking lot. Avenue Road is either a racecourse of HOT CARS or Dodgems. The amount of illegal left turns and U-turns with no consideration for either other drivers or pedestrians is monumental.\n"
