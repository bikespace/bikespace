        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto is a short-sighted and wasteful decision that jeopardizes cyclist safety, harms the environment, and wastes taxpayer money!! Adding more car lanes will only lead to increased traffic congestion in the long run, ignoring the PROVEN benefits of sustainable transportation.\nSee below for my key points.\nImportance of Bike Lanes to Cities\n1. Improved Safety for Cyclists and Pedestrians: Bike lanes create a safer environment for cyclists by providing a dedicated space separate from motor vehicles. Studies have shown that bike lanes reduce the risk of accidents involving cyclists by up to 50% [1].\n2. Environmental Benefits: Encouraging cycling over car usage significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. According to the European Cyclists' Federation, cycling 10 km each way to work instead of driving saves 1.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually [2].\n3. Economic Gains: Investing in bike lanes has been shown to boost local economies. A study by the University of California, Davis found that bike-friendly cities attract more tourism and generate higher retail sales. Additionally, every dollar invested in bike infrastructure returns five dollars in economic benefits [3].\nAdding More Car Lanes Will NOT Reduce Congestion in the Long Run.\n4. Induced Demand Phenomenon: Increasing the number of car lanes often leads to more traffic, not less. The concept of induced demand shows that making more room for cars encourages more people to drive, ultimately leading to the same or even higher levels of congestion [4].\n5. Diminished Returns on Investment: Extensive research by the Transportation Research Board indicates that while new road construction may temporarily alleviate congestion, it fails to provide long-term solutions. Within a few years, traffic volumes typically rebound to previous levels [5].\n6. Promoting Sustainable Alternatives: Focusing on car infrastructure ignores the potential of sustainable transportation. Cities that prioritize public transit, cycling, and walking experience lower congestion levels and better overall mobility [6].\nWaste of Taxpayer Dollars\n7. High Costs of Removal and Reconstruction: Removing existing bike lanes and reallocating road space for cars involves significant expenses. These funds could be better used to improve current infrastructure and support sustainable transportation initiatives [7].\n8. Loss of Previous Investments: Cities like Toronto have already invested heavily in bike infrastructure. Dismantling these systems would mean wasting taxpayer money that has already been spent on planning, construction, and maintenance [8].\n9. Negative Economic Impact on Local Businesses: Research from Portland State University shows that bike lanes increase retail activity. Removing them could hurt local businesses that benefit from the increased foot and bike traffic, leading to potential revenue losses [9].\nReferences\n[1] National Institute for Transportation and Communities, \"The Impacts of Bicycle Infrastructure: Evidence from Cities Across the U.S.,\" 2019.

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212.\nThe best way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road. Preserving bike lanes and adding new ones does exactly this.\nMaking roads safer for cyclists not only saves lives but attracts car users to switch to cycling, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. Similarly, investing in transit improvements reduces the number of cars on the road, reducing gridlock.\nResearch shows that increasing road space for cars increases gridlock, because it attracts more cars to the road.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are necessary to protect more vulnerable road users including children while moving more people in less space than cars or trucks. The province is looking backwards to the hey-day of the 50's rather than forward to a future of safer and more effective transit. More individual people in more and larger cars will not meet the needs of a fast growing metropolis. We need innovative leadership solving complex problems in multiple ways for the multiple needs we have now and in the future rather than catering to a single type of transit and following one type of voter..\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m so disappointed with the tabling of this bill. The only way to reduce congestion is to reduce the number of cars on the road. The only way to reduce cars is to provide people with alternatives to driving, like transit and cycling. While it might feel counter intuitive, the promotion of bike lanes means fewer cars on the road, making more space for those that need to drive. If we truly want to save time them we must make better use of limited space by enacting standards and measures that focus on the efficiency of moving people and not vehicles.\nAlso, as a parent, I worry that there are more vehicles on the road, that they are getting larger and heavier, and that they have increasing blind spots that make streets more dangerous for my child. I would very much like for my child to be able to navigate her neighbourhood safely on her bike. Bike lanes enable this. In fact, they empower mobility for many groups of people who otherwise cannot drive. A province (and a party that claim) to support family values would enable infrastructure that both protects and improves the quality of life of society\u2019s most vulnerable members.\nIf these arguments of less congestion (and less pollution that goes with it) and improved safety are not compelling enough, then decision makers should at least be worried about induced demand. Opening up space for cars doesn\u2019t save time because more cars will come, clogging up the newly created space, re-establishing the congested status quo. Therefore this bill cannot deliver on its promise. In fact, it will likely do the opposite. Researchers, engineers, public servants, city planners know this. I hope that more experts will speak out, pulling back the current on this false bill of goods.\nPlease show real leadership. Because this is not just about bike lanes, this is about the types of cities we want to live in and raise our children in. Leaders were not always so short-sighted, only concerned with the now. They knew they had a solemn responsibility to shape a city into its greatest potential for the next generation. They knew that what they built (or destroyed) today set their communities on a trajectory. I would like to support a bill and leaders with a bolder vision that includes fewer cars, active transportation, reliable public transit, fewer emissions, more green space, and safer streets adopting the Hierarchy of Controls. A bill like that would place Ontario cities amongst the best in the world, where everyone would want to live and do business.\n"

        "comment": "I'm beyond disappointed in this provincial government's decision to meddle in municipal politics about something that has no connection to their jurisdiction. This bill would needlessly add red tape to something intended to improve the lives, the health and safety of citizens. Well designed bike lanes benefit not only those who bike to work but those who drive, as any effort to divert drivers to bicycles helps reduce congestion for drivers while also improving the drive as we no longer have to worry about sharing the road with these small and vulnerable bikers. And it's important to remember that we're not just talking about regulating something recreational: bikers may be on these roads for fun but are more often than not getting to work or who may be working on their bikes. They are also our children getting to school or to go see friends. We should be enabling their safe commuting.\nThis proposed legislation is both wasteful and irresponsible, and should be rewritten to support and enable the separation of bike routes from motorways, not to bog them down due to an imagined \"war on cars.\" You should be trying to help people get around safely and efficiently, not simply preserve the seemingly convenient status quo.\n"

Toronto didn't vote for this, if they didn't want bike lanes they would have elected a mayor and council who didn't support them. you are not the mayor of Toronto remember.\npeople will get seriously injured and die because of this.\nthis policy direction is baseless.\nbike lanes make roads safer for EVERYONE.\nthis is pure optics. what's next? rip out the sidewalks because the traffic is still there?\nhow about focusing on the transit projects that are so wildly behind schedule.\nyou should be ashamed to put forward something so stupid that will cost people their lives.\ndriver convenience its not worth a person's life.\nit's 2024 what other major city is going so backwards with stupid policy like this? give people more ways to move around. people who ride bikes are not second class citizens and while you think \"just take the side streets\", that's not where the shops and everything is. people ride bikes for their daily lives not just for recreation.\nwhy doesn't doug just take the subway to work? he does know the three lanes they want to rip up have subways underneath right?\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislature specifically targets the City of Toronto and discriminate cyclists in favour of single occupancy vehicles which are the actual cause of congestion.  The legislature unlawfully circumvents and underminds the City of Toronto Act, 2006.  Should the province proceed in modifying existing bike lanes without any meaningful review as they are announcing, they will be making an existing condition less safe for cyclists and should therefore bare all liabilty and cost for damages. This unlawful meddling with municipal infrastructure will see to it that the ontario ombudsman and integrity commissioner be called upon.\n"

        "comment": "The shared goal of both the government of Ontario and citizens is to reduce traffic. The only way to reduce traffic in cities with finite public space is to allow viable alternatives to driving. Cycling is one such alternative, and segregated bike lanes take cyclists out of conflict with cars so that the experience of both cycling and driving is safer and faster. This bill would take transportation choices away from Ontarians, and would see the provincial government overrule the local needs of communities. I regularly bike with my young children to and from daycare, and I want to see infrastructure in this province which protects me and my family from cars by taking me out of conflict with them.\n"

        "comment": "**Opposition to the Removal of Bike Lanes under Bill 212**\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable.\nFirstly, bike lanes save lives. Dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collisions and fatalities by separating cyclists from motor vehicles. Toronto has seen too many tragic accidents, and removing these lanes would put more lives at risk. According to the City of Toronto\u2019s own reports, streets with bike lanes experience significantly fewer serious injuries and deaths.\nIn addition to safety, bike lanes support local businesses. Studies conducted along the Bloor Street bike lane show that retail sales increased after the lanes were installed. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses compared to drivers, and removing these lanes will hurt the economic vitality of these neighbourhoods.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are an essential tool in reducing traffic congestion. One less car on the road reduces gridlock for everyone. Encouraging active transportation through safe cycling infrastructure is a proven way to ease congestion and promote more efficient use of road space. Removing bike lanes will only increase car dependency and worsen gridlock, contradicting the bill\u2019s stated goal of improving mobility.\nLastly, bike lanes provide an affordable, accessible transportation option for those who cannot afford the high costs of vehicle ownership. By removing this infrastructure, the government is limiting equitable access to transportation and disproportionately harming low-income individuals who rely on cycling as a primary means of travel.\nI urge you to reconsider this damaging proposal. Removing bike lanes is not just a step backward for Toronto but a move that undermines the safety, economy, and livability of our city. Ontario should be expanding its cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\n"

        "comment": "Evidence shows that ADDING bike lanes reduces gridlock and makes streets safer for everyone. Bill 212 will spend tax dollars doing the opposite of what it intends to do while increasing the province's environmental impact.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I value and occasionally use the lanes at risk of removal. The citizens of Toronto voted for leaders that promised bike lanes and those leaders followed through. Please respect democracy.\nI am also a daily driver on Bloor street and in the downtown core. I feel safer driving when cyclists and motorists are separated. Plus, the bike lanes have not slowed me down. Decades of underinvestment in infrastructure certainly have. Why remove one of the few items we did invest in?\nThis bill would be an irresponsible and undemocratic use of precious public funds. Stay in your lane!\n"
