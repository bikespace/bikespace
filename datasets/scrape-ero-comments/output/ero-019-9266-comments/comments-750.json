What has been proven effective is providing alternatives to driving.  Bicycles and transit are an important part of that.\nExempting highways from environmental assessment and normal expropriation rules shows the government cares more about the developers than the residents.  Make it easier to build more highways no matter how it affects the people around it and the environment.\nPlease rethink this mess.\n"

        "comment": "Disappointed at this proposed legislation. It is a backwards looking proposal that is only pushing us towards more personal vehicle dependency at a time when the province should be looking ahead to the future where people will have more transportation options and we can start to lower our environmental impact and leave the road capacity to those who really need it and the vital freight volumes that keep our province functioning.\nThe removal of due processes for both expropriation and environmental assessment in order to push ahead highway 413 appears to be simply a way to advance a project where the impacts are not properly understood the the benefits have been shown to be minimal at best. While I appose the highway overall as simply a project that will increase the amount and distance that people are forced to drive (induced demand making it clear that no one will be saving time overall and the highway will quickly become congested) but, once built, the highway will only encourage more sprawl and the poor provincial/city planning that has made us so alarmingly car dependent in the first place.\nEven despite my scepticism of highway 413, at least I could have felt some reassurance that it was going through the standard processes required for a project of this magnitude. The Environmental Assessment states \"The purpose of this Act is the betterment of the people of the whole or any part of Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the environment.\" I cannot understand why the Province feels that it would be appropriate to exempt a project of this significance and magnitude from the key provisions that are in place to ensure that infrastructure that will possibly have centuries of impacts to the environment, some impossible to be reversed, do not have adverse impacts that generations down the line will be paying for.\nSimilarly, the proposed exceptions to the Expropriation Act for the purposes of building this highway (and broadband technologies) undermine the public's trust that the government is operating in good faith in these processes and is acting appropriately.\nOn the subject of the proposed changes to the Highway Traffic Act, as an engineer and a road safety professional, I find it alarming that our government would propose legislation that will inevitably lead to an increase in preventable injuries and death. It is well known and has been demonstrated in jurisdictions across Ontario, Canada and the world that separated cycling infrastructure leads to improved safety outcomes for all road users. Historically, municipalities have made decisions on how to assign right-of-way to the various road users in order to ensure an official and safe road network and they continue to be best-positioned to make these decisions.\nNeedless to say, I full-throatedly oppose the unnecessary expenditures and negative outcomes associated  with the removal of currently installed bike lanes in the City of Toronto. The Province has not demonstrated any sort of indication that this decision was made with sound judgement or with any data to support it. The  removals proposed in the legislation do not appear to be supported by any professional association as a sound decision. Organizations such as the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, the Ontario Traffic Council the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, as well as many advocacy groups and disability communities have all written formal opposition messages to the proposed changes to the HTA.\nDespite the Provinces efforts, personal vehicle travel will continue to become more and more expensive and a greater financial and environmental burden on society. This is why it's so important to move beyond the mistakes of the past to a province where people can choose to leave the car at home to make most of their trips during the day. Helping people live close to work and the resources they need daily will make active transportation and transit more and more attractive. This is where the province should be dedicating it's efforts instead of building highways and trying to add more lanes where they will not offer any relief. While I know that submitting this comment is in vain and these changes will be enacted to the determent of the Province for generations to come, I can only humbly submit this comment in the hope that cooler heads prevail and some more thought is given before these proposals which will have far-reaching impacts are approved.  Thank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I'm against Bill 212. My comment is only on the removal of bike lanes on University, Bloor and Yonge and the province's overreach to restrict bike lanes going forward, because they affect my everyday life directly. The removal and restriction of bike lanes will make traffic worse, put people's life in danger, and make living in Toronto even more unaffordable.\nFirst, traffic will not be improved by having more cars and more conflicts between cars and bikers. Traffic will be improved by having less cars and encouraging people to choose public transit, biking and etc. Removing and restricting bike lanes will take away one option from commuters and force some of them to get into cars. Because most people want to be safe and will choose not to ride when there are not consistent bike lanes. In addition, for those who are forced to ride with cars in traffic lanes because driving is just not a reasonable option for them, cars will have to slow down and take another lane to pass them, and it will make traffic worse. It's just common sense when you have bikers and cars sharing the traffic lane.\nSecond, it is very dangerous for bikers to ride in traffic lanes with cars, especially in downtown Toronto and during traffic time (which is most of time during the day). University and Bloor are two major lines that help bikers to ride north-south and east-west. They are widely used. They help to get bikers off other roads that do not have bike lanes. They are near the U of T and help students (who often don't have money to buy a car) to get to their class. Taking them off will force so many bikers to ride with cars and constantly worry about their life on the road. It is very irresponsible for the provincial government to choose travel time for those who can afford cars over life and safety of those who cannot afford cars.\nThird, driving is simply not an affordable option for most young people. I work as a lawyer at one of the Bay Street law firms with good salary, and frankly, I cannot afford living in Toronto AND having a car. The monthly lease payment, car insurance, parking and gas add up to $1,000 per month. I cannot afford spending so much money on a car while paying Toronto rent. That's why I give up my car when I moved back to Toronto from Ottawa last year. Now I don't have a car, biking allows me to still be able to get around the city. It's simply more affordable when I can bike instead of driving. And I cannot do this without consistent bike lanes, especially those on University, Bloor and Yonge.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto. I am a driver and a pedestrian. I am NOT a cyclist. That said, the cycle lanes NEED TO STAY.\nFirstly, spending millions of dollars to remove bike lanes already in existence in Toronto is absurd. It's a massive waste of public funds and will absolutely lead to the deaths of cyclists. Further, if all the reader of this comment cares about are cars and drivers, then please also understand that removing the cycles lanes will only lead to worse outcomes for city traffic. It will force those cyclists who no longer feel safe back into their cars, meaning more cars on the roads and therefore more traffic. And it will also force the remaining cyclists back into traffic with the cars, slowing car traffic as cars get stuck behind the cyclists or struggle to get around them. It will lead to cyclist deaths when cars get impatient and also more car-on-car collisions as drivers of huge SUVs misjudge how much space they have to get around.\nRemoving cycle lanes WILL NOT MAGICALLY MAKE CYCLISTS DISAPPEAR.\nSecondly, given the province's obsession with removing the cycle lanes that already exist, they should absolutely not be given the final say in whether or not communities are able to implement them. The province is clearly looking for the power to ban all cycle lanes. Communities should retain the power to make their streets safe in the way that is best for the community.\n"

This helps no one\n- makes traffic slower due to the construction of removing bikelane infrastructure, working against the goal\n- does NOT reduce the number of cyclists on the streets, just mixes them in with drives which is more annoying and less safe for both drivers and cyclists\n- does not improve traffic flow. Drivers have to give cyclists 100m of space on the road anyways. Removing the official bikelanes doesn't change that.\n"

        "comment": "These bike lanes keep me and my 3 and 4 year olds safe when I'm biking them through the city on the back of my bike. I've had a number of scary situations and now only feel comfortable biking with them if we are protect from cars on bike lanes. I won't bike with them on busy streets without a lane. These are important streets to get around in the city. I am WAY more likely to visit these neighbourhoods and local businesses if I can safety bike there with my family. If not, I don't feel safe and won't. Driving cars in these neighbourhoods is much more of a hassle for me and my family. Biking is free, better for the environment, way more fun, no parking, no paying... it's a no brainer. But only if safe!!\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to the removal of bike lanes, that are improving the transportation networks in Toronto. I  live, work and commute in the city of Toronto as a driver, a user of transit, a walker and a cyclist depending upon destination. The proposed changes will have a negative impact on me, and the future of Toronto as a growing city that requires more transportation options to support that growth. Recently, I have become a more frequent cyclist to destinations within the city, because of the availability of the dedicated cycle lanes.\nI am strongly opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable.\nBike lanes save lives. Dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collisions and fatalities by separating cyclists from motor vehicles. Toronto has seen too many tragic accidents, and removing these lanes would put more lives at risk. According to the City of Toronto\u2019s own reports, streets with bike lanes experience significantly fewer serious injuries and deaths.\nIn addition to safety, bike lanes support local businesses. Studies conducted along the Bloor Street bike lane show that retail sales increased after the lanes were installed. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses compared to drivers, and removing these lanes will hurt the economic vitality of these neighbourhoods.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are an essential tool in reducing traffic congestion. One less car on the road reduces gridlock for everyone. Encouraging active transportation through safe cycling infrastructure is a proven way to ease congestion and promote more efficient use of road space. Removing bike lanes will only increase car dependency and worsen gridlock, contradicting the bill\u2019s stated goal of improving mobility.\nI urge you to reconsider this damaging proposal. Removing bike lanes is not just a step backward for Toronto but a move that undermines the safety, economy, and livability of the city. Ontario should be expanding its cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\n"

If you want to improve traffic then why are you starting a project that will leave the city streets under construction for months? Please improve transit instead.\n"

You are basically passing a law that allows them to kill us. Sounds like an exaggeration but Toronto is one of the most dangerous cities where to bike and it's because of the poor education and its infrastructure. By taking the lanes you are telling us and them that we have no right to be on the road .\nI have had two accidents caused by driver being reckless on roads where there is to this day still no bike lanes . Our safety is at risk.\nRemember that cycling is better for our environment and for our health and for shops around us.\nI have two jobs, I wouldn't be able to have them if I couldn't cycle. As a cyclist I try to avoid main road but it's not always possible/ doesn't make much sense when the city is a grid. I use the bloor lanes every day, it isn't magical cause driver now don't pay attention at all and keep on turning without looking and cutting our lanes but it is better than having no lanes at all.\nYou should pass a bill to improve public transit and bike path - not removing them.\n"

        "comment": "**Opposition to Bill 212 and Highway 413 Act, 2024**\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. After careful consideration, it is clear that this legislation fails to address its stated goal of reducing gridlock while introducing significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and public health.\nHighway 413, which is exempt from environmental assessments under this bill, will destroy crucial Greenbelt lands, including wetlands and farmland. These areas are vital for flood prevention, carbon storage, and biodiversity. Environmental Defence has reported that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of this protected land, irreparably harming our ecosystem. Exempting a project of this scale from proper oversight undermines the integrity of Ontario\u2019s environmental protections.\nFurthermore, the removal of bike lanes contradicts well-established principles of sustainable urban planning. Bike lanes improve traffic flow, promote safer streets, and reduce emissions by encouraging active transportation. They also provide economic benefits, as demonstrated by increased retail sales along bike-friendly corridors in Toronto. Removing this infrastructure will lead to more congestion and undermine local economies.\nThe financial cost of Highway 413, projected at over $8 billion, is another cause for concern. This money could be better spent on public transit, healthcare, and affordable housing\u2014areas that provide far greater economic and social returns. In short, Bill 212 prioritises costly, outdated solutions over modern, sustainable alternatives.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation. Ontario\u2019s future depends on bold, forward-thinking investments that prioritise environmental stewardship, public health, and fiscal responsibility.\nSincerely,\n"

        "comment": "1. The Importance of Bike Lanes for Safety\n\"One of the biggest reasons bike lanes are essential is safety. In a city as busy as Toronto, cyclists face heavy traffic, and bike lanes provide a dedicated space for them. This separation from cars helps reduce accidents and makes cycling a safer option for people of all ages and experience levels.\"\n2. Encouraging More People to Cycle\n\"Bike lanes also encourage more people to choose cycling over other forms of transportation. When people feel safer, they\u2019re more likely to ride their bikes, which means fewer cars on the road, less congestion, and a healthier population. In fact, studies have shown that cities with good bike infrastructure see more people choosing this eco-friendly option.\"\n3. Environmental Benefits\n\"Cycling is a green form of transportation, and by making bike lanes accessible, we can reduce pollution in Toronto. Fewer cars mean cleaner air and a healthier city overall. Supporting cyclists with bike lanes contributes to our environmental goals and helps Toronto become a more sustainable place to live.\"\n4. Making Toronto a More Livable City\n\"Finally, bike lanes are important because they contribute to a sense of community. When we invest in safe and accessible spaces for all types of transportation, including biking, we create a more livable, inclusive city where everyone has the chance to get around safely and conveniently.\"\nConclusion:\n\"In short, bike lanes are essential for Toronto\u2019s safety, health, and sustainability. Let\u2019s continue to support and expand them to make Toronto a better place for all. Thank you.\"\n"

        "comment": "Premier - It is known worldwide that the answer to grid lock, as well as safety risks for pedestrians and cyclists is not to add more cars to the road, but to build better, cleaner, safer ways for people to move around the city.  Toronto and other cities in Ontario have been building cycling infrastructure and have plans to increase that to ensure increased safety, peace of mind for drivers, and to encourage more people to get out of their cars and take other forms of transit.  it is the way of the future for reasonable, progressive cities and countries around the world who care about their citizens, communities and the environment.  it is also the way of the world for cities who support small and medium size businesses, who as you know, are supportive of bike lanes and have continued to share positive news about the impact of bike lanes on their businesses.\nif you, Premier Ford, would like to invest millions of dollars in Toronto's road safety and efficiency, you should invest it in improving TTC, completing the Eglington LRT, promoting active transportation.  You should NOT invest millions of dollars to rip out new cycling infrastructure that i and my fellow tax payers have paid for, and you do NOT have our support to use our tax payer money to do so.\nMy blood, my friends, my kids blood will be on your hands Premier Ford, as emboldened anti-bike drivers continue to get more aggressive on the roads, with no protected lanes for us to ride.  It occurs to me that this is a premeditated act putting people in harms way....... I think there are laws against this, no?  What will your remarks be at the press conference after the next cycling death??\nI'll also point out that the bizarre attack on cycling infrastructure is so blatantly a distraction for the outrageously short sighted and heavy handed anti-future generation destruction of the Greenbelt, its bizarre.  It's confusing to me, and many other, that your team would willfully ignore science, experts, laypeople's opinions all for the sake of lining a few developers pockets with MY hard earned taxes.  Shameful.\nAs much as you have painted this as a lefty vs righty issue, it is not.  this is about the safety of our residents across the province, and future of our environment for our kids and theirs to come.  Please reconsider - there are very few people in your corner on this issue.\n"
