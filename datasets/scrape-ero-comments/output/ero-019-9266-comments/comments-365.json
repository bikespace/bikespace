        "comment": "I 100% support this bill to remove the bike lanes in the city of Toronto. I am a resident of Etobicoke around Bloor street west and I have seen the traffic situation here go from bad to worse in the last year due to the reduction in traffic lanes with the new bike lanes put in. Just this week I saw a fire truck stuck in traffic on Bloor west just west of prince edward drive (sirens blazing) as the traffic was at a standstill and the cars could not make space as it\u2019s single lane and the bike lanes barricaded. The fireman had to get down from his truck to manage the traffic and make space for his truck. And today I spent 15 mins to travel 200 meters on Bloor street down to south Kingsway. I hope the provincial government puts an end to this insanity!\n"

        "comment": "I wish to register my disapproval and complete disagreement with this proposal. The proposal to remove bike lanes, and to prevent the installation of new bike lanes, is not based on valid evidence about effective strategies to reduce traffic congestion. This proposal will also make bicycling transportation more dangerous for cyclists, leading to more injuries and deaths that can be avoided or minimized with protected bike lanes. Bike lanes help to ease vehicle congestion in the long term by increasing the availability of cycling and reducing the number of cars on the road. The proposal to remove or prevent new bike lanes from being installed is also detrimental to efforts to try and reduce human impacts on climate change. This proposal makes no sense and I am strongly against these measures.\nThe government should instead make housing more affordable so that people do not have to live so far away from their work or school, therefore reducing the need to commute by car for long distances, which leads to greater traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a resident of west-end Toronto. My transportation patterns have changed significantly since the introduction of bike lanes along Bloor. Instead of driving to a supermarket, I now bike along Bloor and pick up groceries from Snapper's Fish Market, Bloor Meat Market, Carload fruit and vegetable store, Meaty Eats deli, and other local businesses. I do this three to four times a week. When I'm meeting someone downtown, I bike from Jane and Bloor. It takes me 20 to 30 minutes, almost as fast as the subway and far faster than driving.\nI'm also a car driver. I have to take my kids to soccer practices and games all over the city four or five times a week. I don't like traffic jams either. But the traffic patterns on Bloor are only marginally different than they were before the introduction of bike lanes. Other roads with no bike lanes have gotten busier too -- the perennial congestion on the 401 and the Gardiner have nothing whatsoever to do with bike lanes. Tearing out millions of dollars of newly installed bike lanes isn't going to make a significant difference to anyone's ability to drive around the city without encountering traffic.\nI understand that people have different perspectives on the benefits of bike lanes. If the majority of people in Toronto didn't want bike lanes, I would have to accept that verdict. But that's not what happened. In the last election, anti-bike-lane candidates like Mark Saunders got less than ten percent of the vote. The people who live here - the majority of them, at least - want bike lanes.\nHow is it fair or reasonable for the province to arbitrarily force the city to remove these lanes? If the province had tried to force the city to build bike lanes when Doug Ford's brother was mayor, he would have been furious! I hope the premier will reconsider this poorly studied and arbitrary measure.\n"

        "comment": "Removing or not expanding infrastructure for bike lanes will not save time or reduce traffic. By doing this, you will be increasing traffic and time by forcing bikes to take up space on the roads. Therefore cars cannot get around bikes causing traffic to build up behind a bike as they typically move slower than cars do. It would be the same as saying \"we will remove sidewalks, forcing people to walk in the middle of the road to reduce tine and traffic\" when we all know it would not do that because people walk slower than other forms of travelling.\n"

        "comment": "This seems like a page taken from the gas guzzling 1970s. The reason there is gridlock is because there are too many cars now and not enough public transportation networks. European and Asian cities have more regional commuter train and bus networks. We should be building those instead of new highways that encourage more cars. The addiction is gasoline and in about 10 years all the major fuel retailers are going to be selling a lot less of it. So we will have built a highway for nothing, spending\u2026er giving money to Ford\u2019s buddies in construction. He\u2019s a man with yesterday\u2019s ideas.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThis proposed legislation to remove bike lanes is inappropriate, and using valuable taxpayer time and money to pursue this policy is grossly wasteful, callous and mean-spirited. No level of government, anywhere, should be removing, or proposing to remove bike lanes without an alternative cycling route available. The correct approach to cycling infrastructure is to make it safe, through separate routes, fully connected across all barriers, including across main streets, highways and railways, and to make Ontario's cycling network as extensive as possible, as quickly as possible. As someone who commutes by bicycle from Scarborough to downtown, using the University Avenue bike lanes, the proposal if implemented will negatively impact me by depriving me of a safe travel option. I have personally noted that the University Ave bike lanes are quite busy, so there are many other people this would impact. Additionally, Scarborough is severely lacking in safe, connected bicycle routes, and the proposed leglislation would make it more difficult to construct or install safe infrastructure, as Scarborough has very few through-running, continuous side streets. And the most direct route into downtown Toronto for me is along Danforth Rd, a busy main road, and to give another example, the CP rail line, running diagonally across Scarborough from Flemingdon Park to Rouge Park, does not have any safe cycling route, or any side street, crossing it between the East Don River and Highway 7. That is a barrier over 20 km long, and that, and other barriers, cause low uptake of cycling as a means of transport in Scarborough.\nAdditionally, I want to know what the goals of such legislation are, because the proposal will not improve traffic flow as desired. The results will instead resemble a congested main street, such as the current conditions of Eglinton between Weston and Dufferin. Such a policy has been attempted before, on Jarvis in 2011, and no improvement in journey times were noted; rather traffic got worse, less safe, and more congested.\n--J.S.\n(Scarborough Southwest)\n"

I have driven and cycled down roads that have protected bike lanes and roads that are two lanes with parking permitted at odd hours in the right lane and the roads with two lanes for cars are astronomically worse to drive and cycle on in this city. Removing the bike lanes will not advance Toronto, it will set us back until they are re-installed, and in the end taxpayers will just have paid for their installation twice\n"

Improving cycling infrastructure together with investing in public transit would make this make more sense but now the province is removing bike lines to allow safe cycling in the city for individuals. Where will we be putting the extra cars that result  from people deciding  to drive over cycling because they do not feel safe. This move is incredibly  shortsighted. Shame on the provincial government.  In addition  to increasing the chaos of traffic with this move by forcing more cars onto the road, they are decreasing the safety of people who want to cycle as their primary means of transportation.  This will lead to more deaths and injuries from cycling. Blood will be on the hands of decision makers.\n"

        "comment": "Rather than discouraging bike lanes, the province should be encouraging cities to install them.  Gridlock is caused by cars, and the solution to gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the road.  This can be done through a combination of improving public transportation and encouraging active transportation such as walking and biking.  Public transportation and active transportation use the road much more efficiently than cars do, and if the province wants to reduce gridlock, it should be encouraging people to walk, bike, and take public transit as much as possible, rather than driving their cars.  And it cannot encourage people to bike without providing the infrastructure for people to do so safely.  Therefore, if the goal is to reduce gridlock, then the province should be providing incentives to municipalities installing bike lanes, rather than putting up barriers by asking them to justify their installation.\n"

Perhaps the Premier might want to think about all the bikes that are currently using the bike lanes, using the regular car lanes. Bicycles generally do not go as fast as cars. This could increase the congestion, the very thing he is trying to fix. I, for one, will not hesitate to take up a complete lane in order that the cars have to go around me in order to keep myself safe.\n"
