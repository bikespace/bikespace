        "comment": "Reducing the need for car travel is better for health, the environment and public safety. Yet your divisive government continues to take this province back to the 1950's. While other major cities in the world see how unhealthy car culture is and promote and implement progressive ideas to get their population moving, allowing cities to thrive as safe, livable and healthy spaces for non-drivers (improved transit, congestion charges, emissions controls by limiting vehicles in city cores to improve air quality, pedestrianized areas to bring people out and help the local economy thrive, connected cycling networks for commuters and for those wanting to exercise, reduced (or removed) parking on major streets to allow more people to walk and cycle safely), your government is all about the car. With record numbers of cyclist and pedestrian deaths, the blood is on your hands. More cars equal a less livable city. Look longterm instead of trying to win votes in the short term. A healthy vibrant city does not exist when people are taking their lives in their hands when cycling and walking in their own neighborhoods, choking on emissions, while drivers become more unhealthy and obese by driving everywhere.\n"

Please do not remove the bike lanes that I use on a weekly basis. Otherwise I will have to take up a full lane of traffic for my safety or use a car which will contribute to more congestion!\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is dangerous to people lives. That should be reason enough to keep them. Other than that, they do not actually make congestion worse. What makes congestion worse, is the constant construction and influx of car-centric lifestyles and housing in condensed areas, without improvements to infrastructure like transit. It's also mind-blowing to take this already created infrastructure out having already spent money on it - and then spend MORE money taking it out. That makes no sense. As a local business owner, whose business enjoys the newly improved College Street lane, the very vast majority of my shoppers ride their bikes in or take transit. I am also a year-round cyclist, and love seeing families enjoying the lanes all year, with their kids safe in the lanes, and out of cars. It seems like this is one big distraction from actual issues that the Ford government is neglecting, and failing out. How dare they propose removing infrastructure when they cannot even get the Eglington LRT line finished. So corrupt, so senseless, so incendiary.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is simply culture war, wedge issue politics, and does not follow any fact, logic, or the decades of data from around the world.\nBike lanes save lives, and ripping up the ones installed will not make traffic worse. Traffic will only increase as more people choose to drive. Anyone that is not looking at actual facts, is simply ignoring science and known ideas based on countless studies from around the world. Ignoring facts and making a decision that will absolutely increase road deaths for zero gain.\nIf you are passing this legislation, you are essentially listening to gut, politics, and 'word on the street' beyond any kind of actual evidence. You will make life worse for a huge number of people that need more safe infrastructure.\nThe City of Toronto has published several studies that show expanding bike lanes has only a small impact on car commute times and next to no impact on emergency response times. Ridership has increased massively, and once the routes are more connected, places that haven't yet seen those same increases will undoubtedly see it. Make the right choice and cancel this legislation.\n"

The bike lanes keep us safe.\nI make sure that they have lights, wear helmets, ride respectfully and safely, but every time they grab their bikes to go to school, work or play. Every time I see them coming home after dark, I am terrified.\nThe bike lanes separate the road and ensure that they can't have a door opened on them or a car crash into them. They actively choose bike lanes on Bloor Street in particular because Dupont is way too dangerous.\nLook! I drive. I walk and I ride. I use every form of transportation to get around the city.  I know that congestion can be frustrating for everyone, but is is worth the life of one of our children?\nI BEG YOU! Please please please keep my boys safe. Bike lanes - esp on Bloor - do that for my family.\nToronto has come so far making Toronto safer for everyone. I hope that Ontario can 'stay in its lane' and let Toronto do what it needs to do to keep our roads less congested (you don't need two more cars on the road making it worse) and safer for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This bill, if passed, would endanger the lives of cyclists and it makes no economic sense.\nThere's only so much you can do to stay safe as a cyclist: take a defensive cycling course, keep your bike tuned, wear a helmet, and wear reflective gear and put lights on your bike when it's dark.\nHowever, this bill will make it harder for anyone to be a cyclist. Here are some of my stories about cycling safety.\nI hit some black ice in an underpass in early winter one year and fell off my bike. A car slowed down, rolled down the window, but rather than ask me whether I was okay, the driver yelled at me and said I was an idiot.\nAnother time, I saw a woman cyclist get knocked off her bike in front of me because a driver opened his door without looking. She was a grown woman but she cried because of the pain of the broken shoulder.\nI live five minutes from Ottawa City Hall, where a man was killed in broad daylight by a van crossing the bike path. It was eery knowing it could have been me or any of the hundreds of cyclists that use that route daily. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/guilty-plea-hit-and-run-death-cyc\u2026\nYou assume everyone has access to a car. The average annual cost of car ownership in Canada is $16,644. I live in downtown Ottawa, where half the people don't own a car. I'm a woman, and women are less likely to own a car.\nYour economic argument also doesn't make sense either. A study by The Centre for Active Transportation of Bloor Street in Toronto\u2014a section that Premier Ford wants to remove\u2014shows that when car parking was replaced by bike lanes, \u201cmonthly customer spending and number of customers served by merchants both increased.\u201d This is why the Bloor Annex Business Improvement Association has opposed Ford\u2019s legislation.\nThe removal of the lanes is plain wasteful. Sadly, wasteful transportation spending has become the norm for this government, which is advancing a $6\u2013$10 billion highway that will have little to no beneficial effect and recently expressed a desire to build a tunnel under Highway 401.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a frequent user of bike lanes, as are many of my friends and family members. Bike lanes make travel by alternative means than combustion engines more accessible and safe.\nIt is despicable that the Province of Ontario is prioritizing inefficient, dangerous, and high-carbon emitting transportation means rather than supporting transit options that are faster, promote health, promote environmental action, and overall create a stronger sense of community.\nWho do you think wins in a situation where is it a person on a bike vs a one tonne vehicle? By removing bike lanes, and making it harder for municipalities to add bike lanes, and are directly impacting the safety of Ontarians.\nHow many more lanes and roads do you think will solve traffic? The answer is none. Doug Ford needs to prioritize rapid public transit and alternative means such as bike lanes.\nSome key questions:\n- If bike lanes are causing so much traffic, than why do highways such as the 401 (where there are no bike lanes), experience so much traffic? (I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s not the bikes causing traffic)\n- What type of studies or scientific information is being used to make these decisions? (A quick google search offers a wide variety of academic articles that provide evidence that bike lanes only increase delays slightly)\n- how is induced demand being taken into account? (The proposal to add more room for cars, will in fact, just make sure there are more cars and more congestion in the area).\nThanks!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the bill, particularly the proposal to remove bike lanes from Yonge St. I am 71 years old, and recently retired. I have been using the Yonge St bike lanes since shortly after they were installed. I had always wanted to use a bicycle to get around from my place of residence, and for exercise, but was too frightened about cycling on Yonge St to do so. There is no north-south route from my home that does not involve using Yonge St for at least several blocks. As soon as the bike lanes were installed, I felt more confident and bought a bike. I have been using it regularly (in good weather!) since, for exercise and for errands, rather than using my car.\nMy opposition to the bill is not only out of concern for my personal health and safety but also deep concern about the general climate--related impacts of discouraging cycling in the city.  I believe that cycling safety and convenience are key for giving more people the option to reduce their use of the car.\n"

        "comment": "I object to the basic premise of this proposed legislation. Car drivers, which includes myself, are not inherently deserving of more resources in the form of space to permit us to drive more quickly to our destination. More lanes lead to induced demand, as more people choose to drive when they perceive more space is available for driving, causing any newly build infrastructure to quickly become clogged with traffic. Pedestrians, cyclist and transit should be given priority when considering infrastructure. It is more equitable to consider the needs of the population that use their own feet, bicycles or transit to commute. Many segments of the population do not have the option to drive due to age or economic reasons. The climate crisis also demands that we as a society focus on transportation modes that lessen our impact on the planet. Besides it's so much more fun to ride a bike than be stuck in traffic in a big metal box.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose any plan that would reduce bike lanes in Toronto. Without bike lanes riding a bike in the city becomes increasingly dangerous. Doing so will increase the injury and fatality rate for bikers. Too many cars, including Ubers and Lyfts are the problem. Ride services should be better regulated. Improving public transit is one of the best ways to encourage Torontonians to leave their cars at home. Adding bike lanes would encourage more people to ride. In addition removing bike lanes is a tremendous waste of money because when a more enlightened government comes into power in the future they will add bike lanes back, which will lead to more spending.

Every major city is taking the approach of installing more safe infrastructure to ease congestion, and decades of study show this to help.\nDo not take Ontario and Toronto backwards. Look to the evidence. Cancel bill 212.\n"

This area needs to be study relative to traffic flow.\nTraffic flows most of the time except during rush hour. Traffic is bad during rush hour on all of the major arteries in the area.\nHigher density with the building of many condos between is planned between 427 and Runnymede will only exasperate the traffic issue and will not be solved by removing the bike lane.\nProtected bike lanes have made biking and sidewalks significantly safer because bikes are no longer on the sidewalk and it has made biking safer.\nI do not want municipal or provincial money used to remove bike lanes because it takes some people longer a few minutes longer to commute in cars during rush hour.\nI also feel that the Province should purchase highway 407 instead of building highway 413.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill for two key reasons.\n1) I use the Bloor cycle lanes daily, to ride to and from work and to commute with my young children. This bike lane saves lives and reduces stress for both cyclists and drivers due to separating the two groups of people. I would not feel comfortable riding in the lane with my child if the lane is removed, and that is deeply unfair, as cars have access to their own lane. If the lane is removed, I will go back to taking the full lane as I ride which will impede cars regardless. This will also frustrate drivers and puts me at risk.\n2) I do not agree with the changes to expropriation rules in creating highways. We need more transit, more bike lanes, more connections, not more cars on roads.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Doug Ford and the Conservative Party,\nI am vehemently opposed to Bill 212 as it is exactly the opposite of what should be done. The mentioned bike lines should not be removed as there is a strong statistical fact based assessment showing their benefit to both biking safety, businesses, and traffic flow along these routes. There is no evidence suggesting that these and other bike lanes slow vehicular and EMS (and they have stated as much!) movement. Other major cities are only increasing their bike routes as they see the positive benefit to their cities, regarding health, safety, reducing carbon emissions, and traffic flow. We should not be going backwards on this issue! What causes traffic congestion is road, TTC, and building construction that obscures and blocks traffic lanes. Let's get these finished faster - particularly the TTC lines. The City of Toronto has conducted endless hours of real and serious research, not ones based on personal anecdotes or personal interest, that identifies where and when bike lanes should be established. Our Urban specialists know and understand the issues related to traffic flow within its jurisdiction. This is should not be based on Provincial partisan opinion, and the bias of this Bill is glaringly obvious that this is the case. No research has gone into this Bill whatsoever. The City alone should decide when and where bike lanes should be added based on qualitative and quantitative research. This Bill will only endanger more cyclists, a number in Toronto that is growing dramatically and will continue to grow as people see the benefits of this mode of transportation, and evident in the increase in the use of Toronto's Bike Share Programs. Traffic will be reduced when we invest more in Public transportation and alternative methods (ie: cycling, drive share etc).\nI write this not as over-enthusiastic cyclist looking out only for self interest, but as a citizen of the City of Toronto, a car owner and driver, a cyclist, a TTC user, and a pedestrian. Toronto streets need to be safe and efficient for all its users, and this Bill is not only costly financially (ripping out newly installed bike lanes is a ridiculous waste of our tax payers money), but is the exact opposite a progressive world class City like Toronto should be doing, let alone the Provincial Government. Please do not pass this Bill!!\n"

The city is currently gridlocked not because of lack of road but because lack of alternative transportation infrastructure, which includes bike lanes. More bikes lanes should be built to encourage cyclists and keep them safe.. often the the only way to get around the city is to use major roads, and riding on a major road without a separate bike lane is exceptionally dangerous. We need to look to the future for alternative ways of movement around the city.. not look back to the car centric 1950\u2019s\u2026 time to have forward thinking vision.. need to look to European city model, and ditch urban sprawl and the corresponding car centric thinking that goes with it.
