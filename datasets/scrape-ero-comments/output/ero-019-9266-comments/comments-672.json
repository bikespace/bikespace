        "comment": "I am totally opposed to the Ford government's initiative to remove/reduce bike lanes.  These not only  preserve the safety of cyclists, but encourage people to get out of their cars and travel by alternate means.  Removing bike lanes and moving bikes onto back streets simply does NOT work.  Those streets are full of stop signs at every corner. This makes cycling travel totally unworkable.   Cycling is not just a \"recreational activity\". It is a MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, which is as legitimate as cars. And should be respected as such.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 overlooks the serious issues causing gridlock in Toronto. These include construction of private developments and the construction of the Eglinton Line and the Ontario line by Metrolinx, the Ontario line being directed by the PC government. Strategies to alleviate the stresses caused by these activities have not been proposed.\nMoreover, the bill proposes destroying the cycling infrastructure before replacing it. Please put forward a plan for the replacement lanes prior to demolishing the existing lanes. To do otherwise jeopardizes the safety of cyclists.\nAdditionally, the City and Province should consider slopes and changes in elevations when proposing cycling infrastructure; the military street grid is not forgiving to cyclists travelling North and South and routes that moderate the slope for cyclists should be encouraged and need not be on major thoroughfares.\n"

        "comment": "There's a number of reason's that this proposal doesn't make sense for Ontario. First, it's a huge overreach of the provincial government to interfere with municipal planning. Years have gone into the planning process for bike lanes, consulting with the community, to determine what is best for each city. For the province to come in and say that they know better than all of the city stakeholders is ridiculous. It also shifts the focus away from things that are actually under the purview of the provincial government and implies that gridlock is caused by bike lanes, rather than chronic underfunding of public funding and mismanaging of highways. Adding an additional lane on Bloor, University, and Yonge will do little to impact the crazy gridlock seen on the 400 series highways. It also ignores the fact that by removing bikelanes, you're encouraging more cars to be on the road. More cars equals more traffic, not less. It also creates a more unsafe situation for people that bike. This legislation will lead to more injuries and potential road deaths. There's also the issue of cost. It's ridiculous that the provincial government waited until the bike lanes were completed before recommending pulling the cost. The city of Toronto has quoted an amount of 64 millions dollars ti accomplish this. That's 64 millions that could go towards transit, other road infrastructure, healthcare, and education. That also doesn't account for the cost that the city spent to install, nor the cost to potentially install bikelanes elsewhere in the city.\n"

        "comment": "The Bloor bike lane is always getting great use, and moving faster than the cars. You can walk faster than the cars are moving. An extra lane of traffic isn't going to fix that. It doesn't make any sense to remove them and it's a waste of city funds. The expense alone of removing existing biking infrastructure is unjustified.\n"

        "comment": "Why do we always go one step forward and 2 steps back. Biking is a carbon friendly mode of transportation that is cheaper in the long run. Cities are about liability and car mobility. Improve public transit and encourage the use of the same. Grid lock is a result of personal entitlement by everyone, as the rules of the road are flouted and a daily basis. Bill 212 is overreach by the provincial government and a stupid plan. Get the Eglinton crosstown working now!\n"

Bike lanes reduce traffic by increasing alternate methods of transportation. People are just now starting to feel safe using these separate bike lanes and rider ship is only increasing, which reduces the amount of cars on the street. The craziest thing is that anyone complaining about thisseems to always forget to mention the hundreds of thousands of new people every year in Toronto the issue wasn\u2019t bike lanes. It\u2019s that more and more people are trying to drive into the city when it\u2019s not necessary.\n"

Electric bike open the door for more bike riders of all ages, and safe and plentiful bike lanes is how we motivate people to leave the car behind.\n"

The number of people using bikes has vastly increased, and their safety is much less at risk where there are bike lanes, rather than roads where the bikes are in traffic lanes.\nFurther, encouraging more use of bicycling contributes to the reduction of fossil fuel emissions, excessive use of electricty to charge e cars, and they increase exercise opportunities for those who use bicycles as a primary means for transportation in the city.\nGiven the vast amount of automobile traffic, anything that helps to reduce it is a positive thing for a city\n"

        "comment": "I hope that many other Ontarians will join me in voicing our disapproval of Bill 212.\nThe issue of provincial overreach into municipal jurisdiction (bike lanes) is concerning and has been widely reported in the news. What is a much bigger concern though, is the other 27 pages of the bill that clearly lay out the provincial government's plan to exempt \"priority highway projects\" including highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, the Access to Information Act, and to deny procedural fairness to any Ontarians unlucky enough to be affected by the construction of these misguided projects.\nWhat, if anything, is the point of having an Environmental Assessment Act if the provincial government can simply ignore these statutes when it deems the project a \"priority\"? Your constituents trust you to do everything in your power to ensure that they have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and viable lands in which to grow crops and enjoy nature. I urge you to take this responsibility seriously.\nThe Information and Privacy Commisioner has addressed access to information exemptions proposed in the Bill in her letter, which I've linked. I agree and urge our lawmakers to reconsider.\nI am particularly disturbed by the callousness with which the provincial government intends to conduct expropriations in the interest of rushing to build these highways. This bill, if enacted, would require Ontarians whose property is deemed necessary to build these highways to vacate their property within 90 days, and offers no process for appeal nor leniency on timelines. This draconian methodology is not how Ontario taxpayers expect to be treated by a government that claims to have their best interests in mind.\nLastly, I wish to make it clear to our elected representatives that the people of Ontario are not fooled by the title of this bill. We know that the proposed infrastructure projects will not reduce gridlock nor save anyone time. Highway 413 will be then next highway 407: a costly taxpayer-funded project that will be sold to a private entity at a massive loss and that will go largely unused because no one will want to pay the ridiculously high tolls that will be imposed. Tearing up bike lanes will not reduce gridlock in the city of Toronto nor anywhere else. It will do the opposite.\nI firmly believe that our current government knows that there are better ways to move people through major metropolitan areas, but they are looking for easy wins. These highways won't be completed before the next provincial election but they may be started whereas expansions of train networks that would actually have a positive effect would still be in the distant future by election time (especially if environmental assessments are done properly).\nDo the right thing folks. Be honest with your voters, abandon costly and useless highway projects and start building infrastructure that supports high quality, economically and environmentally sustainable modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "This is the stupidest piece of legislation tabled within the past 150 years.  Bikes cause congestion? Nobody in the Ford government is stupid enough to believe that, but they are banking on the idea that voters are just stupid enough to swallow it whole.\nCongestion is cars. Period.  You want less congestion?  You have to reduce the number of people driving cars.  That means more transit, more bike lanes, more alternative forms of transportation overall.  Not to mention more walkable cities.  But all that takes brains and effort.  You'd rather adopt idiotic, tribal solutions that satisfy your voters' craving for red meat than do anything to actually confront the problem.\nThat you are willing to kill any number of cyclists to attract the votes of car-choked suburbs is despicable.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is out is step with moving forward to develop climate friendly, sustainable cities. The provincial government is stepping out of their responsibilities of a provincial governing body and creating  a culture war between people who drive and people who ride bicycles. Bike lanes do not cause congestion, they offer a safe option for people who ride bicycles to ride for pleasure, ride to run errands, ride to commute, or ride as a mode of work (couriers etc.) instead of travelling by car or on transit (that could also be improved across the province). Traffic is caused by vehicles with single occupants (most of the time unless your are the Premier and have a driver), essentially people in their cars create the traffic that makes it difficult to get around Toronto (this is about Toronto), it's not the cyclists you can't see who have passed the cars and arrived at their destinations first.\nBanning, tearing out, and preventing bike lanes from being installed will end up killing people, 6 people have already died in the last year, 5 on streets without a bike lane, and one on a street with a blocked bike lane.\nThe proof that bike lanes work has been established by the numerous studies that were conducted. the proof that cyclists spend more money that drivers on their routes has been established by numerous studies. the proof that people who ride bicycles are more empathetic was also determined in a recently published study.\nRemoving bike lanes will not save time or money. It will take months to remove the lanes and cost an estimated 48 million dollars! And frankly, I am not interested in the hard earned tax dollars of our province being spent to remove the thing that paid for the installation of them in the first place. Additionally, the gridlock that will come from construction on major transportation arteries  will be ridiculous and likely last longer and result in more accidents and possible deaths due to the unsafe road conditions construction always causes. And when it's all said and done, no time will be saved - the road will still be congested with cars.\nIf you build it, they will come. More roads = more cars, but more safe cycling infrastructure = more people riding their bikes (and not in cars or crowded lame transit).\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal, especially for those of us living in downtown Toronto. The priority must be to return to mass, 'low volume' transportation. And by low volume, I mean physically low volume. For example, most cars on the road have one person in them, and yet they take up, what about 8 cubic metres? A bike takes up 1, and considering a bus or a streetcar even half full, means that each person in there is taking up about 1 or 2. Just as we are moving toward more dense housing, because it makes more sense in an urban environment, we need to move toward more dense people-moving. Thus, reduce the physical volume of the vehicle transporting the person.\nReducing gridlock and saving us time actually means: funding the TTC so it can run regularly, inexpensively and reliably. Build more bike lanes, not less, and separate them from traffic so that both bicyclists AND drivers feel safer. Reduce the amount of cars in the downtown core by incentivizing carpooling.\nPeople say, 'I never see people in the bike lane'. Well, aside from the true statistics of downtown Toronto where about 1 in 5 people regularly commute to work on a bike, the fact is that bikes are not in the lane for long, because travel is so much faster in the bike lane. We take up less room, move faster than cars and are an answer to smog, pollution and most importantly, climate change.\nThis is a wrongheaded move, not only because of policy, but also because it is OUTSIDE of Ford's jurisdiction. He has no right telling a community how they should manage their municipal affairs, or their transportation. It's an overreach and an attempt to pit people against one another - drivers vs cyclists. I've been there, it's not pretty.\nAs a final note I would like to add that two wheeled vehicles have every right to take up an entire lane. Therefore, imagine what the streets of Toronto will be like when delivery guys, skateboarders, bicyclists, electric scooterists and the assorted new modes of cheap fast urban transport compete with cars for lane space. Not only will there be more accidents, but it will slow traffic considerably. I rode my bike in downtown Toronto since 1989, when I would chop down my handlebars so I could squeeze between cars. I don't want those days to come again, but if they do, car drivers will be more miserable about it as they swerve around low-volume vehicles than they are now about separated bike lanes.\n"

Instead of wasting time and money on this, I would ask that you please commit those resources to something that *builds* this province, not something that wastes my tax dollars.\n"
