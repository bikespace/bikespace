The bike lanes were installed with a plan in mind. With climate change events (storms, flooding etc) it makes sense to try to encourage Torontonians to not rely on cars and instead provide safe alternatives (such as using bikes on a bike lane). I disagree with removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. To better move people around, the provincial government should support municipalities in prioritizing other methods of transit instead of cars on highways and in cities. Building more roads/lanes will mean more congestion and car pollution, and the provincial government should avoid inciting this induced demand. Because of this added pollution, the environmental regulations for any new highways are mandatory to ensure that Ontario's natural ecosystems remains intact and protected.\nAdditionally, the provincial government should not remove bike lanes in cities, which are under the municipal governments' jurisdiction. The provincial government should avoid interfering with municipalities' jurisdictions for their own urban design, and instead focus instead on their own jurisdiction. The provincial government should not add more red tape and bureaucracy for cities which want to make improvements for their citizens by building new infrastructure. Removing existing infrastructure in municipalities is certainly not the best use of the provincial government's time and resources.\nBike lanes are beneficial for everyone; they are essential transportation infrastructure. Building and maintaining dedicated bicycle infrastructure improves many qualities of life, including road safety, road use and congestion, public transit use, businesses and the local economy, and the health of citizens (promoting an active lifestyle) and the environment (limiting the number of cars and their pollution on the road).\nThe fast-growing population of Ontario means not everyone can or should be driving. When alternative solutions are made available (bike lanes but also trains, buses, subways, etc.) then everyone benefits - people will have more safer, healthier and more enjoyable options in their travel.\nThank you!\n"

        "comment": "I think this is an overreach of provincial authority, I do not want the provincial government, particularly Doug, to have control over the construction and maintenance of bike lanes in my city, Kitchener. Furthermore, the justification used is not sound. Removing bike lanes would result in more bikers driving, likely contributing more to congestion. It also forces people to purchase cars, but then again, maybe that's what is desired by Doug.\nFurthermore, I am not confident in highway 413s ability to significantly reduce congestion especially when accounting for the financial and environmental cost. Due to the phenomenon of induced demand it is likely that highway  413 will also become congested as more people will opt to drive. A better alternative would be to invest in better public transport between the cities. Mass transport will always be far more efficient than driving.\nIn fact, after writing this, I wouldn't be surprised if this had a net negative effect on congestion as it will lead to more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is such a depressing motion to put forward and lacks foresight and optimism about our future. It's been proven time and again that the key to reducing gridlock is to reduce the amount of cars on the road. This is not complicated to understand. This proposal denies reality. It denies the reality that the dominance of the automobile IS the problem. It denies the reality that bike lanes keep us safe. It denies the reality that we absolutely need to encourage people to use healthier and greener forms of transport. This proposal denies us of a bright future and denies us of a city worth living in.\nI repair bicycles professionally, and many of my customers are families who have embraced cargo e-bikes to haul their kids, groceries, etc around the city. This is more economical, enjoyable, healthy, and faster than using a vehicle. This is the future that I want, and it's the future that we need to embrace. This is not really new or revolutionary. It's practical and it's a mode of transport that is used with great success across the world. The secret to reducing gridlock is to get on a bike.\nI object this bill completely.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212. Adding more highways is not an effective way to reduce traffic and if it were, the methods that the bill proposes to expedite this process are not in the best interest of Ontario citizens.  I oppose to it very strongly and call on the government of Ontario to instead build more bike lanes, better fund public transport and prioritize building railways and passenger trains. Citizens that cycle as transport should be better protected. Cheap, reliable rail transport between major cities is a far superior  method of reducing traffic on highways and reducing commute times. I would especially like to note that no highway, including highway 413, should be exempt from the environmental assessment act. Canada's biodiversity and ecosystems are some of the greatest things about this country and I believe that skipping environmental protections for a highway goes against Canadian values. I urge the government of Ontario to helps its people and its wildlife by refusing to pass this bill.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes to add additional processes for implementing bike lanes and aims to remove some existing bike lanes in Ontario. As both a cyclist and a driver, I believe this bill would be detrimental to urban mobility, safety, and quality of life in our communities.\nFirstly, I urge the government to reduce, not increase, red tape and bureaucracy in the implementation of bicycle infrastructure. Adding more processes will only hinder cities' abilities to install bike lanes where they are needed. This will impede efficient and responsive urban planning that meets the evolving needs of our communities.\nAs a regular cyclist, I can attest to the fact that bicycle lanes allow me to reach my destinations quickly and economically. Removing existing bike lanes or making it harder to implement new ones will negatively impact my daily commute and that of many others. This could lead to increased traffic congestion and higher carbon emissions in our cities.\nSafety is paramount, and bike lanes provide an essential level of protection for cyclists of all ages, including children. Removing these lanes or making them harder to implement puts vulnerable road users at risk. Moreover, bike lanes create a buffer between pedestrians and vehicular traffic, enhancing safety for all. The traffic-calming effect of bike lanes contributes to safer streets for everyone, and we should be expanding, not reducing, this infrastructure.\nFrom a driver's perspective, I find that dedicated bike lanes greatly simplify interactions with cyclists on the road. When cyclists have their own space, it eliminates the need for drivers to navigate around them in shared lanes, reducing stress and potential conflicts for all parties involved. Removing bike lanes would make roads more challenging and potentially dangerous for both drivers and cyclists.\nIn conclusion, I strongly oppose Bill 212 and its potential to create less safe, less efficient, and less sustainable transportation networks in Ontario. By hindering the installation of bike lanes and removing existing ones, we risk the well-being of our communities and move away from efficient, healthy and prosperous cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and instead focus on policies that promote and expand safe cycling infrastructure in our province.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Construction causes many traffic delays so I don't support removing existing bike lanes.  At the same time, I agree with the proposal to not create new bike lanes without provincial approval where a lane of traffic is being removed.  I want cyclists to be safe.  We must however acknowledge that removing lanes of traffic for bikes does slow down vehicular traffic.  This was definitely the case in Toronto on Dundas St. E.  The design of bike lanes also is very important.  On Danforth Avenue, for example, the bike lanes are excellent since going from the centre of the road to the right you have the traffic lane, parked cars and then the bike lane.  The cars are well separated from the bikes for everyone's safety.  You do not have bikes continuously weaving in and out of the bike lane creating dangerous situations for everyone.   We also need to enforce the vehicle laws for cyclists.  Cyclists should not be moving to go through the intersection when the walk signal goes up in Toronto.  They are a vehicle and must wait until the light changes green.  This needs to be enforced.  Cyclists should not be driving in the bike lane and then ride their bike through the crosswalk as a pedestrian.  They are a vehicle not a pedestrian.\n"

        "comment": "Opposition to Ontario Bill 212: Prioritizing Safe and Sustainable Transportation\nI am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several compelling reasons. This legislation's proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\nHistorical Lessons: Removing Bike Lanes Does Not Ease Congestion\nToronto's own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city's own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic-precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes asa means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\nPublic Health and Safety Risks\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees-all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nPromoting Sustainable and Multimodal Transportation\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creatinga livable, accessible city for alI residents.\nAlternative Investments for the Greater Good\n Rather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents' quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban Commuters and drivers.\nConclusion: A Step Backwards for Ontario\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario's cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\n"
