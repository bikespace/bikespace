        "comment": "I strongly oppose Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several key reasons. The bill's proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by a large history of strong evidence. Rather than alleviating gridlock, this approach could worsen the situation, compromising public safety and undermining efforts toward sustainable urban development.\nToronto\u2019s experience with similar measures demonstrates why this approach is likely to fail. In 2011, the city removed bike lanes from Jarvis Street in an effort to improve traffic flow. However, data showed that the removal actually resulted in longer travel times and slower traffic. This serves as a clear example that removing bike lanes does not reduce congestion but can instead worsen traffic conditions and encourage more car dependency, further straining road infrastructure. Also, adding in more car lanes also worsens traffic. This is a known fact.\nEliminating bike lanes poses significant risks to cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Studies have shown that the absence of dedicated bike lanes leads to higher rates of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents place additional burdens on healthcare systems, emergency services, and legal resources\u2014costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. Maintaining and expanding bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also a cost-effective strategy for reducing long-term public health expenditures.\nEffective urban planning must prioritize sustainable, multimodal transportation options that reduce car dependency. Bill 212 undermines this goal by cutting back on infrastructure for walking, cycling, and public transit. As cities worldwide invest in green policies and expand bike lanes, Ontario risks falling behind in fostering an environmentally responsible and accessible urban environment. A shift toward more sustainable transportation is essential for creating livable cities for all residents.\nRather than dismantling vital infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that provide lasting benefits for all Ontarians. Allocating resources toward healthcare, education, and public transit improvements would not only address the root causes of congestion but also enhance the quality of life for residents. These forward-thinking investments would do far more to ease traffic and improve public well-being than a temporary fix that caters primarily to suburban drivers. Bike ridership is \u201clow\u201d because half of the bike lanes aren\u2019t connected or finished in Toronto. If you build better infrastructure, more people will use it, and they take up way less space than cars. We should be thinking of people first not cars first.\nBill 212 represents a setback for Ontario\u2019s urban development and its future sustainability. Truly effective urban planning prioritizes safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can promote a safer, more accessible transportation system that supports all modes of travel and contributes to a cleaner, greener environment. Ontario needs policies that foster a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents, not one that favors short-term, car-centric solutions.\n"

        "comment": "While it may make intuitive sense at a surface level, removing bike lanes or preventing their inclusion to maintain car lanes is an extremely shortsighted, misguided approach that can lead to significant negative consequences. The Ontario Highway Traffic Act clearly states that bicycles are entitled to use the roads, so eliminating a safe space for bikes will only serve to put people riding bikes in danger when they share road space with speeding cars. Prioritizing cars over cyclists compromises safety,forcing cyclists to share the road with faster, larger vehicles, increasing the risk of collisions. Many jurisdictions around the world have shown again and again that \"induced demand\" is a real effect. Simply adding more car lanes doesn't reduce congestion. Instead, it leads to increased traffic as more people choose to drive. There are far more cars in the GTA than what the city can sustain in terms of volume. Create more lanes, more cars will move in to use the space and congestion increases. Bike lanes, on the contrary, promote sustainable transportation, reduce congestion, reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality. Bike lanes also encourage physical activity, benefiting public health and reducing health care costs. By investing in bike infrastructure, cities can create a more sustainable, equitable, and healthy transportation system for all.\nListen to the experts! Look at other jurisdictions around the world. There is a TON of evidence showing that bike lanes REDUCE congestion. This a selfishly motivated, misguided initiative.\n"

        "comment": "I think this is a bad proposal.\nThe province has many urgent issues on which it should be focusing (affordable housing, healthcare, long-term care, education, etc.). There is no need to add more things to the province's plate right now, especially when municipalities are fully capable of overseeing and managing the development or removal of bike lanes within their jurisdictions.\nThis proposal is, in essence, anti-democratic, as it unnecessarily limits municipalities' ability to manage their own affairs effectively.\nIt is also not clear that the removal of bike lanes or the halting of their development will actually lead to significant decongestion of city streets; research, in fact, suggests the opposite.\nStudies, moreover, indicate that bike lanes are actually good for business and increase property values because they make neighbourhoods and local businesses more accessible rather than less accessible.\nThe cost of removing existing bike lanes is therefore a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, which is not worth whatever benefits it might bring about since research suggests that these benefits are likely negligible.\nMore worrying, though, is the fact that this proposal will remove from city streets existing infrastructure that currently keeps both motorists and cyclists safe while also supporting and encouraging an affordable and environmentally conscious form of transportation.\n"

This proposal is pointless interference with local municipal affairs and will do little if anything to improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of these key bike lanes would disconnect the already meagre bike lane network that the City of Toronto offers to its tax-paying residents. Previous incidents of removing bike lanes to improve gridlock have proven to not aid in congestion. In fact, increasing available bike lanes across the city would allow for citizens to feel safer biking, reducing the amount of people who would otherwise drive their car and increasing bike usership.\n"

        "comment": "When visiting Montr\u00e9al recently, I found myself biking constantly. I never felt the need to call an Uber as I was able to use a combination of biking, public transit, and walking to get to my destination. Being a 15m walk from a subway station here in Toronto, I typically take a car or walk to the subway. I enjoy biking. It is good for my health and it is much faster than walking and sometimes public transit. Would I bike in Toronto? Yes. Do I feel safe using my bike to get to a further destination such as downtown? No. As my neighborhood has very minimal bike lanes, I don\u2019t feel safe competing with a heavy metal vehicle going much faster than me. Bike lanes, especially those that have a physical barrier between the car and the cyclist, provide encouragement for the cyclist to cycle, rather than resorting to using a car and adding to congestion. To level up the city of Toronto, I would suggest that the network of existing bike lanes should be improved and expanded, and certainly not removed. Biking promotes a happier and healthier city, gets more people out of their cars, reducing traffic, and would allow for citizens of many income levels to have a simple commute.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes has significant negative consequences, making streets less safe for cyclists, who are then forced to share lanes with cars, increasing accident risk. It discourages eco-friendly transportation, leading to more car dependency, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Additionally, the absence of bike lanes reduces opportunities for physical activity, impacting public health, and hurts local economies, as bike-friendly areas often see increased business and tourism. Furthermore, bike lanes provide equitable transportation options, especially for those who cannot afford cars, so their removal limits accessibility and makes cities less inclusive. Overall, bike lanes are crucial for safer, healthier, and more sustainable urban living.\n"

People will continue to cycle on these roads without the protection of bike lanes and more will die.\nBike lane infrastructure supports a healthy city. These lanes provide a safe, reliable, consistent route in and out of the downtown core as an alternative to driving.\nIt is very difficult to cycle through the city without a consistent network of lanes. Without these lanes, More cars will be on the roads adding to gridlock.\nThis is yet another of Doug Ford's archaic and self interested policies.

        "comment": "As a resident of University Avenue, I am absolutely appalled at the proposal to remove the bike lanes established just months ago. I endured the extensive construction process, which was disruptive and costly. To tear down this infrastructure now is not only a slap in the face to taxpayers but a complete waste of time, money, and resources.\nThese bike lanes, aside from improving safety, actually helped reduce congestion. I primarily drive, but having access to safe biking lanes encouraged me to bike more, which, in turn, means one less car on the road and a smoother commute for everyone. Eliminating these lanes would discourage people from choosing alternative, eco-friendly transportation, increase traffic, and contribute to pollution and noise. It\u2019s baffling that after such a major investment, we\u2019re considering removing a resource that benefits all road users.\nPlease reconsider this shortsighted decision. Let\u2019s prioritize long-term, sustainable infrastructure solutions over wasteful backtracking.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s proposed framework that would mandate the removal of bike lanes on key streets in Toronto, as well as potentially other existing bike lanes across the province. While I understand the government's focus on reducing gridlock and improving the flow of motor vehicle traffic, this proposal fundamentally undermines efforts to create more sustainable, equitable, and safe transportation options in our cities. In addition, it would be an irresponsible use of public funds and distracts from other measures that may reduce traffic in a more sustainable manner.\nBike lanes are vital for ensuring the safety of cyclists, especially in busy urban areas. These lanes provide a designated, protected space for cyclists, reducing accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, and minimizing overall traffic-related injuries. Removing bike lanes will put cyclists at greater risk and undermine public confidence in biking as a safe, viable mode of transport. As a driver, bike lanes provide me with a tremendous amount of comfort. Even when both driver and cyclist are driving carefully, unexpected accidents may occur, and the separation that the bike lanes provide could very well be what saves the life of a cyclist in the event of an accident.\nThe proposed review process and criteria for the removal of bike lanes also lacks clarity and transparency. The reliance on a set of criteria to be developed in future guidance or regulations raises concerns about the consistency and fairness of the decision-making process. Municipalities and local communities should have a clear, transparent say in any changes to existing infrastructure. The decision to remove bike lanes should not be made solely by the provincial government without the meaningful input of the communities most impacted by these changes, including cyclists, pedestrians, and local residents.\nThe government\u2019s emphasis on expanding highways and removing bike lanes fails to address the root causes of urban congestion. Adding more vehicle lanes is a short-term solution that could exacerbate long-term congestion and pollution, while also further encouraging car dependency. In a city like Toronto that is quickly growing, measures that address the core causes of congestion is needed. In only a number of years, any improvement that could potentially result from removing a bike lane may be lost simply as a result of the number, location and nature of residential developments in the city. In addition, the significantly increased safety risk that would be present as a result of a bike lane being removed may incentivize more residents to drive or resort to taxis/ride shares, resulting in increased congestion once again.\n"

        "comment": "Bike infrastructure is fundamental to the urban transportation system. Removing bike lanes does not improve traffic, but instead forces more people into cars further clogging up the roads, while forcing cyclists to dangerously mix with traffic or pedestrians.\nShouldnt drivers want cyclists to be separated from driving lanes? this lets the cyclists stay out of the way to improve traffic flow. Should pedestrian paths also be removed for car space?\nCycling is a very space-efficient method of transportation. Moving 100 cyclists down the road requires far less space than is required for moving 100 car passengers (likely requiring 70 cars).\nFurther, street designs and local infrastructure meddling by the provincial government is simply government overreach, increasing red tape and bureaucracy.\n"

The province's desire to overreach into municipal affairs is a mystery.  Why spend money (apparently $48M) to remove existing infrastructure?\n2.  As a life long bicycle commuter (more than 50 years), the bike paths on University, Yonge and Bloor Streets make my life - and those of other cyclists - safer.\n3.  All government levels should be encouraging healthier design into our cities so people can ride and walk more easily.  Most urban trips are less than 5 km and can easily be done by bicycle, providing cyclists feel safe.\n4.  Your data about bike lane use is flimsy at best.  Come with me on a downtown bike path and you will see it full of commuters, food deliverers and couriers.\n5.  Transportation is the 2nd highest producer of GHG emissions.  Why are you encouraging more internal combustion engine car use?  (And believe me - I see this every day - it is normally one person per car in downtown Toronto.) Climate change is happening now and everyone should be helping control greenhouse gas emissions.\n"
