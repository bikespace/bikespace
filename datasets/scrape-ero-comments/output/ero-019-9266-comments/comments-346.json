        "comment": "I would like to point out to the Ministry that bike lanes on the streets mentioned: Bloor, Yonge and University use lane space NOT designated for travel, that is, the lanes designated for parking. Parking is by definition, NOT TRAVEL. Those should remain, as removing them will not return lanes for travel.\nThe removal of those lanes would not increase the number of lanes available, as those lanes are used for parking.\nI do drive, take transit, walk and cycle in Toronto. I do not believe bike lanes are the cause of congestion. Stand on the sidewalk and look at the vehicles passing by - 90% - are single occupants. People are driving, AND I AM CERTAIN that they have alternatives.\nSome of the things that should be looked at are uncontrolled delivery services such as Lyft and Uber. People have not returned to the transit system after the pandemic to their previous numbers. The Province should invest in public transit, add routes or arranging for companies to use private shuttles. A construction site should not need lots of parking for its workers. It can provide a shuttle from the subway, or something like that. The province should encourage solutions.\nIt is an unnecessarily divisive choice to remove bike lanes environmentally. The bike lanes do not contribute to air pollution. Commuting by car DOES. The province is not helping people get into hybrids or electric vehicles, so any increase in car travel by measures by the province will increase pollution.\n"

You are elected to represent all of Ontario, even Toronto cyclists.\nAs an aside, my aging Muskoka parents will not vote Conservative if you spend Ontario tax dollars threatening the lives of their grandson and son-in-law. They have always voted for you but will not if this passes.  The mismanagement of money to put citizens at risk infuriates them.\n"

        "comment": "No!!! No no no. Removing bike lanes is absolutely ridiculous. Do your research, more cycling infrastructure means LESS gridlock. Adding more car lanes INCREASES cars and INCREASED gridlock. This is insanity. Look up what Robert Moses did in New York in the 30-50s, a pro car nightmare that is being unraveled more than 70s years later. Please don\u2019t do this. I\u2019m a parent and car driver and bike lanes make driving safe for everyone. This proposal is non sensical and spiteful and you won\u2019t win. You will just radicalize everyday people like me and we will all be protesting in the streets. Traffic sucks, but it must be solved with public transit and cycling and walking infrastructure. Do your research.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford and his government should focus their attention on condos that are being built and then abandoned by their developers, the gridlock related to trying to get building permits to build coach / laneway houses and garden suites, the failure to keep safe injection sites opening leading to more crime on the streets and open drug use of controlled substances and unhoused people in parks and in empty businesses, and the inability for people to get proper health care because there are not enough family doctors.  Focusing on the removal of bike lines is a joke and a ruse.  What should be happening is an increase to public transit, subsidies for those who want to buy electric vehicles (cars, bikes and scooters) and offering incentives for people who choose to cycle.\n"

        "comment": "Do not rip out these bike lanes. Visit any European city and you will see how bike lanes make cities better: more accessible, less crowded, less polluted. Transit in Toronto is miserable. Traffic was impassible long before bike lanes became an issue; most of the bad congestion is caused by construction and too many cars and large trucks on the road. Bike is by far the best way to navigate Toronto -- which, on this November 1, is around 10 degrees Celcius, putting a lie to the argument that the city is only cycleable for a limited time of the year.\nYou won't waive the toll for trucks on the 407, so your government is not serious about managing traffic. You have chosen to target bike lanes because they are politically convenient for you. And thousands of Toronto residents who care about this city are TIRED of this government wasting tax money and meddling in municipal affairs it has no legal right to dictate. DOUG FORD IS NOT THE MAYOR OF TORONTO.\nIt is difficult to imagine a government with less integrity. May you be held responsible for every dollar your burn. For shame.\n"

        "comment": "I am a suburban driver who works in the city of Toronto. I believe this bill is regressive, short sighted, and I do not support it.\n1. Cyclist fatalities- It is simply not acceptable. The majority of cyclists are our young - youth and adults. Their deaths are a tragedy and loss of the contribution they could make to society.\n2. As a cosmopolitan city, Toronto with bike lanes has an opportunity to evolve for the needs of future generations. For many, it is simply not affordable to pay rent, food, transit. Bikes are a cost effective.\n3. Many businesses are located along University, Bloor and the other main roads. Removing bike lanes is a major obstacle in getting to work safely.\n4. Tourism - LOCAL as well as from outside the city. Because the city is not safe for cycling, suburbanites avoid bringing their bikes down to enjoy the city. Toronto has so many great communities, and bike lanes will widen the range of attractions for tourists, strengthening local economy.\n5. Growing pains- any major change requires time for adjustment in design and mindset. It is way too early before even maximum adoption to make changes.\n6. Further the province is removed from the city and not best government entity to support the needs of the residents of Toronto who look to the city.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to state what is obvious and factual. The Province's proposed legislation (Bill 212) flies in the face of all research on gridlock and urban planning to reduce carbon emissions. The rationale for Bill 212 is full of misinformation which is indefensible given the climate catastrophe that confronts humanity. 1) Building more highways is like building more bike lanes - \"build them and they (users) will come\". More users of bike lanes is the direction supported by climate research. More users of roads takes us in a direction that is environmentally unsustainable. The gridlock urban centres in the province are facing currently is not due to bike lanes, it is due to the failure over the last two decades to plan for and take the necessary action to provide commuters with effective public transportation alternatives to driving individual vehicles - both into the city and between urban centres in the province. Our gridlock is also due to the Eglinton Crosstown debacle and decades of provincial and city public transit debates and delays. 2) Because our population is expanding we need more, not fewer transportation options since we simply cannot sustain the same vehicle growth per capita no matter how many highways and vehicle lanes we add to infrastructure. The Ministry itself admits that opening the 407, a highway that should never have been sold to a private consortium, would be overfilled in ten years. This will be true of any highway we build.\n3) We know that accidents and quality of life for Ontarians is actually improved with bike lanes because people ride bikes regardless of whether there are bike lanes or not. Those who live along bike lane routes, whether they are bike riders or not, appreciate that bike lanes make it safer to cross arterial roads and acknowledge that those in their families and community who use bike lanes are safer when they are separated from traffic.\n4) There is absolutely no connection between improving broadband connection in Ontario and highway building. This appears to be a rationale that has nothing to do with transportation or gridlock.\n5) The province admits that building highways and removing bike lanes is intended to help vehicle drivers - sadly their lack of evidence-based research will not end gridlock and will only encourage more individual vehicles on the road, as well as the growth of more low density urban sprawl. Both of these outcomes fly in the face of climate change research and the transformative environmental action we need to take in the areas of transportation and urban growth to reduce pollution, protect the environment, lessen Ontarian's dependence on fossil fuels, and lower our carbon emissions.\n"

Two lane roads in Toronto tend to be full of parked or stopped cars anyway. Bike lanes make the city safer for everyone and reduce traffic deaths.\nI don't drive, I don't want to drive, and most people I know who live in downtown Toronto also don't own cars. Plenty of non-drivers live here and we deserve to get around safely too. I bike around most of the year, even during the winter when the bike lanes are clear.\nPlease don't waste our tax payer dollars to tear up existing bike lanes. Please, let the mayor voted in by the city of Toronto decide what happens to Toronto roads. The provincial government is not the municipal government.\n"

With the daily experienced effects of climate change, how can a premier suggest we design cities to have more cars on the road and that are not required and designed for future generations. Bike lanes save lives, they increase accessibility in cities for many residents, they allow you to get to work on time with the same commute time each day, and they make us healthier. Cars pollute, are extremely costly and kill. How can a government prioritize the latter? For myself and all cyclists who follow the rules of the road, create space for drivers on the road and in parking and who rely on safe routes to get to work, this bill will affect our day to day while taking major steps back for any sustainable progress towards a climate responsible future.\n"

This government has continued to waste taxpayer money while congratulating themselves on completing infrastructure projects that were well under way before they were involved. It is absolutely ludicrous to spend more money and time reconfiguring roads that have just finished major construction projects. At the very least if the intention is to reconsider the bike lanes in Toronto then you must first give us evidence based reasoning for reconfiguring the infrastructure, as it currently stands there is no form of equitable explanation given for the proposals in this bill beyond a vague assumption that this will fix congestion when there are multiple other factors at play. Will the province be willing to relocate the cycling infrastructure to alternate locations? What if there are no alternatives possible? The current lanes service a large portion of the city and are the foundation of the east/west and north/south cycling infrastructure. Give us something beyond the populist sloganeering, people want evidence.\n"

All examples given allow for more car movement: in USA via one way streets where a bike lane still leaves two lanes for cars; in London via third middle lane, etc.\nFamilies with children cannot hop on bikes in rain and cold and with their backpacks etc. There is no reasonable explanation for this activism.\nThese bike lanes are also not safer for anyone, the resulting congestion causes mass breaking of traffic rules. The bike lanes will be much safer on side streets with less traffic.\n"

Since the bike lanes were added on Bloor, I have found driving BETTER than before they were there. The problem with congestion begins with the 401 but continues with the focus on cars instead of public transit. Ontario should mandate/pay for trucks to use the 407. It would make things flow so much better. With the volumes of people we have we need more GO, more street cars, more subways. As other western countries move to taxing or banning cars in downtowns we should not be increasing them. Such backwards 1950s thinking.\n"
