        "comment": "I do not think the provincial government should be involved with municipal road issues. This is big government over-reach. Adding extra red tape for no value.\nA local government is in the best position, elected by its citizens, to decide on traffic patterns, safety, not queen's park elected by citizens of other larger jurisdictions.\nThere is no one size fits all answer, a small town with wide roads and no transit versus a large very spread out city. Why should there be a provincial law that tries to set a one-size fits all 'override' on local democracy?\nReducing gridlock is a noble goal. Safety is a noble goal. The environment is a noble goal. The health of the citizens is a noble goal. Let each municipality sort this out.\nRemove red tape, remove large provincial overreach, cancel this bill 212, its a political agenda, not a proper policy decision.\n"

        "comment": "The government of Ontario making it more difficult for cities to build bike lanes is a backwards move. I believe that it wastes time and effort on something nobody wants to be changed. Bike lanes make it easier and safer for people wishing to commute and get around via bike, and making it more difficult for cities to introduce more of them is making fundamental safety and ease of use more difficult to attain. The time spent on this idea would be better used to undo the action of placing beer in convenience stores and fixing all the massive issues that are currently going on in Ontario's healthcare and education system. I believe having to have provincial government approval to create more bike lanes does the opposite of the claim this bill says it's trying to do - having more bike lanes makes it easier to get around on a bike therefore reducing congestion and saving time for both people in cars and on bikes. At the same time, bikes are far cheaper than cars so people wishing to save money by riding their bike should not have a more difficult and dangerous time because just adding more lanes to things does not reduce traffic and gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Doug Ford, and the Government of Ontario-\nNobody is building bike lanes over highways. Even reading your proposal is like being splashed with the very dregs of a barrel of lies and greed. It is deliberately obtuse, misleading, and misdirecting.\nWe do not need more highways. We do not need you to be spending billions of our dollars, on your corrupt deals. We need more affordable transit options. We need subsidized inner city transit, we need bike lanes, we need pedestrian infrastructure. We do not need more cars.\nThe world is moving forward and you are deliberately leaving us behind.\nResign. I'm so sick paying even one cent of your salary while you fail to represent me that I should see my family doctor- if only I could find one.\n"

        "comment": "I support fewer cars, better public transportation, municipal-levied tolls on cars, anti-speeding cameras, and more bicycles and bicycle lanes in Toronto. A public transportation- and bicycle-friendly approach is the way of the future. Go to Amsterdam and see how beautiful it is because of its sensible urban transportation policies. Doug Ford seems to want us to return to the worst of the 1950s to court votes from people who do not even live in big cities. Accordingly, this government initiative is wholly wrong-headed.\nAm looking forward to receiving that promised bribe/cheque for $200 so that I can immediately endorse it over to whichever other political party is most likely to thwart this ridiculous proposed policy (not to mention the ridiculous tunnel-under-the 401, Ontario Place High-end Spa Giveaway and Green Belt Graft scandals).\n"

        "comment": "A stupid idea. Removing bike lanes means that bicycles will now be forced to mingle with traffic. This is both more dangerous to bicyclists, and less efficient for motorists, as they must now wait to pass bicyclists. Frequently, those passing maneuvers are not done safely (from what I've frequently seen on  roads without dedicated lanes. The process for determining the location for bike lanes and installation of same should remain the sole accountability of the municipality. Municipalities have a direct responsibility to their residents, and a greater awareness of the factors that required the bike lane in the first place. There is no LOGICAL reason why the Province needs to step in.\n"

        "comment": "I live in KW. Bike lanes have made commuting to and from work significantly easier and safer for my family (and yes, we do bike in the winter as well). We've been able to maintain only having one car for a family of four which also means we're able to save money and weather global inflation better than some of our neighbours have. I want to keep living in a city that has growing bike infrastructure so there are commuting options for all people at different income levels. I want my kids to be able to grow up in a forward thinking community that values a variety of transport options, especially ones that reduce Ontario's carbon footprint. Removing existing lanes or halting the build of future cycling infrastructure is both a waste of money and limits further societal progress.\n"

With the high cost of living, poor quality of the ttc, and new bike share program in Toronto, many people like myself have started cycling around this city. In the year I've been cycling to work, I have been almost hit by a car on a road with no bike lanes nearly every week.\nAdditionally, as a driver, there is nothing more Frustrating than being stuck behind a slow cyclist. Bike lanes will prevent that.\n"

        "comment": "Trying to kill more cyclists will not help anyone. The way to improve traffic flow in Toronto is quite simple, really. One example: Leave the bike lanes on Bloor and turn it into a one-way street. This way there are 3 to 4 lanes moving in one direction. Much cheaper to do, and much safer for everyone.\nToronto has a large and growing population. Just the idea that removing bike lanes from a few streets will somehow lessen the number of cars on the road is ridiculous, something only fools would believe. Removing bike lanes will not suddenly stop traffic congestion from ever happening again.\nDrivers don't want to admit that they're not stuck IN traffic, they ARE the traffic and the cause of the congestion, so they look to blame anyone or anything else. When they're sitting stuck in a traffic jam they curse all the drivers around them, but then go online and complain about cyclists and construction and the weather and the stoplights, even though it isn't bikes that cause traffic jams, it's the entire one-person-per-car commuting that's allowed to go on.\n"

        "comment": "I think this is an extreme overreach by our government. Bike lanes are absolutely not the problem. I emplore our government to do research on what the issues actually are relating to traffic . Rather than what seems like an arbitrary decision? It has been proven time and again that additional roads, highways, and lanes absolutely do Not improve traffic where there was already lots of it.\nEspecially where I live in Waterloo region. Where the region has made astounding and incredible strides to make the city livable and easy to get around. This includes their constant additions of protected bike lanes all over the city. Does this remove lanes for cars? Sure, but in today's world, isn't that the point? Don't we want people to get out of their cars? People don't like driving, it's not a great way to get around. If we go forward with this bill, it will impact Waterloo region making their strides worthless.\nWhy should a bill that is so obviously intended for Toronto with no thought of other cities be pressed upon Ontario as a whole. Let the regions decide what is best for them. Don't push Torontos political will onto other cuties. Go out and look at Waterloo/Kitchener and decide if this bill makes any sense here.\n"
