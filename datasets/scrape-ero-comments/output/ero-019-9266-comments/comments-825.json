Emergency vehicles are not able to pass cars and are stuck in gridlock delaying them in emergence .\n2. with 3 schools just south of Bloor on Royal York and one just north on Montgomery I have not ever seen students use the bike lanes to get to school. consulting with the schools and students are needed regarding the use of the lanes.\n3. the bike lanes have been a disaster for businesses and shoppers in the Kingsway. Ask any small business if this is true.\n4. Seems the only use of the bike lanes are for food delivery and they can safely use secondary roads.\nTraffic is always bumper to bumper and I imagine the air pollution with thousands of vehicles practically stopped along Bloor must be on the rise.\n5. Just stupid thinking.\n"

        "comment": "I do not think the provincial government should be involved with the removal of bike lanes in Toronto. I am an avid cyclist and I feel much safer travelling on a bike lane, especially a  lane in which there is a barrier between the car lane and bike lane. As our city population continues to grow, it is imperative that the city promote other modes of transportation. Promoting car use will not help with congestion, air pollution or climate change. People are afraid to ride their bikes if they need to be mixed in with traffic. This fear is warranted because the number of cyclist who die in traffic accidents continues to rise every year. Bike lanes encourage people to leave their cars at home. Bike lanes promote a healthier life style, build a sense of community and reduces our carbon footprint.  I have been pleased with the city's focus on building a network of bike lanes.  Removing bike lanes will move our city in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "I bike to work every day of the week. I am proud to live in a city that has been steadily improving its biking infrastructure year over over and, in doing so, truly showing a commitment to sustainability and addressing climate change. When I bike on Bloor, I feel safe and free. The protected lane encourages me to ride my bike instead of drive or take transit. Biking is often the fastest way for me to get around the city to the places I want to go. (Or a combination of biking and TTC. Love the bike racks on the busses.)\nSo I am deeply disappointed by the policies proposed in Bill 212, and by the disingenuous \u201cmassaging\u201d of data to promote the false narrative that these lanes are underused. Urban policy research shows that adding motor lanes does NOT reduce congestion over time. Furthermore, usage of bike infrastructure takes time to increase - the better it is and the longer it is there, the more people will use it over time. We need to invest in the future instead of selfishly and foolishly wasting money to remove something that is GOOD and could get BETTER in our city.\nAt times I am a motorist and I get that traffic is frustrating (and not good for air quality or the climate). The solution is MORE bike lanes and BETTER public transit, not more motor lanes. Make bike infrastructure and TTC so good that people will choose it over driving. We have no time to waste. We need to get off fossil fuels. Period. We should be disincentivizing driving, not encouraging it. And I say that as someone who owns a car and enjoys the convenience of driving. I urge you to do the right thing and keep your hands off our bike lanes.\n"

And there are more pressing social issues we should spend these taxpayers' money on.\nI travel to work daily from Yonge and Eglinton to Forrest Hill by biking through the bike lane, biking takes me 10 minutes of commute time. If I am taking TTC, it takes me 45 mins with one transit. If I am driving, it takes me 20 minutes as Yonge street always have heavy traffic. I am not the only user of the bike lanes - I travel with multiple bikers daily.\nAs a driver myself, I don't see how bike lanes causing traffic, but instead, if we remove street parking on major streets like Yonge and Bayview - it will release a lane immediately and causing the city zero dime.\n"

        "comment": "I am surprised that Bill 212 has become such a priority for the Premier. There are various reasons I oppose this bill and they are listed below:\n1. The bike lanes were built by our taxes, and their removal will also be paid by our taxes. It is irresponsible of the premier and his government to waste taxpayer money this way by removing bike lanes so soon after they have been built.\n2. Roads are not just for cars, in fact, by law bicycles are able to take an entire lane. Removing these lanes would reduce efficiency and increase danger to cyclists. I have lost a teacher, a friend, and a colleague to drivers striking them. Bike lanes across major traveling lanes would have kept all of them safe while they commuted to their work/homes.\n3. The attention and money being paid to this bill, which is largely focused on Toronto, is a slap in the face to the rest of the province and the health and housing crises that plague our province. These are actual issues that, if addressed, would make Ford a good premier. However, he has decided to attack a safe, healthy alternative to driving that will NOT address the traffic issues that exist in our highways. How will bike lanes removed on bloor positively affect traffic on the QEW or the series 400 highways?\n4. It is terrifying to see that the true aim of bill 212 is to dispossess Ontario citizens with more ease and to ignore environmental assessments for the sake of building construction projects at lower costs and faster.\nThese reasons are why I, and many other citizens, oppose bill 212. Please focus on actual issues that affect people all across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Comments on Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving Your Time Act, 2024\n(Please replace this version with a previous version I submitted earlier this evening. I noticed some typos and some omissions.  This version reads better and more clearly represents my views and concerns. Thanks.)\nI am a senior living in Toronto. I'm also a cyclist who worked for 30 years as an Ontario provincial civil servant. For most of my 30 years I cycled to work. As a former civil servant, I know well the Provincial Government has the power to override local democracy, this government has done it several times before in the City of Toronto. Having the power to do something, is different from having the moral authority to do it. Each time the provincial government arbitrarily interferes it makes citizens more cynical about government. It would seem the provincial government does not trust municipalities to know what is needed and wanted in their communities. One would wonder when the Ontario government will decide to abolish municipalities outright. It would appear that the Ontario government does not believe citizens are capable of knowing how they want their local communities to be run.\nAs a retired person - 66 years old, I still cycle daily for shopping, volunteering, and visiting and caring for friends. If Bill 212 is passed and receives Royal Assent it will put me in danger.  Several times a week, I visit a 97-year-old friend who lives in a downtown Long-Term Care Home. I live in East York (Toronto). I use the bike lanes on Danforth and Bloor to visit my elderly friend with dementia. So, your Bill 212 will force the City of Toronto to rip up these lanes than help to ensure my safety. The Ontario Government wants bike lanes on secondary roads, but I wonder how I will cross the Don River without going on a major road. Does my safety not matter to your government. It would seem not. This Bill is \u2018Dog Whistle\u2019 politics. The Ontario Government\u2019s version of the \u2018Culture Wars.\u2019 It puts the safety of a minority group - cyclists up for debate. To save motorists a few minutes my safety and the safety of all cyclists is up for grabs.\nI am opposed to Bill 212. It is a prime example of overreach on the part of a higher level of government \u2013 provincial, that unilaterally takes away democratic control from a lower level - municipalities. I never elected the Premier to run the city of Toronto. If the Premier wants to be the Mayor of Toronto, he should run but stop trying to run it from his office at Queens Park, The Ontario government should start respecting local decision making. The location and placement of Bike Lanes is a local issue, and logic would state that it is best managed by local government, which is the closet to the people and the issue. I elected a Mayor and a City Councillor, not an MPP, to deal with the local issues in my city and neighbourhood. Bike lanes should be a municipal responsibility. Good governance calls for the control by that level of government closest to the issue. Bill 212 is arbitrary and is one sided, it is aimed at motor vehicle drivers to the detriment of cyclists. Why are cyclists being pitted against motorists? Why this zero sum game? Why are MPPs at Queens Park dealing with this issue? I would think their would-be plenty issues on the Ontario Government\u2019s plate such as people having a doctor and a home to live in. How the local traffic flows in neighbourhoods in the city of Toronto wouldn\u2019t be one of them. Bill 212 makes no sense. Its interference with the running of municipalities. Did the municipalities come to the province asking for the placement and control of bike lanes to be uploaded to the Ontario Government? Bill 212 makes no sense other than as a distraction from what the provincial should be working on. Stop the meddling.\n"

        "comment": "This bill proposes provincial approval for bike lanes that remove traffic lanes on municipal roads, adding unnecessary red tape to the process. Bike lane projects already take years to implement, with plans reviewed by traffic engineers and local councils, making provincial oversight redundant. If approved, these projects will take even longer, even more resources and still, if done with integrity, come to the same conclusion. That conclusion will, in most cases, be that the bike lane does not impede regular traffic or the movement of emergency vehicles. This has been shown time and time again.\nBike lanes are essential for safety, reducing cyclist injury risk by 30-40% and promoting active transportation, two factors which ultimately reduce provincial health care costs. Bike lanes will also have a null effect on traffic congestion, or even reduce it in some cases, which has been demonstrated, particularly when controlling for other upwards pressure on traffic such as increasing population. Removing existing bike lanes would waste time and money, while increasing traffic and safety risks.\nRather than removing bike lanes, funds should be directed toward public transportation to better reduce gridlock. I hear talk of common sense solutions. What is more common sense to solving traffic congestion (made of motor vehicles) than reducing the number of vehicles on the road. More active transportation solutions and better transit achieves that. Reducing the options for people to get around without motor vehicles does the opposite. It is that simple.\nThis will not reduce gridlock. It may increase it. It doesn't save anyone time. It will have negligible effect on motorists, perhaps increase commute times for cycling commuters, or even cost lives as it increases the high-risk points of contact between cyclists and motorists. For a government supposedly dedicated to cutting red-tape and finding common sense solutions, this is a big, disappointing miss.\n"

I am a cyclist but the current set up with bike lanes isn\u2019t safe for anyone and it\u2019s ruined the streetscape. In Etobicoke many interior streets don\u2019t have sidewalks and cars are racing through side streets to escape traffic on Bloor and so walking along these streets is dangerous now. There is a better solution for bike lanes but taking lanes from major through streets with vibrant retail businesses is not the answer.\n"

Bikes already have Dupont just 3 blocks north and Toronto's own study says that the increased riders on Bloor are basically just riders from Dupont/Harbord.\nIf cyclists want to connect into Etobicoke, have them connect from Annette, to Baby Point, Humbercrest and then cross at Old Mill, connecting to Kingsway. Kingsway/Bloor used to have a thorough road from Old Mill to Kingsway, bring that back for cyclists only.\nMost of us cyclists in Etobicoke basically just ride to Humber River near Old Mill and ride down to the Martin Goodman Trail. It's a dedicated bike lane and much safer. So put the bike lane on Kingsway and connect to Old Mill.\nThere is no need for a bike lane on Bloor.\nAlso, fix Kipling/Bloor. This intersection never had any traffic, NONE! Now that Toronto got rid of the bridge and made Kipling/Bloor and Kipling/Dundas only 100m apart this is a disaster. The lights aren't timed, so traffic gets stuck in the middle. The left turn Lane's going northbound are only single lane and tiny, so they always back up and block the road, and what's with that random 3rd lane between Bloor/Dundas?\nWhoever designed this should be fired. There used to be absolutely no traffic here and now it often takes me 10-20 minutes going northbound to cross when the backlog reaches Norseman Ave.\n"

It is inconsistent with the Provincial Policy Statement as well as Toronto's Official Plan, Vision Zero Strategy and TransformTO Net Zero Strategy. Surely it is not consistent with the mandate of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation to expend $48 million to make roads less safe.\nFurther, City of Toronto statistics have shown a huge increase in the number of people cycling on routes where safe cycling infrastructure has been installed and a greatly reduced number of collisions. The Province has not provided any data that proves removing cycling lanes will reduce congestion, nor released any data from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey about the number of people who commute by cycling.\nLocal roads should remain the sole responsibility of municipalities and elected local councillors, not the Minister of Transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto, commute primarily by bicycle, and use the bike lanes the province is proposing to remove frequently. They are an important part of the city's cycling infrastructure and allow cyclists to get where they need to go safely. It would be an immense disappointment if the province chose to override the consultation and decision making process of the city and prioritize a marginal improvement in commute times for motorists over safety for other road users. Decisions about local roads and infrastructure belong rightly to the elected officials of local municipalities, who have the best sense of their contituents' needs and priorities and are locally accountable. The province's intervention in this matter is counterproductive. Cyclists will not disappear if the bike lanes are removed. They will be forced to share the road with motorists in a much less safe manner. People will be injured and killed who would not be if lanes were left in place. Furthermore, encouraging people to commute in ways other than by car - for example, by bicycle - by providing infrastructure for them to do so safely improves traffic by reducing the number of motorists on the road. Cycling reduces traffic congestion, lowers emmisions compared to driving and is good for our environment, improves physical and mental health, requires less public space be used for parking, and is an affordable form of transportation. Improving access to the choice to cycle should be a government priority. This bill makes cycling in Toronto less safe and should not be enacted.\n"
