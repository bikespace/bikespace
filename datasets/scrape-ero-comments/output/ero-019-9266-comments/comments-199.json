        "comment": "Hello,\nWhat causes congestion is too many cars on the road. It is well known that increasing lanes worsens traffic (one example here: https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/). What will reduce gridlock is creating easier and more reliable methods for commuters that remove cars from the road. This includes public transit and having safe and separate bike lanes. While Toronto already has good public transit, more funding should be diverted to it (instead of being spent on removing recently installed bike lanes) to increase its reliability and frequency. In the time of an affordability crisis, a car is not affordable, insurance is not affordable, and gas is not affordable. What is affordable is public transit and biking.\nFurther actions should be taken by the current provincial government to instruct OPP (and to tell major cities to instruct their own police force) to further enforce the rules of the road for drivers. As someone that lives in a downtown, I have seen countless drivers blocking the box (which causes gridlock... bikes don't do this) and countless drivers driving while using their phone. This falls under distracted driving which further increases gridlock. If an effort is made by law enforcement to crack down on driving infractions, many drivers will be less distracted and prone to making errors while driving (which again, causes grid lock). This will also increase the provincial and city coffers from the fines collected for infractions, allowing more reasonable and logical road and commuting improvements to go forward, without taking money away from another area.\nThe solution to a smooth commute isnt to allow more cars on the road. It is to allow alternatives that take up less space per person (eg: public transit, biking,...) and to properly and effectively enforce the currently driving laws in order to create a safer and more efficient environment for both drivers and other commuters.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "This a blatant over-reach by the provincial government in to municiple affairs and it is certainly not backed up by any modern understand of how traffic works. More lanes does not reduce traffic. Creating viable alternatives to driving is the only way to reduce traffic. Do you think removing bike lanes and having bikes mingle with cars will let cars drive faster and safer? Again, there seems to be no logic to this and it seems ridiculous for the province to over-reach on an issue which is not that pressing at a provincial level. With all that is going wrong with our province lately, is this really what our province should be focussed on?\n"

        "comment": "If the goal is to improve traffic flow, and reduce congestion, then I would say that adding more cars to our already congested streets should not be the main priority. More cars are what's causing traffic, and fatalities in our city are at record numbers, especially for cyclists. More bikes on the roads means less people in cars. Bike lanes make our roads safer for EVERYONE, including pedestrians and people on mobility devices, who are safer with less cars at slower speeds. Walking and cycling, when possible, are better for our environment, our health, and it would serve everyone in our communities if we can feel safe when choosing these alternatives.\nThese decisions should remain in the hands of municipalities who understand their streets best, and know too well that our streets will not feel safer for vulnerable road users, and those who choose alternative forms of transportations, with more cars whizzing by.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will do nothing to resolve gridlock, and will only worsen the problem by 'inducing demand' for roads. Reducing congestion requires reducing traffic volumes, this requires providing alternate transportation solutions for short trips, or building better towns and cities that don't rely on a car for every single trip.\nThis bill will endanger cyclists, and other vulnerable road users without any appreciable gains on motorist travel time. The unintended consequence is that cyclists will take over entire vehicle lanes to ensure safe travel, making less space for motorists.\nWhen every other global urban jurisdiction is installing cycling networks to reduce the need for cars for short trips less than 5km, this bill sets Ontario back.\n"

        "comment": "It is disheartening to read Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 and the framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. I am firmly against Bill 212. The environmental and human health impacts of this Bill are glaring. The idea that saving a few minutes of drive-time (only 30-35 minutes; Goverment of Ontario, 2024) on the highway and city streets is worth such a cost is irresponsible and shows a complete disregard for science and decades of environmental, engineering, and city planning studies and data.\nBuilding larger roads does not ease traffic. There have been many studies which have shown that building bigger highways and adding lanes only leads to induced demand. In other words, when highways are built and lanes are added, more cars will use them, leading to more traffic (Cervaro, 2001; Goodwin, 1996; Lee 1999). In the current environmental crisis, I am disappointed that our government continues to make decisions which prioritize cars and car infrastructure. Studies have found that on the Toronto corridor of Highway 401 alone, vehicles emit 3771 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually (Shamsi et al., 2021). The government should be looking for solutions to decrease the number of cars on the road, not increase it. Studies have shown that \"[t]he transportation sector has the highest potential for environmental and health cost reductions amongst other energy-related sectors\" (Shamsi et al., 2021). We need a government which takes this statement seriously. We need a government which looks for alternatives to car infrastructure to help alleviate commute times while making decisions which are best for the environment (i.e., bike paths and lanes, promoting walkable cities instead of building car-dependent exurbs, funding reliable and affordable regional transit, etc.).\nBesides the environmental impact of highways and cars, there is also a real impact to human health. Shamsi et al. (2021) estimates that the health cost of air pollution from Highway 401 traffic is 416 million dollars per year. Increasing the number of cars on the road will only increase the amount of air pollution. Removing bike infrastructure also endangers lives. In Toronto in 2024 alone, 6 cyclists have died on the streets (CBC, 2024). It is disturbing that the debate around bike infrastructure on city streets is pitting driver inconvenience against peoples lives. There have been many heart-breaking cases where bike lanes could have saved lives such as the story of Alex Amaro who was killed while cycling on Dufferin Street (Knope, 2020). It is irresponsible to put peoples lives at risk in order to save drivers a few minutes or seconds of commute time. Instead, governments should be looking for alternate forms of transportation which are better for people and the environment.\nIn cities (and I will speak from a Toronto perspective, as that is where many of the bike infrastructure projects are), studies have shown that many people who use the major streets access them by foot or transit (over 70% of people in the Annex/Korea Town neighbourhood) and that \"these visitors' journeys were mostly unaffected by the street's reconfiguration [i.e., adding a bike lane]\" (Smith et al., 2019). If the majority of people accessing these urban areas are not driving, the government should make decisions in the best interest of pedestrians and transit users instead of motorists. The government should be making these streets more accessible to pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users instead of drivers. There will always be people who are upset about bike lanes. We need a government that looks to real data and prioritizes peoples lives over driver inconvenience.\nUltimately, until there are viable options for driving (i.e., good bike infrastructure, reliable municipal transit, frequent and affordable regional transit), there will always be gridlock. Always. Adding more highways, more car lanes, and removing bike infrastructure will never be the answer.\n"

        "comment": "Bill  212 is a dangerously regressive piece of legislation masquerading as a solution to traffic congestion. In reality, it's an assault on evidence-based urban planning, environmental protection, and local democracy.\nThe provincial government's heavy-handed intervention in municipal bike lane decisions is nothing short of authoritarian overreach. This blatant power grab undermines years of careful local planning, community consultation, and democratic process. It's particularly galling considering that municipalities are legally empowered to make these decisions under the Municipal Act.\nThe Act's fundamental premise - that more car lanes reduce congestion - flies in the face of decades of transportation research. The concept of induced demand isn't merely a theory; it's a proven phenomenon witnessed globally. By ignoring this evidence, the government demonstrates either willful ignorance or deliberate disregard for scientific consensus.\nThe planned removal of Toronto's bike lanes is particularly shortsighted and harmful. These lanes serve thousands daily and have demonstrably boosted local business revenue - facts the government seems determined to ignore. This isn't just bad policy; it's actively harmful to urban communities and local economies.\nThe environmental implications are even more alarming. The reckless exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. This isn't merely cutting red tape - it's cutting essential safeguards for irreplaceable ecosystems. Once paved over, these vital carbon sinks and natural habitats are lost forever.\nThe timing of this bill, amid a climate crisis and rising urban transportation challenges, is particularly tone-deaf. Instead of embracing modern, sustainable solutions, the government is doubling down on failed 1950s-era car-centric policies that have proven disastrous for cities worldwide.\nThe absence of expert consultation in drafting this bill is glaring. It appears to have been crafted to satisfy political objectives rather than address real transportation needs. The result is a piece of legislation that not only fails to solve congestion but actively works against public health, safety, and environmental protection.\nMost disturbingly, the bill reveals a troubling pattern of governance that prioritizes short-term political gains over long-term public good. It's a direct attack on sustainable urban planning, environmental protection, and municipal autonomy.\nThis isn't just flawed legislation - it's a dangerous step backward that threatens to lock Ontario into unsustainable, unsafe, and inefficient transportation patterns for generations to come. The bill should be scrapped entirely and replaced with evidence-based policies that actually serve the public interest rather than political expediency.\n"

        "comment": "1. Why are bike lanes and a highway proposal lumped together? These are very different forms of travel to \"save time\"\nTo clarify bike lanes are key for travel within a city <20km. Having well-linked, safe, and organized bike lanes encourages people to bike to/from their destinations helping reduce gridlock. As is spatially obvious, a bike takes a lot less space than a car, especially when a car is single-person occupied. Anybody who considers cars their only mode of transportation should want more bike lanes and should be encouraging travelling by bike within the city. More bikes, means less cars on the road, thereby reducing gridlock.\nHighways are efficient for travel between cities. It is already known that increasing the number of lanes does not equal a reduction in gridlock. Creating redundant highways is unnecessary and an environmental assault on the greenbelt. Anybody who considers cars their only mode of transportation should encourage alternate forms of travel, similar to the policy of promoting \"an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\".\n"
