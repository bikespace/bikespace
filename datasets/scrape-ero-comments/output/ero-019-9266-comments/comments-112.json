There is no evidence to support any of the claims in this proposal and it will make traffic worse and it will kill people.\nNot that I have any faith left in this government to read comments but please do not move forward with this bill\n"

The only way to reduce cars is to provide viable alternatives for people to get to where they are going.\nThat means MORE bike lanes, reliable transit, neighbourhoods with walkable amenities.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident who lives downtown Toronto for at least 9 years, the biking infrastructure that has been put on key roads (Bloor, Yonge, College, etc) and throughout the city has allowed me to increase my use of cycling as my main method of transportation. I now bike to work regularly, bike to restaurants regularly, and bike to access services downtown regularly. It is incredibly important to me as a resident of downtown Toronto to have access to safe cycling infrastructure wherever I go. Vehicle users are not more important than vulnerable road users and pedestrians, and I would be incredibly disappointed in our province if they choose to prioritize the people driving through Toronto vs the people who live in Toronto and who need to safely travel within it.\nDo not limit municipalities power to increase safe cycling. Keep Toronto the lively and beautiful city that it is and can be.\n"

        "comment": "Induced Demand is a proven result of adding traffic lanes.\nIf you add a vehicle lane or another highway, more vehicles will use the route, resulting in the same drive time for motorists almost immediately after the lane is installed.\nThe ONLY way to decrease traffic and gridlock caused by cars, is to reduce the cars.\nOur tax dollars are best used by investing in public transit or active transportation.   This is the most effective, efficient and economical use of our limited tax resources.\nWe have experts in the economics of transportation- I implore you to heed their advice and experience.\nHas a single dollar been spent on expert research for this proposal?\nHow much is the 413 costing us for a limited number of kms and to benefit a small percentage of our population?  If the same amount of funds was invested in light rail, other public transportation, and incentivize active transportation, hundreds of thousands more Ontarians would benefit.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver in a city, I much prefer to drive on a street that has bike lanes. I have found that, particularly in busy places, bike lanes actually keep traffic moving and are much safer for everyone\u2014drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Cyclists are going to exist no matter what you do, so separating them from car traffic is the best way forward. When cyclists are having to mix with traffic, it slows cars down and is unsafe. Please keep building bike lanes, it\u2019s the best way to keep traffic moving in busy cities!\nAlso\u2014in the interest of keeping government small, I believe that bike lanes should continue to be a municipal issue rather than a provincial one. Let municipal council members, who are democratically elected, decide what is best for the people who elect them\u2014their constituents. It\u2019s not the place of the province to get involved here.\n"

Removing bike lane means cars will just have to slow down for cyclists or risk running them over. What a disingenuous bill name - this won't reduce gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should be part of any world class transportation strategy. I am concerned that the proposal is not backed by data, and case studies of other world class cities and communities. More people would ride bikes if it was safer to do so. My opinion is that politicians like roads and cars, as it helps them get elected and maintain votes from their base. This policy does not have an impact on economic attributes like productivity caused by gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford\u2019s obsession with the job he never had as mayor of Toronto leads your government down nonsensical paths. This legislation on bike lanes is punitive toward Toronto and distracts from real issues that Ontarians actually want you to be working on: funding Health care and climate action.\nI do cycle and use bike lanes and do you want to know what I see is causing gridlock? Drivers who block entire intersections on red lights with no repercussions. I also see construction companies on behalf of Developers blocking whole roads at 8:30 for private condo projects. For instance regularly during the morning rush hour on bloor street in Toronto the company working on a condo at dufferin and bloor will block the entire road for their private project for at least ten minutes once per week for both cyclists and drivers. This is happening all over Toronto and your government seems to think bike lanes are the problem?\nThis proposed legislation is not based on evidence; it endangers people\u2019s lives; and it\u2019s undemocratic as we elect our government in Toronto to make decisions related to civic matters. To be part of this, the minister of transportation should quite frankly be embarrassed and ashamed of himself that this will be associated with his career over the long term. The planet is clearly warming and continuing to encourage people to drive everywhere is a losing strategy for all of us.\nI strongly encourage your government to read some actual evidence based research on this matter.\n"

        "comment": "The culture of motorists in Toronto shows a blatant disregard for traffic laws and the safety of others. It is very apparent when you look at the countless fatalities caused by their careless and aggressive style of driving. This is caused by Toronto Police Service's lack of enforcement, complicity/encouragement of road rage towards cyclists, and poorly planned infrastructure projects that favor motorists. Your proposal is a continuation of backwards logic, and will cause more congestion. Any good city deters driving and encourages transit / alternate methods of travel. Do you want Toronto to end up with traffic like Los Angeles? That is where we are headed with your proposal that caters to motorists. Many people I speak with would like to use their bicycle, but don't feel safe to do so. Building bike lanes is ONE STEP towards reducing congestion and gridlock. I am so happy to be a citizen soon and vote against you and your short sighted policies. God bless your heart, because we all know it is in bad shape. Exercise helps ;)\n"

        "comment": "Bicycle infrastructure, including bike lanes, not only reduces traffic but is better for the environment. Every person riding a bike means one less car on the road. With less motor vehicle use, less congestion will occur.\nAdditionally, bicycle use of road infrastructure requires less upkeep than a multi-thousand pound vehicle. Bicycles have. Significantly lower carbon footprint than a motor vehicle.\nI would rather see less dedicated motor vehicle lanes and more bike lanes, to provide safe, efficient means of transportation throughout our cities.\nIncreasing lanes of traffic does nothing to solve congestion. Induced demand means that every lane added only temporary improves congestion, after which it is the same or worse than before.\nInstead of devoting time and resources to building roads and highways, we should be investing in active transportation infrastructure (bike lanes), transit and rail infrastructure, and investing in health care and education.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose BILL 212, it's simply not what the people of Ontario want and it will cause additional gridlock in our cities. The bill is regressive and sad for Canada.\nStudies consistently show that bike lanes not only improve cyclist safety but also reduce traffic congestion and promote economic activity by increasing foot traffic to local businesses. Cities should retain the ability to make timely, informed decisions to expand such benefits, without being subject to slower, less flexible provincial oversight.\n"

Whether it's walking, cycling, transiting, or driving, world class cities integrate all to provide everyone with options to create a strong economy.\nIf the Premier and his party pack ambition and clearly want keep Ontario behind.\nAlso, I would like to note that the Premier and his party members and cabinet members should focus more on policies that uplift the province as a whole and less on over reaching and focusing on Toronto - Canada's most populous city and business capital of the nation. Maybe focus on bettering the lives of the entire province.\n"
