        "comment": "Dear Parliament,\nThis bill represents a step backward in progress. We have seen the rest of the world move forward with transportation projects that are able to move their citizens quickly across their country. Why do we continue to focus on more highways? Why can we not commit not the time and money to build a better future for our children? We have the proof that larger highways do not scale with population growth. A larger rail network would be better for both everyday citizens and businesses alike. Spending more of our money on expanding highways is not the way forward.\nThe forced removal of bike lanes in urban centers would be a saddening over reach of provincial government. The cities which have elected their own officials, who installed these lanes as they are better for their citizens, should not be over ruled. Regardless of the lanes being great protection for cyclists, as well as reducing gridlock significantly (something you are purportedly for), the forced removal of these lanes is an over reach that should not be stood for.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto citizen who has benefitted from the Bloor, Yonge, and University bike lanes and am extremely worried and upset that the proposal will remove them - I call on the Ministry of Transportation to continue investigating and heavily consider other avenues of alleviating traffic congestion, instead of removing bike lanes. When I was a university student at U of T, I used the bike lanes daily using BikeShare to get to all my classes and the exercise, fresh air, and significant reduction of commute time (compared to walking) really improved my quality of life. Now as a university graduate, I still use all these main road bike lanes to get to my church, campus events, meeting people, and running errands. Removing these bike lanes will mean taking away a safe and environmentally conscious means of transportation for many of us, as those main roads are only safe for bikers when there are designated bike lanes to protect us. Please reconsider and I will await all updates pertaining to Bill 212. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing as a Toronto resident of over 10 years, who uses bicycle lanes regularly. When I first moved here from Ottawa without means of owning a car these bike lanes were my main method of getting to work and back. While back then these infrastructures were in their infancy, they provided me with patches of safety on roads where I would otherwise be at mercy of the drivers.\nThe major issue with bill is that it uses outdated statistics from 2011 based on a question with the very limited scope of whether someone uses bicycle as a primary mode of commuting. In reality many people bike to do many other things, like spending time with friends and family, attend events, going shopping, etc. Its implication of removing bike lanes in major streets in the city has complete disregard that many of these places are the destinations, and removing means of getting there means people will need to resort to other modes of transportation.\nWhen I tell people that I cycle to work, the reaction I get is that of shock, disbelief, and concern. Premier himself have experienced unsafe roads that cyclist must navigate in areas without cycling infrastructure. Over half of my friends and even my significant other have never cycled in the city due to safety concerns, and I think it says a lot about the large number of people that current lack of safe cycling infrastructure is preventing people from switching from car and buses that add to existing grid lock and losing valuable time they can be doing something else.\nBill 212 is a significant overreach of power by the provincial government and it inherently has an imbalance of consideration as to who has priority on municipal roads. Blanket legislation like this divides people in the city and rural areas even further because people in different areas have different needs. If reducing grid lock and saving time is the objective, we must give municipalities the ability to make their own decision about road uses.\nThank you,\nSeita\n"

        "comment": "Regarding:\nBill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nIt seems incredibly wasteful to remove these established bike lanes.\nThe simple fact is that people enjoy biking and biking in the city and it contributes to vibrancy and health and low cost travel.  Removal of these bike lanes poses a safety issue.  The high volume of bikers along these routes will simply take over any traffic lane reinstated and in a dangerous way.\nI use these routes regularly and I do not support this measure.\n"

        "comment": "I am a daily commuter relying on the newly created Avenue Road, and recently updated University and Adelaide bike lanes. I sat through the construction of the bike lanes in the summer on Avenue and dealt with the construction on Adelaide. I sometimes felt unsafe but I knew that the bike lanes were coming. I cannot imagine the amount of waste this project is going to product and additional gridlock to our streets. In May of this year on my bike ride home from work I biked by the crime scene of a fellow fallen rider on Avenue. It took his unfortunate death for that section of the road to get a bike lane and if we tear it out, more deaths will happen across our city. We need transit. If the Ford Government wants to be \u201cfact based\u201d they need to look at what\u2019s actually causing traffic (more cars). I am livid about the bike lanes being torn up.\n"

        "comment": "This is the worst idea. Please please look at the evidence- widening roads does not reduce gridlock in the long run! We should be adding more bike lanes- and funding public transit- at all costs. The bike season is only getting longer, and more people are choosing bikes over cars. How many more cyclists and pedestrians have to die before you start to listen to the experts and make ethical decisions? Stay in your lane- let municipalities make the right decisions since you are clearly incapable.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a step backward in successful city planning. Safe, managed and dedicated cycling lanes are an efficient and inexpensive means to reduce congestion in cities, reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles both through the use of fossil fuel as well as any embodied energy regardless of fuel source, as well as promote a cleaner environment. It is absolutely retroactive to remove this critical infrastructure. I recommend the Ford administration spend some of our tax dollars on a research trip to Copenhagen and Amsterdam.\n"

        "comment": "I think that bike lanes are key to allowing for an additional mode of transport into the City. The bike lanes that were developed along Yonge Street are what allowed me to bike into work from North York to downtown. They were invaluable and also provided a safe means of getting to work. Additionally, the traffic along Yonge Street was never too bad, so I'm not sure why the bike lanes are being removed.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I'm a cyclist in Toronto and cycling is my main form of transportation, even into the winter months. It is incredibly disappointing to hear that the premier is overreaching and dealing with municipal affairs instead of managing major provincial issues like healthcare access. It is also disheartening to feel that my safety as a citizen is less important than the commute time of drivers.\nEveryone deserves a safe commute, including cyclists and pedestrians. Bike lanes are proven to improve the safety of both. Bloor, University and College are all bike lanes I use weekly if not daily and I chose them specifically due to the infrastructure. As a cyclist, I have experienced countless close calls and have almost been struck by cars on main roads, secondary roads and even in the bike lane. The only way to prevent these close calls and any full on collisions are protected bike lanes.\nAdditionally, as a cyclist I would like to say, you're welcome! What for, you may ask - well, I am one less vehicle contributing to congestion, gridlock and CO2 emissions. I believe the least I can ask for is a commute I don't have to risk my life for.\n"

Removing the bike lanes is costly and won't reduce gridlock; the more cars there are on major streets in Toronto, the worse the traffic will be.\nMany cyclists will leave their bikes at home if the bike lanes are removed. I urge you to reconsider this decision and work with Toronto City Council to search for other solutions to Toronto's traffic challenges.\n"

This bill makes zero effort to explain how this is a good idea.  And it gives zero metrics for proving that it will attain the desired result.

After my studies I moved overseas, and just this year an opportunity arose to return to the city that I love, with my young family.  I specifically chose to move to a location on Bloor again because I was excited by all the positive cycling infrastructure that had been put in place in the past 20 years.  My wife and I chose to live car-free in the city because the new cycling infrastructure made me feel safe to carry my toddler to his daycare and swim lessons on Bloor via bicycle.  TTC is good for long trips, but for short trips cycling is far more efficient.  And nearly ALL of our trips are short trips.  My family would be devastated if the cycle lanes we depend on are ripped out.  We would be forced to rethink our lifestyle.  Buying a car would be a likely result.  We moved to Toronto because it's a safe and practical city to live car-free.  I honestly can't believe we are on the brink of reversing everything.\n"

The lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University are some of the only places for cycling commuters to feel safe and secure while cycling.

Though I acknowledge that many people travel in cars, and that will not change, I don\u2019t believe increasing the number of cars in these areas is a long term, viable solution. We need to decrease our reliance on individual motor vehicle transportation and improve our public transportation and cycling infrastructure.\nI also personally know someone who lost their life while cycling in Toronto. The removal of cycling infrastructure would be a complete disregard for her life, and the life of the many others who have been killed.\nAt this point I feel like I\u2019m begging. Please don\u2019t remove these bike lanes. Increasing the number of cars on the road at a given time and removing these safeguards for cyclists will make the roads less safe for everyone who uses them, regardless of the mode of transportation.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"
