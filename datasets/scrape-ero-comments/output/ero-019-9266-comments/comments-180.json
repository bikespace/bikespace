        "comment": "This is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirst, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power.\nWhy is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas.\nPeople should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don\u2019t have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes reduce congestion more effectively than car lanes because they accommodate many more users in less space. They encourage cycling as a safe and efficient alternative to driving, leading to fewer cars on the road. This shift is particularly effective for short trips, which are common in urban areas. Overall, bike lanes promote mobility and reduce reliance on cars, helping to ease traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I believe the province should not be telling cities how to manage their streets. Toronto has decided (under conservative mayor Tory) what is best for its people - the province should respect that! Limiting the installation of new bike lanes and removing the old ones not only won't reduce gridlock, but will also result in even more people dying on our streets. Bike lanes have proved to be beneficial on so many levels, that thinking of removing them does not make any sense. It would be a mistake and a huge setback for all of us, drivers included. Safe streets save lives, bike lanes save lives. It is the duty of the provincial government to keep the citizens and residents of Ontario safe. We need more bike lanes, safe lanes, on main streets, so that people can choose alternative means of transportation, and get safely and efficiently to their destination. With this bill, the government is saying that it does not care about the safety and the wellbeing of its people. With this bill, the government of Ontario is proving that they want us to live in the past instead of embracing the future.\n"

I would also like to be able to bike on Dupont safely, and support new bike lanes proposed there.\nThis has been a deadly year for cyclists in Toronto, and these irresponsible plans will only make it worse.\nInvest in transit instead of making roads unsafe for cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Strongly oppose of this bill. Removing bike lanes already built by cities is a waste of tax payer money. There have already been studies showing how adding an extra lane does NOT improve traffic. How about improving public transit? How about better biking infrastructure so that people can get out of their cars and thus reduce traffic? How about getting rid of street parking then to free up a lane? So many other possibilities, yet Doug Ford and the conservatives are so fixated on getting rid of bike lanes.\nAnd let's not skim over the real reason for this bill, it's to push for the building of highway 413, which no one asked for and benefits no one except developers.\nShame on Doug Ford and the conservatives for even putting out this bill.\n"

        "comment": "This is no place for provincial legislation. This act should be dropped.   Transportation planning is done at a municipal level. Let the municipalities decide where the bike lanes belong, where roads need to be wider or put on a diet. the province should not interfere in this arena.\nBike lanes are options. Having access to bike lanes meansI can bike places without idling in car traffic. It means I can drive without bikes slowing me down  They are a way around the congestion. Everyone in that bike lane, is one less car on the road. Everyone on a bike, scooter or mobility device is getting where they are going faster and safer. Everyone deserves a lane on the road.

I guess he thinks that the people who ride bikes are not his responsibility - they probably don't vote for him.\nAll studies show that bike lanes reduce traffic.\nThey help people stay healthy, they reduce emissions, thus mitigating climate change, and cyclists spend more money at local businesses.\nFord has no business over-ruling what local residents want in our own neighbourhoods.\nPeople are going to die if the bike lanes are removed - every death is the fault of this stupid proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make help move traffic, when bikes are in the same lane as cars everyone suffers. Cars are slowed down, cyclists are less safe and it is hard we for everyone to navigate streets. Harbord is currently under construction and reduced to a single file lane with cyclists and cars together, it is awful. No driver or cyclist would choice this over the separated bike lanes there.\nGood cycling infrastructure means cyclists of all levels can make the choice to bike. Families, kids, seniors can all make this choice. It is healthier, better for the environment and better for gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This is an atrocious bill. Gridlock will remain no matter how many highways and lanes you build. The only proven way to fight gridlock and traffic congestion is to supply efficient and reliable alternative transit methods which reduce the amount of cars on the road. Adding life saving bike lanes will only decrease the amount of  single car drivers who are contributing to gridlock, and will free up space for those vehicles (emergency, transit, accessibility) who need to be on the road.\nShame on you for putting this forth and not focusing this energy on projects that will actually make a difference for the majority of the population of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who owns a car, Doug Ford's intent to remove bike lanes is completely unacceptable, full stop.\nIt will not solve congestion and will only encourage more people to drive. What's more, it will put more residents who bike in danger of serious injury or death. It is completely unacceptable that the alleged \"better commute\" for residents who drive trumps the lives of residents who choose to bike.\nTraffic congestion will be a worsening issue unless the province of Ontario invest in a reliable public transit network. The more people take alternative forms of transportation when possible, the better it is to navigate from point A to point B.\nI would encourage the province to focus on completing existing transit projects and continue building better public transit across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of kitchener, I can say that Bikelanes have gotten out of control. With little to no rhyme or reason, we are seeing multi million dollar roads get redirected to nowhere for bike lanes that are never used. Many of our bike lanes crossover major traffic routes with little to no notice, as well as interacting poorly with our major roundabouts.\nThe biggest problems have been the daily collisions that result from poor driver understanding and a lack of caution from cyclista. If it were me passing this legislation, I would focus on how having a consistent process and criteria for new bike lanes, would make ontario safer in the long run. Going from Toronto to Guelph to Kitchener to Hamilton shouldnt feel like a cross world trip when it comes to lane placement and laws.\nAs per usual, cyclists/motorists (barring stand out individuals) are not the problem. Poor city planning and inefficient projects are the cause of gridlock\n"
