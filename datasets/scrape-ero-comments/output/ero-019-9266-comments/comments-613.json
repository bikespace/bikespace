        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto and I walk, cycle and drive to get around in Toronto.  I also use transit.  I read this Bill 212 and I do worry to what extent it will be enacted.  The experts of Toronto traffic, I believe are it's residents. We have had government after government (both municipal and provincial) delaying, reversing and cancelling transit projects for decades.  Bike lanes and a widespread bike infrastructure are part of the solution. Another part of the solution is transit.\nFor example the Eglinton subway extension which was finally started in 1994 after nearly 30 years of discussion.  It was cancelled by the provincial government in 1995.  Imagine if that had been allowed to be completed and the impact on the current gridlock. And imagine a cohesive vision for Toronto that is continued and added on to by successive governments instead of being destroyed and re-worked.\nA better use of government power might be the finish projects that have been started, like the Eglinton LRT.  This would have a greater impact on gridlock than to destroy some bike lanes.\nMr. Ford, finish what has been started on Eglinton and be open to the long term goal of creating a Toronto that is enjoyed by both it's residents and visitors alike.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this legislation as written on personal, financial, professional, and ethical reasons. I will be focussing my comments on the restrictions on (and removal of) bike lanes. Any reference to bike lane removal also applies to the restriction on new bike lanes, as bicycle network coverage is nowhere near complete in the 905, and needs to be improved in order to realize the benefits listed below.\nBike lanes give people more choice and protect vulnerable road users (including pedestrians). I rely on bicycle lanes to safely get to work, and take my kids to activities. I feel threatened by this legislation because it will force me to cycle in vehicular traffic where bicycle lanes are removed, or on sidewalks. Cycling in vehicular traffic is stressful, unsafe, and uncomfortable. I wear a helmet, but that will not protect me from 2 tonnes of steel moving at 50 km/hr. Bicycles also shouldn't be competing with pedestrians for limited sidewalk space, which slows bicycles down and puts pedestrians at risk. Bicycle lanes allow people on bicycles to travel faster and more securely, and protected, seperated bicycles lanes are more comfortable and safe for families and people who aren't already harcore \"cyclists\".\nBike lanes save people money. I also drive a car, but my spouse and I are able to save money and only have 1 car between us because there are safe and adequate bicycle corridors in my city in the 905 (although I want better coverage). My spouse already accepts that I put myself at risk when I cycle on areas without bike lane, and that it will take me longer to get around because I often have to go out of my way to find a safe route. The removal of protected bike lanes will make my travel take longer, be less convenient, and less safe. The suburbs needs a better connected network of bike lanes, not worse. The end result is there will be greater pressure for us to buy a second car, which we cannot afford.\nBike lanes save public money. Infrastructure for motor vehicles is expensive, large, and requires replacement often because of wear and tear from the weight of motor vehicles. Bike lanes can accomodate the same number of people in a smaller space without needing as much engineering or frequent replacement, because the bikes are lighter. The slower speed of travel and smaller vehicle size also makes collisions less likely, so it's easier for bikes to make turns and merges without needing as much extra space for turning lanes, queueing, etc. Restricting or removing bike lanes will require more public money for roadworks for motor vehicle traffic, and will be less efficient than bike lanes. Paying to remove existing bike lanes in favour of motor vehicle lanes is financially absurd; this will cost money while functionally reducing road capacity.\nBike lanes are good for businesses, when they are on main streets. People on bikes travel more slowly and make less noise than people in cars. It is easier to stop and shop when your vehicle is small, light, and maneuverable, so I am more likely to stop downtown for coffee, shopping, or appointments when I'm on a bicycle than when I'm in a car. And if I'm walking downtown, I would much rather the bicycles be in their own lane than competing with pedestrians for limited sidewalk space. If bike lanes have to divert around main streets, that is taking customers away from businesses and making sidewalks less comfortable for people already downtown.\nBike lanes are good for cities. I am an Urban Planner by trade, and I am aware of many problems that are caused or exacerbated when transportation choices are limited to private motorized vehicles. Bicycles allow for a greater number of people to travel in a smaller amount of space, and they are quieter, safer, and more sustainable than motorized vehicles. It is already difficult to convince developers and decision-makers to reduce parking rates or include more dedicated space for active transportation. Removing bike lanes will induce more demand for driving, and will result in more congestion, collisions, pollution, and inefficiency. This will make the Province's other goals around transit use and compact development more difficult to achieve.\nBike lanes in roads are a result of our previous transportation planning choices. Our cities could have been designed with a separate network of active transportation corridors, which would allow for greater speed and comfort for people on bikes without impacting motor vehicle road networks. However, most of our cities have presupposed that roads are for transportation, and pathways are for recreation (i.e. not straight or well connected). This means that roads are often the only practical location for active transportation from point A to B. Bike lanes shouldn't have to be in roads, but we've limited ourselves by our previous focus on motor vehicle transportation. If the province wants bike lanes off roads, it should provide a separate network of interconnected convenient active transportation pathways. This would be very expensive in built-up areas, but it would cost less than new controlled-access highways, and serve more people.\nBike lanes are especially necessary where transit is poor. In the suburbs, transit is not frequent or reliable enough to allow busy families to efficiently move between school, work, errands, and events. Bike lanes allow people to more quickly get from point A to B without having to backtrack or go off-course to catch a bus which may take 30 minutes or more to even show up. This requires having a network of safe bike lanes with good coverage and connections. Even where transit coverage is adequate, bike lanes allow for first-mile and last-mile connections to transit.\nBike lanes are good for people driving cars. I drive a car often, and I know that I would much rather a bicycle be in its own lane (better yet, in a protected buffered lane with a separating curb) than on the road in front of me. If people on bikes have to bike in vehicular traffic, that is more challenging for people in cars to navigate around, and slows people down. Bikes naturally are made for a slower speed than cars, and having separate lanes just makes sense to allow for better flow for different types of traffic. If bike lanes are removed, or made more difficult to install, more bikes will be in vehicular traffic, which will make driving worse, not better.\nMore motor vehicle lanes won't ease congestion. They will induce more people to drive, which will quickly fill any additional capacity and make traffic worse. We should be inducing demand for the kind of travel we want; this means building more protected bike lanes, not removing them or making them harder to build.\nI believe that this legislation is ill-advised and will result in more congestion, more collisions causing serious injury or death, and will make our cities worse places to live in. I am also very concerned that this legislation will exacerbate a culture war between people in cars and people on bikes, and stigmatize people on bikes. There is nothing inherently elitist or exclusionary about bikes; they cost less than motor vehicles to own and operate, they are easier to operate than motor vehicles, they support local business, they help people stay active and healthy, and they save public infrastructure dollars.\nI hope that these comments are helpful.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "We all know the plans to remove bike lanes is not about moving traffic. Bike lanes don't interrupt traffic. Construction does. And with the removal will be more construction. And after the removal cyclists will be back in the car lanes, where they have a right to be when there is no bike lane, and then they will slow traffic there, and endanger their lives. There are more people in Toronto without cars, than those with cars. And we all need to get around the city safely and quickly. Toronto is more than cars, and your plan will not make cars move faster.\nThe lives of the people in this city are more important than your power. More people will be killed by cars without the bike lanes. Cyclists still need to use those streets (Bloor especially).\nI urge you to keep Toronto bike lanes as they are, and leave the matter to the city.\n"

I am voicing my opinion in favour of bike lanes.\nEven as a driver, I find traffic smoother (if not faster) due to the improved lane structure where bike lanes exist.\nWe are at the limit of how many lanes of auto traffic we can accommodate. It is simplistic to think more lanes will reduce traffic congestion.\nIt is time to think about lane structure to improve flow and I believe this is the case along Danforth/Bloor and other areas with bike lanes.\nI will also state the obvious that the long term solution to reducing traffic congestion is to reduce the quantity of cars on the road. Encouraging people to take bikes by improving bicycle safety is critical to reducing traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is not a logical and effective response to traffic congestion. Instead, the bill will result in more people choosing to drive their cars and will further increase congestion. We need to encourage other forms of transportation: public transit by bus or train and active transportation (cycling and walking).\nSchedules 2 and 3 are devoted to the rapid creation of new highways. Not only will this cause further environmental degradation and loss of scenic and desirable green space, it will induce the creation of scattered communities and use of the automobile for commuting and general transportation.\nSchedule 4 places the problem of congestion on the creation of bike lanes, and takes away the ability of municipalities to plan for a future with fewer cars on the road. Bike lanes reduce congestion by making bicycling safer and encouraging people to use a bicycle for shorter trips (1 to 5 or 10 km). When combined with bike-friendly public transit (buses with bicycle racks, trains with accommodation for passengers with bicycles), bike lanes can provide the means for people to use their bicycle for longer trips.\nBuilding highways and curtailing safe cycling infrastructure will make congestion worse. This bill is ill conceived and will not be good for Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling has been my primary mode of transportation for over twenty years.  I also drive in the city, and walk.  The Bloor and Danforth bike lanes are part of my daily commute and they are always well-used by cyclists.  I rely on bike lanes to get home safely to my family, just like thousands of other people in Toronto.  Toronto's bike lanes have been put in place through careful planning and consultation over many years.  There has been ample opportunity for the public to be part of the planning process, and the democratically-elected Toronto City Council voted to put the infrastructure in place.  Bike lanes are about public safety, not cars versus bikes.  The Provincial Government's sudden anti-bike lane stance is anti-democratic and infuriating.\nBill 212 shows that the Ontario Government under Doug Ford is more concerned about a few minutes of time for motorists than it is about the safety and lives of people like me.  It's a punch in the gut.\nRegarding bike lanes, Doug Ford said in 2017 \"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city.  One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.   We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.  And I felt so much safer when it was separated\" (TVO \"Political Blind Date\" S1E2).  Ripping out infrastructure is the opposite of this.\nSix cyclists have been needlessly killed on Toronto's roads in 2024.  Five of these collisions occurred where there was no protected lane, or where the lane was illegally blocked.  Removing critical cycling infrastructure will result in further injuries or worse.  And for what?  Is anyone\u2019s time worth sacrificing someone else\u2019s life?  If the Ontario Government proceeds with this blatant jurisdictional overreach, any injuries or deaths where bike lanes previously existed will be due to the negligent actions of those involved in pushing through this horrible legislation.  It would be inexcusable.\nThe aggressive pushing through of Highway 413 is just as bad.  It is unnecessary.  It will not solve traffic congestion (experts in the field say it would only increase traffic through induced demand).  It would lead the the extinction of species.  It would pollute our water, reduce our ability to feed ourselves, and contribute to flooding.  It would be tens of billions of tax payer dollars spent on saving a few people seconds.  Common sense should be enough to quash this legislation.  Given the lack of common sense displayed in Bill 212, please consider this a reminder to do the right and responsible thing and stop trying to destroy Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Every scientific study that has been conducted in this subjected of bike lanes has demonstrated that bike lanes actually improve traffic. It calms down car drivers and provides an alternative for people to move. In addition if well designed it prevents accidents and decreases the potential of cars killing cyclists and pedestrians.  moreover, each cyclist in the road is one less car. Therefore it is disappointing that the current provincial government does not follow these studies or uses common sense. In addition, with the current climate crisis we should be creating incentives to alternative modes of transportation, not creating barriers. This proposed policy is  wrong and shortsighted. A recent study has shown also public heath benefits in New York City after the addition of bike lanes.\n"

I want our provincial government to focus on important provincial matters, and there are MANY more important issues that require the government's attention to implementing real solutions (health care, public transit, education for example). I also do not think it is helpful for the Premier of this province to blame and demonize a group (cyclists) which gives license to another group (drivers) to act more aggressively towards them because they feel emboldened that they do not belong on our roads. This is dangerous and irresponsible on the part of our \"leaders\". If you look at leading cities globally, they are installing more bike lanes to get people out of their cars and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Even if the provincial government oversteps and moves ahead with 'ripping out the lanes', there should be a plan to relocate these lanes, not simply remove them and make it more difficult to install new ones in it's place and in the future.\nPublic transit and cycling are the way forward to tackling Toronto's long term traffic congestion.  If you are removing lanes in the name of traffic, then please also announce where you are going to relocate them. There are more cyclists, particularly deliver drivers on every variation of a bike, than there were before the pandemic.  They will take up space on roads shared with drivers, creating congestion, frustration, and injuries or death.\nIf you persevere in making decisions that are not yours to make, then please share your plan for relocation, not just 'ripping them out'.\n"

        "comment": "RE: Bill 212 \u2013 An Act to enact two Acts and amend various Acts with respect to highways, broadband-related expropriation, and other transportation-related matters (\u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d)\nI am writing to request the reconsideration of Bill 212. My concerns relate to the provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure (i.e., bike lanes). There are five areas of benefit that bike lanes provide: improved safety for all road users [1] (including decreased dooring collisions, sideswipe, and rear end collisions)[2], increased economic outcomes for local businesses [3] and governments [4], reduced greenhouse gas emissions [5], decreased access gap for equity-seeking populations [6], and improved physical and mental health [7]. I will now focus on the health, equity, and safety implications of providing protected bike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is a key factor in reducing numerous chronic health conditions and improving individuals\u2019 mental wellbeing [8, 9]. Physical activity, such as through active transportation \u2013 walking, cycling, or other active modes of travel \u2013 is an effective way to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines that show increases to health, well-being, and fitness. Specifically, bike lanes can increase the total distance traveled by cyclists and the overall ridership of residents [10]. By replacing some car trips with cycling, research indicates that people can gain an additional nine life-years [11]. Moreover, by not incorporating physical activity into Canadians\u2019 lifestyles, the healthcare system is estimated to spend $6.8 billion per year due to the impact physical inactivity has on chronic diseases [7].\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately impacts equity-deserving populations such as racialized persons, people living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and Indigenous peoples. For example, lower income neighbourhoods have historically been poorly designed with increased safety and health risks. However, when active transportation is included into the neighbourhood design (i.e., sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit, roadways) social and health inequities are reduced [6]. Given transportation options, individuals can select the affordable and safe travel mode to participate in the workforce, access grocery stores, recreational facilities, and healthcare services [12]. This research is not unique as researchers and governments globally have identified that high-quality multi-modal infrastructure increases the use of active transportation, and its\u2019 associated social and health benefits [13, 14, 15, 16]. Additionally, when individuals have affordable transportation options, they have more money to spend on necessities such as food and rent, or extras such as goods from local business [7].\nThird, safety of all roadway users increases with the installation of bike lanes. As outlined by the Canadian Paediatric Society [17], cycling infrastructure that is well-connected (\u2018cycle tracks\u2019) has a halo effect where collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists decreased in a 500m surrounding area. Additionally, protected bike lanes are the safest option for all roadway users compared to painted lines, protected right of ways, and elevated lanes [18].\nHigh-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more people walking and cycling. Active travel has many proven physical and mental health benefits and impacts chronic disease prevalence. These investments need to be distributed equitably so that every community member can enjoy the benefits of active transportation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Ministry of Transportation Ontario. (2022).

        "comment": "I am not a believer on bike lanes to begin with.  I don't think bike lane has resolved traffic jams as much as cyclists claimed. One should study how much slowdown do cyclists caused on motorists trying to make right turns.  When cyclists, specially those on e-bikes, see a vehicle making right turns slowly, they would speed up from behind and flying straight through the intersection, yelling at the motorist as they passed you.\nI do not mind sharing the roads with cyclists as long as they obey the laws and there are police enforcing them.  I have not seen cyclist being fine for not having head/tail lights, do you expect motorist would get the same treatment when they have no lights whatsoever?  Their attitude towards motorists are hostile and they truly believed that they have a chip on their shoulder. The word courtesy is not in their vocabulary. Any time an accident occur involving a motorist and a cyclists, they would jump to the conclusion that the motorist is at fault.\nStop hiding behind the benefit shield of Green Environment and Healthy Life Styles, if cyclists would ride on the bike lanes in snowy days and -20 degree Celsius then they may deserve bike lanes.  Otherwise please consider using the sidewalk walking/jogging/running as your commuting options.\n"

Bike lanes on both sides have narrowed the avenue forcing drivers to pay more attention.\nThe intersection where I was struck is now a protected intersection, forcing drivers to slow down and approach the turn from a position that gives them more time to see a other road users crossing and more time for crossing road users to see a vehicle moving toward them.\nI was a pedestrian when I was struck, but safe street infrastructure protects everyone, not just cyclists. If University Avenue had had the same safe street infrastructure eight years ago that it has today, I would have made it safely to the other side and not experienced the pain, lost life time, year off work, and continuing effects of my injury.\nThe city is a place for people to live, not just drive through. Safe streets save lives and all road users benefit from cycling infrastructure and road calming measures.\nYet Doug Ford wants to remove this safe infrastructure and put peoples' lives at risk.
