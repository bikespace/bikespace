Does anyone on your team making these decisions even have lived experience as a cyclist? You are lacking the consultation needed to make informed decisions!\nFurthermore, why are you not referencing the data that Toronto and other cities in Ontario already have front the consultations they did before building existing bike lanes?\n"

        "comment": "This latest stunt by the Ontario Government to tear out bike lanes on Toronto\u2019s key streets is the epitome of tone-deaf, backwards policy-making, pandering to car-centric lobbyists at the expense of urban livability. Let\u2019s be clear: dismantling bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University isn\u2019t just short-sighted\u2014it\u2019s a betrayal of anyone who dares to envision a city that values safety, sustainability, and basic public health. The Ontario Government is single-handedly clinging to an outdated, pollutive model that has already turned our streets into gridlocked parking lots, all while insulting residents with the feeble claim of \u201cfighting gridlock.\u201d\nWho exactly do they think they\u2019re fooling? Cars cause the gridlock, not bikes. This mind-boggling attempt to rewind Toronto\u2019s progress isn\u2019t just clueless; it\u2019s a deliberate and hostile gesture towards anyone advocating for cleaner air, safer streets, and viable mobility options. By gutting bike lanes, the Ontario Government is choosing to lock Toronto into a dystopian, car-choked future where pollution spikes, accidents rise, and quality of life takes a nosedive\u2014all while pretending it\u2019s doing everyone a favor.\nAnd the hypocrisy is staggering. How dare the Ontario Government claim to \u201cconsider environmental implications\u201d while exempting itself from environmental assessments? This greenwashing is an insult to anyone with even a basic understanding of environmental responsibility. Let\u2019s call this what it is: a grotesque farce designed to placate developers and car manufacturers, no matter the cost to public health, safety, or the environment. Only a government profoundly out of touch with the realities of urban life would ever dream of selling this as a forward-thinking measure.\nBut perhaps most infuriating is the authoritarian overreach here. Forcing Toronto, a city that understands its own streets and residents better than any Queen\u2019s Park official ever could, to beg for permission just to maintain basic bike infrastructure is condescending and undemocratic. This isn\u2019t about \u201cpublic consultation\u201d or \u201cgridlock solutions\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a blatant power grab, an act of bureaucratic bullying aimed at stripping Toronto of its autonomy. It\u2019s provincial paternalism at its worst, and the Ontario Government\u2019s contempt for local decision-making is on full display. They are not protecting public interests\u2014they are enforcing a regressive car-first agenda that no progressive city would ever entertain.\nThis is more than just a policy blunder; it\u2019s a full-frontal assault on Toronto\u2019s ability to shape its own future. By undermining bike lanes, the Ontario Government is smothering the city\u2019s progress, robbing residents of their right to a safer, cleaner, and more accessible environment. This is a stark message to every Toronto resident that, as far as Ontario is concerned, they don\u2019t matter.\nIf the Ontario Government thinks it can bulldoze over Toronto\u2019s aspirations without a fight, it\u2019s in for a rude awakening. Toronto\u2019s residents have no intention of sitting idly by while their city is shackled by an outmoded, car-obsessed vision imposed by a provincial government that couldn\u2019t be further removed from the needs of urban life. This is a fight not just for bike lanes, but for the very future of the city itself.\n"

        "comment": "As a current resident of south Etobicoke and longtime Torontonian I am deeply concerned with the both the proposed bike lane legislation and ongoing rhetoric regarding cyclists and cycling infrastructure. I believe that our elected officials should represent the interests of all their constituents, regardless of their preferred mode of transportation. I sincerely hope the government reconsiders this legislation, this is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons:\n1. As both, car, pedestrian, cyclist, and transit user, I feel significantly safer on the street, regardless of transportation mode, since the bike lanes were installed. The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel.\n2. I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3. I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4. It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government claims to care about, taxes. I am confident that when there is a change in government, whether that\u2019s in 1, 5, or 10 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5. I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6. If this government is committed to relieving congestion they should focus their efforts on provincial matters that would have a much more significant impacts, such as getting the long delayed transit projects completed or investing in and funding public transportation across the province.\n7. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes offer significant benefits for the environment, safety, and traffic management. Environmentally, bike lanes reduce carbon emissions by encouraging people to choose biking over driving, which lowers air pollution and conserves natural resources. This shift helps decrease the carbon footprint of cities and contributes to cleaner air and a healthier urban ecosystem.\nFor safety, dedicated bike lanes separate cyclists from motor vehicle traffic, reducing the likelihood of accidents and promoting a safer experience for all road users. This dedicated space for bikes also encourages more people to cycle, leading to a more active, healthier community. In terms of traffic, bike lanes help ease congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road, particularly in dense urban areas. Fewer cars mean less traffic, faster commutes, and improved public transportation flow.\nGiven these advantages, the removal of bike lanes is absurd and it would be a step backward. It's crucial that the provincial government leave this decisions to cities and stop intervening to dismantle this essential infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "There are two key reasons why removing bike lanes is preposterous and dangerous: climate change, and safety.\nAt a time when the impacts of climate change could not be clearer, the last thing this government should be doing is taking away options that reduce driving. We've just come through some of the hottest October days ever recorded in Toronto (and much of Ontario). As a society, we need to shift away from reliance on personal vehicles and instead consider alternative modes of transportation. It is clear from how busy most of Toronto's bike lanes are that people are eager to get around by bike.\nThe Toronto Community Bikeways Coalition's \"Bike Counts on Bloor 2016-2024\" report found that bikes made up as much as 37% of road vehicular traffic during rush hour at key intersections such as Spadina and Bloor. The demand for biking is clear, when people are presented with the option to do so safely.\nThis brings me to my second point. As someone who commutes to work by bike in the exact lanes that are set to be removed, I fear for the safety of myself and others if these lanes get removed. I do not own a car, nor am I interested in owning one, as someone who lives in a highly accessible, walkable area of Toronto. When I have to go across town, my preference is to do so by bike, because I enjoy the fresh air, exercise, and ease of getting as close to my destination as possible. My behaviour will not change if bike lanes are removed, as I will continue to bike the same routes, but I am concerned that my life might. I and everyone else in this province deserve the ability to get to my destination without fearing that I will be hit by a car, or harassed by an aggressive driver.\nIn short, this decision is irresponsible, and will not only worsen the climate catastrophe that we face, but will also lead to more deaths on Ontario's streets.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government\u2019s proposal to rip out bike lanes from major arteries like Bloor, Yonge, and University is more than misguided\u2014it\u2019s a devastating blow to the health, safety, and prosperity of our communities. These lanes are not just nice-to-have paths for cyclists; they are veins pumping life into local businesses, essential safety corridors for thousands of Ontarians, and crucial pathways toward a sustainable future. Tearing them down isn\u2019t just a demonstrably poor choice; it\u2019s a willful betrayal of the citizens this government is meant to serve.\nEconomically, the bike lanes have been a clear success. The Bloor Annex BIA, as just one example among many, has shown that foot traffic and spending soared after the lanes were installed, with businesses reporting higher revenues and a steady flow of customers. These lanes aren\u2019t a passing trend; they\u2019re woven into the fabric of the local economy. With nearby property values rising and local shops depending on the increased foot traffic, the bike lanes support consistent economic growth. Destroying them would be economic self-sabotage, trading real financial gains for the illusion of a \u201csolution\u201d to congestion that will certainly not materialize and only deepen the city\u2019s traffic woes. Yet the province is willing to gamble with this success\u2014without consulting the people who live, work, and have directly invested in these improvements.\nThe government\u2019s proposal to rip out bike lanes in the name of \"easing congestion,\" in particular, is insulting. Cyclists don't just vanish when lanes are removed\u2014they are thrown directly into car traffic, creating more congestion, not less. We don\u2019t need a report to see this outcome; it\u2019s why we installed the bike lanes in the first place! Forcing cyclists to share lanes with cars will immediately slow traffic further and create a far more hazardous environment for everyone. With thousands relying on these lanes daily, eliminating them will bring back the chaos, more accidents, and dangerous conditions we had before. It\u2019s not just short-sighted; it\u2019s a disregard for the very safety and well-being of the community.\nFrom a health standpoint, this decision is even more damning. Cities with robust cycling networks report lower rates of chronic illness, lower healthcare costs, and better mental health among residents. Ontario is already grappling with deliberate healthcare cuts, and removing these lanes would push up costs even further as residents lose access to affordable, healthy transportation options.\nEnvironmentally, this decision is a massive step backward. Cities worldwide are adding bike lanes to cut emissions, improve air quality, and combat urban heat. Toronto\u2019s bike lanes directly contribute to lowering emissions and noise pollution, making the city more livable and pleasant for everyone. By removing these lanes, the province ignores the time, money, and planning that Toronto has invested in becoming a greener, more sustainable city, as if the progress we\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve simply doesn\u2019t matter.\nAnd finally, the process of developing this proposal transparently reeks of arrogance. The local BIAs and the residents who rely on the lanes the government is explicitly targeting with this proposal were completely left out of the decision-making process and, worse yet, condescended to in the media when they challenged the province's baseless assumptions. This lack of consultation is deeply dehumanizing, implying that the people who live, work, and contribute to this community don\u2019t deserve a voice in decisions that directly affect them.\nRemoving these bike lanes dismantles more than infrastructure\u2014it dismantles our trust in a government that should work for us, not against us. Ontario deserves leaders who listen, who respect our lived experiences, and who understand that meaningful progress is not something to be discarded for short-term political gain. The people of Toronto, the residents of Ontario, and every single community that has invested in safer, healthier, more sustainable streets deserve better than a plan that ignores the facts, disregards our voices, and sacrifices our future. This isn\u2019t just a step backward; it\u2019s a failure of leadership so profound it defies reason.\n"

People from the suburbs have said they would be more likely to drive in Toronto if bike lanes are removed. Drivers create gridlock, not cyclists. This is common sense.

Cycling reduces congestion. Removing these bike lanes will only make gridlock worse and endanger cyclists - why are drivers being prioritized? Cycling should not be treated simply as expendable, most have important places to go just like drivers.\nDiscouraging people from cycling will make traffic worse and make the pollution in this city worse. This is a short-sighted decision, and a waste of time and money.

This move would be a step backward in building a sustainable, healthy, and economically vibrant city.\nThe Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes serve as crucial arteries for thousands of Toronto residents who choose cycling as an affordable, environmentally friendly, and efficient mode of transportation. Removing these bike lanes would discourage cycling and lead to increased car dependence, counteracting efforts to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\nCycling infrastructure provides clear environmental, economic, and social benefits. Reduced car traffic lowers greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and helps mitigate the urban heat island effect. Numerous studies have shown that bike lanes increase local commerce by bringing more people to businesses without congesting roadways, enhancing the economic vitality of our communities.\nWhile I understand the objective of reducing gridlock, we must prioritize approaches emphasizing sustainable and diverse transit solutions. The long-term environmental and health costs of removing bike lanes far outweigh the short-term gains of adding car lanes. A future-focused policy must continue to support, not hinder, accessible and green transportation options like cycling.\nI urge the Environmental Policy Office to prioritize public health, environmental sustainability, and the long-term livability of our cities by maintaining and expanding cycling infrastructure in Toronto. I respectfully request a transparent and thorough consultation process with local stakeholders to ensure decisions are made in the best interest of all Ontarians, now and for future generations.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Sir / Madam,\nI strongly disagree with this proposal. This bill along with Doug Ford's recent attacks against bike lanes will be directly responsible for environmental damage, death on the road and worse quality of life for ALL Ontarians.\nThe province \u201cRecognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock\u201d. Our province IS growing, but this growth is not uniformly distributed.\nFor example, GTA's population growth of 3 million people is expected to account for 47% of the entire province's population growth between 2023 and 2051 (1). Given current traffic conditions on 401 and GTA, how is GTA supposed to accommodate the additional 3 million residents by 2051?\nAre all of them supposed to drive? New highways will be bottlenecked by ramps and arterial roads - should we add more lanes to arterial roads as well? Should we start removing sidewalks? What happens to buildings and houses that get in the way - should they be torn down?\nThe province also \u201cRecognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\u201d CARS worsen traffic congestion. Traffic worsens very time the province forces someone to drive rather than bike. Bike accidents never cause a lane closure or a hospital trip. If more people were encouraged to walk, bike or take the bus, then these problems would disappear altogether.\nMost cities in Ontario are well aware of this problem, which is why significant investments are being made at municipal level to incentivize biking and take cars off the street. All the progress that is made will be compromised if bike lanes are not connected and if this proposal passes.\nOther than the space that cars require, there are numerous other harms associated with car dependency globally. You can refer to the research paper (2), the YouTube video summary (3), or my summary in the appendix below. This provides ample reason for province to pivot towards alternative modes of transportation, or at the very least, allow people to bike if they choose to.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nADDRESSING COMMON OPPOSITIONS TO BIKE LANES\nI also want to present my arguments against common criticisms of bike lanes:\n1)\tOur weather is too cold and unfit for biking: People in Netherlands and Oslo continue to bike in winter with their gloves and jackets on. Besides last year we didn\u2019t see snow till the end of December. Most importantly, people should have the option to bike even if they choose not to.\n2)\tThere are far more drivers than bikers so they should be prioritized: Two issues \u2013 firstly prioritizing cars is not sustainable and comes with numerous harms as discussed above. Secondly cars should not be prioritized to the point where bikers are neglected completely. And at the very least, it should be the city\u2019s decision, it most definitely should not be a decision implemented across the entire province.\n3)\tNo one is using the bike lanes: Ask yourself \u2013 what stops you from biking on a sunny day? Typically, this is because they are not protected, feel unsafe, and aren\u2019t connected to the places you want to go. Montreal is building a network of protected bike lanes, and their biking population is on the rise every single year with the effect that there are fewer cars on the streets. If you were in Montreal, you\u2019d be far more likely to bike. We need more investment into bike lanes, not less.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nADDRESSING ISSUES UNIQUE TO ONTARIO\nOther than this, there are some considerations that are unique to Ontario which are discussed here:\n1)\tThis proposal actively undermines the $13.5B GO Expansion program. Metrolinx is working to provide better connectivity across GTHA with faster trains, two-way service and 15-minute frequency. However, passengers must by able to reach their final destination from the GO station with ease and without a car. The only place in GTHA where this is currently possible is in Downtown Toronto, but most tips in GTHA do not end at Union Station. For this reason, the GO Expansion will take far fewer cars off the streets than it is able to, and the province will see a very meagre ROI on the $13.5B investment.\n2)\tThis is jurisdictional overreach. The province should not be able to strong-arm decisions made by publicly elected city officials relating to mobility on behalf of their constituents. Especially not in Toronto where most people didn\u2019t vote Doug Ford in the first place.\n3)\tThis is a massive waste of taxpayer money. Doug Ford has said that the province will pay for removal of bike lanes that do not meet the criteria (which hasn\u2019t been specified yet). As a taxpayer it angers me when I\u2019m hard at work and 30% of my paycheck is taken, only for it to be wasted like this. Why is the province should be prioritizing this with our limited resources while our healthcare and education is struggling?\n4)\tDoug Ford said in 2017 \u201cWe have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d What exactly invoked this sudden departure from Doug\u2019s former position?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion I strongly oppose this proposal. I sincerely hope that the environmental ministry will faithfully weight the pros and cons of this proposal before making a decision, and I hope Doug Ford and his administration can provide more details about why they are proposing such an appalling bill in the first place.\nThe future of this province is in your hands. Please choose wisely.\nThank you,\nAryan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAPPENDIX: Harms to people and environment associated with car dependency.\nCATEGORY 1: decline in health and wellbeing\n1)\tCar crashes: Car crashed kill 3500 people every single day. This is roughly the same as 10-20 passenger planes crashing every day, killing everyone onboard. The number of permanent and life-altering injuries resulting from car crashes is significantly higher.\n2)\tAir, land and water pollution: Car exhaust is responsible for large quantities of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, sulphur dioxide, etc. Tires and break pads result in material aberration. Small particulate matter is especially dangerous as it passes through organic barriers with ease. Upto 90% of particulate matter in urban areas is traffic related. The combined result is an increased risk in respiratory and circulatory diseases, including cancer. Electric vehicles will produce less exhaust related pollution, but more material aberration as the vehicle is heavier.\n3)\tNoise pollution: Automobiles are the largest source of noise in urban areas. Health effects include high blood pressure, tinnitus and hearing loss, stress, anxiety, sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment.\n4)\tLight and thermal pollution: Roads and parking lots are required to be brightly illuminated at night, again causing sleep disturbance, and causing harm to birds and other wildlife. Large and wide asphalt roads also absorb heat and exacerbate heatwaves.\n5)\tSedentary travel: Human body is made to move. Sedentary travel increases risk of several cardiac and vascular diseases. Walking and biking regularly results in improved physical and mental health. Children have become especially sedentary, as car centric outdoor environments are dangerous for them. Proportion of children walking or biking to schools in US has declined from 48% in 1970s to 11% in 2017.\n6)\tSocial isolation due to car dependency: Results in increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline. Again, children are again particularly impacted.\nCATEGORY 2: Environmental damage\n7)\tCarbon emissions: 72% of all transportation-related CO2 emissions come from road vehicles.\n8)\tPollution from resource extraction: Oil extraction and mining for metals required for automobile manufacturing all have impacts on air, water and soil.\n9)\tTires: Tires are not biodegradable. About 35% of microplastics that are released into the ocean come from tires and road markings.\n10)\tOther pollutions: Road salt runoff contaminates freshwater ecosystems. Oil spills damage marine ecosystems.\n11)\tLand use: Roads fragment habitats for wildlife and result in wildlife collisions. Also results in habitat loss and exacerbations of natural disasters like flood and wildfires.\nCATEGORY 3: Social injustices\nBenefits and harms of automobility are not equally distributed.\n12)\tUnequal distribution of harm: Cars are designed for typical male anatomy. Women are 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car accident than a man.\n13)\tInaccessibility: Car-centric built environment is hazardous to people with disabilities and people with visual and hearing impairments. Prioritizing automobility also makes the environment inaccessible for those who can\u2019t afford or choose not to drive.\n14)\tUnequal street space distribution: Streets are for everyone but automobiles consume far more than any other mode of transportation. One person in a car requires the same amount of space as 20 people in a bus or a tram.\n15)\tParking: Parking space is useless to anyone not driving. Cost of free parking is baked into the price of goods and services, meaning non-drivers subsidize parking for those who drive.\n16)\tHousing: Space required to support automobility leads directly to scarcity of space for housing. One off-street parking spot consumes the same amount of space as the average living space per person in places like China and Spain.\n17)\tInequitable allocation of time: In 1974 the typical American make spent 4 of the 16 waking hours either driving, or earning the money required to drive. As more people drive, traffic worsens, and this problem only exacerbates.\n18)\tFinancial burden: Car-dependent built environment necessitates car ownership for rich and poor alike. Car ownership costs about $10k every year for most people, meaning owning a car for a month costs more than the price of a bike that will likely last for a lifetime.\n"
