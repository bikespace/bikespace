Province and Feds need to back off!\n- Removing bikes means more cars, even worse traffic!\n- Traffic is caused by bad highways (which the province is supposed to fix)\n- Traffic is caused by LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSIT - Metrolinx is to blame for not getting new crosstown lines done\n- Cyclists now need to bike in the road, causing MORE TRAFFIC\n- Residents want to bike, who is Ford to decide what people can and can\u2019t do\n- Lastly and most importantly, I was hit by a car while on a bike and bike lanes are the least we can do to protect and improve safety - safety first! Try to tell this to the families when they lose someone to cars.\nSick of it and will NEVER vote for Ford if he does this.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely terrible. Bikes and bikelanes are obviously not the cause of traffic congestion. Each one is many times smaller than a personal vehicle, and removing the lanes do not help the actual issue. Invest in alternative modes of transport, such as reliable public transit infrastructure. Stop redirecting attention to superficial issues such as bike lanes. We have bigger fish to fry, such as the state of healthcare, the cost of housing crisis, uncontrolled grocer greed, and the overall decline in quality of life. Address the things that actually matter instead of playing these partisan political games. Get your head on straight.\n"

The removal of bike lanes in Toronto will only have create an unsafe environment for cyclists, and have negative environmental impacts. Provincial approval for bike lanes will slow cities ability to create new bikes lanes, which are beneficial to reducing car traffic, increasing physical activity in the public, and decreasing harmful emissions.\n"

        "comment": "i have commented prior, but i would like to provide further points:\n1. the provincial government shouldn't be adding unnecessary red tape to municipal governments. this will just slow down the implementation of increased transportation options for the residents of the city\n2. they are essential infrastructure for me, like sidewalks. ripping out sidewalks for more lanes would be outrageous, and i believe it is the same for already-installed bike lanes like bloor, yonge, and university. something similar can be said for restricting sidewalks if they don't hinder a car lane\n3. the bike lanes provide safety to those who choose to ride bikes over other transportation methods. there have been six cyclists this year who have died from motor vehicle accidents. all six could have been easily preventable with proper infrastructure\n4. the bike lanes provide safety to those an the sidewalk. according to a study from toronto community bikeways coalition, the installation of the bike lane on bloor st w reduced sidewalk riding from 30% to 4%, or from 141 people on august 16 2023 to 30 people on may 23 2024\n5. they even benefit drivers. at least for me, i would rather have cyclists out of my way in their own lanes while driving, and proper bike infrastructure allows for that\n6. bike lanes help people get to transit stations, bringing in more ridership and thus helps support transit investments\n7. a point specifically for removing infrastructure that already exists on yonge, university, and bloor: this would waste so much taxpayer money. i thought the conservatives want to lower taxes? how will the conservatives fund this unnecessary change?\n8. the data is wrong as well. a survey from 2019 shows that many residents want to bike more. when asked opinions on the phrase \"i would like to travel by bike more than i do now\", 29% of all residents of toronto (including etobicoke, north york, and scarborough) agreed, and 38% somewhat agreed.\nfurthermore, the study by toronto community bikeways coalition cited in point 4 has also found that bike usage increased from 497 on august 16 2024, before the lane installation, to 694 on may 23 2024, after the installation, or an increase of almost 40%. it also found that bike traffic consisted of 37% of all road traffic during rush hour at the annex; specifically, between 8:00-8:30 AM at bloor and brunswick, and between 5:00-6:00 PM at spadina and bloor.\nwhy is giving the option for cycling with cycling infrastructure good overall? here are points for that:\n1. environmental reasons. it was 20 degrees in the middle of october, while this summer had multiple heat waves. it is just a good idea to give the residents of ontario a safe option to cycle with bike lane infrastructure\n2. more bike lanes give us the personal freedom to choose what mode of transit we would like to take. removing and restricting them would be directly limiting our freedom to choose what mode of transportation to use\n3. cycling is great for personal health. this is self-evident. less cycling infrastructure promotes a more sedentary lifestyle\n4. cycling allows for people to save money and live within their means. less cycling infrastructure would allow more people to save up\n5. promotes safe, family-friendly neighbourhoods where you can personally bike your kids to school before work\n"

        "comment": "Please don't remove the bike lanes. It's the only way for cyclist to bike safely. We will not purchase cars if you remove them, and the whole concept is backward. In Europe city centers are only allowed for resident cars and have good and cheap shuttle bus service to help people getting downtown. Also every km biked goes towards one's health, while every km on a car remove from personal health. And cars are also causes more pollution, trafic and deadly accidents. Keep bikers safe and help people be healthy.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI would like to start by stating my overall support for measures that reduce traffic and gridlock, particularly in the denser areas of our cities. However, I find this proposal to be counter to that motive and thus would like to express my concern.\nFirstly, as a happy suburbanite working a sedentary job in the downtown core of Ottawa, I would dearly appreciate the opportunity to bike to work. My one attempt nearly had me run-over, and I have not tried again. Since then, I have looked to the City of Ottawa's plans for added bike lanes with excitement, hoping that I will soon be able to incorporate exercise into my commute instead of actively damaging my health sitting in a car for as much as 2 hours a day. Many of my colleagues have expressed similar hopes, even of biking in the winter!\nSecondly, the rising cost of living makes biking more attractive for its lower cost of ownership. A bike costs a fraction of what a car does, and requires much less maintenance to boot. Infrastructurally, they also require much less road space and thus, presumably easier to support than large, heavy cars.\nThirdly, are we not facing a shortage of medical personnel? Have we not been told that exercise improves health outcomes, increases productivity, and reduces the need for doctors' visits? Why make it more difficult for people to get the exercise that they need and reduce the amount of effort needed to improve our doctor situation? If anything, I would have expected a push towards active transportation.\nLastly, I would like to say that bike lanes, like roads, derive much of their benefit from network effects: they become exponentially more useful and usable the more interconnected they are. As it stands, they are relatively sparse outside of our downtown cores and so one expects to see improving ridership as more are added and people feel safer riding instead of driving. Certainly, I am among that number. This proposal would actively reduce the number of bike lanes and thus hamper the network effects we want to see.\nI appreciate that the problem of gridlock is difficult to solve, and that there are many factors that make it easier to restore what we used to have, but I think that this is the wrong approach.\nYours faithfully\n"

We don't need Yonge to be the most direct route downtown for a car - we need vibrant neighborhoods with connected businesses. We don't need to rip up University Avenue for the sake of single occupancy vehicles - we need a connected network of safe cycling routes.\nThere is no war on the car, there's only cities trying to create more liveable spaces for the citizens who live and work locally.\n"

Cycling is better for congestion by reducing cars on the road, better for health and better for the environment. By removing these spaces, you\u2019re sending the city backwards and endangering the lives of all who commute through the city. There is absolutely no research that supports this government\u2019s claim that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion.

        "comment": "Re: Bike lanes and congestion:\nDo we believe in experts or not? Every single study has shown that bike lanes do not add to congestion, but instead reduce it. The governments own studies showed this - yet the spokesman clings to a study in 2011 (before the implementation of proper, safe bike lanes on bloor) to show they are unused - a ridiculous, outdated claim. If every cyclist either had a car, or took a full car lane traffic would be much slower and much less safe for all. Time and time again, construction is shown to be the cause of grid lock - the province should focus on hastening that. Furthermore, cycling is a more-green mode of transportation that we should be focusing on in addition to mass transit, not single occupancy vehicles.\nRe: Environmental impact studies of Highway 413\nThe fact that many of the governments own professional engineers working on the highway resigned in protest is all that needs to be discussed - the additional provisions in this bill to remove requirements for environmental impact studies (the intent of the language, if perhaps not the exact written words) is outrageous and suspicious. As a professional engineer myself, this is incredibly concerning conduct from the Ontario conservatives. Again, do we believe experts or not? \"Removing red tape\" is not sufficient reasoning to override the regulations written as a result of environmental disaster and loss of life.\n"

Years of planning and millions of tax dollars have been spent on these lanes. Ripping them out will cost additional millions and add to the congestion during this progress.\nThen there are the safety elements. Bike lanse separate cars and bikes. As both a cyclist and driver I appreciate the separation. When cycling down established I feel far, far safer and know that my chances of injury are much lower. Bike lanes SAVE LIVES, and reduce injuries.\nDoug Ford is the premier of Ontarion, he is NOT the mayor of Toronto. He should be focusing on province wide matters like health care, education provincial infrastructure, NOT bike lanes in downtown Toronto. Once again the Ford name is making Toronto a laughing stock.\nIf he succeeds in removing these lanes, rest assured they will be added once again when a new premier takes office.  More expense and time and energy devoted to something that already existed before.\nDoug Ford is a disgrace to his office and this province. I can't wait until he is voted out of office.\nGood Day, sir!\n"

Removing bike lanes and putting red tape on new bike lane development is going to negatively impact congestion, not make it better - it's basic urban planning. Look at cities like LA: adding an 8th car lane didn't solve their traffic problem. This is absurd and definitely not what Canada and Ontario should be striving to achieve.\nIf the argument is the low ridership, it is because there's not enough incentive. You should be discussing legislation to increase the number of bike lanes, not remove it.\n"

        "comment": "The choice to add bike lanes on municipal streets should be something that is decided by municipal governments not provincial governments. Cycling is growing quickly in Toronto and is already the fastest way to get around the city downtown. All you need to do is look on google maps and see the times of various forms of transportation to see that cycling is the way to go. We should be encouraging people to cycle not discouraging them.\nMost cars in the city are being driven by single drivers which not an efficient use of space in our cities.\nIt is a myth that bike lanes cause more traffic congestion. What causes congestion is cars, especially cars with only one passenger. It has been shown over and over again if you give more space to cars more cars will come and take up more space. Many studies have been done that prove this. Bicycles take up very little space and can move many more people in a much smaller space. This can be seen in many cities like Copenhagen, Berlin, London, Paris as well as Montreal. This is the way of the future and it would be a mistake for us to remove the lanes that have been installed instead we should be building more.\n"
