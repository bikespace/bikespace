        "comment": "Bloor Street is never going to be a free-flowing traffic artery. It never was. Bike lanes keep me safe.  As a cyclist and actual citizen of this city, I have a right to get downtown or to my place of work safely!  The Ontario Government needs to stop playing Mayor of Toronto and focus on more pressing provincial matters like crumbling school infrastructure and making it easier to find a doctor.  It's clear Ford and his government rely on questionable experts (if any at all) when their other big idea is a proposal for an underground tunnel beneath the 401.  So pardon me for questioning their \"evidence\" on how ripping up bike lines will benefit anyone.\nIt takes very little time to find studies from around the world that show how bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and benefit local businesses.  It's called Induced Demand.  Look it up.  (See Link)\nI wish this government would subscribe to the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" mentality - instead of the \"it works fine, let's break it' one.\n"

        "comment": "Hello.\nI am a Toronto resident in the University-Rosedale constituency. I travel around the city by bicycle, by car and by walking and transit. Averaged out over one year, I probably use all three modes about equally.\nThe expansion of bike lanes in the past five years has made me feel safer both when I am cycling and when I am driving. The bike lanes on Bloor Street in my area (Bathurst to Dufferin) took some getting used to. But when I am driving a car, I appreciate that they keep cyclists in a safer space away from my wheels, and they also provide strong visual signals to me and other drivers to be aware of bike traffic as we make right or left turns.\nWhen cycling in 2004, I was knocked off my bike on Bloor near Avenue Road by a car-door incident, fracturing my left hand. I was lucky the injuries were not worse.\nWe can't go back to those days. The Ontario government needs to recognize that Toronto's elected council is in the best position to plan the city's transportation grid in a way that keeps all users (including pedestrians, cyclists, transit users and drivers) safe and moves people efficiently.\nThe changes proposed in this bill will only send us backwards to a time that Doug Ford may be nostalgic for, but that no longer exists.\n"

People that drive will hopefully eventually understand that seating for extended periods of time surrounded by the cloud of fumes that even a hepa filter can't fully absorb is lame or that their cars are causing asthma in children is not cool or that walking and biking is fun or that climate change is real and their choices are important or that they don't want to drawn in an underground parking lot (climate change ie. valencia, ie. toronto) - will (hopefully) - stop driving. I hope that it's still more than the - cars this, cars that, cars, cars crowd. I understand that Ontario invested a lot of money in cars and electric batteries but unfortunately, at least in Toronto, we just don't have space for more of this things, with bike lanes or no. And the batteries can still be used to shut down the fossil gas plants and (eventually - nuclear power plants. I know - all of it is big business - but we just can't continue like that. Love.\n"

I am NOT OKAY with my taxes going towards REMOVING the bike lanes I actively use everyday, as biking in the city is my primary mode of transportation. I DO NOT see the cost to benefit ratio making sense for this bill to be passed.\nIf this bill gets passed, I am going to reconsider being a resident of Toronto which would be sad because not only will the government lose my votes and my family\u2019s, it   would also mean that the city won\u2019t benefit from the annual taxes I pay to the tune of thousands, and if we consider the future amounts lost both from me and my household, upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That might not mean much but I am sure there are other people who have similar feelings and that can add up to a lot of lost revenue, votes as well as the value provided to the society and to the economy of the city, province and the country by people like me.\n"

        "comment": "Given the age of the city of Toronto, in addition to the many hills, ravines, and streams that exist within the city, there are few to no alternatives to having bike lanes on major roads. Bike lanes on University Avenue provide critical safe pathways for healthcare workers, such as myself, to get to work on time and in a safe manner. Without these bike lanes, my and many of my colleagues' rides to work would be far more dangerous, and would lead to increased rates of injury amongst hospital staff. Bike lanes on Bloor Street cross the city, allowing for our interconnected communities to navigate the city core safely. Given the varied physical geography of the city, there exist no side streets that would allow for someone to cross the city in this area.\nIn addition to the safety concerns, bike lanes have been shown to increase rates of cycling in cities. As a public health physiotherapist, I am a mobility and wellness expert; increasing rates of cycling and active transportation in our communities is directly correlated with healthier communities, and thus reduced burden on the healthcare system and reduced healthcare spending.\nI implore you to read the following evidence-based article (link below) from the CBC describing the falsehood that building more roads/lanes will reduce congestion - \"The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion... Conversely, if you put in more dedicated bike lanes, people tend to feel safer and demand for use increases.\"\nIf our government's goal is to avoid worsening gridlock and reducing the quality of life in our cities, it is imperative that existing bike lanes be maintained, and that additional biking infrastructure is implemented to encourage the development of healthy, safe, and happy communities.\n"

Removing bike lanes/ preventing their installation will only serve to make municipal roads more dangerous and save motorists minuscule amounts of time. This measure is a gesture of this government to appeal to the car driving voters of the suburbs, and to appease a few misguided business owners. If you actually look at the data instead of opinion and anecdotes this decision is easy- keep the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Please accept the following comments relating to this proposed bill:\n1. Municipalities elect officials through a democratic process to make decisions in the best interest of the municipality to serve the local context of the municipality. Proposed provincial bills such as this will remove the voice of the local municipality on how it wants to plan and grow and in my opinion, is not a democratic approach.\n2. The Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA) process was developed back in the 1990s to guide good planning of municipal infrastructure including road and transportation projects. This process already provides a mandated mechanism for municipalities to review, plan, evaluate and design projects under an established and documented process and must consider all impacts of the project, incl. mandatory public and stakeholder engagement . The proposed bill will de-value the MCEA process that has been around for 3 decades.\n3. There are countless communities, especially rural communities across all of Ontario that are in need of improved provincial infrastructure, financial support and administrative assistance. The province of Ontario should focus its efforts on improving those needs rather than becoming involved in local and regional decision-making.\n"

        "comment": "I am not in support of this at all. It seems like an incredible overreach of provincial authority and an unnecessary addition of bureaucracy to what should be simple urban planning decisions.\nThere is no evidence at all provided that removing bike lanes will have an ameliorating effect on car travel times. In fact, even just a cursory search of the applicable urban planning literature indicates it would have the opposite effect. Improving car travel times requires the expansion of transit and active transport infrastructure.\nThere is also the very clear impact this will have on the safety of cyclists. We should be advocating for policies that will protect the safety and well-being of all residents, including those who walk and bike. Not sacrificing the for the appearance of savings a few seconds travel time for motorists.\nThis whole program has been incredibly disheartening. Having only recently moved to Ontario for Montreal, the north American city with the best cycling infrastructure, this seems to be a step in the wrong direction. One that makes me regret the move. It is clear that my health and safety is of no concern whatsoever for this government. Shame!\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bikes lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Ave will make cycling in the downtown core much more dangerous for cyclists. There have already been six cyclist fatalities in Toronto in 2024, and countless injuries, and removing the bikes lanes will only increase these numbers. There is also no alternative form of transportation being offered to cyclists. Will public transit be improved in order to fill in the gaps left by the removal of the bike lanes? If not, then the removal of bikes lanes will simply make cycling more dangerous in Toronto, as cyclists will not turn to other forms of transportation, but will be risking their lives in order to continue cycling downtown. In fact, it\u2019s likely that the removal of bike lanes will force cyclists to make more dangerous manoeuvres when cycling, which will increase the amount of accidents happening on the road. In summary, although the removal of bikes lanes may offer a marginal decrease in traffic congestion, it will certainly do so at the cost of cyclists\u2019 lives.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is either misguided or willfully not interested in reducing traffic gridlock, for the following reasons. The most efficient way of reducing traffic is to decrease the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes will push some of the people who currently commute and travel by bike to driving instead, counter-productively increasing the number of cars on the roads. Conversely, creating new and maintaining existing bike lanes increases the number of people choosing to cycle, convincing those who would otherwise be uncomfortable cycling in the city. This, again, decreases the total number of cars on the road, helping to alleviate gridlock. But perhaps worse, this bill does not consider the severely harmful effects that it will bring on if approved, besides being ineffective against its goal. Protected bike lanes save lives, safeguarding Toronto cyclist residents against the passing traffic or the traffic turning right. Just recently, a young woman was killed right in front of the ROM, on a cycling route I myself take regularly. It is incredibly distressing to me that the Province doesn't seem to care whether I, and thousands of others, would survive our commute to work. Importantly, bike lanes on Bloor and University that are proposed to be removed are ones of the few protected bike lanes in the city. Removing bike lanes will take away the only mode of transportation from and isolate many people, e.g. those disabled or from a lower economic class. Removing bike lanes will cost a whooping estimated $48M, money that could certainly be better spent on many pressing issues in our city. This expense would be in addition to the money spent building those bike lanes in the first place, and not that long ago, making that expenditure being absolutely in vain. Finally, removing bike lanes is in direct contradiction with all goals aimed at reducing the effects of climate change and reducing emissions. It would be an enormous mistake and a big step back to approve this bill and it would certainly be widely opposed and provoke an even bigger outrage than it already has.\n"

If your policies were based on true transportation principles, rather than the prospect of securing short term votes by vilifying bike lanes amongst suburban voters, the basic concept of 'induced demand' would shut down your own argument immediately.\nIf this current government considers this a truly sound, non-politically motivated bill, I would please ask you to share your data with the public on how Bill 212 will solve gridlock.
