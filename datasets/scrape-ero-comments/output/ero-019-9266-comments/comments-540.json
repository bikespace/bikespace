        "comment": "The city's own historical data from the 2011 removal of bike lanes on Jarvis shows that removing bike lanes will result in:\n- more accidents\n- more fatalities\n- increased costs for the city and province in healthcare, emergency and legal services\n- longer commute times\nThis measure\u00a0also sends a loud and clear signal to constituents: that the Ford and provincial government, and those that support this bill, do not care about the lives of residents. Removing the bike lanes will see more fatalities and injuries for anyone who rides a bike (children, youth, adults, seniors).\nThe initial cost to remove bike lanes, and the subsequent cost to maintain roads, healthcare (as a result of increased pollution, and injuries), and legal fees (as a result of increased lawsuits) could be allocated to other measures that would better serve the province as a whole.\nWhat's striking to me on this bill is that it focuses so much cost on one city, while ignoring the rest of the province when money could be better spent serving the entire province that the provincial government was elected to do.\nThis means that not only does the government and the Bill 212 supporters not care about the lives of residents, they blatantly disrespect them and the faith the people put in them. This is irresponsible across many fronts.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with this. City traffic management should not be a provincial matter, the majority of MPPs elected do not live in Toronto and have limited or pigeonholed experience as to traveling in it. I do not feel comfortable with constituents in the rest of Ontario having more say in Toronto city planning than I do as a resident for my entire life. This matter should be left up to local governments who are elected by the residents of the city the changes are proposed in as they are the ones whose lives are most affected by it. The Ontario government's consistent exploitation of the power given to them by the City of Toronto Act has eliminated any good faith that I see in this decision. To me, this looks like suburban drivers trying to control urban travel so that it's most comfortable for themselves.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed Bill 212 is an affront to local democracy, sound planning, and represents an intention on the part of the provincial government to reduce affordability and quality of life in the City of Toronto. It reflects a large, inefficient, and wasteful government. The requirement for municipalities to obtain provincial approval for new bike lanes is by definition \u201cBig Government\u201d, and I oppose this strongly, but I will focus my comments here on the portion of the bill that calls for the removal of bike lanes on Yonge St, Bloor St, and University Ave.\nI am a young professional who lives on Yonge street, next to the existing bike lane. I own a car, drive, take transit, and cycle, depending on what is the most efficient mode of transportation for my trip. I consider myself lucky to have these choices, and to live in a city that has made great progress on delivering transportation options to its residents.\nI am also a political conservative. I believe in small government, low taxes, and personal responsibility. It is because of my conservative principles that I oppose this bill.\nFirst, this bill is wasteful, and shows complete disrespect for taxpayer dollars. Much time, effort, and resources have been spent developing and installing the existing bike lanes mentioned in the bill. In many cases, they have required complete road re-construction, such as along Bloor St. and University Ave. Ordering them to be removed so soon after they have been completed is wasteful.\nSecond, this bill would worsen affordability. Bike lanes provide residents with options for how they will get around the city. While cycling is not appropriate for every trip, it is very useful for short to medium commutes. I use the Yonge and Bloor bike lanes frequently to commute from my home in Midtown to my office in Leslieville. Of all my transportation options, it is by far the most affordable. Given the affordability crisis we are experiencing (which affects my generation most acutely) I find it absurd that the government would seek to make it more difficult to commute affordably. Cars, car insurance, and gas are expensive - why does the government want to incentivize citizens to spend more than they have to?\nThird, this bill represents inefficient planning. I drive along Yonge street often, and I find it to be a better experience with the bike lane in place. I do not have to worry about cyclists who are too close to my car, and can focus on the road ahead of me. If the Province truly wanted to increase road capacity, they may start with removing the full lane along Yonge that is currently allocated to street parking.\nFurthermore, removing these bike lanes will not solve congestion. Toronto is a big city. More cars on the road is not possible given the limited space we have. A government that was interested in efficiency would recognize the value of transport modes that use less physical space - i.e., bikes and transit, and work to improve their respective infrastructure.\nFinally, this bill represents government incompetence. Ontario is facing numerous crises, whether that be affordability, health care, or housing. The TTC subway is in complete shambles (see the growing \u201cspeed restriction zones\u201d), and the Crosstown LRT and Finch LRT are both delayed. The provincial government of Ontario focusing on three bike lanes in the City of Toronto is an attempt to distract from the real problems that the government is unable, or unwilling, to solve.\nIt is for these reasons that I strongly oppose this legislation. I hope the government will reflect and reconsider its position, and in future develop policy in accordance with the conservative principles it claims to hold.\n"

I believe most statements and gestures are made to procure votes in the next election instead of for the greater good of the general public. The Ontario government let safety inspection checks slide on Long Term Care Homes leading to poor staffing and so many deaths when that should have been a priority or maybe the Ontario Government doesn't see those residents as important voters so instead they pander to those who want cheaper beer and to develop construction projects on previously protected green spaces and to enrich their friends.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government would be up in arms if the federal government encroached on affairs under the purview of the province, but has no problem doing the same to municipalities, undermining the years of expertise municipal government workers have brought to designing cycling infrastructure.\nUrban centres around the world have come to understand that, with increasing populations, cars can't be the primary mode of transportation for its citizens and that transportation infrastructure needs to be multi-modal. Every drives that chooses a bicycle over a car reduces gridlock, and that choice is based on having safe and efficient biking infrastructure. The argument that cyclists can be shifted to secondary roads shows the provincial government's ignorance of the expert municipal advice that has already considered all options and built cycling infrastructure accordingly.\nUnfortunately, I think most know that the provincial government hasn't made municipal cycling infrastructure a suddenly critical issue based on facts but rather a communications strategy to draw attention away from the Greenbelt scandal, the destruction and selling off of Ontario place to private corporate interests, the failure of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, etc.\nWe need a government that stays in its lane and makes decisions based on facts and expertise. Unfortunately, we don't have that in this government.\n"

        "comment": "Safe and connected active transportation links and well-functioning and affordable public transportation are two proven methods to reduce congestion. When people have a safe, affordable and convenient option it has been proven over and over again that they will change their habits to take it.\nRemoving existing services, and discouraging  further development of this infrastructure is counter-intuitive. Fewer people choosing to travel using active modes and public transportation means more car congestion on roads.\nWhen people who must use active transportation have no protected options and are forced to share lanes with vehicles, traffic is slowed further and is more dangerous, with severe consequences for both the vulnerable road user and the vehicle operator who harms them.\nBike lanes and bus lanes do not cause congestion -- they alleviate it. Every person on a bike, on foot, or on public transportation is one less car on the road. Please invest in support for those alternative modes, not in thwarting them. Ontarians will thank you for it.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who regularly cycles, walks, AND drives to get around, I do not support the removal of bike lanes as listed in the proposal or providing the province with the ability to review and propose other bike lane removals of other streets.\nBike lanes have encouraged me to cycle, as I am concerned with safety, and it's a big barrier for me to cycle. As a driver and car owner, the bike lanes have not negatively impacted my ability to drive and get around the city.\nThere is also the financial and environmental cost of proceeding with the proposal that concerns me. Bike infrastructure is important in any world class city that wishes to meet it's climate targets and I will feel deeply disappointed if we back track on our bike lane routes.\nUnless the province and city can identify direct route alternatives to existing bike lanes, I don't see how this will be an improvement. For example, along Bloor Street West between st. George and Dufferin, there are no direct parallel alternative bike lanes, so removing the Bloor bike lane makes no sense to me.\nI have used my bike to run errands along Bloor where possible, as it's more convenient than driving. Bike, walk, TTC or drive is my hierarchy of preference due to the convenience and cost effectiveness.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212 on the grounds that it is both unfair and unwise.\nFirst, the government should not be playing favourites with the type of constituents it makes infrastructure for - it should be working to help everyone not just those who can afford a motorized vehicle!\nFurthermore, the provincial government should not be micro-managing down at the municipal level. As Doug Ford has even gone so far as to name specific bike lanes he wants removed, it is clear he has a personal bias and is not making an objective decision based on data or feedback from his constituents. The city had already undergone extensive research prior to installing the bike lanes - not only is he ignoring that data, he is showing an incredible lack of respect for the the city and the concept of working together with others.\nSecond, as someone who has lived in and visited other places with better cycling policies, infrastructure, and use, and knows other major global cities like Paris are making it a priority to re-configure their traffic infrastructure to encourage greater bike use, it seems clear to me that this would be a major step backwards for Toronto, and other communities in Ontario.\nI think we can agree there's no more space to add car lanes within many cities, therefore, we need options that move more people using less space like the subways and trains. But while those projects need significant time for construction, another thing we can do is compact the type of vehicle using the existing lanes and that is bikes! Safe secure bike lanes are much quicker to create than subways/trains and provide incentive for more drivers to switch how they get around. For every one person that moves from a car to a bike, some space is created.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212!\n"

        "comment": "Once again we have a bill that undermines the importance of developing mobility options for everyone, in favour of temporary wins for drivers. Along with highway upgrades, this bill demonstrates a lack of understanding of the time-tested fact of induced demand and falls prey to fallacies that have plagued highway projects for years (https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/highway-robbery/). The sprawl of suburbia and zoning restrictions are the real contributors to our traffic woes (https://medium.com/@SullivanIsrael/this-map-says-it-all-3fcbdd05bf9b). Anecdotally, I don't want to drive - I want to get where I need to go quickly and efficiently. That's a notion that holds true for the majority of Ontarians.\nWhen we compare the usage of our roads vs bike lanes, it's very important to consider the incompleteness of our bike network. Imagine if that same incompleteness was present in our road network, people would opt for whatever transit mode was most efficient. We need to reduce our dependance on cars. Invest in multimodal forms of transit to build an efficient complete network that doesn't rely on cars - bike lanes are an important part of that. Car driven development is not just bad for people without cars, but cities themselves. Ignoring the impact of sprawl on our utilities, the impact of increased vehicle traffic is bad for our businesses. When people are on foot, commuting by public transit or biking, they engage with local businesses. Drivers tunnel-vision on their destination, do not engage with local business, cost our province billions, and are responsible for more than 100 thousand  minor, major injuries and deaths in Canada alone (https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/statistics-data/canadian-mo\u2026). When we just look around, it's so obvious that better solutions exist. We need bike lanes. We need to invest in our public transit. We need to make it just as convenient to use multimodal forms of transit as driving. We can and we should! Let's not set ourselves back again. That would be stupid.\n"

        "comment": "The new and old bike lanes make such a difference when trying to commute. Since they've updated the ones on college and university I actively choose biking over driving to work 80% of the time, even when the weather is poor, vs before when I would do it maybe 20% of the time. The bloor bike lanes make a huge difference to my choice of transportation as well. I went out and bought fenders for my bike for rainy days and better gear to protect me from the weather because biking is just a nicer experience now. I am a driver who has gotten off the road since these bike lanes have been put in. If you take them away it will do nothing to help congestion because me, and many others, will just get back into our cars. Those take up a lot more space than if we're all on our bikes. Leave the driving to those who don't have the option. Plus, if those who don't have a car are biking instead of say, taking the TTC, it relieves TTC overcrowding, thereby encouraging others who can't bike to take it as a convenient and fast option. Furthermore, the company who operates the city bikes noted a significant increase in usership (I believe it was 120%) in the latter part of this year - not so coincidentally since there have been major bike lane improvements. If that's not enough to prove that bike lanes on \"priority\" streets are encouraging people not to drive when they don't have to, I don't know what is. Even food couriers who use e-bikes a probably benefitting from these lanes. If you make it more dangerous and difficult to do their jobs in this way, they will also start opting to drive a car instead. Removing the lanes will make everything worse.\n"

Elected representatives in cities are making common-sense decisions to make streets safer and more inclusive, including by creating more separated bike lanes and reducing car lanes where it's appropriate. I do not trust the province to make safe transportation decisions for anyone while their guidelines for where bikes belong includes in busy left-turn lanes of 70 km/h, four-lane roads. Cities are making transportation networks with separate infrastructure for different modes of transportation, and this legislation threatens to set our cities back decades, to cause more traffic deaths and injuries, and further separate us from our neighbours and communities.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove recently installed bike lanes in Toronto. As a careful cyclist who has experienced close calls with vehicles, the presence of protected bike lanes has been crucial for my safety and well-being. These lanes have significantly reduced my anxiety about city cycling, encouraged me to ride more frequently, and positively impacted my physical health.\nBeyond personal experience, evidence demonstrates that maintaining and expanding bike lanes is economically beneficial, environmentally responsible, and essential for the safety and prosperity of our community.\nEconomic Benefits\nStreets with bike lanes have been shown to boost local businesses and stimulate economic activity:\nIncreased Retail Sales: A study evaluating the Bloor Street bike lanes found that businesses \talong the corridor experienced an increase in customer visits and sales after the installation of \tbike lanes. According to the City of Toronto, local merchants reported a 4.45% increase in \tcustomer spending and a 7.15% increase in the number of customers served after the bike lanes \twere installed1.\nCyclist Spending Habits: Research by the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation (TCAT) \tindicates that cyclists and pedestrians tend to visit local businesses more frequently and spend \tmore per month compared to drivers. TCAT's study found that cyclists spend 24% more per \tmonth than those who drive2. This consumer behaviour supports small businesses and \tcontributes positively to the local economy.\nReduction in Traffic Congestion Costs\nEnhancing cycling infrastructure encourages more residents to choose cycling over driving, reducing traffic congestion and associated economic costs:\nShift to Active Transportation: The City's ActiveTO initiative, launched in 2020, led to \tsignificant increases in cycling trips. The City of Toronto reported a 61% increase in weekday \tcycling volumes on corridors with new bike lanes3.\nHealthcare Cost Savings\nPromoting active transportation like cycling can significantly reduce the incidence of chronic diseases, leading to substantial healthcare savings:\nImproved Public Health: According to Toronto Public Health, increasing cycling and physical \tactivity helps reduce rates of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Physical inactivity costs \tOntario's healthcare system approximately $3.4 billion annually4.\nEnvironmental and Long-Term Economic Impact\nIncreased cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants, contributing to environmental sustainability and economic benefits:\nReduction in Emissions: The City's TransformTO Climate Action Strategy indicates that \ttransportation accounts for about 38% of Toronto's greenhouse gas emissions. Expanding \tcycling infrastructure is key to achieving the goal of net-zero emissions by 20505.\nSafety and Productivity\nProtected bike lanes enhance safety for all road users and reduce economic losses due to accidents:\nReduction in Accidents: Studies have shown that the installation of protected bike lanes leads \tto a decrease in collisions involving cyclists. Research published in the American Journal of \tPublic Health found that streets with protected bike lanes saw a 90% reduction in injury risk \tcompared to streets without such infrastructure6.\nCycling as an Essential Part of the Transit System\nCycling is an essential part of Toronto\u2019s transit system, particularly as a last-mile solution connecting users to major transit hubs. While recent investments in transit are commendable, they come late, and micro-mobility options like cycling remain critical to meeting demand. With Toronto\u2019s population booming, more residents are cycling not just to commute but to access local businesses, visit family, and run daily errands. The oft-cited 1.2% cycling commuter rate from 2011 is outdated and fails to capture this broader use. In a dense, urban area like Toronto, where space is limited, cycling provides an efficient alternative to driving and takes up far less space, making it crucial as we face housing and infrastructure challenges. Expanding road space for cars is impractical in such an environment; supporting cycling is a more sustainable, effective solution.\nConclusion\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes is counterproductive to economic growth, environmental sustainability, and public safety. Evidence demonstrates that bike lanes:\n- Boost local economies by increasing retail sales and supporting small businesses.\n\t- Reduce congestion costs by promoting a shift to active transportation.\n\t- Save healthcare dollars by improving physical and mental health outcomes.\n\t- Mitigate environmental impacts by helping to meet climate action targets.\n\t- Enhance safety by reducing the economic and personal costs of accidents.\nGiven these significant benefits, I urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the proposal and focus on expanding, rather than removing, cycling infrastructure. This approach supports the economy\u2014which is a paramount concern\u2014and ensures a safer, healthier, and more sustainable future for Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "If there are more cars on the road, there is more traffic. Because the additional cars take up more space and break more often. More cars means less room for everyone. They are crowded together (congestion.) If some people are using bikes instead of cars, there are fewer cars crowding the roads. This means there is less traffic and less congestion. Additionally, construction slows traffic and increases congestion.\nRipping up bike lanes both puts more cars on the road and slows traffic through construction. It creates two new problems where there were 0 problems. the only way to further decrease congestion is to create MORE non-car public transportation options like trains/subway systems, busses, and bike lanes. To remove more cars from the road. The change proposed here will make congestion significantly worse. it\u2019s a terrible idea.\n"

        "comment": "I very strongly oppose the proposed legislation. Deciding where to build cycling facilities, and getting the subsequent Complete Street design as part of a complete network, is a complex task. It requires detailed knowledge of local pedestrian, cycling and car traffic patterns, possible alternative routes for cars, and the desires of the local population for alternatives to car travel for commuting, errands, and recreation to destinations across the city. The local context is critical. City staff are experts in transportation planning, and can consider all of these factors. Decisions should be made at the local level, not by a provincial politician. The additional red tape will delay valuable improvements in the Waterloo Region, while adding  wasteful costs.\nBuilding safe cycling facilities will inevitably lead to replacing trips that were taken by cars with trips by bikes, reducing road congestion. However, the impact is not necessarily immediate. New cycling facilities need to be accessible from other safe cycling routes as part of a network and provide time for residents to adopt a new way to travel. Maximum cycling volume will come when the cycling route is part of a strong network that allows cyclists to safely go to many desired areas of the city, including along major roadways.\n"
