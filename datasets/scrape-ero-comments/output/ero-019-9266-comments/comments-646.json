Bike lanes are critical in encouraging Torontonians to bike.  Biking is a greener way to get around, also reducing car traffic and therefore reducing congestion.   Biking keeps people fit which is also good for Canadians.\nWe want the bike lane network in Toronto to be expanded, definitely not shrunk.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario taxpayer who uses the bike lanes in Toronto almost daily - I can only say the proposal to remove existing bike lanes is entirely ignorant. It goes against study after study of data and will do nothing to combat the (real) issue of congestion in the city.\nMore often than not there are just as many bikes on some of the Bloor street sections as there are bikes! Not to mention, there are entire \"car traffic lanes\" dedicated to the storage of non-moving cars. Surely they should be targeted if the goal is to provide more space to moving cars?\nOn top of that, it is a frightful waste of money - some of the quotes I am seeing suggesting it will cost up to $50million to achieve. Ridiculous. Put that money instead into our failing healthcare system Mr Ford.\nFight the battles that actually need to be fought.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is absurd. To fix the issues with traffic in the city, we need more alternative transportation options that are safe and reliable. Bike lane infrastructure is an obviously great way to provide people a safe lane to use so they can bike to work and not have to drive. I drive to work previously, and with the addition of the university ave and bloor st protected bike infrastructure, I can now bike to work without being scared for my safety. If these lanes were removed (which is silly considering they are excellent infrastructure that were very recently installed) I would be forced to return to driving, adding additional commuter traffic. Bike lanes are a part of the solution, not the problem at hand.\nWhat the provincial government should be focusing on, is getting Metrolinx in order to complete the larger transportation infrastrucure projects done within a reasonable timeframe and budget. There are multiple billion dollar plus projects that face undue delays, and the time lag of getting the LRT lines online is an actual problem that results in more people driving day to day.\nRemoving the bike lanes would be a uneconomical disaster, please be sensible.\n"

        "comment": "As far as I can tell the proposal to remove bike lanes is ideological, as the Government has yet to provide research or evidence on which it has based its decision. Notably, removing bike lanes will increase gridlock because people who now bike to work will be unable to continue doing so safely, and so will choose to drive instead. Additionally, this is a fiscally irresponsibly decision as it will cost money to remove bike lanes that cost money to put in only a few years ago, some much more recently. And, also irresponsibly, during the lengthy construction process of removing bike lanes gridlock will become even worse and more unbearable. This is also a fiscally irresponsible decision in that in being forced to drive more and take public transit, the Government is forcing Ontarians to spend money we don\u2019t have (it seems to have gone unnoticed by this tone deaf and out of touch Government that biking is free). Lastly, this proposal is unethical and immoral because it risks lives.\n"

Just open up 407 for commercial vehicles.\n2) As a tax payer, cyclist and resident of the city, I think it is abhorrent to suggest removing bike lanes from key roads in Toronto. Bike lanes move more people faster, boost business for local establishments and save lives. More cars cause more traffic, not bike lanes. Cyclists are tax payers too, and deserve to move around the city using infrastructure that their tax dollars have helped to fund.\n3) Paying more money to remove bike lanes is ridiculous. This money should be spent on healthcare and education.\n"

        "comment": "We live in a city. The entire point here is that we\u2019re able to rely on smaller circuits of commuting and the ability to use public transit and cycling on a smaller network. We know North America focuses on cars. We know that\u2019s the point and that the provincial government currently wants to push out Torontonians on bikes.\nThe bike lanes we have on main roads need to be majorly improved, not removed. This is all a tactic to make cyclists simply happy they didn\u2019t lose any infrastructure instead of improving it.\nThe province shouldn\u2019t have jurisdiction on this. We need bike lanes, and we need them to be safe. We need them on main routes so it\u2019s easier for people who actually live here and use green transport to get around this city.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to you as a concerned resident and cyclist of Toronto to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes the removal of bike lanes in our city. This bill not only undermines our community's progress towards sustainable transportation but also poses a direct threat to the safety of cyclists, including myself and my children.\nResearch consistently shows that bike lanes can actually help alleviate road congestion. Cities like New York and London have demonstrated that bike lanes can reduce car traffic in urban areas by providing a safe, alternative mode of transportation, thereby decreasing the overall number of vehicles on the road. Furthermore, a study from the University of Colorado Denver found that bike lanes can lead to a smoother flow of traffic, improving travel time reliability for all road users.\nMore critically, removing bike lanes will significantly increase the risk of accidents and fatalities among cyclists. Bike lanes provide a designated safe space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of collisions with vehicles. Without these lanes, cyclists are forced to share the road with motor vehicles, greatly increasing the potential for serious accidents. The proposed removal of bike lanes by Bill 212 not only threatens the lives of cyclists but directly endangers the lives of families, including mine.\nThe implementation of Bill 212 would be a step backward in our city's commitment to safety, health, and environmental sustainability. I urge you to consider these points seriously and oppose Bill 212. We should be working to enhance and expand our bike lane infrastructure, not dismantle it.\nThank you for considering my concerns. I hope you will stand with us, the citizens who seek a safer and healthier Toronto, in opposing this harmful legislation.\n"

        "comment": "I think this proposal is not only a bonkers approach to the congestion problem, it also feels like extreme provincial government overreach into the affairs of Toronto.\nCars are extremely space inefficient. Increasing car volumes with another lane is absolutely not the solution to reduce city congestion. Induced demand will incentivise more driving, and we will be back at square one regarding congestion. As we have known since the 1940s, the only way to reduce car congestion is to bolster other means of transit, so that fewer people feel the need to drive to get around.\nA bicycle lane can carry far more people per hour than a single lane of motor traffic. The funds used to destroy public infrastructure that had already been built would be MUCH better served on projects such as streetcar signal priority, additional bike infrastructure and funding for the TTC.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is so problematic and short sighted.\nFirst, the province should not over-rule the city's careful process of planning and decision making. Toronto's mobility infrastructure and policy should primarily be decided by the people who live here and rely on these roads every day.\nSecond, removing bike lanes or preventing future lanes is not an evidence-based reaction to excessive congestion in the city. There is a strong research base that tells us about \"induced demand.\" i.e., Adding another lane for cars will ease traffic congestion for a very short period before they \"induce\" (encourage) more car use, resulting in a return to high congestion.  Ultimately, we cannot ease Toronto's congestion by encouraging more driving. The population is increasing. Without shifting people to TTC and cycling, the number of cars on Toronto's roads will only increase.\nSay you take away the bike lanes tomorrow and add another lane for cars; in two years, when traffic is again congested on Bloor, what next? We cannot widen the road any further. Instead, we have to encourage alternative transportation for everyone who doesn't need to drive. This will keep traffic moving for those who have to drive.\nThird, when people cycle rather than drive, not only does it remove cars from clogging the roads but it also has health benefits for the cyclists (saving provincial health insurance expenditure), it reduces fuel consumption and pollution levels in the city, it reduces wear and tear on the roads, and it reduces consumption of the fuel, metals, plastics and materials that go into creating more cars.\nFourth, we need bike lanes on many major roads to ensure cycling is a viable transportation option. Pushing cyclists onto minor roads will mean fewer people cycle because routes will take longer and involve more hills. Cyclists want to be on the efficient routs and on the streets with the shops, banks, libraries, etc.\nFifth, without bike lanes, cyclists will die. Some will stop cycling and some will use side streets but many will continue to use the main roads, where they will be far more vulnerable to being hit by cars.\nSixth, making cycling more dangerous and less viable is an equity issue. Cycling is far cheaper than owning and driving a car so prioritizing the safety and comfort of car owners is prioritizing the wealthy over the poor. Youth are not legally allowed to drive yet also have the right to move freely and comfortably around the city. The thousands of delivery people who zip around on eBikes to keep our city functioning are primarily young newcomers to Canada trying to make a life; they deserve safety and comfort.\nSeventh, Bill 212 also includes an egregious effort to exempt Hwy 413 from environmental assessment and proper approvals for land use.\nMore cars and more roads is not in alignment with Toronto's strategic plans  (e.g., Vision Zero) and Canada's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n"

Bike lanes reduce traffic, cut emissions, and make streets safer. Removing them will only push more people into cars, worsening congestion and harming the environment.\nCycling infrastructure supports public health, boosts local businesses, and makes cities more livable. Decisions about bike lanes should remain with municipalities, which know their communities best\u2014not the province.

To rip out the bike lanes now would be a complete waste of more time and more money, as well as creating more waste.\nCreating safe lanes for bicycles to travel is necessary to encourage more individuals to choose cycling which will lead to freeing up the vehicle congestion. (Additionally, these lanes are situated where it is also possible for an individual to access the TTC and then rent a city bike to commute or travel around Toronto.)\nPerhaps going forward bike lanes can be done on secondary roads instead of main avenues.\nThe future for Toronto and Ontario is to reduce vehicles and vehicle use where possible. Having bike lanes is essential to move forward towards that future.\n"
