        "comment": "We need to provide alternate modes of commuting other than cars to avoid traffic. Removing bike lanes will make it so that people need to rely on cars more, increasing traffic and congesting the traffic lane that you have now freed up after spending millions of taxpayer dollars. As a taxpayer, this is a waste of my money and I would prefer you address congestion through improving transit and expanding the cycling network, allowing people in traffic to choose non-car sustainable methods of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing the number of bike lanes and making it more difficult to add new bike lanes will only cause further car traffic on roads. Cycling offers people the choice of not driving to work or the store or wherever else they go. A great comment I saw said that 100 bikes in an hour seems like an empty bike lane, 100 cars with one person each is a lot of traffic.\nWe should keep the existing bike lanes, upgrade them, and add more to help reduce car congestion (less people in cars), reduce emissions, and allow people the choice to bike if they would like to.\n"

As someone who lives downtown, it genuinely makes life easier to get around. I\u2019m imploring you, please don\u2019t get rid of any bike lanes. I honestly think we need more bike lanes and they need to be more protected.\n"

        "comment": "This is perhaps the most childish thing this provincial government has proposed in a long time, and that's saying something. Is this literally the extent of our premier's ambition? This is how he wants to spend his time and our tax dollars?\nThis is the kind of thing a sadistic ten year old playing SimCity does, not the leader of 14 million people in a developed country. Actually scratch that. I don't think a child would waste their time and precious simoleons on something so foolish and so trivial as this. They would at least show some fun, creativity or ambition, like the alien invasion disaster or something. This is just sad.\nOn a more serious note, this will waste money and tangibly hurt people, both financially and in the real physical sense. That this is Doug Ford's idea of a good use of his time and attention is pathetic. The fact that it has even gone this far demonstrates a profound lack of self respect on the part of Ontario voters.\n"

People who bike are not taking up space on roads by not having a car. In Toronto, one of the most unaffordable cities in Canada, people must be able to get around in ways that public transit fails us, and by biking, there is less strain on all public infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes in Toronto is a mistake. Especially on such a central route like Bloor Street. This city already prioritizes cars as the main source of transportation as it is. Instead investing a bunch of money to rip up an destroy the bike lanes that are already there, you should be using that money to invest in more bikes lanes (Adelaide and Richmond are a great example) and getting better TTC service. Maybe even start investing in turning some of the street car routes into subway routes. Streetcars are far worse for traffic then bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding Ontario Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\u201d As a cyclist living in Toronto, I am particularly alarmed by the potential safety risks and the undermining of local autonomy that this bill represents.\nFirstly, bike lanes are essential for the safety of cyclists like myself. On August 31, 2009 I was hit by a car while I was cycling North on Yonge Street.  There were no bike lanes and a driver passed me to turn in front of me causing a crash that resulted in my right arm being broken and needing surgery to have a plate installed.  I live with this plate and the scars and am forever grateful I wasn\u2019t killed, as on the same day another cyclist, Darcy Allan Sheppard was killed while cycling on Bloor. Removing existing bike lanes on Yonge Street and Bloor or any other roadway significantly increases the risk of accidents and fatalities. As someone who relies on cycling for daily transportation, I am deeply worried about my safety and that of my fellow cyclists. The presence of bike lanes provides a necessary buffer between cyclists and motor vehicles, reducing the likelihood of collisions.  I regularly cycle to work from April through to October and into November.  When winter hits I still cycle but often switch to using the BikeShare network and commuting by bike one way and by TTC the other.  The stats you cite about the numbers of cyclists have been widely denounced as inaccurate and misleading.\nSecondly, the bill\u2019s requirement for provincial approval for the development or removal of bike lanes undermines the authority of local governments. Municipalities like Toronto are best positioned to understand and address the unique needs of their communities. This centralization of power is an overreach that disregards the expertise and autonomy of local authorities.\nLastly, the removal of recently installed bike lanes represents a waste of taxpayer dollars. Significant public funds have been invested in planning for and creating safe and efficient cycling infrastructure. Reversing these investments not only squanders these resources but also undermines efforts to promote sustainable and healthy transportation options.  As minister of transportation you realize that transportation planning involves planning for the future, and removing cycling infrastructure is incredibly short-sighted and dangerous in addition to being wasteful. Focus instead on public transportation which will help many more people, including those in cars stuck in traffic.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 and to prioritize the safety of cyclists, respect local governance, and ensure the responsible use of public funds.\n"

        "comment": "Removing Toronto bike lanes is a misguided waste of time, and will not be effective in reducing congestion caused by automobile traffic.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes is clearly a red herring. What's troubling is the blatent provincial overreach into municipal planning and local concerns, and a distraction from corruption within the provincial conservative government.\nWhy not take the millions it would take to rebuild roads in downtown Toronto, and deliver a revenue stream to address homelessness instead -- an actual provincial problem?\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes in Toronto and every city in our beautiful Province of Ontario are an important part of transportation and recreation. They should be encouraged to be built, not ripped out causing a waste of taxpayer dollars.\nThis government claims to be against unnecessary bureaucracy but will now create significantly more for municipalities across the province who have adopted active transportation plans and want to expand their biking and walking networks.\nI use bike lanes in multiple cities across southern Ontario for work every week. They are the only safe way to bike to and from transit and to work.\nFor the safety of Ontarians, bike lanes are just as important as sidewalks.\nIf you ever wonder why fewer people bike in this province, look at the attached map of the only safe cycling paths in Toronto. Imagine those are the only safe roads to drive on for cars, all other roads have massive potholes and are consistently full of semi trucks. Would 50-60% of people still drive if that were the case? Of course not.\nWe're finally improving public transit in this province. Cycling supports public transit. Why reduce cycling access?\nWe already don't have enough building space and parking downtown in many of our cities. Why encourage more cars, when we could encourage public transit and biking instead?\nThis government should go back to consulting with experts as they did during the early pandemic instead of falling prey to US style culture wars. If you implement voter supported policies by taking real polls, you wouldn't need to worry about getting reelected so badly.\nGood luck, I really hope you can learn.\nThank you for your time, to anyone reading this.\n"

The recent proposal to remove existing bike lanes on primary roads, specifically on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, is concerning.\nBike lanes are essential for promoting sustainable transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and enhancing public safety. Studies have shown that well-designed bike lanes can lead to a decrease in accidents and encourage more residents to choose cycling over driving, thereby alleviating road congestion.\nRemoving these bike lanes could reverse the progress made in creating a more bike-friendly city and discourage residents from adopting healthier, more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.\nI urge the government to reconsider this decision and to continue investing in bike infrastructure that benefits all citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I am vehemently opposed to Bill 212.\nYour bill is NOT evidence-based, and as government officials, you should be ashamed of perpetuating uninformed opinions- the title of this bill is clearly inflammatory and entirely misleading. Bike lanes have been strongly evidenced to reduce traffic congestion, boost business and of course, cut emissions amidst our current climate crisis. https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nAlso, the proposed hwy 413 would destroy hundreds of acres of protected greenbelt land. We have not forgotten the greenbelt scandal of Ford's PC government and this is but a 2nd attempt to fill the pockets of rich developers at the expense of our children's future. NO.\nThirdly, that the provincial government can interfere with municipal transportation planning without consulting City of Toronto residents who rely on safe biking infrastructure and transportation planning should be a jurisdictional violation. I DO NOT WANT CARS prioritized on Toronto city roads. We DO NOT WANT fast moving cars on the street creating safety risks for pedestrians and cyclists. We want more bike lanes, much more affordable transit and less cars.\nIF YOU WANT TO REDUCE GRIDLOCK, FUND OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.\n"
