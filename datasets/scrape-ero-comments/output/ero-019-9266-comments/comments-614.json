        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\" This bill, which could require municipalities to seek provincial approval for new bike lanes and potentially remove existing lanes, is deeply concerning for several reasons.\nFirstly, bike lanes are crucial for public safety. Studies have consistently shown that protected bike lanes reduce accidents and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians alike. By making cycling a safer option, we encourage more people to use bikes for short trips, which helps to alleviate traffic congestion rather than increase it. Removing these lanes would likely lead to more accidents and discourage the use of sustainable transportation alternatives.\nSecondly, bike lanes have been shown to benefit local businesses. In Ontario, cities like Toronto have seen increased foot traffic and higher sales for businesses located along streets with protected bike lanes. Removing these lanes could negatively impact the local economy by reducing accessibility for cyclists and pedestrians who frequent these areas.\nLastly, this bill undermines the authority of municipalities to make decisions based on the unique needs of their communities. Municipal governments are in the best position to understand local traffic patterns and to implement solutions that balance the needs of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Imposing a top-down approach from the provincial level is not only inefficient but disregards the progress many communities have made towards creating safer, more inclusive streets.\nI urge you to vote against Bill 212 and to support initiatives that prioritize the safety and well-being of all road users. Ontario should be moving forward with sustainable transportation solutions, not rolling back the progress we\u2019ve made.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

It has been shown that removal of these bike lanes will not significantly improve travel times for drivers, it will only cost money, undermine local democracy, and make the roads less safe. Nobody in good conscience should support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "The Province of Ontario is supposed to manage Ontario. Why are they managing local roads? You are supposed to build and maintain highways that connect cities, but somehow you have decided that Toronto's traffic is your job, and you keep trying the same thing over and over, an inter-city solution for an intra-city problem. It's actually insane. I drove on the 407 recently, driving between cities and it was really surprisingly wide, which is crazy given that there is a parallel highway just south of it that is the one of the largest in North America. You clearly don't understand the problem, yet keep trying the same solution. There is some global constraint for traffic that more lanes eventually does not solve. You seriously think if you just take control over all the cities and ram through your half-baked ideas of tunnels and more car lanes, that anything is going to get better for anyone?\nBuild trains, build communities, office parks, industry, around train stations. Stop trying to build more lanes for the \"floppy disc\" of transportation when so much more efficient technology exists. By the way, TRAINS BETWEEN CITIES WOULD ACTUALLY BE YOUR JOB, like roads and ferries. Give the municipalities a break from your nonsense interference in local traffic flow and learn how to actually move people and goods in the Province. Seriously.\n"

It also makes it more likely the people will bike to a local store if they feel there's a safe route to do so (i.e. a bike lane) rather than just driving to their nearest big box store.\nPlease stop taking us backwards. Listen to urban planning professionals, they seem united on this front.\n"

        "comment": "In 2017, Doug Ford said that when he wasn't riding in a bike lane, he didn't feel safe.  Why do I even have to ask what he's now thinking as he plans to threaten the lives of other cyclists, who have grown in numbers since he made that remark?  I'm a driver, a runner and a cyclist; I ride anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000km per year for the past 20 years (I'm now 70); I've been hit twice in a lane shared with cars and was fortunate that I survived each encounter.   I'm always safer in the bike lanes, but they don't go everywhere I want or need to go, but I'm now experienced enough as a cyclist and as a car driver to manage to survive.  That said, a fellow cyclist of mine was killed on Bayview Avenue this past spring on a route I regularly travel, and saw the devastation that it has caused his family.  We've had 5 other deaths this year, including one who was forced out of a bike lane by a construction obstruction.  I met a young 30-something Moroccan immigrant to Toronto last year who loves our bike rental program and our bike lanes; she doesn't have a car, and doesn't need/want one ... but she depends heavily on the Yonge bike lane to get from Eglinton to Bloor and along Bloor to meet with her friends and for business uses; she is terrified of the possibility that she's going to be forced to share lanes with cars now.   How many injuries and deaths of Ontario voters is the Ford government prepared to accept as collateral damage for his wrong-headed thinking that removing bike lanes will move cars faster?\nWant to do something useful for the economy (the PC Government's usual drumbeat)?  Expand bike lanes across the province and turn it into a cycling Mecca for tourism.  Cyclists spend $.  Just ask any bakery that greets us when we descend on them.   Talk to any bike shop about how much we spend with them.  You should be encouraging cycling, not just in Toronto, but across the Province.  Quebec does it, so does BC ... and both could do more.  Ontario is a laggard, but shouldn't be .... we have a beautiful Capital City (Toronto) and a beautiful Province ... we should be a cycling destination, not trying to scare people away from it.\nHere's hoping Doug Ford can take his foot off the gas on this piece of legislation and think about all of the people who he could be ensuring get home safely, rather than promote a bad idea based on a junk notion about how to move cars faster.  Safety be damned?\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am strongly opposed to Bill 212.\nBy limiting the creation of new bike lanes and even destroying existing ones, the Ontario government would be limiting alternative transportation modes, and creating more space for cars, \"i.e. build it and they will come.\" This would have serious consequences for the environment and human health. The destruction of present bike lanes is also a foolish move economically given all of the taxpayers money spent on them.\nHere in Ottawa, the use of bike lanes for both recreation and travel to and from work and school only continues to rise, and these lanes have helped to make the capital the world-class, enjoyable city that it is today. There is no evidence that destroying bike lanes will improve gridlock. Instead, investing in public transportation and a variety of modes of travel, such as cycling, as well other components of careful urban planning (i.e. density along subway/LRT routes; creating conditions for walkable neighbourhoods), is what will reduce car travel.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Despite its name, this bill will neither reduce gridlock nor save anyone time (or money). By reducing the number of safe and accessible bike lanes, it will increase the number of people driving, which will actually worsen gridlock. More gridlock means more people sitting in cars without moving, wasting time and polluting while they idle.\nRemoving or preventing the construction of safe bike lanes will also cause more fatal accidents. Is the provincial government okay with more Ontarians dying as a result of its decisions, as long as they are 'only' cyclists?\nRemoving well-used bike lanes (like those mentioned in Toronto) will cost millions of dollars, not counting what they cost to build in the first place, or the costs of relocating bike lanes elsewhere. The provincial government claims to be financially responsible. This is a huge waste of taxpayer money.\nNeedless to say, the consequences of this bill for climate change, air pollution, and public health will also be extremely negative. Why are no environmental implications considered in the proposal? This is unacceptable.\nLocal governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that work best where they are. The province has no right to overrule local governments if they want to install bike lanes. It is interesting that the same provincial government that thought mayors deserve \"strong\" powers to make decisions consistent with Ford's agenda think they should have no power to make decisions based on other  priorities.\nThis is a petty attempt to target cyclists (and everyone who cares about the environment) in a culture war. This bill is dishonest, counterproductive and hypocritical. Being so flippant about climate change is a disgrace; it betrays future generations and nature. Please do the right thing and stop this profoundly damaging proposal from going ahead.\n"

        "comment": "Every person on a bike is one less person in a car by themselves which improves the flow for cars or buses. People need safe cycling lanes and the more safe lanes means more people will cycle. Holland used to be car centric but their implementation of lots of safe cycle tracks means thousands of fewer cars on the road. The only ways to improve traffic flow is to make public transit fast, efficient and affordable and to have safe cycle tracks. There is overwhelming evidence that more lanes for cars does not improve flow because all that does is encourage more people to drive thinking it improves their commute times.\nPremier Ford needs to get his head out of the sand and read the thousands of reports showing that creating more lanes for cars is a self defeating plan. It never works.\nRemove Bill 212 and shred it for good.\n"

City affairs should be run by the elected city government.  The government should focus on it's own complex mandate, and not waste time in someone else's.\nSecond because the government's heavy handed stupidity will tear out bike lanes that are, by and large, popular with residents and business owners. Yes the recently installed sections along Bloor street (between Jane and Islington) are poorly implemented,  little use and deeply unpopular, but this is not the case in Bloor West Village, or along large stretches of Bloor street east of Jane and  right across the city.  But instead of dealing with this local and small scale problem the Provincial Government has decided to tear out the entire network, and make it impossible for the City to do any future planning or implementation without provincial approval.\n"

        "comment": "I feel this is an overreach of the Ontario Government into something that local governments are much better able to assess. It is also incorrect that removing bike lines will reduce traffic congestion, except perhaps in the very short term. If there is safe cycling infrastruc more people will leave their cars at home and use their bikes, thus reducing congestion for those who have no option but to use cars. Good public transportation is also necessary. It\u2019s much better to have a bus with 40 passengers, than 40 cars. More cycling infrastructure and better public transport will not only reduce congestion but will also improve the quality of the air that we breathe - as as happened in London, England and other cities that have reduced the number of cars in their cities. Most importantly this approach will decrease carbon emissions and reduce the impact of the climate crisis.\n"

Undoing this process would be an incredible waste of time and money, and would create little to no benefit for drivers. It would only force many new cyclists back into cars.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding  Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock Act, and the implications it may have on the existence and expansion of bike lanes within our cities. As a resident of Toronto, I believe it is crucial to highlight the importance of bike lanes and advocate for their preservation and expansion rather than their removal.\nBike lanes play a significant role in creating safer, more sustainable, and more efficient urban environments. They provide numerous environmental (reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) and health benefits, and contrary to the governments claims they reduce traffic congestion.\nAs a daily user of the Yonge and Bloor bike lanes, their removal would mean me shifting to other means of commuting, including a car - increasing congestion.\nAn added important reason for the existence of bike lanes is to make our streets safer. Having seen the devastation road violence caused in a family close to me, it is very hard to understand how the government can ignore that the removal of bike lanes will cause additional deaths and injuries on Ontario's roads.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is particularly short sighted.  Not only will reducing bike lanes not reduce congestion, it will do the exact opposite.  Innumerable examples from jurisdictions around the world (including cities in North America including New York, Portland, Montreal and even Toronto) show that an investment in the expansion of micro-mobility infrastructure results in a reduction of congestion and a significant reduction in infrastructure costs.  An increase in 'bike' infrastructure leads directly to fewer cars on the road, fewer cars needing to find parking on streets, more people getting the health benefits of exercise and a significant decrease in the the maintenance costs of the road network which represents the largest chunk of municipal budgets.  The main reason that so many jurisdictions have embraced micro-mobility is not some artsy, left wing agenda but the result of a pragmatic, realistic appraisal of the long-term financial obligations associated with the unrestricted expansion of road networks.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, not on the basis of politics, but on the basis of facts supported by decades of established transportation policy research. This research has repeatedly shown that cars and trucks cause traffic congestion, not bike lanes. Widening roads to accommodate personal vehicles will only encourage more people to drive and cause more congestion. Notice that Highway 401 as it passes through Toronto contains 16 lanes with no bike lanes or pedestrians, yet is often gridlocked. More lanes are clearly not a solution to our traffic challenges.\nThe correct solution is to invest and improve infrastructure, such as separated bike lanes, effective public transit, pedestrianization, wider sidewalks, congestion fees, and other measures that have proven highly effective in cities around the world. These solutions enable residents to move around the city without a personal vehicle, in a way that is pleasant, safe, efficient, and dignified. By providing these proper alternatives, we can ensure that the roads are less congested for those who truly need to drive, such as delivery and emergency vehicles.\nIt is both unfair and ineffective to punish cyclists and pedestrians, the most vulnerable of road users, by legislating the prioritization of motor vehicles in a way that ensures a more dangerous street realm. Six cyclists have died in Toronto in 2024 so far. Just this weekend in the GTA, a 94-year-old pedestrian and a baby in a stroller were struck by drivers. These people were not radicals or activists, but merely regular Torontonians attempting to go about their day. Even though I do not cycle myself, I traverse the city regularly as a pedestrian and I know how dangerous it can be because of aggressive and speeding vehicle drivers. Bike lanes such as those on Bloor Street provide a buffer between vehicle lanes and sidewalks, making the public realm safer for all users.\nToronto is the largest city in Canada, with a much higher population density than many other parts of the province. This means Toronto needs full autonomy to implement traffic infrastructure and policy solutions that make sense for the city and its residents. Many Toronto residents have made financial and other sacrifices to live in Toronto because we prefer a dense city of neighbourhoods, and we do not want to live a car-dependent lifestyle. We make these choices for personal reasons, yes, but these choices also have wider benefits by helping to reduce traffic congestion and climate pollution for everyone. These lifestyle choices should be encouraged, not demonized and scapegoated.\nTorontonians have also exercised our democratic right to vote for municipal representatives who support these same aims. It is therefore infuriating and unfair to have an external government override our choices and force a mindset more suited to rural and suburban areas onto dense urban streets, disempowering our elected municipal representatives and making our lives less pleasant and more dangerous in the process.\nBill 212 is not about finding an effective solution to Toronto\u2019s gridlock, it is about cynical politics. We can do much better.\n"

At best, the bike lanes are sparsely used in the middle of summer.  From November through April, you will hardly see more than a cyclist an hour on Bloor street - while you see cars bumper to bumper waiting for a single car to turn right.\nInstead you have created even less safe neighborhoods as cars weave through small side streets to avoid the congested ones.  The removal of these lanes will finally provide the residents in the area their evenings back spending more time with family instead of sitting idly in traffic.\nThank you!\n"
