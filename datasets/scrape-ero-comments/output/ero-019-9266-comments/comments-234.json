        "comment": "I am writing to oppose the proposed bill that seeks to remove bike lanes in an effort to improve commuting speeds for vehicles. This measure, while well-intentioned, is counterproductive. Evidence from urban studies consistently shows that bike lanes, rather than increasing congestion, actually reduce it, alongside delivering significant health and safety benefits to communities.\nResearch reveals that bike lanes help reduce vehicle congestion by encouraging more people to use bicycles instead of cars for short commutes. A study from the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) found that cities with dedicated bike lanes experienced a decrease in car traffic as a greater number of people opted for cycling when provided with safe infrastructure. In New York City, for example, the implementation of protected bike lanes led to a 49% increase in cycling while concurrently decreasing congestion on adjacent streets, it not only opens up space on the roads but reduces parking demand, both of which are critical in high-density areas.\nFurthermore, segregated bike lanes make streets safer for everyone. The Federal Highway Administration reports that streets with protected bike lanes see 90% fewer collisions involving cyclists, and the presence of these lanes helps calm traffic overall, reducing accidents involving pedestrians and drivers as well . Citiesland and Seattle have demonstrated that streets with bike lanes experience fewer crashes and smoother traffic flow compared to streets without them.\nThe health benefits of bike lanes also merit attention. By encouraging active transportation, bike lanes promote physical activity and reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. According to a 2019 report by Public Health England, regular cycling can reduce the risk of these diseases by up to 50%. Moreover, when fewer cars are on the road, air quality improves, benefiting everyone but especially those with respiratory conditions.\nIn sum, removing bike lanes is likely to have the opposite effect of its intention: it will decrease road safety, increase congestion, and erode the progress made toward healthier and more environmentally friendly cities. Investing in and expanding bike infrastructure is a proven way to reduce congestion, improve public safety, and promote public health.\nFor these reasons, I urge you to reconsider this bill and instead focus on expanding and enhancing our bike lane infrastructure.\nThank you for your time and attention.\n"

        "comment": "How does this act actually accomplish eliminating gridlock on Hwy 400, Hwy 401 or DCP (Don Valley Parkway) by eliminating local decisions about bike lanes?\nsimple answer it does not - current studies show that bike lanes improve a city & town's traffic patterns.\nBike lanes make cities/towns more enjoyable to live and visit.\nFor a govt that claims to listen to the people - bike lanes and roads inside a city/town are the responsibility of the local govt and their citizens yet the Ford Govt is taking away people's choices and giving it to non-voters (people who live outside the municipality).\nStop wasting money - study after study shows us that active transportation makes healthier air for citizens to breathe, keeps people active and makes it safe. Wider roads means that people speed and do not take proactive measures to ensure that they drive safely.\n"

        "comment": "I support removing all these useless bike lanes and having bylaws removed so that cyclists can ride on the sidewalks. They impede traffic and all the studies that say otherwise are based on European cities. European cities are centuries old and were built pedestrian centric because they existed before cars. North American cities were built in only the last century and were made for and alongside the automobile.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212. It is provincial overreach and disappointingly short sighted. Reducing the ability for municipalities to install bikes lanes will result in more cyclists in car dominated traffic which will ultimately slow down traffic and will result in more cyclist injuries and fatalities. Municipalities know best how to serve their communities and requiring review and approval from the provincial government will only delay infrastructure projects, waste tax payer money, and further discourage municipalities from considering infrastructure redesigns to their population. The idea that we should continue to prioritize car traffic instead of more scalable methods of transportation such as cycling is an outdated and short sighted one. It's simple - cars cause congestion and by continuing to prioritize car traffic it only perpetuates a cycle of increasing trips using cars, therefore increasing car traffic, and ultimately increasing the demand for more car infrastructure. I commute to work every day by bicycle and that is only possible because I have a safe and efficient route that does not require me to risk my life and ride amongst car heavy traffic. We need to empower our municipalities to decrease our population's dependence on cars, not hamper it. For the health and safety of our people, for the good of our planet, and for the sake of not burdening our people with the insurmountable costs of cars and car infrastructure, please scrap this bill and come up with a better plan to move us forward - not backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the proposal that building highways faster will reduce gridlock. I would rather see my tax dollars invested in better public transit and increasing road safety for all citizens including cyclists and pedestrians. I only began commuting by bike to my office on King St. in Toronto after the installation of the University Ave. bike lanes. I never felt safe biking in the downtown core before. Today I prefer to use the University Ave. lanes to quickly get out of the downtown core by bike, rather than use the Richmond St. lanes, which are crowded at rush hour. Biking is the most reliable, efficient mode of transportation. My TTC route, by comparison is often interrupted by stopped subway trains or interrupted streetcar service. I would like to see more provincial investment in the faster building and better maintenance of subways, light rail and commuter trains as proven means of reducing gridlock.\nMunicipalities know what their communities need more than the provincial government and should be empowered to act on behalf of their residents without adding provincial legislative red tape. The bike lanes on city roads should not be legislated in the same act as provincial highways.\nI also disagree with Schedule 3 \u2013 exempting the Highway 413 Project from the Environmental Assessment Act. We are seeing the increasing negative impact of climate change in Ontario and around the world every day. It\u2019s short-sighted to put the issue of gridlock above environmental protection especially where there are other, greener options for decreasing gridlock rather than increasing car traffic.\nI strongly oppose this proposed bill.\n"

People will have fewer options for the type of transportation they use, which will cause them to switch to driving, increasing the number of vehicles on the road, which will worsen congestion times.

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock is a great idea, that can only be accomplished by increasing alternate transportation methods such as bike lanes, transit, and more walkable cities.   Adding bike lanes has for decades proven to reduce traffic, increase business in areas where businesses exist, increase overall citizen health, and decrease pollution!  There are many business associations that have noted that bike lanes close to their businesses have actually increased sales!   More and more cars on the roads means that there is less and less space for them....building more and wider highways for decades has proven that gridlock just comes back.  Increasing the speed limits on 400 series highways only does any good if they aren't filled with cars.\nGet building better transit, actual 2 way all day GO trains from Kitchener to Toronto (that has literally been talked about for decades with NOTHING to show for it yet)...Eliminating cars from the roads and enabling better transit options will make the entire system move smoother and more effectively.\nStop throwing out ideas like tunnels, and listen to the experts on infrastructure development study - not big developers only looking for money for their land.\nServe all the people of Ontario, not just the Toronto wealthy.   Keep the bike lanes, expand the bike lanes, build the transit and get people moving!\n"

        "comment": "Putting bikes back on the road will absolutely worsen traffic, not make it better. We need bike lanes to keep bikes off the road itself. Our government is incredibly incompetent if this is what they believe will \u2018help traffic\u2019 but unfortunately I don\u2019t believe this is incompetence, I believe this is willful ignorance.\nJust one more of many bad decisions that will do nothing more than hurt Ontarians. Cyclists will be in more danger as well, and most likely people will be injured or die if cyclists are forced back onto the roads. They are not allowed on sidewalks. This is terrible for both drivers and cyclists.\nWe should be encouraging MORE cycling to help with gridlock, not making it harder. The best way to help traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road. This \u2018solution\u2019 is absolutely ridiculous. Please do not let this bill pass.\n"

Keep the bike lanes in. How many lives is this government willing to kill in order to save at most 2min of travel time? How many families ripped apart, lives endangered, travellers inconvenienced is worth saving 1 minute on one specific type of transportation only? I beg this government to look at the data and see how devastating removing the bike lanes will be on the community.\n"

Cyclists get separated lanes, pedestrians get more distance between them and traffic.\nWe can never have enuf car and truck lanes to satisfy everybody. Space is scarce and needs to be allocated amongst competing users. Cyclists and pedestrians matter.\nCities and towns need cycling infrastructure plans, and all roadworks need to be designed to be traffic friendly AND friendly and safe for pedestrians and cyclists.\n"
