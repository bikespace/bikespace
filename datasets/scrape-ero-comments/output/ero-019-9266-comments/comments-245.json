There is plenty of evidence that proves that the opposite is true which has now been highlighted by CBC, CTV and the Toronto Star. If that isn't obvious enough, the following is: Cars pollute.

For reasons including but not limited to the above, we need fewer cars on the road and more bike lanes... NOT the inverse.\nThat this legislation is even being considered in 2024 is embarassing before even mentioning the expense of taking out existing, world class bike infrastructure.\nDoug Ford what is wrong with you?\n"

        "comment": "This bill  will not have any purported positive effect if passed into law. Bike lanes offer an alternative to driving reducing the number of cars on the road. Replacing bike lanes with lanes for cars will see those lanes marked by the pre-existing congestion this bill is trying to prevent due to induced demand; those who would not other wise drive on those non-existent car lanes now will and fill them up no differently than current ones.\nThis bill also creates unnecessary bureaucracy. Municipal governments often have the resources and intelligence gathering powers to gauge where bike lanes will best serve their own communities. Where they don\u2019t, the province should be enhancing those powers at the municipal level, not undercutting municipalities of the agency to decide what their roadways can and cannot look like.\nThis bill is absurd. The creation of new bike lanes should be incentivized and not treated as a nuisance.\n"

        "comment": "I object strongly to ripping out existing bike lines, and the interference of provincial government in municipal affairs. Municipal council knows much better the needs of its communities. Doug Ford has been to my community maybe twice in the past year so his suggestion that we rip out bike lanes are are used is off-side. He has NO IDEA how we live every day. Not a clue. He doesn't have a clue what the causes of congestion are here.\nIn addition, I've counted the number of bikes on a lot of our roads compared to vehicles and often it's the same or maybe a bit more. The difference is bikes take up far less room than vehicles so it looks like \"no one\" is using the bike lanes when in fact there are the same number. I would be interested to see how municipal planners are tracking use of bike lanes so we have some quantifiable data to discuss instead of this insane proposal.\nDoug, focus on fixing health care and education. Here's another tip: Physical exercise, like riding bikes, contributes to cardiac health. Taking cars off the road reduces air pollution, contributing to cardiac health.\nIf you want to fix congestion, look at traffic lights - I was in Mississauga on the weekend and I hit EVERY SINGLE RED LIGHT between the 401 and my destination. Sometimes I was stopped for 2 minutes as the light cycled to let one car through.\nIf you want to fix congestion, fix public transit. It is RIDICULOUS that we cannot get efficient train service across this province.\nUsing my tax dollars to rip out infrastructures my tax dollars paid for is not fiscally responsible.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal put forth by the Government of Ontario to introduce stricter regulations on implementing new bicycle lanes is concerning given the substantial evidence supporting the benefits of cycling infrastructure. Prioritizing highways over bike lanes not only risks exacerbating congestion and environmental issues but also overlooks crucial public health and urban planning considerations.\nResearch highlights the significant benefits of bike lanes in urban areas. A study by Teschke et al. (2012) found that cities with dedicated cycling infrastructure, such as separated bike lanes, experience a marked decrease in traffic-related injuries, providing a safer environment for both cyclists and pedestrians. Moreover, research by Buehler and Dill (2016) underscores that well-designed bike lanes encourage more residents to cycle, which can effectively reduce vehicular traffic and, in turn, alleviate overall congestion. This contradicts the notion that bike lanes inherently worsen gridlock; instead, they contribute to a more balanced and sustainable urban transport system.\nFrom an environmental perspective, bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality. According to a study by Transport & Environment (2018), cities with extensive cycling networks report lower per capita emissions compared to those focusing primarily on road expansions. Highways and additional vehicle lanes may provide short-term relief, but they are likely to lead to induced demand, as outlined by Duranton and Turner (2011), ultimately resulting in increased traffic volumes and associated emissions.\nIn addition, cities with comprehensive cycling infrastructure often see improved public health outcomes. A study by De Hartog et al. (2010) quantified these health benefits, suggesting that the physical activity from increased cycling outweighs the risks posed by exposure to air pollution or traffic accidents. Encouraging cycling through better infrastructure not only promotes physical health but also contributes to mental well-being and quality of life in urban populations.\nThe proposal's emphasis on obtaining provincial approval for bike lanes based on criteria that may prioritize vehicular flow fails to consider the multi-faceted benefits of cycling infrastructure. Instead of potentially stifling municipal efforts, the province should aim to create guidelines that support active transportation, promote safer streets, and foster environmental resilience.\nIn conclusion, Ontario must reconsider its framework by recognizing that more and better cycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of modern, sustainable urban planning. The evidence indicates that prioritizing bike lanes can contribute positively to reducing congestion, enhancing public safety, improving health, and addressing climate change.\nBibliography\n1.

        "comment": "This proposal is the complete opposite of how cities and provinces should be developing their infrastructure, both for quality of life reasons and for the environment. We need more public transport and bike lanes and less cars. Already North America is too car dependent, polluting, causing accidents and death, social isolation, and physical deterioration due to lack of exercise. This approach of stripping municipalities of the right to even improve themselves in favor of the provinces backwards and car-centric plans is cruel to all Ontarians.\nMore specifically:\n1. The plan threatens the safety and well-being of cyclists, which should be encouraged and protected in protected bike lanes. This will actually improve health, happiness, safety, and decrease traffic, unlike the failed plan of constantly adding more car lanes.\n2. This promotes car dependency by inducing demand, which will increase congestion, emissions, and issues with road safety.\n3. This promotes an unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle by stripping Ontarians of the choice of an active mode of transportation.\n4. This wastes taxpayer money by creating unnecessary beaureaucracy and inefficiency in a province where transportation projects already take far too long to complete.\n5. No criteria were outlined for the Province to use to approve bike lanes (they say they will develop them later with muncipalities) and so until further details are provided this legislation should not be pushed through to promote the Premier's pro-motorist agenda\nNorth America has been under the control of car companies for too long. Everywhere else in the world has better public transportation, better bike lanes, and better walkability than us. If we care about the health, safety, and quality of life of our citizens, as well as the environment, we need to do the complete opposite of what this out-dated bill is attempting to do.\n"

It will lead to more congestion in that bikes will have to share the road with traffic and create for more dangerous conditions for all involved. Bikes are an essential part of our transit system and need to be respected. There should be a governmental push to prioritize modes of transit outside of driving because that will have a larger and lasting impact on traffic times as well as a net positive impact overall. We need to shift the narrative that cars and bikes and adversarial, bike lanes are not what is giving our city horrendenous traffic and it wrong and damaging to present it as such. I urge the Ford government to look at its priorities and see that bikes are a positive and important part of our city life. Bike lanes and biking infrastructure needs to be invested in and made safer, not removed.\n"

I am in good shape - mostly because of my cycling - it keeps me fit and it's free ... just part of the reason I can stay in my home as I age.\nI am very much in favour of more bike lanes - it makes for a much more workable city and alleviates congestion. If I were to drive to all the locations I visit on a weekly basis I would be contributing to congestion, air pollution and also spending way more money than I can afford to.\nPlease continue to build a safe biking infrastructure. Eliminating bike lanes is backward thinking and will make Toronto a less desirable city to live in.\nStudies show that bike lanes do NOT, in fact, lead to longer commute times. They offer a safe and environmentally friendly manner of travel and increase public health and safety.\nPlease keep the bike lanes we already have - I use them daily - even in winter - and continue to build more of them.\nThank you\n"

If you want to reduce traffic you have to provide viable alternatives.\nThese alternatives should be equal or better than driving for people to start using them. Bikes is one mode of transport, that is readily accessible to people of all ages to use to get around the city.\nIn addition, public transports needs to be improved. This can be achieved by adding more subway lines, dedicated bus lanes and intercity trains.\nMany in the community of Toronto are incapable of driving either due to medical reason or their license having been revoked or simply because they are not able to afford a car. This should not mean that they should be treated as second class citizens and be not able to get around the city using other means.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria,\nI am strongly opposed to Bill 212.\nFirstly, the removal of existing bike lanes or the curtailing of bike lane expansion in the City of Toronto is a grave mistake. Bike lanes save lives. Bicycles cannot safely travel on roads used by cars - there is simply not enough room to ensure safe passage.\nToronto is a sprawling, car-centric city with an inadequate public transit system. Currently, only 4% of city roads have bike lanes - this is not enough to allow citizens to safely commute from East to West and from North to South. We need more separated bike lanes, not less.\nThat being said, there may be ways to reduce the width of bike lanes in certain areas, such as the Bloor strip between Bedford and St George, where the bike lane is very wide, to allow for a passing lane for automobiles. But most bike lanes take up less than half of a lane of traffic, so this is the exception.\nAgain, removing existing bike lanes or curtailing expansion of bike lanes to allow cyclists to safely commute is a bad and dangerous idea.\nSecondly, reducing car use is critical to achieving Ontario's carbon and pollution reduction targets - which is key to our future economic, social and physical wellbeing.\nRather than spending billions on more highways and tunnels for cars, we should be spending billions on expanding our subway and commuter train system - including a complete downtown relief line that reconnects with the Bloor line in the West end.\nThere are already too many cars on the road, and making it easier to get a driver's licence and get on the highway will only increase congestion in the downtown core and make the atmosphere more unlivable for everyone - drivers, cyclists, pedestrians.\nThe long-term solution to our health and climate crisis is to move people away from the car to more sustainable modes of transportation, including public transit and bicycles.\nPlease base your decisions on science-based evidence and not on the whims of a focus group that may represent your party's electoral base but not the majority of Ontarians - and particularly not those Ontarians that actually have to live with the consequences of your actions.\nSincerely,\nMark\n"
