        "comment": "Amazing how blatantly corrupt this bill is. Overreach into Toronto policy. Decreasing barriers to entry to drive to reduce congestion? The real kicker is the attempt to shove the 413 down our throats by introducing a way to bypass environmental assessments. The only thing that actually makes sense is increasing highway speed limits. It's like a piece of candy attached in with a bill of poison.\n"

That\u2019s literally adding more cars to the road. \u201cOh but the bike lanes take up too much space.\u201d Please tell me how many cars can fit in a bike lane. Zero. Literally zero. I know nobody is going to listen but instead of using money to remove bike lanes and INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CARS ON THE ROAD maybe we could use it to HIRE MORE DOCTORS????? Just a thought.\n"

        "comment": "Please withdraw this bill immediately.\nThere is no evidence that bike lanes increase gridlock. There\u2019s no transportation planner who would recommend this.\nBike lanes are an important way to improve safe choices for people to get around so they don\u2019t need to drive, particularly now that e-bikes have made cycling less physically taxing, especially for longer journeys or when carrying cargo, like kids or groceries. A connected grid of cycling lanes is critical to allow people to choose to bike instead of driving.\nThe province currently provides no funding for municipal cycling lanes. Asking municipalities to submit these for provincial review will cost provincial staff time and increase health care costs due to injuries. Across the province cyclist  deaths and serious injuries have been increasing while the same stats stay the same or fall for drivers. Preventing even one accident saves tremendous costs for the province and more importantly for individuals and families.\nPlease target this effort to more enforcement of existing traffic rules (for drivers, especially delivery services, and cyclists) and addressing impacts of construction on traffic which are each more significant contributors to gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to the changes proposed by the government around bike lanes. I do not own a car and I use my bike as my primary mode of transportation, supplemented by some car sharing when it\u2019s not safe of feasible to bike. I rely on bike lanes every day to keep me safe on my commutes. If bike lanes are deprioritized, I will need to commute by car more often because it will no longer be safe to bike. I may even need to buy a car. This directly goes against what the government says it wants to achieve - deprioritizing bikes and making it less safe or feasible to bike puts more people in cars and increases congestion.\n"

No reason for the province to be involved at all.\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown Toronto resident commuting by car to Markham each day, I understand the importance of improving traffic flow. While I support measures to reduce gridlock, I am concerned that the restrictions on bike lanes proposed in Bill 212 are driven more by ideology than by evidence-based urban planning, potentially harming both businesses and residents.\nRecently, business owners in Toronto\u2019s Annex neighborhood expressed strong support for maintaining Bloor Street bike lanes, emphasizing the positive impact they have on foot traffic and local commerce. Small businesses along Bloor Street report that bike lanes encourage more pedestrian and cycling traffic, which benefits local shops without increasing parking congestion or road use by cars. Their message to the government, as captured in a recent CityNews report, is clear: bike lanes are an economic asset that shouldn\u2019t be removed without solid evidence proving otherwise\u200b.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just beneficial to cyclists\u2014they help drivers too. By encouraging some commuters to choose cycling for shorter trips, bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road, which helps streamline traffic for drivers making longer commutes, like mine. This symbiosis between transportation methods is well-documented and backed by urban planning studies that link bike infrastructure with decreased congestion.\nI urge the government to prioritize empirical data in its decisions and to avoid restricting bike lanes without solid evidence to support such changes. Decisions that don\u2019t align with community and economic data will erode support for government initiatives that aim to reduce gridlock, especially if they ignore the contributions of existing infrastructure like bike lanes to an overall balanced traffic ecosystem.\nThank you for considering an evidence-driven approach to this issue.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is only going to lead to more congestion. Where are cyclists going to go? They are going to take up a whole car lane. This will lead to so many more dangerous situations.\nThis proposal wants us to go backwards in every single direction. Worse infrastructure, more pollution, more car centric.\nThe bitter pill legislators need to swallow is that a big city, and Toronto is growing into a proper metropole, is always car unfriendly, and that is a good thing. New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, when you put so many people in one space - cars are never the answer. We want a safe livable city, not a car-centric one.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am in favour of keeping the bike lanes on Bloor St. I have been hit by cars twice. The first time was on Bloor St close to Islington, and the other time was in a residential neighbourhood south of Bloor St and east of Royal York. I would like to openly challenge Doug Ford to cycle from Etobicoke to downtown without a bike lane every day. If he can do that, I'll change my mind. I promise.\nDue to these near-death scares, I used to drive from Etobicoke to my office downtown every day. I couldn't take the subway due to my extreme anxiety in crowded environments. It is also impossible to wind my way through residential streets to get downtown, so I never used to bike. I would challenge anyone who says \"move the bike lanes to a smaller street\" to plot a route that is not twice as far as the straight shot down Bloor St and University Ave.\nWhen the bike lanes were opened on Bloor St and University Ave, I was able to start cycling to work and back. I get my groceries along the way in the Royal York and Bloor neighbourhood. I am much happier, much safer, and I am saving money on car maintenance and gas. Furthermore, I have become one less car on the road, making it safer and less congested for everyone.\nOpening up one extra lane on Bloor St will turn a traffic snarl of 20 backed-up vehicles into 40 backed-up vehicles. The reason why drivers don't see the constant flow of cyclists is that we're not stuck beside their window. 80 cyclists can queue up in the same space as 6 cars.\nThe Ford government is simply pushing this legislation as a way to divert from the fact that they want to skip the need for environmental assessments for new highways. They have no evidence, no studies, no third-party assessments that demonstrate any rational reason to remove bike lanes. Perhaps they have never traveled to world class cities that all have great economies, great public transportation systems, and excellent cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Keeping bike lanes in Toronto is essential for several reasons. Protected bike lanes offer an affordable and accessible form of transportation, especially for those who cannot afford a car or rely on public transit. This inclusivity allows more people to participate in the city\u2019s transportation network without the high costs of owning a vehicle. Also, not only do bike lanes protect cyclists, but they also create a buffer between motor vehicles and pedestrians. This separation improves the overall flow of traffic and reduces the likelihood of accidents involving cars, cyclists, and walkers.\nLong-term traffic reduction requires a shift toward sustainable forms of transportation. Simply increasing space for cars doesn\u2019t change people\u2019s travel behavior. Bike lanes, on the other hand, incentivize cycling as a practical, safe, and efficient alternative, leading to a more balanced and less congested transportation system. When cities invest in expanding roads or parking for cars, it tends to encourage more driving. People who previously avoided driving due to traffic or lack of parking may now choose to drive, leading to congestion returning to the same or even worse levels. This has been observed in many cities around the world, where road expansions fail to reduce long-term traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is fundamentally nonsensical.\nCongestion on Toronto\u2019s streets will not be solved by removing existing and blocking new active transportation options. Bike lanes have proven to be extremely popular wherever they\u2019ve been installed. Making cycling safer and easier incentivizes more people to do so, reducing demand on both public transportation and automobiles. They have also not been found to significantly reduce vehicular travel speed, reducing travel times only by minutes on average.\nThe benefits of bike lanes aside, removing existing bike lanes would be a monumentally bizarre decision. This would be a trifecta of bad decisions: millions of dollars would be wasted not only on the removal cost of a popular transportation option, but also its previous installation; a popular and effective transit option on major thoroughfares would be removed and lead to congestion; and drivers would be inconvenienced anyway by the construction work of removing permanent bike lanes and rebuilding the roadbed.\nThis effort also represents another glaring example of this government\u2019s willingness to trample over the jurisdiction of municipalities and the desires of people living within them. This government has consistently inserted itself into the affairs of municipalities based on what appears to be lingering petty grievances the premier holds towards the city he once worked for. While municipalities are not constitutional entities and are creatures of the provinces, this move tramples a long-standing convention of letting cities handle their own transport systems. It is especially brash to legislate how a city uses its own streets that aren\u2019t even provincially maintained. The provincial government was more than happy to ignore the crumbling state of the Gardiner Expressway for decades before it was under their control, but has now decided to insert itself into the affairs of city streets it does not pay to maintain.\nThis bill represents everything this government has come to be known for over its 6-year tenure; trampling over municipal jurisdiction, wasting millions in public funds, and acting on the petty grievances of an immature premier. Passing this bill into law would be an enormous mistake not soon forgotten by the citizens of the most populous city\u2014and most vote-rich jurisdiction\u2014in the province.\n"

        "comment": "This plan to remove bike lanes from Bloor/Yonge/University is phenomenally stupid.\nHow much taxpayer money has been spent on installing these bike lanes and now how much taxpayer money will be spent ripping them out? Also, if a municipality wants to install bike lanes shouldn't that be up to the municipality? I live in Toronto. I don't care if bike lanes are or aren't installed in Brampton or elsewhere. That's none of my business. What's with all this government red tape preventing stuff that people who live in these neighborhoods actually want in their communities. This doesn't seem inherently conservative.\nIf cyclists choose to continue to cycle on these streets once the bike lanes have been removed, they will be entitled to take an entire lane. That won't help address congestion. It certainly won't prevent cyclist deaths. What's this going to actually solve?\nI'm not surprised by this plan, just disappointed.\n"
