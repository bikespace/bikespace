        "comment": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation that would limit or remove bike lanes  in Toronto. First of all provincial overreach on municipal planning is wrong. I am both a cyclist and an occasional driver, and there are challenges to both modes of transportation. Please do not remove the bike lanes. They are essential to a vibrant, modern healthy city. There are indeed problems, and some of those problems can be dealt with through improving the culture of cycling and the culture of driving in the city . Drivers must be better informed about the rules of the road as they pertain to cyclists. Cyclists must be made to have lights. They should be ticketed if they do not. E bikes and e scooters Must be properly regulated. The police must be empowered to regulate them , to fine  them or to remove them from bike lanes.  in my experience  police do not even know the bike lane regulations which is an outrageous unacceptable state of affairs.  The province and the city must rise to these challenges instead of shrinking from them. Shrinking from the Challenge of creating safer cities where cyclists and drivers and pedestrians all understand the rules and can get from point a to B is a disservice to all citizens. Removing bike lanes  is a weak and Short sighted move . I also object to the way that the data has been manipulated: that\u2019s corruption!\n"

        "comment": "I use the bike lanes often and view them as essential transportation infrastructure!\nSeparating cyclists from vehicles is essential to achieve Vision Zero (see Vision Zero Plan Overview, Toronto.ca). If ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users if not convincing enough somehow, bike lanes actually ease congestion in the long term. People want active transportation systems, and they use them when they are safe, available and consistent (see \"Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion? Here's what the research says, CBC News, Oct. 22/2024).\nCycling is inexpensive, good exercise, and a great way to commute in a city.\n"

        "comment": "- harmful to those who cannot drive\n- infastructre is working well and difficult to remove\n- adds unecessary red tape and oversteps into municipal decisions\nAs an Ontarian without a driver's license this change would drastically lower my ability to get where I need to be in reasonable times.\nThe bike lanes explicity stated to be removed are very useful to people getting to the places they need. They have infastructre that would be needlessly difficult to remove and are good at encouraging people who want to cycle to actually do so. Ridership on these lanes has increased well with the work that has gone into improving these lanes and routes for cyclists. A single additional lane of car traffic in these areas would not compare to the capacity of a fully utilised bike network, in effect increasing gridlock as the road is filled with the people who were cycling being forced to drive.\nThis proposal is also overstepping what the Ontario government should be doing. Bike lanes already need to go through their municipal governments to be approved, so requiring another provincial review of potentially all existing bike lanes that took space from motor vehicles is absurd. There is no need to add unecessary red tape to upgrading infastructre for the residents of the municipalities. The provincial governments job in transportation infastructure should be in getting to and around cities. Once inside the cities, the municipalities should decide for themselves how best to control transportation.\n"

        "comment": "The only proven way to reduce car traffic (\u201creducing gridlock\u201d) is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Spending tax dollars to remove existing bike lane infrastructure is a poor political calculation that doesn\u2019t address the needs of the constituency or make good on the promises made in this bill. Investment in the expansion of quality bike lanes and quality public transit will ultimately be the best antidote for car traffic. Every ride made on a bike or on transit keeps a car off the road (thus freeing up more space for the people who do choose to drive, not to mention the reduction in emissions). Without bike lanes, the road becomes a more dangerous and unpredictable place for everyone, drivers and riders alike. I\u2019d like to think that the provincial government has access to this information. If not, we may need to think about changing things up. If so, please trust the data and the experts and do the right thing.\n"

Motor vehicles are a know source of air pollution.  While so many cities around the world are working to reducing motor vehicle traffic (ie. Paris, London, Berlin, Pontevedra, Copenhagen) it is extremely disappointing that this government\nis pursuing a policy that could increase reliance on cars, exacerbating air quality issues and undermining efforts to promote sustainable transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this legislation. Bike lanes have shown to decrease traffic congestion over time; adding more car lanes has actually shown to increase congestion over time. Additionally, bike lanes are a crucial way to keep Ontarians safe while engaging in a healthy, environmentally friendly, convenient, and fast mode of transportation.\nRemoving existing lanes is particularly nonsensical. The infrastructure already exists and is well used - to tear up perfectly functional roads for more construction is a waste of taxpayer dollars on top of bad policy.\nThe Conservative government should spend its time and money trying to solve the problems it has created in health care, education, and other realms rather than solving its politicians' personal pet peeves. Government is for the people, not for the rulers. Act like the public servants you are supposed to be.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Downtown Toronto and, although I own a car, I choose to use it as little as possible in the city. This choice ensures that I do not contribute to the traffic gridlock that is a constant feature of Torlonto living and, of course, also reduces the impact on the environment.\nTo get around the city, I walk, take the TTC, and bike where it is safe to do so. Over the past few years, the increase in the number of safe bike lanes in the city means that I have been able to bike further afield - especially onto Bloor Street West and Midtown Yonge Street - streets that were previously unsafe for cyclists. Now I am able to regularly shop and dine at restaurants in these areas and so contribute to small businesses who are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. Should these bike lanes be removed, I will no longer be able to visit these areas with the same regularity.\nI would urge you to consider the needs of all Torontontians in the city - not just those who choose to drive their cars - and continue to treat safety for cyclists and pedestrians as being of paramount importance.\nPlease do not remove the existing bike lanes and allow the local elected representatives (Toronto City Council) to make decisions on when and where future bike lanes and complete streets are installed.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Submission on Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the provisions within Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which would require provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal introduces significant challenges when evaluated against the foundational rights articulated in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment\nThe EBR, as highlighted in your SEV, affirms that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This right is directly relevant to urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live and work. Urban environmental health critically influences human well-being through:\n* Air quality, especially at street level, where people walk and bike.\n* Noise levels, which impact mental and physical health.\n* Safe and accessible transportation options for active travel.\n* Urban heat island mitigation and enhanced street-level temperatures.\n* Quality of life in vibrant, livable urban spaces.\nBike lanes are essential to creating healthful urban environments. They contribute by:\n* Improving road safety for all users.\n* Reducing air and noise pollution.\n* Promoting public health through active transportation.\n* Supporting sustainable and equitable mobility options.\n* Enhancing livability and fostering human-centered urban design.\nBy introducing barriers to bike lane implementation, Bill 212 risks undermining this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The Ministry\u2019s commitment to \"protect, conserve, and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must include urban areas where environmental quality directly affects health and well-being.\nConcerns with Bill 212\nConflict with Multi-Modal Transportation Goals\nThe SEV emphasizes \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation,\" recognizing that these improvements help \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, Bill 212:\n* Contradicts the Ministry\u2019s recognition that active transportation reduces congestion.\n* Prioritizes single-occupancy vehicle infrastructure over sustainable alternatives.\n* Undermines efforts to integrate transit and cycling networks.\n* Places disproportionate administrative burdens on municipalities pursuing active transportation solutions.\nInsufficient Environmental Assessments\nWhile Bill 212 references consideration of \"implications to the environment,\" this is insufficient given SEV commitments to:\n* Integrate sustainability into decision-making.\n* Reduce transportation-related air emissions and water pollution.\n* Conserve energy and mitigate climate impacts.\nComprehensive environmental impact assessments should include:\n* Air quality impacts from changes in transportation patterns.\n* Water pollution risks from increased vehicle traffic, including oil, tire particles, and de-icing * chemicals.\n* Comparative benefits of bike infrastructure, which has minimal environmental impact.\nClimate Change and Sustainability Goals\nThe SEV outlines clear commitments to:\n* Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation.\n* Increase sustainable travel options.\n* Support innovation in sustainable mobility technologies.\nBy creating additional obstacles to bike lane development, Bill 212 undermines progress toward these objectives and hinders Ontario's ability to address climate change.\nEvidence-Based Decision-Making\nBill 212\u2019s narrow focus on traffic flow data:\n* Ignores the SEV mandate to consider \"social, economic, and scientific considerations.\"\n* Imposes asymmetric scrutiny, requiring municipalities to justify sustainable infrastructure while exempting vehicle-centric projects from equivalent assessments.\n* Overlooks broader benefits of bike lanes, including public health, safety, environmental quality, and economic growth.\nMunicipal Planning and Integration\nThe SEV emphasizes the integration of transportation, land use, and environmental planning. However, Bill 212:\n* Undermines municipal autonomy to implement locally appropriate solutions.\n* Creates regulatory uncertainty that discourages innovative transportation projects.\n* Delays critical safety improvements for cyclists and pedestrians.\nRecommendations\nTo align Bill 212 with the Ministry\u2019s SEV and the EBR, I recommend the following:\nRevise Evaluation Criteria\nEnsure criteria reflect environmental, public health, and safety benefits, including:\n* Air quality improvements and climate mitigation.\n* Urban livability and safety enhancements.\n* Accessibility and equitable transportation outcomes.\nRequire Comprehensive Assessments\nExpand data requirements to consider:\n* Seasonal and induced demand for cycling.\n* Public health and safety metrics.\n* Community well-being and environmental impacts.\nFacilitate Municipal Collaboration\n* Streamline approval processes to support integrated municipal planning.\n* Provide clear guidance to align local projects with provincial goals.\nConclusion\nWhile the stated intent of Bill 212 is to reduce gridlock and save time, the evidence supporting additional car infrastructure as a solution to congestion is mixed at best. Research consistently demonstrates that expanding car lanes often leads to induced demand, where increased road capacity encourages more driving, ultimately exacerbating congestion rather than alleviating it. In contrast, investments in active transportation, such as bike lanes, have been shown to reduce congestion by providing viable alternatives to car travel.\nBy creating additional barriers to the implementation of bike lanes, Bill 212 risks undermining broader efforts to build healthier, more sustainable, and equitable communities. I urge the Ministry to revise this legislation to align with its commitments under the SEV and EBR, prioritizing evidence-based strategies that foster livable urban environments and truly address the root causes of gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford, Minister Sarkaria, and MPPs,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to your proposed Bill 212. I am opposed to this legislation for the following reasons;\nSafety: Removing separated cycling lanes from busy roads makes cyclists and all road users unsafe. When cyclists (and other micromobility users such as E-Scooters which I am collectively referring to as \u201ccyclists\" and \u201cbikes\u201d) find that the road is too unsafe they will use the sidewalk. This is extremely unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Pedestrians, particularly seniors, people with disabilities, children, and people walking pets, are not able to move out of the way of cyclists or they step unwittingly into the path of cyclists. In many cases one or the other is forced to step out onto the roadway in order to avoid a collision. These incidents result in serious injuries to both pedestrians and cyclists, and they make people, particularly seniors and the disabled, afraid to walk. Further, separated cycling lanes make the roads safer for cars because they do not come into conflict with cyclists who are trying to navigate roads that are riddled with obstacles, such as sewer grates, debris, parked cars etc. that require that they move into live traffic lanes. If avoiding gridlock, rather than safety is your primary goal, then I would point out that motor vehicle collisions, and collisions with other road users are a major factor in causing said gridlock;\nLocal Decision-Making: Local communities, including City and Regional Councils, understand the nature and cultures of their communities better than the Province, and are better able to make decisions that are responsive to the wants and needs of all of their residents. They also engage in extensive consultations throughout the planning process to try to address, as best as possible, the needs of a diverse group of their residents. I am quite aware of how the planning process works in the City of Kitchener and Waterloo Region, and that there were, and are, extensive consultations regarding the installation of cycling infrastructure, including separated cycling lanes, in our community. That a few people are unhappy with them is no justification for the Province to intervene. In a democracy such as ours, if the majority of people disagree they have the mechanism of the ballot box to voice their opinion;\nEnvironmental and Climate Change: Not only are cars significant contributors to greenhouse gasses, air and water pollution, and overall environmental degradation, so is the construction, maintenance, repair of roads. Encouraging people to use alternate means of transportation is critical if we are to even begin to address the imminent collapse of the systems that keep us alive. Bicycle lanes encourage provide people to ride bicycles and pedestrians to walk on city city sidewalks by providing safe zones away from cars in which to do so;\nBureaucracy: Your government ran on a platform of reducing \u201cred tape.\u201d Now you wish for the provincial government to interfere in matters of local jurisdiction by putting another level of review and approval requirements on local and planning decisions, thereby increasing costs for taxpayers across this Province, and delaying planning decisions for local governments;\nHealth: it has been demonstrably proven that people who are active are physically and mentally healthier than those who are not. Providing safe cycling lanes encourages people, including children, to cycle, Given the crisis in our health care system, encouraging people to be active should be a top priority;\nEquity: Vast numbers of people are not able to afford a car or have an ability or desire to drive. This proposed legislation further increases the inequity that people who do not drive face in a society that has the motor vehicle as the primary focus of its transportation policy. Providing safe spaces for people to use other means of transportation more safely increases equity;\nCosts: Removing separated cycling lanes is going to cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars and, as noted above, implementing a provincial review process is going to add even further costs for Ontario taxpayers. If reducing gridlock is your true goal, then using that money on better public transit and commuter rail systems (such as your promise to bring two-way, all-day GO train service to Waterloo Region) would have far more impact on reducing gridlock that removing separated cycling lanes;\nData: There is no data that shows that cycling lanes actually increase gridlock, or that removing them will actually solve the problem. The reason why there is gridlock is that there are too many cars on the roads, and if you want to reduce gridlock, the only way to accomplish that is to reduce the number of cars; and\nLocal business and local communities: good cycling and pedestrian infrastructure helps foster local communities and local business. Commuters trying to get from one place to another are far less likely to stop at a local business than are people living in an area who can walk or cycle to that business. People want to live in safe and healthy communities, and part of that is ensuring that there are thriving local business for people to patronize.\nCountries, and world-class cities around the globe are building cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, and people in those cities are taking up cycling and transforming the places they live into wonderful, livable, spaces. One only needs to look at places like the Netherlands, Paris, Copenhagen to see how the decision to move away from a car-centric culture has benefits for everyone. I have spoken with many people in the Netherlands about this, and they all say that it was not an easy, or even popular, proposal when the policy was first implemented, but that it was the best thing that their government ever did. Ripping out cycling infrastructure and restricting its constructions is not only a colossal waste of taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money, it is also poor planning that will have absolutely no effect the problem that you are trying to solve. Those taxpayer dollars could and should be spent on finding solutions that actually work - to wit: reducing the number of cars on the road.\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n"

We should be making the city more accessible for people of all walks of life- including:\nPeople who\u2019s main mode of transportation is biking (who cannot afford a vehicle)\nThose looking to make their commute healthier and safer by biking to work (the ttc remains a place where women and LGBTQ+ community members feel endangered)\nIt is incredibly dangerous to bike in Toronto without bike lanes. Our city\u2019s drivers remain unaware of bikers and pedestrians, or perhaps they simply do not care about the safety of others. Their driving is unsafe and they do not look to see if others are around their vehicle.\nOur environment continues to be sacrificed again and again. Our government should be prioritizing a healthier and safer place for all to live in. If we remove bike lanes, we are taking steps BACKWARDS in history. There are many cities where biking is the main mode of transportation (Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Montreal, Berlin, Paris) and not only are the bike lanes incredibly safe because the majority of the commuters are biking, but because the vehicles know to prioritize the safety of the bikers. Removing the bike lanes sends the message that the government doesn\u2019t care about the environment, the future of our city, the young people living here, those who are unable to afford a car, and mostly, DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS.\nWe should be moving forward.

If so much as a single meter of bike lanes are removed through this law, I will never vote for Doug Ford for as long as he is on a ballot in an election. Bike lanes are one of the best ways we as a city and a province can get more people moving faster. Ultimately, it is cars that cause traffic. If we give people more options to travel, less cars will be on the road, and everyone will be able to move more efficiently. We cannot build a modern province if we will only be serving one type of commuter. Cars, bikes, subways, and regional rail is ALL required for the people of this great province to move and get to work/school/etc. I voted for Doug Ford before because I believed he had a vision for bringing Ontario to a bright future, but if Bill 212 passes then I will see that I was clearly mistaken.\n"

Requiring approval by the Ministry would cost money, time, and resources not currently spent. It is an indication of further overreach and red tape by a government that says it is against red tape. Further, the removal of existing lanes would result in more dangerous roads for all road users as speed and lack of awareness of humans on the street grow, and it would leave those who cannot drive with fewer options to move in their cities. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong in their city - with this overreach, you are forcing decisions to be made by people who are not connected to the community, for the people who make up that community. The only outcome can be a less connected, less human environment.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist, and a car driver, I am appalled at the proposed law to ban bike lanes. If enacted it will not reduce congestion (cars do that, bicycles reduce it) while at the same time make cycling more dangerous and therefore less attractive as an alternate form of transportation. Furthermore the Province shouldn\u2019t be meddling in local government. Municipalities are the ones who understand their communities the best and where and whether to install bike lanes, or in fact to remove them. If the Premier wants to eliminate bike lanes in Toronto (which this bill targets) then he should resign and run for Mayor. Trotting out bogus statistics to justify this action amplifies the weakness of the government\u2019s policy. Suggesting bike lanes only on secondary streets ignores that, at least in our city, secondary streets rarely run in a straight line and therefore make commuting by bike longer and more complicated. The result is cycling on more dangerous routes or commuting by car, causing further congestion. Also, secondary streets are already narrower than main roads so how would adding bike lanes there ease traffic? Finally, the Premier\u2019s war on bikes emboldens those drivers who already harass and endanger cyclists. Surely the government has better things to do with their time and our money.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lane portion of this bill is not in anyone's best interest. The costly removal will make traffic worse and jeopardize the lives of vulnerable road users. The provincial government should stay out of cities jurisdiction, and use taxpayer money towards projects that bring the province forward, not backward. If discussions are needed in attempts to mitigate traffic congestion, fine. But deciding that bike lanes on bloor, yonge and university will be ripped out no matter what the data says, is undemocratic and wrong.\nThere are no secondary streets parallel to these, as the grid is disjointed and disrupted by rivers, rail corridors and cemeterys. Forcing traffic to share lanes with cars will put lives at risk, and slow down drivers who have to wait behind bikes. This will lead to less people travelling by bike, and more cars on the road and transit users overcrowding the network.\nThe line 1 and 2 subways, lines that go directly under the streets in question, can carry higher volumes of people than the 401. And the expanding GO network-led by your administration, can mive way more people into the city centre than any roads or highways. An extra lane for cars on three roads will do nothing to address the regional traffic issues and is only a political ploy to gain support from drivers.\nThe only solution to traffic congestion is providing alternates to driving. Cities from London to New York to Los Angeles know this, and so does your government. The data does not support this decision and we did not sign up to have our taxpayer dollars go towards such a reckless policy. My conservative voting friends and family will not vote for a government that puts the lives of their loved ones at risk. Please reverse course.\n"
