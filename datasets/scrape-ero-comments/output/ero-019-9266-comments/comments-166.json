        "comment": "It has been very frustrating the last few years to see the changes made to our downtown streets.  While I certainly understand making streets safer, it seems as though decisions are made by persons as though it were a board game rather than real life.  Bike lands that are basically not used for at least half of the year have come to dominate the city.\nGridlock on the city is out of control and much has to do with the over zealous reduction of the ability for drivers to get around.  This is Canada.  This is Toronto.  There will always be drivers.  Making it difficult and slow to traverse through the city does no one any good and makes for angry residents.   Do we honestly think that adding bike lanes is going to make a 50 year old woman ride her bike in November rather than drive to the grocery store?\nYou are making our city unpleasant to live in.  These are not improvements to the overall fabric of our city.\nThe addition of the bikelanes on Yonge street has been a nightmare.  I live off of Yonge Street near Bloor  The additional time it now takes to move around the city hear that area is truly unbelievable.  The time it can take to move a few blocks is horrendous because the lanes have been so reduced.     It took me 7 minutes to move from Aylmer street to Crescent Road last week.  I timed it.  The distance is approximately 200 yards at best.  This is because the bike lanes have taken over.   So while I sat there, 7 bikes - only 7 - passed me by on the right.  How does that make any sense.  This while we are still in bike riding season.  Two months from now, it will probably be 2 or 3 bikes while all traffic is gridlocked as the 2-3 bikes drive by - (probably while almost being run down by the electric bike).\nAnother huge and increasing problem in the city are the electric bikes who now use the bike lanes to travel unimpeded through bike lanes at tremendous speeds.   They are a huge problem for drivers, pedestrians and also cyclists.   If you want to make the city safer, do something about enforcing rules for ebikes.  They drive those roads, sidewalks, bike lanes and everywhere else at ridiculous speeds and with absolutely o sense of safety.  They drive as though there are no lanes and no rules.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is pointless. It won't reduce gridlock because all the people who can't bike any more would have to drive a car instead, so you're just increasing traffic.\nIt would also cost the government more to administer, or take tax dollars from more important programs to administer. The only other option is to not administer it at all, and prevent municipalities from creating infrastructure and services for thier own people, no matter how much it is wanted/needed, even by a huge majority. Which would be the antithesis of democracy.\nIt also doesn't get bikes out of the way of cars, because they both have to use the same infrastucture, instead of each having a place to be.\nI'm not interested in paying more tax because of Ford's uneducated assumptions.\nI'm not interested in more cars on the road.\nI'm not interested in more conflict between bikes and cars.\nIt makes more sense to make a rule that every road, everywhere in the province must have the bike lanes painted on them. That way cars have a bike free path to drive everywhere. Bikes have a car-free space to themselves and don't have to worry about conflict. More people would bike then, and there would be fewer cars in the car lanes, and with fewer cars there would be less gridlock.\n(I don't think the present bike lane structure is ideal, but I think automically painting the bike lanes every road would solve a lot of problems).\n"

        "comment": "It should not be within the authority of the provincial minister of transportation or the ministry of transportation to make decisions about municipal road use planning, including decisions about whether and where a municipality wants to build a bike lane.\nI pay municipal property taxes to my local city government and those taxes fund municipal roads, bike lanes and sidewalks. As such decisions about how those funds are allocated and how those projects are planned and implemented should be made by my locally-elected municipal councilors and mayor.\nThe minister of transportation has no role in deciding whether a pot hole in front of my house gets fixed, whether a sidewalk gets build or where a bus stop is located. Likewise they should not have a role in determining whether the road is redesigned to add a bike lane to enable safer travel by cyclists.\nFor an environmental perspective, we know that bike lanes do not cause traffic. Cars cause traffic. The best way to address issues of gridlock is to create alternative transportation options for people to get where they need to go. That includes trains, public transit, improved pedestrian facilities and bike lanes. The better the infrastructure for cyclists, the more people who will ride, especially with the growth in e-bikes and scooters.\nIf I choose to get to work by bike, which I do year-round in Ottawa, that means I am not driving my car, burning fuel, taking up space on the road and in parking lot, and generally adding to traffic volume. This reduces gridlock for other drivers. As a bonus I get some physical activity in my day and am a healthier person than I would be if I drove 3kms to work every day.\nThis provision in Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock and will not save time. It is an inappropriate overreach of ministerial authority into municipal planning decisions and is politicizing local road use decisions.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Yonge st have caused major problems to residential streets.  The new gridlock on Yonge means that drivers try to leave onto side streets.  This has happened on Roxborough st W which is the first left turn on Yonge after Davenport  . The traffic heads to avenue road.  But this detour gets blocked so from 2pm the traffic backs up from Avenue Rd to past Molson on Rox W.  Every day.\nMy daughter lives on that section with 3 children. They had a big problem with selling their house due to traffic issues . Nobody wants to live there now.\nPeople who work in the area and needs car find it takes them double the time it used to.\nWe have pointless cafe tables on the street outside a pub that already has a sidewalk patio! ( the Quail).  There are bust stops now that take over a lane( on Yonge and Macpherson) that are built up and with barricades.   Buses on Yonge ?  We have a subway for Yonge but it always breaks down\nThe cycle lanes are always empty except for electric bikes for food delivery.  And they use the sidewalks if they can.\nIam a resident of 40+ years.  The bike lobby are not local.  Our whole city is now the worse gridlock in all North America.\n"

        "comment": "How in the world can you call this bill  Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act?  Nothing like a little bias heading into the project.\nThe further addition of even more bike lanes has absolutely, totally and completely increased gridlock in the city to an extreme extent.     This saves time?  It has added frustration and made Toronto a far less pleasant city to live in.\nNo more bike lanes.  There are too many.  They dominate the streets - or take up street space in the wintertime when the number of riders dwindles to a few.\nCome on people, have some sense.   Bike safety is great and I am all for it. , but it has gotten out of hand.  People need to be able to get around - not just on bikes.\nThere needs to be some balance.\n"

        "comment": "This bill unfairly targets low-income wage earners and commuters by reducing marginal and un-protected road space for the minimal benefit of larger vehicles that are too often the root cause of traffic gridlock. Removing cycling lanes will put Ontario citizens who commute by bicycle at even greater risk by forcing them to ride amongst dense urban traffic.\nCycling lanes have been proven to be of great financial benefit to small Ontario businesses, allowing people to travel easily between destinations without having to worry about the hassle of parking.\nThis bill also bypasses important infrastructure project development processes such as environmental studies, a decision that most likely will result in long-term negative impact environmentally and economically. Without proper infrastructure research and development, Ontario risks an unsteady and potentially costly future for many, for short term financial gains for few.\n"

        "comment": "First, this act is written to appeal to drivers and drivers are not the only people in Ontario that need to get around. In fact, there should be more investment in the condition, safety, and frequency for alternative methods of transportation like biking, walking, or taking transit. The greater number of individuals that use an alternative method, the less congested the vehicle lanes will be for those who want or need to drive. Calling this a \"saving you time\" act is disregarding the many people who live in and visit Ontario and do not have the luxury or the want to get around by car. How do you plan on saving time for those on the streetcar that is constantly being delayed by left-turning vehicles? Removing bike lanes and inducing more vehicles back on our roads? This won't get anyone anywhere faster. More people will choose to drive if you decrease (or prevent future increase) safe cycling infrastructure and that will only make congestion and gridlock worse.\nThe second item on your proposal mentioned that accidents (collisions) worsen congestion and impact the quality of life for Ontarians. Protected and separated bike lanes increase safety and helps prevent collisions between vulnerable road users and drivers of vehicles. If these vulnerable users are protected, you are preventing these collisions that worsen congestion and quality of life. High speed collisions, like those that occur on highways with increased maximum speed and lax enforcement, are the ones that will cause the most congestion as substantial resources are needed to help those involved. If you would sincerely like to decrease collisions, you would be reducing the speed on streets and highways across Ontario.\nI disagree that provincial approval will be required to install bike lanes where a vehicular lane will be removed/affected. If you are proposing to require provincial approval to install bike lanes, you should have a set of criteria in place before trying to pass this act. What are you measuring? Who is impacted? How are you using this data to inform decision-making? It is irresponsible to have a put forth an act without even publishing your criteria.\nI disagree that the highways that fall under your proposed \"building highways faster act\" should be exempt from environmental impact assessment.\nI disagree that the Highway Traffic Act should be amended to require Ministry approval to build bike lanes.\n"

Having good bike infrastructure is a cornerstone of efficient last mile movement in dense urban environments. Doug Ford is I'll informed. The very name of this bill is a travesty. Increasing car lanes is not going to help congestion longterm, please google induced demand Dougie boy! Make alternatives to cars safe and accessible, and viola, less congestion(see european cities with toronto like populations like Berlin).\nEspecially the brand new ones on University ave. , ostensibly being targeted for assaulting Fords suburban sensibilities as he makes his way to queens park. Show us some numbers! Bikes hardly get noticed by cars (see:bike deaths by car) but I assure you they are being well used.\nPlease, for the love of God, do not waste our money on this nonsense.\n"

City officials are engaged with the communities directly impacted by these decisions on a day-to-day basis, and I trust them to have the insight to make the correct decisions for their constituents, balancing the needs of businesses with public safety. In many cases, the installation of bike lines increases traffic to local businesses. Local governing officials have the on the ground information necessary to make informed choices, and it makes no sense for the province, which is far less engaged, to have final say on these decisions.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my family's vehement opposition to measures in this Bill that will impede the implementation of more bike lanes and, even more disappointingly, remove current bike lanes in the province.\nI favour the expansion of bike lanes, not only as a cyclist but also as a regular driver. I am more than happy for my drive to take a few minutes longer, if it means increased safety for people who are travelling in more vulnerable modes of transportation. In fact, as a driver I prefer bike lanes, as they make driving less stressful--I do not need to worry about injuring cyclists. Before Toronto started seriously expanding its bike lanes on major thoroughfares, I never rode my bike to work - I never even considered it. Over the past few years, the growth of a real Toronto bike lane network has meant that myself and my young family have become a regular cyclists, which is better for our health, the economy, government finances and the environment.\nOne would think that a provincial government that constantly promotes their measures to keep costs down for individuals and families in Ontario and rails the supposed increased costs of the federal carbon tax would do all that it can to enhance forms of transportation that are low cost, like cycling. But instead, the government is proposing to rip up existing bike lanes (at the cost of millions of dollars) and essentially stop the implementation of more bike lanes - both of which will force more people into cars, costing families more money, inhibiting their physical health and hurting the environment. This is a lose-lose proposal.\nThis proposed policy is short-term thinking that lacks any supporting evidence, full stop. We live in a world that is facing the effects of climate change and in dire need of sustainable transportation solutions. This proposal is a step backwards, and one that will hurt future generations like my children. In addition, I have yet to see any studies that prove bike lanes are bad for businesses or moving people (vs just moving vehicles). In fact, quite the opposite.\nI ask the government to rethink this policy for the safety and well-being of all Ontarians.\n"

It is downright embarrassing to live in a province where the government wants to undermine projects that would enable us to grow toward a more environmentally friendly future.\nThe provincial government should be investing in infrastructure that is not reliant on motor vehicles, including walking, cycling, and public transportation. The provincial government should also be supporting municipalities engaged in these projects, not undermining those efforts through approval processes that are not based on any concern for environmental impact or safety.\nBike lanes make commuting more safe for cyclists and motor vehicle users. Bike lanes also ensure cyclists are off and away from main roads so that cars and bikes do not have to share lanes, causing further congestion and dangerous driving conditions for all road users.\nPlease do the right thing and stop this bill from becoming law.\n"

        "comment": "I'm no longer gobsmacked when the Doug Ford government makes an idiotic decision. These are the people, after all, who are gleefully destroying Ontario Place, spending one billion taxpayer dollars to accelerate access to beer in corner stores and bribing us with our own money ahead of an early election call.\nBut making it impossible for municipalities to install safe cycling infrastructure where it's needed most -- and proposing the destruction of existing networks -- goes way beyond stupid. It's dangerous and cruel.\nThese cars-over-everything proposals may seem to Ford like ballot-box winners, but they come at a very steep cost: the lives of vulnerable road users. Because Ford can rip out all the bike lanes he wants, but the bikes -- and scooters -- won't disappear. For thousands of Torontonians, they're the only way to get around in this increasingly unaffordable province. What's more, they're the lifeblood of entire sectors of the gig economy. Ever enjoyed UberEats after a long day at work or school? You should probably thank a cyclist.\nIt should come as no surprise that Ford continues to mindlessly prioritize the demands of vehicle drivers. His is the government that watches our once-vaunted healthcare and public education systems whither away to nothing while cutting the gas tax, doing away with vehicle registration payments and committing billions to building new highways -- highways that will be gridlocked within months of opening thanks to induced demand. He will always shamelessly pander to his base because he has no shame.\nNever mind that data overwhelmingly show that bike lanes actually reduce congestion, boost safety for all road users -- including drivers -- improve streetscapes and increase retail spending, per the Bloor Annex BIA. Of course, Doug Ford isn't exactly known for making data-based decisions. Why bother acting on the evidence when stirring up anger against vulnerable road users is so good for poll numbers, right?\nDoug Ford and Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria still have time to do the right thing here. Rescind this glaringly bad piece of proposed legislation and stop endangering the lives of those who just want to get around on two wheels instead of four.\n"

        "comment": "A ridiculous act that will do that exact opposite of what it promises. This act will directly take power away from municipalities and their ability to self govern. This will also cause wasteful use of precious resources at the provincial level. This is all without even mentioning how the logic behind this bill is completely and utterly flawed and goes against the consensus of city planners and experts world wide. Creating barriers for car alternatives, such as bicycles, will only put more cars on the road, increasing grid lock and wasting the time of all commuters. Forcing municipalities to jump through hoops in order to support cyclists is major barrier, and will only increase gridlock. Prioritizing highways will also only induce further gridlock within major population centers. There's countless ways to actually reduce congestion, this bill will only make things worse.\n"
