Not only are bicycles already not allowed on 400-series highways (which the province has oversight on), bicycle lanes in cities should be handled by the municipal government, not provincial. It has also been scientifically proven that adding more vehicle lanes does not reduce traffic congestion over a long period of time.\n"

Spending all this money to tear down existing bikes lanes will make gridlock worse, make our streets less safe, and cause local businesses to lose revenue. Some areas don\u2019t need bike lanes but they are essential in the downtown core.\n"

When installed, bike lanes see immediate use and car traffic decreases. Conversely, if bike lanes are removed and replaced with motor vehicle lanes, more drivers are encouraged, worsening congestion due to induced demand.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is provincial over-reach to municipalities who know far better whether or not a bike lane is needed in a particular municipal road.  What input could the province possibly have that the municipality does not have in deciding where to build a bike lane?\nIt is blatant pandering to non-urban voters who may not understand the opportunity to transport people around the city safely on bikes with no pollution and relieving congestion by getting them out of cars.  Bikes are becoming more prevalent and are an important part of commuting and delivery.\nWhy not make a bill that requires drivers to re-take their driver's license test every two years to improve driving skills and therefore traffic flow?  Perhaps enforce distracted driving laws so that car drivers are paying attention to the traffic and driving instead of checking their phones at a green light?\nWhy is the car assumed to be superior in the bill?  It appears that getting cars moving is the only metric that the bill is trying to solve for. What about safety?  Person kilometers per tonne of carbon? Why not flip it and make the bill require municipalities to seek provincial approval for building new lanes for cars where removing a bike lane is required?\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad decision. Bike lanes are good for so many reasons - supporting local businesses, enhancing citizens' local knowledge + community advocacy, promoting people's health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions - and  they ultimately *decrease* car traffic by providing people with other feasible transportation options. Getting rid of these lanes will not solve anything, it will in fact make traffic worse ultimately and jeopardize the health and safety of many!\n"

        "comment": "Shunting bicycles onto secondary streets is using government to \"pick winners\", giving motor vehicles preferred place regardless of their lack of merit.\nSegregated cycling is needed solely due to \"motor culture\", the assumed privilege of motorists, which will take a generation to age out of commuters. Compare the relative prevalence of roundabout or LRT collisions, novel situations for many drivers, versus collisions at traditional intersections, interactions that all drivers have completely internalized. Segregated bike lanes built today are meant for the next generation; tearing them out only delays expanding and refining their design later.\n"

It\u2019s a myth that bike lanes are causing more traffic, we need investments in transit and cycling to AVOID people needing to drive everywhere. I say this as someone who has lived in the city 24 years and is forced to drive sometimes when I would take transit because of convenience.\n"

        "comment": "I am disappointed in the province\u2019s decision to require approval of any new bike lanes that take away from space for cars. This decision will not only negatively affect cyclists; it affects all people who live in communities across Ontario.\nI am writing to you as a concerned resident of Lambton Shores to express my strong support for the expansion of bike lanes in communities across our province. Ontario is at a critical juncture, and investing in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the pressing environmental and transportation challenges.\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Students and workers depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to get to their destinations. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nThis proposed legislation demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing transportation and climate change challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nI urge you and your colleagues to take strong action in support of expanding Ontario\u2019s bike lanes network.\nIn closing, I strongly urge the Ontario government to reconsider this regressive proposal. By prioritizing cycling infrastructure, we can build safer, more sustainable, and more inclusive communities that benefit everyone. The future of our communities, our health, and our environment depends on it.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing a comprehensive and accountable response from all levels of government.\n"

        "comment": "The stated goal of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d yet it employs measures that compromise public health, mobility, environmental protection, and safety. In fact, this Act threatens Ontario's communities by intensifying the ongoing climate crisis and undercutting local autonomy.\nThis mandate requiring provincial approval for bike lane construction where they \"replace a lane of traffic\" \u2014despite municipalities already having this authority under the Municipal Act\u2014is a blatant overreach. It reveals a lack of trust in local governments to govern effectively and an apparent disregard for local democracy. Municipalities only construct bike lanes after rigorous planning, research, and public consultation, demonstrating their commitment to safe, accessible roads. This provincial interference undermines these democratic processes, suggesting a government intent on control rather than partnership.\nIt is also a fact that adding car lanes does not reduce traffic congestion. Decades of research on \"induced demand\" show that more car lanes lead to more traffic. If reducing gridlock were truly the goal, the government would prioritize major transit infrastructure and expand cycling networks, offering genuine relief from congestion and pollution. Every bike on the road replaces a car, taking up far less space and making driving easier for those who need it.\nThe proposed removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto\u2014which serve thousands of users daily\u2014will put more cars back on the road and hurt local businesses that thrive in bike-friendly areas. Business Improvement Associations (BIAs) and city studies on Toronto\u2019s Bloor Street have demonstrated that bike lanes increase business by making local areas more accessible and inviting.\nCycling is also a healthier, more sustainable option, reducing healthcare costs and making streets safer for everyone\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. Tragically, Toronto has already lost six cyclists this year, each one an unnecessary loss, leaving families shattered. Bike lanes can save lives.\nMoreover, bike lanes make cities more accessible for people who cannot afford cars, insurance, gas, or parking fees, allowing them to contribute to and participate in their communities. Car-dominated cities exclude lower-income residents from essential activities and isolate them from opportunities.\nThe proposal to exempt lands for Highway 413 from environmental assessments is equally damaging. This highway would pave over sensitive land, destroying natural carbon sinks, flood plains, and wildlife habitats permanently. Exempting this development from environmental scrutiny reveals a lack of commitment to environmental protection, despite the fact that, as with other road expansions, induced demand will ultimately create more traffic, emissions, and congestion.\nThe evidence is clear: if the government were serious about addressing gridlock, it would invest in robust public transit and support municipal initiatives for sustainable transport. This Act moves in the opposite direction.\nBill 212 is a regressive policy that will worsen traffic, harm local economies, degrade public health, and inflict irreversible damage on our environment. For Ontario\u2019s future, this bill should be halted.\n"

I truly do not understand a) why this is necessary at all, b) who this is even meant to help, c) why the provincial government needs to get involved in such a mundane aspect of local policy and urban development.\nAt the very least, it should be left for the local community to determine if bike lanes are a worthwhile endeavour or not (they certainly are), so that forward-thinking communities can continue to do so.\nI honestly want to see some evidence how this would directly improve the experience of road users, not just gut-feelings or general 'anti-bike' feelings of some decision makers.\n"

This includes London, Paris, Berlin, and even in Manhattan. It saddens me that in Ontario we are apparently moving backwards. Rather than concentrating on facilitating automobile transportation at seemingly every turn, we should be looking at a more wholistic approach which we decidedly are not, despite government rhetoric. Sprawling new subdivisions on former greenfield areas will, in the long and even medium term, make transportation worse and further degrade the quality of life of those who are forced to live there because they cannot afford a family home elsewhere.\n"

At worst his policy seems destined to make traffic worse, and at bare minimum it is is an unwarranted intrusion in to municipal affairs. I would also question why, if it is deemed that the province should have a role in the design of city streets why it is confined to this extremely specific scenario. If it is warranted (which personally do not think it is) it would be be logical to apply to any alterations or expansions to the road network.\n"

Traffic and gridlock in this city is the result of a quickly growing population, post-Covid commuter rebound, a massive increase in Uber and Lyft drivers, construction and other factors. Bike lanes have a negligible effect on this issue. If New York City, London and San Francisco can have a great bike lane structure so can Toronto.\n"
