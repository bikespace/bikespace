        "comment": "I deeply oppose this bill. The removal of bike lanes is a terrible idea that is only going to increase congestion. The measures to increase bureaucracy in order to prevent future bike lanes from being built is not only an overreach of the provincial government, but is again only going to slow down movement in our cities.\nI also oppose the building of highway 413 entirely. I am particularly opposed to the exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for this highway. I firmly believe we should not build any more 400-series highways in Ontario nor expand the existing ones.\nThe true path to reduced congestion would be to increase funding for GO transit service and infrastructure so that they can: run trains/buses more frequently, run trains at faster speeds, have dedicated bus lanes, severely reduce the cost of fares, and expand the network. Additional bike lanes and an expanded bike infrastructure network will also reduce congestion.\n"

        "comment": "In a rapidly growing city with poor infrastructure and the cost of everything increasing, it is crucial to keep bike lanes. They encourage people to be active, get out of cars, and off public transit. They are affordable for families and the dedicated bike lanes promote safety for riders and little kids who are learning to ride as well.\n"

        "comment": "Challenges for Smaller and Rural Municipalities\nFor smaller and rural municipalities, the requirement to seek provincial approval for bicycle lane projects may create unnecessary administrative burdens. These communities often have limited resources and may not have the same levels of congestion or traffic flow concerns as urban centers. Requiring Ministry approval could delay or even discourage these municipalities from implementing beneficial bike lanes, as they may lack the resources to meet added regulatory requirements. Allowing rural and smaller municipalities more flexibility in decision-making could support the development of bike infrastructure suited to their unique needs without imposing undue delays.\nTo better serve smaller and rural municipalities, this proposal should undergo further review, with potential adjustments to avoid unnecessary provincial oversight in areas where it may not be warranted.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is ridiculous. It is blatantly targeting the city if Toronto. It gives decision making powers about municipal affairs to the province. And there is no evidence it will reduce gridlock in our city.\nThe legislation specifically mentions 3 sections of bike lanes within the city of Toronto that will be replaced with car lanes if this legislation is approved. Bike lanes in other cities aren't mentioned, only vaguely mentioning that bike lane previously or planned to be installed will need to be approved by the provincial government where that bike lane replaced or will replace a car lane.\nTraffic infrastructure within each city should be the decision of municipal governments not the provincial government, unless that infrastructure connects multiple cities. The province has countless other responsibilities it should be focused on rather than add one more thing to their plate: healthcare worker retention and turnover,  lack of health care service availability, the backlog of medically necessary surguries, long wait times in emergency rooms and doctors offices, large classroom sizes, teacher retention, updating curriculums, gridlock on provincial highways. It just does not make sense to add more red tape requiring the attention of an already strapped provincial government for a decision that should be the sole discretion of municipal governments.\nThe provincial government has failed to produce any relevant data to support their claim that replacing bike lanes with car lanes will reduce gridlock. Evidence from around the world shows that installing more car lanes may improve vehicular congestion temporarily, but eventually leads to the same or worse conditions that before the installation of more car lanes as more people are incentivized to drive. The only logical way to reduce car traffic is by giving people options and incentive to travel by different modes. Modes that are more efficient at moving more people: trains, buses, light rail, bikes, walking. By getting people out of cars and into these other modes of transportation, there will be less cars on the road, reducing traffic and removing gridlock.\nI've lived in Toronto most of my life, but I have been fortunate enough to have travelled around the world. I have seen first hand how government investment in public and alternative modes of transportation positively impact the people who live in those places. Investment in alternative modes of transportation improves people's health by allowing them to use active modes of transportation. It saves lives by protecting those not in a large motorized vehicle from those large motorized vehicles. It allows people to see people in the place they live, not just cars whizzing by. It increasing business to smaller businesses by increasing foot traffic to their front door.\nWe should be building our cities for people, not for cars. And that means we should be providing people with a means to get around other than by car. This bill is focused only on cars and reduces access to infrastructure supporting an alternative mode of transportation. It is the direct opposite of what we need to reduce gridlock. It is a terrible plan and I absolutely do not support it.\n"

Time and again if has been proven that traffic congestion is not reduced by increasing car lanes.\nAlso this is an infringement of City and Municipality rights  by the province. These decisions should be made by the city in consultation with their residents and not unilaterally by Provincial government.\nIn other advantages bike lanes improves health of people biking since otherwise they will be sitting in traffic and have no time to workout. Overall reduces pollution of big cities.\nSo leave this to city / municipality and put these efforts into improving provincial Healthcare to stop privatization.\n"

        "comment": "The notion of ripping up bike lanes is frankly unbelievable. This city is still very unsafe for cyclists (being a city cyclist of over 35 years) and bike lanes are one of the few things that make it safer for cyclists. Cars are a luxury and you can't equate having to wait a few extra minutes being stuck in traffic with threatening individual lives. Already, cars abuse cycle lanes and don't share the road safely with cyclists. Removing cycle lanes will exacerbate this situation.\nIt is also not money well spent, in a city with so many other social issues requiring funding, from equitable and affordable housing, to jobs, education and community services. This is not a good use of much needed funds, for something that will adversely affect cyclists -  a large and growing sector of the population and threaten their safety and lives.\n"

These bike lanes are in  constant use by cyclists and not only do they greatly increase safety for those biking, they help reduce traffic in a city that is overwhelmed with vehicles.

        "comment": "As somebody who cycles for work and leisure and ALSO drives for work in both Toronto and Hamilton, I find this proposal to be very much missing the point of addressing congestion and a threat to the safety of some citizens. In my personal experience as a driver, it is a) the amount of cars on the road that is the problem, b) construction that causes more congestion than anything and c) the removal of bike lanes creates unsafe travel for cyclists. When there is a dedicated bike lane I dont have to worry about passing cyclists in my car. When I am on a road that doesn't have cycling infrastructure, cars slow down behind cyclists and it causes dangerous conditions for both parties involved.\nThe attached articles further suggest that bike lanes, in fact, assist in the flow of traffic while keeping those commuters safer as well.\nThis proposition is a waste of time and money that could be better spent on southern Ontario public transit/train lines, better city transit and more infrastructure to get cars off the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am incredibly unhappy about this plan.  Our city and province should be focusing on creating bike lanes to better connect our current network, not destroy them.  Yes, we need better ways to get people moving and congestion is an issue in the GTA.  However, all over the world studies CONSISTENTLY show that bike lanes ease congestion and have many other benefits such as improving health (through exercise and air quality improvements). Conversely - research also consistently shows that adding capacity to roads does not ease congestion but instead often invites more cars and makes congestion worse.\nThe argument that this will improve congestion just isn't based in fact.  Yes some people need to drive. However, we need to be focusing on providing alternate opportunities for people to move through the city that are not car based - this includes bikes lanes but more importantly a focus on transit.  Only through providing people with good alternatives to driving will behaviours change and people use these alternatives.  It won't happen overnight.  I'm happy that this government is creating the Ontario line - we need more of this kind of forward thinking and planning.  The taxpayer dollars that will be spent ripping up the bikes lanes should be allocated to transit improvements, not something that falsely promises to ease congestion but will ultimately invite more.  This is such short term, costly thinking.\nIf usage of Toronto's bike lanes is a concern/argument against their existence (they are used though - I see it all the time), consider this.  Is there the right network connecting them all so that people can safely traverse the city?  In some places there isn't, and looking to fix this problem would help improve usage and assist with easing congestion.  Also, looking at clearing them properly during the winter like Montreal does would improve winter usage and ease issues after winter storms\nLet's keep Toronto a world-class, forward thinking city by keeping the bikes lanes and focusing on diversity in our transportation network instead of only thinking of cars.\n"

I live near Keele and Bloor, and I use all of the listed bike lanes many more times a month than I use those roads when travelling by car.

We need to give people more options to get around not fewer. Not only is removing bike lanes a waste of taxpayers money, it will endanger my life and those of my family who need to bike to work/school/activities. We should also be encouraging people to bike as an important way to reduce carbon emissions. Lastly, the Province shouldn\u2019t meddle in decisions best made by municipalities.

        "comment": "I am in strong opposition to this act. I don't feel sufficient reason has been provided on how removing bike lanes can reduce grid lock. There has been lots of research proving that additional lanes do very little to improve traffic flow when there are many drivers. Toronto has grown immensely in the last 20-30 years and our roads clearly are not designed for this level of traffic. Adding an additional lane will likely do next to nothing to assist. If we do actually believe it might do something, I think it must be proven with some empirical data BEFORE making decisions to remove existing infrastructure. Additionally, have you considered the risk of INCREASING traffic due to citizens not being able to bike anymore? Biking in Toronto is very dangerous and without the safety of bike lanes, many citizens may switch to driving which could make traffic worse. I do not know if this will be the case, but has there been any work or analysis considering this?\nWhy would we waste money on removing something we just installed without sufficient evidence. I would much rather see money go into building something new to reduce grid lock. We need multiple solutions to reduce grid lock and removing the bike lanes just takes away one of our many solutions. Adding more lanes is NOT a solution because the city does not have the necessary space to add enough lanes that could actually accommodate our population.\n"
