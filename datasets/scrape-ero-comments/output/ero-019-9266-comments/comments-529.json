        "comment": "Bill 212 is shortsighted and goes against all science-based evidence:\n- Bike lanes are good for traffic. They reduce the amount of people on cars, and therefore are good for avoiding gridlock. The cities where it is best to drive are cities that have strong bike lane systems and strong public transport systems.\n- Bike lanes are key in achieving climate targets.\n- Increasing traffic lanes does NOT reduce congestion. One more lane will not fix congestion issues. This is perhaps the longest standing insight from transportation studies.\n- Bike lanes contribute to local economies and making streets more attractive.\n- Bike lanes are key for road safety for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Many people use the bike lanes to travel and shop at local businesses along Bloor Street. There are also many delivery cyclists that use the bike lanes for food delivery. Removing bike lanes on Bloor endangers the citizens of Toronto and will discourage people from shopping local and ordering local food. Returning the bike lanes to vehicular traffic would cause cyclists to need to travel with cars, slowing down traffic since cars will need to try and pass them. Taxpayers have already paid to have these bike lanes built. I do not want my tax dollars to go towards destroying them and having another round of construction on these roads. What would reduce gridlock is giving people more options to travel instead of being a single person in a car. Cars take up more space than they transport people. Subways and cycling are better for the environment and are a more efficient use of space.\n"

        "comment": "As an Uber driver that just so happens to live in the city, bike lanes are a necessity. Why should we adhere to the drivers that don\u2019t even live in the city? Why should they(Brampton, Richmond, Hill, Oakville, etc. drivers ) get the say of what happens here in the city.\n1. Bike lanes help me focus on driving with more attention on the road rather than focussing on if I\u2019m going to hit someone today. Proper safety for the cyclist is paramount as a driver. I don\u2019t want to hit them as much as they don\u2019t want to crash into me. I honestly feel much safer driving on Bloor that I do on Queen Street.\n2. How about improving public transit around the GTA. make the GO Train more accessible and more frequent. This will allow GTA drivers to finally realize how good they actually have it to not have to drive downtown. Majority of the drivers that I see driving downtown are ones not living downtown or even in the Burroughs of North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, etc., etc. Also, can the Eglington streetcar line finally finish? That is literally taking too long and will help the gridlock as soon as it\u2019s done. What is taking so long? Is it the workers that are delaying everything? Is the funding going elsewhere? is it possible to just put the money being spent on dismantling the bike lanes into incentivizing them to finally finish this?\n3. What a waste of public dollars if you were to take those bike lanes down after all the money spent putting them all up. How idiotic. The city will never have good things because of it.\n4. Hasn\u2019t it already been proven that bike lanes are actually much more efficient than car traffic? Main cities in Europe don\u2019t seem to have our problem.\nI had just come back from Europe about a month ago and I have to say Toronto traffic is an absolute mess compared to those cities who have integrated bike lanes and public transit to work in harmony. Toronto can never be great until this can be fixed. We know the city can be a lot better, which is why we are even angrier than usual.\nI honestly hope you guys favour the decision to keep the bike lanes. I would much prefer the city being safe for both the drivers and the cyclists. Drivers will talk about how they\u2019re late for things because of lane reductions and what not but I see that as a responsibility of themselves. They\u2019d much rather blame everything around them rather than themselves for their misfortune. Count how many single occupancy drivers there are in the city and check the back of their license plates and see which dealership they got their car from and you will notice that they are not from the city. If cities like London, Munich, Paris, Rome can be harmonious with drivers and cyclists, then I don\u2019t see a reason why Toronto can\u2019t be like that.\nThank you for reading this. Hopefully the resolution will be to favour the bike lane still being in the city and even more being created for the benefit of the downtown. As downtowners we\u2019ve already adjusted to the bike lanes. It\u2019s time for the drivers that live outside the city to adjust rather than complain.\n- Downtown Toronto Driver\n"

        "comment": "I live in the City of Hamilton, and I often feel as if I am being punished for needing to use my car. I cannot ride a bike to work (also, no one ever mentions how sweaty one can get riding to work. And then I have to be smelly and sweaty all day? No thank you). There are no efficient transit options between home and work and vice versa. I have no choice but to use my car. I also have a bi-weekly appointment where I need to get to the West End of the city. What used to take twenty minutes to go from east Hamilton to west, can take up to an hour. It is quicker from me to take the QEW to the 403 back to Hamilton to avoid all the traffic. It is frustrating that the city thinks it is a great idea to convert Main Street in Hamilton to two-way traffic, which will include bike lanes. There is already gridlock on this street every single day, and now you are going to take lanes out and make it two-way with bike lanes. This will be a disaster. If you want to be environmentally friendly, holding cars hostage in bumper to bumper traffic will actually contribute more pollution from idling vehicles.\nThis is also why the LRT is an absolutely terrible infrastructure project that will create more gridlock in the city because it is a train that serves one corridor. It is a train to nowhere and will only add to the traffic congestion on other streets as people try to avoid King St.\nI have no problems with bike lanes on routes that are parallel to major arteries. I am a road cyclist and it is true that I don't feel safe on the road, but I don't travel on the major streets. I follow all of the rules and regulations, I stop at every stop sign and every stop light, I follow in line when supposed to, but it is the cyclists who are arrogant and act entitled and above the rules that cause drivers to be angry and paint all cyclists with the same brush. So, yes bike lanes, but not on major arterial roads.\n"

        "comment": "I want to thank Mr. Ford for his common sense decision to eliminate bike lanes that reduce lanes of car traffic on our busy streets.  I would also argue that much less than 1% of people ride a bike to work on warm, dry days.  During our long Winter and bad weather, bike lanes sit virtually empty.  Rip them out and restore car lanes quickly.\nNow if we could only abolish streetcars in favour of buses that have the mobility to pick-up fares curbside instead of blocking all lanes of traffic.  Streetcars are expensive and maintaining tracks is never ending.  It just makes no sense.\nElectric buses do exist.\nThank you Doug Ford!!!\n"

        "comment": "I am speaking both as a driver and as a cyclist. I am strongly opposed to removing bike lanes from major roads. Studies have shown that they reduce collisions, save lives, and don't significantly impede the flow of traffic.\nMy husband was hit by a car on a road without a bike lane and I know of several other cyclists who have been hit, some suffering life altering injuries or dying as a result of the collision. As a driver, I have come close to hitting a cyclist on a couple of occasions, despite being careful and watching for them.\nSafer cycling on major thoroughfares will increase the number of people willing to ride bikes in cities and thus, reduce car traffic and ease congestion. Moving bike lanes onto back roads makes cycling less convenient and is not possible in some areas of cities due to landscape and infrastructure limiting places to cross (ravines, rivers, train tracks, etc.)\nIt is a waste of taxpayer money to remove bike lane infrastructure and reinstall bike lanes on other roads.\nThe city I live in has installed bike lanes in order to improve safety and reduce traffic congestion. I strongly urge you to withdraw Bill 212.\n"

When I'm biking, I plan my routes around streets that don't have bikes lanes on them, and I elect to use roads with bikes.\nI have only seen positive things stemming from these bike lanes, even other bike lanes that replace a previous lane of traffic. Any hint that car congestion would be remediated by putting a lane back is totally shortsighted and frankly wrong. Congestion existed before these bike lanes, and will exist after, if the root causes of congestion are not tackled.\nMillions of dollars have been spent, concrete poured, construction completed on these lanes, and the province wants to spend more and tear it all out? Does that sound like good governmental policy to you? Not to me.\nThat doesn't even bring in the fact that this bill is an extreme overreach of the provincial government into the territory of municipalities to dictate and control how a city or town wants to organize it's roadways. Premier Ford, the premier of the most populous province, and the 2nd largest by area, must spend his focus on 3 bikes lanes in one city of the province? That doesn't seem like good governmental policy to me.\nGiven these points, I am writing in strong opposition to Bill 212.\n"

This bill aims to save time, but it doesn't recognize that bikes take up much less space than cars and congestion would be improved only by removing cars from roads rather than  forcing more people to use cars. For myself, the removal of bike lanes would impact my commute to school since it is the most practical way of transport for me. It would make my commute much more dangerous to bike in the same lane as cars. I strongly disagree with the proposals in this bill.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea and is going to put cyclists in danger. We need MORE cycling infrastructure, not less. Allowing cyclists on the road reduces traffic. Cycling lanes are already thin, removing them will not have a significant impact on congestion. Cycling lanes protect cyclists AND drivers. Further, the actual solution to congestion is to invest in public transit. Adding another lane doesn't work, look at Los Angeles. I ride my bike to work every day, removing these cycling lanes will have a significant impact on my life and make my commute more dangerous. Cyclists are your constituents too. Removing existing infrastructure is a waste of money. INVEST in green solutions, don't take them away.\n"

        "comment": "In response to the Ontario government\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto and potentially mandate reviews of other existing bike lanes, I\u2019d like to raise a strong opposition, especially given my perspective as a cyclist, driver, and community member in Etobicoke.\nCycling infrastructure, such as the bike lanes on Bloor Street, plays an essential role in ensuring the safety of residents who rely on cycling for daily commutes. This stretch, including the critical area from Mill Road to Six Points, already lacks sufficient bike lane protections, creating dangerous conditions for cyclists. Removing bike lanes would exacerbate these safety risks, particularly for families and individuals who depend on these routes for school, work, and essential commuting.\nPrioritizing motor vehicle traffic over cycling infrastructure not only endangers lives but also undercuts the progress Toronto has made in building sustainable and safe commuting alternatives. Bike lanes contribute to lowering emissions, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting a more balanced, multimodal transportation network that can grow with Ontario\u2019s population. Eliminating these lanes, particularly without a full environmental assessment, disregards the environmental and social value they provide.\nCycling infrastructure should not only be preserved but also expanded and improved upon, especially in high-traffic areas with inadequate bike lanes, like parts of Bloor in Etobicoke. Rather than rolling back progress on active transportation, Ontario should invest in strengthening these networks, which benefit a broad range of community members while supporting environmental and health objectives.\nAdditionally, I urge the Ontario government to consider the value of creating a more interconnected cycling network between Toronto and neighboring municipalities, particularly Mississauga. Improved connectivity between Toronto and Mississauga would provide cyclists with safer, more accessible routes that support cross-city commuting, which is increasingly necessary for the area\u2019s growing population and workforce.\nAn integrated cycling network connecting Toronto and Mississauga would promote safer, sustainable transportation options for residents and foster a more inclusive, regional approach to urban mobility. Such a network not only aligns with provincial goals of reducing gridlock and supporting economic growth but also addresses the evolving needs of our communities for safe, environmentally friendly commuting alternatives.\n"
