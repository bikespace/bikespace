        "comment": "I do not think that your proposal to reduce the number of bike lanes in Ontario will improve the environment in this province. Bicycles have a much smaller environmental impact than cars, and we should encourage people to use them if we want to improve the environment.  Bike lanes are an important part of this, as is investment in public transit. This bill is a step in the wrong direction for Ontario's environment.\n"

It keeps me fit and energized. It is more quiet than cars and less of a hassle to park.\nI would like to get a bike lane along Gerrard Street East to ensure more safety in my travel downtown. I want more bike lanes in Toronto. Biking is the future for healthier Torontonians!\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is not evidence based and will not accomplish any of its stated goals. It is a ridiculous assertion that provincial interference will do anything to reduce traffic congestion to \u2018get you there faster\u2019.  Construction, lane closures, traffic infrastructure and investment and development of public transit are desperately needed, as is traffic enforcement and actual penalties for drivers who are constantly at fault.  This legislation is deeply cynical, stripping municipalities of their ability to govern cities.  What an incredible waste of time from a deeply unserious and incompetent provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is terrible for many reasons.\nFirst off, this is bad policy.  Bike lanes do not cause gridlock.  The real cause of gridlock is that there are more cars on the road.  This is because successive provincial governments - including the current one - have not created the conditions for densification that would provide people real alternatives to needing a car to get around. The current government is only making this worse by building more roads farther from urban centers AND at the same time not incentivizing - or even mandating - higher density construction across ALL municipalities; something that is clearly within provincial control and within the provincial mandate.  How are all those people who will be living up near the 413 going to get to work?  They are going to have to drive.  And that is what makes gridlock.\nSecondly, it is poor allocation of the provincial gvernment's resources. Why should the province be spending its time regulating bike lanes from Thunder Bay to Whitby?  This is ridiculous.  How long will it take to even get bike lanes that offend no drivers (if such a thing even exists) approved?  Controlling bike lanes is in the hands of cities for a reason.  Leave it there.\nThirdly, this decision is anti-democratic. The city of Toronto just had an election not too long ago for mayor, where one candidate was very anti-bike lane and promised to rip out bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge street.  Guess what?  He lost.  Just because some people are unhappy with that does not justify the province stepping in to override the collective will of the people in the city of Toronto (yet again).\nFor all of these reasons, I disagree with this proposed legislation.\nIf the government wants to truly impact gridlock, they should speed up the opening of the Eglinton West LRT and Eglinton West LRT extension, the Finch LRT, all-day 2-way Go service etc and other cycling projects, like the West Toronto Railpath extension that get people on bikes off of roads etc.  They should also stop parking expansion in crowded urban areas, such as the massive parking lot that is planned for Ontario Place.  Building parking down there just encourages people to drive, increasing traffic on the already busy Gardiner Expwy and Lakeshore Blvd.\n"

I live in Kitchener Waterloo where our city does a fantastic job with planning and has implemented a great bike lane system that has improved quality of life and ability to move around the city significantly. The provincial government hasn't shown ANY studies to support their claims when worldwide research in major metropolitan areas shoes bike lanes to reduce gridlock.\nI COULD NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL MORE.\nIt also over steps the provincial power. This is a municipal job for a reason as local city planners know the area and it's needs best. The province does not.\nPlease use data and research to support future bills and listen to your constituents. We do not want this bill. Do not pass it.\n"

        "comment": "This is not the way to reduce congestion and will LEAD to more cyclist interaction, lead to more deaths (we had 6 in Toronto this year) and is counter intuitive to the increase adoption year over year of micromobility vehicles (such e-bikes scooters, etc.). Let the city decide what makes sense.\nI live in downtown Toronto and at rush hour if I were to leave my condo and drive to the Gardiner Expressway onramp at Spadina it would take me about 1 hours to navigate the jammed city streets. The onramp is only 2 km away! If I travel my bike, it takes me about 15 minutes using bike lane routes and quieter back streets. The routes I take by car have no dedicated bike lanes and cannot be widen. They are filled with on street parking, construction, and people purposefully blocking the box (selfishly trying to get ahead of each other).\nRemoving bike lanes is not the answer and only results in more driver/cyclists interactions. Why do we need to considerate of people driving into the city when they should be using mass transit? Removing bike lanes impacts locals who use the road to commute and don't have access or need an expensive car. We should be focused on this community first and worry about those commuting in because there are alternative methods like transit!\nBike lanes such as bloor are important east/west arteries that connect neighborhoods at the top of the city. University before bike lanes was dangerous. I know, because I walked the route for 15 years to get to my job in the financial district. You would have folks rip to up University in their Porsches, Mercedes, Audis, etc. as soon as work was done. As a biker I would never use University because it was scary and felt unsafe.\nPlease reconsider this bill and the power it brings. Leave it to the local mayor and their administration to decide.\n"

        "comment": "If the existing bike lanes are removed from Toronto's busy streets, I'm concerned that the food delivery bikers from India will start riding on the sidewalks where they will get in the way of pedestrians, and they might even hit some pedestrians with their bikes and e-scooters. A lot of them already ride on the sidewalks and nothing is done about it but I think that even more would do it if there were no bike lanes. I don't want to get hit by one of these bikers from India & I really don't want my elderly mother to be hit by one of them when we go out for a walk.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Minister,\nI regularly drive, ride public transit, cycle, and walk on Ontario's roads and highways. I also hold an MASc in Civil Engineering, meaning I understand the factors that affect traffic speed, quality of life, economic growth, and safety on our roads. Based on my experience and credentials I strongly disagree with the framework proposed in Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time.\nI would also like to express my disapproval of the Bill's proposal to allow the Highway 413 project to skip environmental assessments. Not only does the Bill not provide any evidence for why such a change to process should be necessary, the highway has not been shown to be a valid use of taxpayer dollars, given the questionable improvements in travel times for a small group of drivers, and the economic downsides of encouraging sprawl rather than density.\nThe present Bill ignores decades of traffic engineering evidence which states that a mix of density, good public transit, and active transportation help people (and cars) move smoothly, and stimulate economic growth. Adding the provincial review process proposed in this Bill will only stymie the progress that so many municipalities have made based on this evidence. This legislation is also quite at odds with this government's supposed focus on 'Red Tape Reduction'. I urge you to approach any traffic legislation from a place of evidence.\nThank you for consideration.\n"

I am supremely disappointed that our government is ignoring reality and allowing vested interests of the construction and automobile industry to guide their decision making.\nWe do not want more highways, more cars, more traffic and less bikes. We want MORE public transportation, MORE light rails, FASTER and CHEAPER trains, MORE bike lanes, and a SUV tax to reduce the size of cars.\nThe solutions above are what will actually reduce congestion. Please take a look at leading cities in the world like Amsterdam, Copenhagen and London. They are doing things right. Please build safe, clean and pleasant cities for us and our children. We do not need more highways that will destroy the environment.\n"

Stuff after study has found that an increase in lanes does nothing but INCREASE congestion and limiting bike lanes will put cyclists in very real danger.

        "comment": "This legislation is a major overreach by the provincial government into municipal affairs.  It is unacceptable that the province would interfere and prevent any small municipality from designing and implementing infrastructure that meets the needs and wants of local residents.  It is absurd that local government officials would need to seek the personal approval of the Minister to implement minor infrastructure in a small town that the Minister has never even visited.  The provincial government needs to respect the authority of local municipalities.\nThis legislation doesn\u2019t respect data that proves bike lanes are an effective means of reducing traffic congestion.  It prevents residents of towns and cities from being able to make transportation choices for themselves that suit their individual needs.  Municipalities have an obligation to build infrastructure that enables choice and option; this legislation precludes that benefit and is contrary to the needs of residents who want to make suitable choices for themselves.\nThe Premier himself no longer sits in the City Council of Toronto.  If he wants to meddle with local affairs of that city, he should resign and stand for election locally.  It is unethical and embarrassing that the provincial government would impose sweeping legislation that negatively impacts every small town in this province because the Premier doesn\u2019t personally like bike lanes on Bloor St.  Stop interfering in local business!\n"
