        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and the proposed framework to dismantle existing bike lanes and restrict the creation of new ones without provincial approval. This bill undermines municipal autonomy, directly threatens cyclist safety, and prioritizes car traffic over sustainable transportation options.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure for safer, greener, and more sustainable cities. Removing them prioritizes car traffic at the expense of cyclists, pedestrians, and public transit users, undermining efforts to reduce congestion and combat climate change.  Bike lanes are critical for reducing accidents and fatalities, as demonstrated by Toronto's sharp increase in cyclist deaths this year. Research consistently shows that separated cycling infrastructure significantly lowers the risk of injuries and fatalities\u200b\n"

        "comment": "Safety needs to be first of mind and drivers, cyclists and pedestrians each need their lanes!\nYet our provincial government has purposed Bill 212 to remove bike lanes in the province and specifically in Toronto. Disrupting the long-term City planning to provide over the years a cycling network for residents who ride e-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles does not consider the safety of cyclists and as well pedestrians.\nE-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles are here to stay! In the suburbs of Toronto e-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles are necessities. They are a means of transportation for many who cannot afford a car, choose not to own a car for various reasons (perhaps environmental), depend on them for business, want the exercise, cycle instead of waiting for Scarborough intermittent public transit, have no car parking in their condominium or choose a bike over a car because there are few parking spaces in Toronto.\nThe focus to expand housing in the Golden Horseshoe has meant parking spaces at subway stations are becoming high rise housing. Car parking spaces are gone. The result is e-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles are used to reach the subway \u2013 TTC buses are slow and timing between rides is long.\nThe expansion of new high-rise condominiums, midrise, four-plex, multi-plex, etc. with fewer car parking spaces than bicycle parking - forces many to use an e-bike, e-scooter or bicycle for transportation. Car parking is disappearing! Bike parking is increasing!\nOntario is on a \"collision course\" between increasing housing with few car parking spaces, expanding bicycle parking yet neglecting to provide the infrastructure for ALL to be safe - drivers, cyclists and pedestrians!\n"

        "comment": "I'm both a driver and a cyclist in Ottawa, and I can definitely say that I disagree with the premise of this bill. Yes, traffic congestion is awful, but removing bike lanes will not fix traffic congestion. Ontario needs to get cars off the road, and getting more people out of cars and on to other modes of transit like cycling or public transit is a much more effective method of then ripping up bike lanes and replacing them with more car lanes. It does not need to add more red tape to these projects for municipalities\nIf you remove bike lanes, you force people like me into cars, and this will just worsen traffic congestion. The tax dollars used to rip up bike lanes would better be spent on improving cycling and public transit, and it's incredibly frustrating to see the government trying to adopt a regressive, fiscally irresponsible policy towards transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong support for expanding safe cycling infrastructure across Ontario, as well as my concerns about the additional red tape and bureaucracy that may delay these essential projects.\nBike lanes should be considered as essential as sidewalks\u2014they provide safe, accessible options for vulnerable road users, including cyclists and pedestrians, rather than focusing solely on maximizing car traffic. Bike lanes are a critical part of our transportation network. I use bike lanes daily and view them as essential infrastructure, especially for safely accessing transit stations. They offer a practical and reliable way to get around without the hassle of parking, allowing me to support more local businesses along my route.\nAdditionally, as a driver, I prefer to see cyclists safely in bike lanes rather than on busy roads, where it\u2019s challenging and risky for everyone. Providing protected bike lanes ensures safer streets for cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians alike.\nI urge you to respect local authority and not proceed with Bill 212, which would limit cities' ability to make decisions best suited to their unique needs and communities. Cities understand the needs of their residents and are in the best position to design infrastructure that ensures safe, accessible streets for everyone. Streamlining the approval process for cycling infrastructure, without restrictive legislation, is crucial to making our cities safer and more vibrant.\nThank you for considering this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes on city streets are something that cities should be responsible to look after and should not be controlled or restricted at a higher levels of government. Bike lanes and proper infrastructure for bikes and pedestrians along city streets along with traffic calming is what makes cities great and enjoyable placed to live.\nThe bills proposal to remove bike lanes in the favour of adding car traffic is exactly the opposite of how to alleviate congestion and will only create a induced demand for more individuals to choose to travel by car, as opposed to choosing other forms of transportation. These other forms of transportation include cycling, taking the bus, subway, tram, walking, and any other personal mobility devices.\nStreets are meant for the people that live (and work) along them, they are meant to be destination points with large sidewalks, plazas, space for cyclists and bike lanes, with some efficient planning of street parking and dedicated store delivery zones. Streets are inviting places with plenty of space for pedestrians of all ages (pedestrians that are either on foot or on a bicycle), streets are meant to be traffic calmed and have low volumes of car traffic. Streets are a place where you go for a stroll, can do some shopping, or finish some errands. Streets are places for the local community and at the same time build the local community. Streets are a safe place for every one that uses them.\nRoads are meant as a way to get you from point A to point B as quick as possible. Roads are high speed routes with no driveways, and no road parking (its called street parking for a reason). Roads don't care about the community they cut through. Roads are not destination points and generally do not have businesses along them. Roads also are dangerous places when not inside a car (because of the high speed). Example of a few Roads in Toronto include Allan Rd, a few sections of Black Creek Dr, Bayview Ave along the Don River, a very small section of  Mt Pleasant Rd just north of Bloor Street.\nThe intention of removing bike lanes and great pedestrian infrastructure along city roadways like Yonge Street and Bloor Street and turning these Streets in Roads, like the few Roads i listed above, is detrimentally to the local community and the city as a whole.  These streets in Toronto have become great destination points and have become something that we as a city should be proud of at a global scale. These Streets are places that attract both tourists and Canadians alike. Places like Bloor street and Yonge Street are areas families now consider to live along because they provide a safe and inviting location.\nThe city need safer streets with proper infrastructure planning for further traffic calming, while promoting other forms of transportation rather then relying on the car. The addition of bicycle lanes is a step in the right direction to tackle many of challenges the city is facing, making more vibrant communities along our streets will hopefully persuade more suburban residents with their children to move back into the city centre, and not choose to commute by car into the downtown core.\nI would also like to add as a final thought, the government should make any decisions about the removal of any bike lanes with data driven approach. Safety of the most vulnerable users of a city street (pedestrians and cyclists of all ages) should always take priority over any vehicle traffic wanting to shave a few seconds or minutes off their commute time.\n"

        "comment": "Please leave the bike lanes alone in The City of Toronto. This is a  municipal matter that has been studied and voted on for the good of the residents of the city, not just a few business owners.\nRoads after all are for people, and not cars exclusively. Those that commute to work/school/other are not doing so solely via a private car. Many take other modes of transport including bicycles.\nBike lanes, and by extension bicycles using those designated lanes do not cause gridlock for car traffic - cars cause that traffic. You want another lane for cars? Remove on-street parking. But, as any reasonable person understands, \"one more lane\" for cars never works to alleviate the problem of gridlock.\nMore troublesome, is what this bill is trying to sneak in amidst the outrage and over-reporting of the Bike lane distraction. How about one bill per-item?\nAlso, maybe you wouldn't be in such a rush to ram this bill through if you didn't take such a long break over the summer.\n"

Reducing bike lanes in our city will directly impact the safety and wellbeing of many of Torontonians, including myself, my husband, and our friends. The city has the right (and responsibility) to provide all kinds of modes of transit to its citizens; our safety shouldn't be traded for a nominal reduction in travel time for cars. The removal of bike lanes is not grounded in any reasonable research; it's regressive; and it's a waste of money. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "Just when cycling got safer in Toronto, the province jumped out of their lane to send us back to more cycling accidents and deaths. We waited years for a bike lane on Bloor. It took so long to build it and now you want to take it away? I use it every day. I am 65 years old. I ride to save money and not have to take up road space with a car, and now you want to punish me and other riders for gridlock? It's only going to get worse if people like me can't ride safely anymore, and go back to driving. Consider the emissions increase, the parking problems - in fact, the more people who choose cycling the easier it will be for the remaining drivers to get around. I understand that reducing a lane seems to slow down a driver's commute, but as cycling gets safer, more people will leave the car at home or not bother if they don't need it. After all it is expensive, and right now people are looking for ways to save money what with the cost of housing and food going up and up. I spent almost $5,000 on a beautiful e-assist bike, with the safest battery you can buy, CSA approved Bosch. I can get to work in less time than if I drove, and even less than taking public transit, and parking is no issue. If the bike lanes are removed I will feel very disappointed with the City for allowing the Province to overstep its authority, and very angry at the Province for making me less safe on the road, when it should be a City decision. And it was - after years of consultation and advocacy, and the City paid. Even if the Province paid to take them out, it would not be fair. Whenever I have to drive, I know I will need to be very cautious making a turn, with the bike lanes. I need to stop for the streetcar doors. These are part of the driver's responsibilities, because public transit and bicycles are more efficient for the single commuter, better for the environment and cheaper. Ford said that only 1% of commuters use a bicycle, but that's just not true. The real numbers seem to be anywhere up to 10%, and would increase as people get used to the bike lanes that have just recently been completed, and how much safer they feel riding. Can you imagine all the delivery bikes, scooters and cyclists in the car lanes? That would spell disaster and wouldn't make commuting by car any quicker. At least with a separated bike lane, even if it costs an extra few minutes for the driver, they will have less stress not having to worry about hitting cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "There is no world in which we can build enough lanes on our streets and highways to keep pace. Increasing lanes does not increase throughput, due to the limiting factor currently being intersections, not the number of lanes. In addition, there are many negative effects this bill will likely have (increased cyclist deaths, extra costs for removing existing infrastructure, etc.) while the bill will ultimately fail at solving the one problem it is trying to solve.\nIf the conservative government under Doug Ford is actually attempting to solve the problem, they would invest in more robust public transit and bike infrastructure. Unfortunately, it seems like this bill is not meant to reduce gridlock or to save time for the people of Ontario. Instead, it seems to be a desperate grab to get around environmental regulations and ultimately, screw over people who are too poor to own a car. This has been made abundantly clear by the fact that the conservative government under Doug Ford cut the number of public hearings from three days to one, as well as the house debate time from a minimum of 6 hours to one hour (leading to having only 5% of the usual hearing and debate time). This is transparent corruption that the conservative party under Doug Ford believes that they can get away with, because they believe Canadians are too stupid to notice.\n"

Separated bike lanes prevent injuries and deaths to cyclists from collisions with automobiles, thus saving the government thousands if not millions of dollars in health care and rehabilitation expenses for those injured.  (Note: data from ICES shows over 30,000 emergency room visits for cyclist injuries 2016-2021 alone).\n2. Cycling is a healthy mode of transport, whereas cars are a sedentary mode of transport. Promoting car travel encourages a sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and many other conditions. The government should be promoting, not discouraging, active modes of transport such as cycling. Down the road, this will save the government millions of dollars in expenses for the many conditions caused by a sedentary lifestyle.\nPlease reconsider this decision, for the sake of both Ontarians\u2019 heath and the financial health of the province.\n"
