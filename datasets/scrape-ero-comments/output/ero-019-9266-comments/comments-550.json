        "comment": "This current proposal prioritizes drivers and individual automobiles commuters over the many other transit options in the city. Toronto and the GTA is already car-centric in many ways: the perpetual underfunding of public transit options such as the TTC, the scarcity of bike lanes, and city infrastructure that focuses on parking lots and highways. There is already an abundance of literature, data, and research that concludes clearly that the addition of more roads and highways does not help overall in depleting congestion as demand for cars and driving rises proportionately. There is a deep hostility against cyclists currently by drivers and personally, many of my friends and colleagues have been harmed by drivers who are not mindful of other people on the road who are not also in cars. I have friends, who as pedestrians have been struck by cars, and at best are shaken and traumatized, or  worst, sent to ICU in the hospital or even worst, have died from impact. Many of my peers are afraid of biking around the city, knowing exactly how dangerous it is and the risks that car drivers pose. More safe bike lanes, however, could mean less drivers as they can pivot to cycling instead. That, in fact, would be more helpful in decongesting traffic.\nThis new proposal continues to ignore the need for diverse means of travelling in the city. Not everyone can afford a car, and by privileging cars and drivers as the most important form of commuting is to ignore those with less income, less choices, and contribute in making vulnerable communities more marginalized by reducing options for reliable and affordable transit. For the record, I don't even ride a bike: but I can recognize how absolutely vital it is to ensure an equitable city with folks who are dependent on other modes of transport to get around to their jobs, see their families, etc. It escapes me as to why the Provincial government is overreaching in regards to Municipal affairs. It's clear that this proposal will increase opacity and bureaucratic red tape in implementing much needed bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling lanes are extremely important for the city of Toronto. Without them, you can't safely travel through the city with your bicycle.\nIf you remove lanes, you will have less people that will choose the cycling option to transit, thus resulting in more cars being used, which in terms increases the congestion in the city.\nDensely populated cities don't scale up by enable more car transit options, but by facilitating healthier and faster modes of transportation like subways and cycling.\nYou need to think in terms of physics. Consider Toronto to be a pipe of a given fixed diameter (total of roads/lanes), within this diameter you want to be able to fit the most amount of people to have the most optimized flow (transit speed). A single person in a car takes the space of 2-3 bikers/walkers. For cars to be a scalable solution, they would need to be shared between people. You would need constantly 2 to 3 people per car at any given time, for it to be as efficient space wise as bikers or walkers. This is equivalent to using subways or trams. Subways being even more efficient since they only take underground space that is unused.\nThe idea in this act is to remove a bike line to replace it with a car lane, thinking that this will widen the diameter of the pipe. But in reality, it doesn't because you are simply replacing bicyclers with drivers 1 to 1 since most cars are individually used.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my firm opposition to Bill 212, as well as my disappointment with the many (seemingly deliberately) misleading justifications for this bill made by the Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Singh Sarkaria and Premier Doug Ford.\nMy opposition is based on several key concerns.\nFirstly, there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that bike lanes are a leading cause of congestion in Toronto. Instead, congestion is fundamentally caused by traffic volumes that are over the capacity of the road infrastructure. As we see in Toronto, congestion is rife on roads with no bike lanes. Indeed, the broader bill points to congestion on 400-series highways, which are not related to bike lanes.\nMoreover, Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Singh Sarkaria and Premier Doug Ford consistently use misleading figures to justify the bill, and in doing so, neglect the importance and high-use of the bike lanes they are explicitly targeting in the city. They both routinely repeat a figure that only 1.2% of people bike. They never indicate where they get this figure and whether they are referring to all of Ontario or in Toronto. It seems most likely this is an outdated figure for the entire CMA around Toronto. This figure is not relevant if they are openly advocating removing bike lanes in Toronto, as 2021 Census figures as well as studies by the City of Toronto show that the bike lanes they explicitly mention are well-used. For example, during rush hour, cyclists make up 37% of road users on Bloor in the Annex, and 10% of residents along the University Ave bike lane commute to work by bike.\nBy removing existing bike lanes, the government is not only putting cyclists at risk but also halting the progress we have made in building a safe and accessible cycling network in our city. Studies have shown that bicycle infrastructure can improve overall traffic conditions by providing alternative modes of transportation, as well as improve public health, and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Removing bike lanes would be a counterproductive step backwards and would be indicative of inept transportation policy.\nFurthermore, the language used by the transportation minister and premier is not only dismissive but also fosters an atmosphere of animosity towards cyclists\u2014a demographic that contributes positively to our transportation ecosystem. This dismissive attitude is unacceptable, especially when our streets are already overly hostile and dangerous for those who choose to bike for transportation.\nFinally, as a procedural matter, this bill also represents a serious overstep of provincial authority over municipal affairs. Cities should have the right to determine what transportation policies are best for their citizens, especially when it is years of planning ineptitude at the provincial level that has led to the unsustainable and dysfunctional transportation situation across the Greater Toronto Area. Over half of cars on Toronto streets originate outside the city; a situation caused by outdated urban planning contributing to sprawl and the dismal investment in regional transit. Toronto residents are already suffering with their streets over capacity with cars as a result of the province's failures, and this bill would only exacerbate this issue.\nIn light of these points, I urge you to reconsider this bill and eliminate the sections concerning the removal of bike lanes. Any competent, evidence-based, and forward-looking transportation policy would, instead of increasing the already excessive number of car trips in the GTA, direct massive amounts of funding in transit, push for better urban planning, especially density, and support the growth of active transportation, including the development of robust cycling networks in Toronto.\nThank you for considering my concerns.\n"

        "comment": "I recently drove Bloor along the entire length from Parkside to Kipling on a weekday morning. The delays I encountered were due to pedestrians not obeying signals and lane closures due to construction. Bloor is largely a 40 km/h zone and the bike lanes prevent vehicles from driving so fast in a neighbourhood with so many pedestrians. As soon as the road widened to 3 lanes, all cars stepped on the gas and sped off even though the speed limit was still 40.  At this speed car/pedestrian or car/cyclist collisions are almost always fatal. With so many pedestrians not paying full attention to their environment, the wider roads are significantly more dangerous for them.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a resident of Hamilton, Ontario. A city that was transformed for the benefit of cars over many decades before I even moved here. I literally moved houses because the traffic on the street I lived on was so bad that a car flipped over the sidewalk and landed in my neighbour's yard. I have young kids. Not a year later and a prominent Canadian radio personality was killed walking in the same area. Not to mention the many other deaths and injuries to people here caused by traffic congestion.\nAny equation that aims to reduce congestion needs to take measures to reduce the number of cars on the road. There is no arithmetic that balances out where adding more lanes or making it more convenient for car drivers will reduce congestion. The problem is the number of cars on the road.\nThe only measures we should be considering are ones that provide people with transportation needs the means to satisfy those needs with options that don't involve cars. With fewer cars on the road there is less congestion. Less congestion means fewer fatalities, injuries, noise, and pollution.\nCities know this. The people who live in those cities know what needs to be done to reduce traffic. The municipalities elect leaders to affect change in their communities. That change should not be beholden to the Province.\nIf the Province intends to aid the reduction of congestion on roads they should be aiding municipalities to implement the solutions and policies that work for them.\nThis Bill gets in the way of effective solutions.\n"

Removing bike lanes along Toronto\u2019s busiest roads will not help with reducing gridlock. If anything it will put more cars on the road which will simply add to it. It will also make it more unsafe for cyclists who will still use those roads but without an added form of protection. On top of that, you\u2019d like to make municipalities ask permission before they put in bike lanes themselves. This stops them from taking the initiative in going more green and adds more bureaucracy and red tape over something that should be promoted by good and smart government.\n"

This bill doesn\u2019t just affect bike lanes\u2014it also limits local governments' ability to make critical decisions about urban planning, transit, and road safety measures, which are essential for the unique needs of each community.\nI\u2019m sure my voice doesn\u2019t carry much weight as a cyclist, and regardless of what happens to the bike lanes, I won\u2019t be voting for Doug Ford.

These are people who drive for work in the trades and aren\u2019t fond of cyclists, wanting them in their own dedicated lanes. Before bike lanes, they had to deal with cyclists swerving in and out of their lanes, creating chaos on the road. It was a frustrating experience for everyone.

On top of that, think about the added cost and construction it will take to dismantle the current infrastructure. That money could go to affordable housing, health care or education.

        "comment": "I am writing to request the reconsideration of Bill 212. My concerns relate to the provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure (i.e., bike lanes). There are five areas of benefit that bike lanes provide: improved safety for all road users (1) (including decreased dooring collisions, sideswipe, and rear end collisions) (2), increased economic outcomes for local businesses (3) and governments (4), reduced greenhouse gas emissions (5), decreased access gap for equity-seeking populations (6), and improved physical and mental health (7).  I will now focus on the health, equity, and safety implications of providing protected bike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is a key factor in reducing numerous chronic health conditions and improving individuals\u2019 mental wellbeing (8,9). Physical activity, such as through active transportation \u2013 walking, cycling, or other active modes of travel \u2013 is an effective way to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines that show increases to health, well-being, and fitness. Specifically, bike lanes can increase the total distance traveled by cyclists and the overall ridership of residents (10).  By replacing some car trips with cycling, research indicates that people can gain an additional nine life-years (11).  Moreover, by not incorporating physical activity into Canadians\u2019 lifestyles, the healthcare system is estimated to spend $6.8 billion per year due to the impact physical inactivity has on chronic diseases (7).\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately impacts equity-deserving populations such as racialized persons, people living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and Indigenous peoples. For example, lower income neighbourhoods have historically been poorly designed with increased safety and health risks. However, when active transportation is included into the neighbourhood design (i.e., sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit, roadways) social and health inequities are reduced (6). Given transportation options, individuals can select the affordable and safe travel mode to participate in the workforce, access grocery stores, recreational facilities, and healthcare services (12). This research is not unique as researchers and governments globally have identified that high-quality multi-modal infrastructure increases the use of active transportation, and its\u2019 associated social and health benefits (13,14,15,16).  Additionally, when individuals have affordable transportation options, they have more money to spend on necessities such as food and rent, or extras such as goods from local business (7).\nThird, safety of all roadway users increases with the installation of bike lanes. As outlined by the Canadian Paediatric Society (17), cycling infrastructure that is well-connected (\u2018cycle tracks\u2019) has a halo effect where collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists decreased in a 500m surrounding area. Additionally, protected bike lanes are the safest option for all roadway users compared to painted lines, protected right of ways, and elevated lanes (18).\nHigh-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more people walking and cycling. Active travel has many proven physical and mental health benefits and impacts chronic disease prevalence. These investments need to be distributed equitably so that every community member can enjoy the benefits of active transportation.\n(1) Ministry of Transportation Ontario. (2022).

Why don't we undo the cuts to education that were made, rather than undo these bike lanes? Why not put our money into our health care system, which is so overwhelmed?

        "comment": "While Bill 212 tackles gridlock, which is an important issue to tackle, removing & making it harder to implement bike lanes is not the way to go about it as bike lanes have a lot of important benefits & often aren't the cause of gridlock. While gridlock is an important thing to consider as it causes a reduction in people's free time, increase of pollution, & general frustration, it is important to note that cycle tracks don't cause much traffic. In a simulation study done by Nanayakkara et al. (2022) it was shown that the inclusion of a cycle track only caused an increase of 7% in travel time (a simulation allows us to remove any factors affecting traffic which aren't just the inclusion of cycle tracks). Gridlock is more likely based upon a growing population (both within the city and suburbs) and little to no expansion of transit options within the past 20 years.\nBike lanes also have a lot of benefits which include economic, health, & equity within our communities. Separated cycle tracks, like the ones which are looking to be removed, drop cyclist-motorist collisions by nearly 20% in Toronto & it should be noted that this effect is only seen with separated cycle lanes and not painted bicycle lanes (Bhatia et al., 2016). The inclusion of separated cycle tracks also helps intersections, the places where most accidents occur, to become safer for all road users (not just cyclists) (Marshall & Ferenchak, 2019). By removing cycle lanes, we may be decreasing the health (e.g. physical activity & pollution) of everybody within our communities. In another meta-analysis done by Pan et al. (2021), it was shown that bike lane accessibility was very positively correlated with physical activity among children & adolescents. This isn't just among children, there are also widespread affects across many health aspects for all age groups (Oja et al., 2011). Another study showed that when you implement cycle lanes vs cycling in the road, it reduces the amount of pollution that cyclists experience by 22% (Schmitz et al., 2021). Also increasing cycling within cities helps to reduce emissions, which helps to fight climate change, which our legislation should be encouraging & not discouraging (Brand et al., 2021). Bike lanes encourage economic activity within communities, based on the findings of a study done in Toronto on Bloor St., which is one of the bike lanes slated to be taken out (Aranciba et al., 2019). In a study done on Toronto, Faghih Imani et al. (2019) show that to increase cycling numbers, we need low-stress cycling options, which are most facilitated by the upgrading of bike lanes into cycle tracks or the decrease of motor vehicle traffic speeds. It is important to note that cycling access is also a gendered issue and if we pass bill 212, Women & other gendered minorities will be most affected by it. In a meta-analysis of cycling information, it was shown that the greatest barriers to women's cycling are the dangers of cars (Nixon & DeLuca, 2012), which can all be mitigated by low-stress cycling options such as separated cycle tracks. By removing & making it harder to implement cycling lanes, we will be decreasing the equity of our transportation options.\nDue to bike lanes likely not being the cause of traffic within our cities, we should not be deprioritizing cycling as a transit option by removing them. Bike lanes have a plethora of benefits (not all were listed in this comment as an effort to not make it more longwinded than it already is) & should not be ripped out & made harder to implement. We would be doing our cities & communities a disservice by doing so.\n(I recognize that many of these links aren't publicly available & require a paywall to view so please contact me for more information if you cannot view them.)\n"
