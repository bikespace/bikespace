        "comment": "Bike lane infrastructure is crucial for our province. I am against removing bike lanes. Bike lanes will not reduce gridlock because cyclists will have to take more space on the road for personal safety. Removing bike lanes also works against the province's goal of increasing housing by making it so more people have to drive a car. This increases the demand for parking within housing properties and increases the cost of development. I am both a cyclist and a driver. I am against the issue of bike lanes being portrayed as a bike vs car issue. This is an issue of safety, the environment, and the financial costs of removing already installed infrastructure. The decision needs to be data-driven and the data need to be objective not cherry-picked.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI would like to voice my thoughts on bill 212, and why I think it is a bad idea, reversing progress made over the last decade.\n1. The provincial government shouldn\u2019t be adding red tape to local governments trying to improve transportation inside their community.\n2. Many of my friends use bike lanes daily. I consider them to be essential for daily life, much like sidewalks and roads\n3. Safety of cyclists is important, and we can help by adding visual, and physical barricades to ensure cyclist safety.\n4. Students. Highschool, college, and middle school students as well as seniors, often commute by bicycle due to the lower cost opposed to driving. By reducing bike lanes, we are directly putting these groups at risk unnecessarily.\n5. As a driver, I would much rather cyclists be in designated areas so they don\u2019t have to be navigated around the road way. Without bike lanes, cyclist will inevitably end up using roads, and sidewalks (which should be legal when bike lanes are absent), this creates danger for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n6. By having bike lanes connect to transit stations, we can reduce the number of cars on the road. This would reduce gridlock more effectively than adding more lanes.\nIn conclusion, I think bike infrastructure is absolutely essential to any urban landscape to diversify commute options for the community.\n"

        "comment": "First of all, as someone that uses cycling as one of their primary modes of transportation, and has lived on Bloor street for a considerable amount of time, it is quite clear to me that the bike lanes are very well used, and move a lot more people than another lane of backed up traffic ever would.\nIf you are sitting in this government and you earnestly think that this bill makes any sense whatsoever, please give your head a shake. Go stand on College, Bloor, or University at rush hour and count the number of cyclists you see. You know the way that streets are laid out in toronto. There are no practical side streets these people can take and get to their destination in a reasonable amount of time. You would be forcing these people into an already overstressed and inadequate public transit system, or more likely, back into their cars. You will be doing nothing but worsening gridlock, and wasting the time and money of the people of Ontario.\nAnd if you think that this reasoning does not apply to other cities, that may be true. That is why this is a MUNICIPAL issue, in which the provincial government has absolutely no right whatsoever to interfere.\nWe all know that the real purpose of this bill is to distract the constituency from the fact that the provincial government has failed to deliver on fixing housing and affordability in the provice, while actively reducing the quality of our public healthcare. We all know that this isn't about bike lanes, it's about getting everyone angry. Well, guess what? It worked. I'm angry. I'm angry that this government has continued to fail to deliver on fixing the real issues that are affecting this province, and they are wasting time and energy on an obvious straw man to distract from this fact.\nI am from Alberta, so believe me when I say that i'm no stranger to obvious pandering, and this fits the bill 100%. Populism does nothing but serve short term political gains.\nIf this provincal government truly cares about improving the lives of the people of Ontario, they should throw this bill out and focus on solving real problems, rather than winning a few cheap votes before an election cycle.\nI am thorougly dissapointed and disgusted that this bill was ever considered in earnest. You have profoundly damaged my trust that this government is acting in my best interest.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is such a backwards look at how a modern society should be progressing. There is so much published evidence counter to this idea that has been ignored by the Premier. Providing safe alternatives to driving and on routes frequented by cyclists is the way forward. Look at Paris, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Montreal. Surprise, many of these are \u201cwinter\u201d cities. Simply because a bike lane may, or likely may not, impact the Premier\u2019s commute is not the way to make choices about infrastructure. It is not even in the Province\u2019s best interest to meddle in municipal matters to the point of forbidding cyclists safe passage and a right not to die.\nI urge the government and MPPs to quash this bill before it even comes to a vote, and if it must come to a vote, vote with your children and grandchildren in line as they try to navigate these streets where safe cycling infrastructure will be prevented or even removed because of one Man\u2019s opinion on his commute in a large SUV.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a cyclist and a driver in Toronto.\nRemoving bike lanes will make congestion worse. Cyclists are going to remain and they will just take up a lane of traffic instead. There will be more cyclist deaths and injuries and drivers will go even slower because there will be bikes sharing the lanes with them all of the time. On a place like Bloor street, there will not be room for drivers to overtake, so the safest way for cyclists to travel is to take an entire lane of the road. I have a feeling you all know this, it's just political pandering - it's obvious. When I am driving, I want cyclists as far away from me as possible...some of them, let's be frank are not very good at cycling. I do not want to be responsible for a death or injury, so having them on bike lanes is by far better for me as a driver.\nWe all know Doug Ford only dislikes that one lane in Etobicoke which he thinks inconveniences him personally, why try and close bike lanes across the city rather than just the one he personally dislikes? A very see-through attempt to cover his tracks. Of course his personal dislikes are not supposed to affect his governance - he is suppose to represent the people of Ontario. After several years of him in power, I await him taking this responsibility seriously.\nThe congestion will remain after bike lanes are removed and may get worse, who will you blame next?\n"

        "comment": "Every Ontarian deserves infrastructure that supports both SAFE and EFFICIENT travel within their municipal communities, regardless if they are driving a motor/electric vehicle, using public transportation, riding a bicycle, utilizing mobility devices, or are a pedestrian. Every Ontarian deserves to have the FREEDOM TO CHOOSE what mode of transportation is best suited for their needs, values, circumstances, and/or preferences. Everyone should be respected and have their safety be given due consideration. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists to ride either on the sidewalk, which is illegal and endangers pedestrians, or into road traffic endangering the cyclist and contributes directly to any existing congestion.\nThe Premier himself has previously admitted to feeling safer while cycling in a lane dedicated to bikes; 'We have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.' Should priority be given to drivers saving a few minutes on their commutes, or to saving lives?\nLastly, municipalities should be entrusted to make decisions that best support their communities regarding bike lanes.\n"

This is beyond ludicrous.\nBoth of these proposals do nothing to reduce environmental harm.\nThe highway proposal will only add to sprawl and does nothing to support this government\u2019s housing goals, which to date are far from being met.\nThe bike lane proposal seems to try to pit various groups against each other. I am not a cyclist: I am a pedestrian, sometimes transit user and occasional car driver. Bike lanes in my city have helped me, a homeowner senior citizen, feel safer navigating the streets, whether on foot or by car.\nWhat I would support is banning right turns on red lights, which endanger us every day. These are not allowed in many jurisdictions. Why in Ontario?\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about the introduction of Bill 212, which will require the City of Toronto to reduce bike lanes on major streets such as in Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St. Instead of diminishing this crucial infrastructure, we should be expanding it. Dedicated bike lanes contribute to a safer, more inclusive road environment for all, including cyclists, pedestrians, seniors, and people with disabilities.\nThe claim that removing bike lanes and return them to a lane for motorists will alleviate congestion is misleading. Traffic congestion in Toronto stems from construction, and poor road behavior by motorists, such as blocking intersections or illegal parking/stopping. In fact, evidence shows that bike lanes can reduce overall traffic accidents. A study by Toronto Metropolitan University revealed a 38% reduction in collision rates after installing separated bike lanes, proving their effectiveness in enhancing road safety.\nMoreover, eliminating these bike lanes would not only be a step back for road safety but also carry significant financial costs. The City of Toronto estimates a loss of $27 million in investments if the lanes are removed, along with potential disruptions and extended construction timelines, which could worsen congestion rather than improve it. This move would also hinder the city's goals for reducing carbon emissions and improving public health by limiting access to sustainable transportation options.\nIn a place where public transit development lags and driving is neither affordable nor accessible for everyone, alternative modes of transport like cycling are essential. By providing more dedicated bike lanes, we encourage active transport, reduce traffic congestion, and foster a vibrant community. Reducing bike lanes is a regressive measure that undermines efforts to create a safer, more accessible, and inclusive city for all.\nI urge Ontario to reconsider this bill and focus instead on expanding safe cycling infrastructure, aligning with global best practices for sustainable urban transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed legislation. It is not an example of \"common sense\" but rather knee-jerk reactionism. The reasons why I don't support this legislation include:\nIn relation to bike lanes:\n- The governments use of misleading facts on bike lanes. For example the 1.2% of people commuting by bike figure includes areas well outside of Toronto, the number is higher in the city.\n- Bikes lanes don't cause an increase in emergency response times, EMS in Toronto confirmed this. Besides look at Europe and how bike lanes are designed to accommodate emergency vehicles giving them car free lanes. There are solutions to these concerns.\n-  You can't judge the need for a bridge by the number of people swimming across a river. People don't ride because the infrastructure is bad and they don't feel safe. There are numerous examples of cities building new bike infrastructure seeing huge increases in ridership.\n- Putting bike lanes on side streets ignores the fact that people are riding to get somewhere - side streets do not offer an efficient means to get from one place to another.\n- Bike lanes have higher capacities than car lanes, therefore building the lanes and getting more people riding can reduce traffic.\n- It increases red-tape and removes local control.\nIn relation to 413:\n- We have an under-used highway we could use instead.\n- The impact on the environment and communities it goes through will be huge.\n- It will cause more sprawl.\n- Induced demand means it will fill up in the nottoo-distant future.\n- Mass transit (i.e. trains) are far more efficient in moving people.\nWe have had decades of car-centric planning and traffic keeps getting worse and worse. It's time to do something different. This bill just continues the same policies that are failing.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. I oppose provincial involvement and legislation regarding bike lanes and I oppose the proposal  of Hiway 413 and all the urban sprawl and traffic (CO2 emissions) that would come along with it in the Ontario Greenbelt Region.\nOur communities have worked for decades to create safer, inclusive streets for all types of transportation and particularly transportation with less impact on the climate.\nMore people than ever are using bicycles and scooters as a healthy and affordable mode of transportation. I see moms and dads in bike lanes with toddlers in the bike seats, let\u2019s keep them safe by slowing down traffic and being more innovative in transportation solutions rather than pretending that more lanes of cars will ever be a proper solution.   The provincial government needs to leave bike lane planning up to community stakeholder groups.\nThe Greenbelt has never been so important in helping moderate local temperature, rates of evaporation and flooding. Yes, the Greenbelt plays a vital role to help reduce local impacts of climate change.  The Greenbelt also provides local farmland, local food. The Greenbelt provides healthy recreational areas for the citizens of the GTA and Also impacts those farther away.  We know that winters are increasingly shorter, affecting many types of seasonal industries we depend on as Canadians. Blue Mountain resort and many other outdoor companies barely had enough snow last year to make it through the season.  More paved areas and black roof tops will contribute to the heat islands which already exist in urban settings and will only negatively impact winter business and employment opportunities for generations to come!!\nThe warmer wetter climate might please some but it brings with it a tremendous increase in disease carrying mosquitos and other concerns.\nScientists have already sounded the alarm on World biodiversity loss, and if what remains of our Greenbelt is lost, we will most definitely lose more unique and irreplaceable local species of all kinds of flaura and wildlife - many of which play roles in the ecosystems which affect our own human health in positive ways. Our Greenbelt is a part of Ontarios citizens natural heritage and should be passed down to future generations. The Greenbelt requires a provincial government that can recognize the unparalleled value that it has as its own natural entity, and our Ontario government should have the wisdom and courage to protect it, (like their leader said they would when campaigning).\nDon\u2019t the conservatives have any children or grandchildren with futures??? Do you think those children and grandchildren can just use the money you\u2019d make from these construction projects and go to other places that won\u2019t be affected by climate change?? Like California, BC, Hawaii, Jasper, Alberta???\u2026maybe they will, but i hope they like forest fires more than I do. Maybe they could get way to Vancouver or Spain, although atmospheric rivers are an increasing concern too due to climate change.  Scrap Bill 212 immediately!\n"
