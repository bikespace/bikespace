        "comment": "I am against Bill 212 for many reasons. In particular, the bill ignores the evidence about the success of bike lanes in: 1) reducing congestion 2) encouraging more people to use bicycles for transportation than cars 3) making cycling safer. This bill represents a prioritization of car culture, which is backwards from the way we should be going in terms of promoting sustainable and zero-carbon forms of transportation. As we face a climate crisis, our government should be doing everything it can to reduce personal vehicle trips and to promote and support cycling and effective public transportation. My son uses the bike lanes to get from where we live to university; removing bike lanes would make his commute unsafe and would become a barrier to him using his bicycle, which then will mean his costs will go up and his daily commute will increase.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this proposed legislation.\nThe province is not relying on evidence-based thinking, but on knee-jerk dislike of alternatives to the private automobile.\nEvidence indicates that increasing car access to roads will, in one or two years, result in more cars on the roads and more gridlock. So the province's proposed legislation will make traffic worse.\nSo don't do it.\nThe province is overstepping its proper limits in making legislation that allows it to interfere with municipal governments. I wonder how much the current government will like this kind of behaviour when another party is in power.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes would not only cost millions of dollars, it would also strip people of one more form of transportation that they rely on for commuting in an environmentally-friendly way around the city. In the age of the climate crisis, the government should be focusing on data-driven research as to how to reduce congestion, as opposed to further enabling polluting cars to take over our roads as the major source for transportation and endangering remaining cyclists who must ride on roads without bike lanes. Requiring provincial approval of added bike lanes in the city is also an overreach. I am particularly saddened to hear about the potential for bike lanes to be removed on Bloor, which is a major hub connecting my neighbourhood to the downtown core. Studies have shown that by providing alternate modes of transportation, car congestion decreases. Removing cycling infrastructure will only encourage more people to use cars out of a lack of alternatives. More cars on the road = more congestion.\n"

Bicycling must be safe and bicycle lanes are necessary. More and more Torontonians are adopting the bicycle as a preferred means of transportation. I encourage the Ford government to look at investing in improving public transit rather than encouraging more motorists into the city core.\n"

I can tell you I LOVE the bike lanes and would only ever have dared trying bikes thanks to BikeShare and nearby bike lanes.  I felt so safe and able to use city bikes in and around my new home, that we donated our car and purchased bikes instead.  It would be devastating if you got rid of those safe lanes - i wish, in fact, that there were more bike lanes so that my husband and I could ride more frequently.\n"

Anyone with a pair of eyes can see the difference the bike lanes make. Not to mention the lively business we have in this neck of the woods. I would say from Christie Pits to Lansdowne the retail and other businesses in the area appear to be flourishing.\nI wonder about the REAL Reasoning dougie boy has by removing these lanes. Where are all those cyclists going to go? Will there be more collisions with cyclists and cars? How will the businesses do once the lanes are gone? Will hospital ER visits go up?  It is RIDICULOUS that we are spending money to REMOVE bike lanes. Which big city in the world does this? Seems entirely backward to me!\n"

I am not a cyclist, I am a driver - but I believe that our cities have to do everything possible to make transit and transportation by bike and foot safe and convenient.  When I am driving, I love it when there are dedicated bike lanes that keep cyclists safer from vehicles, and I love the fact that Toronto is becoming less car-focused.  I think it modernizes our city, and helps us fight teh climate crisis.\nI also CANNOT support the removal of any existing bike lanes.  The cost alone is ridiculous and would be better invested in advancing other projects.\nPremier Ford, the city is best qualified to make these decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Privileges must be partnered with responsibility. Don't take out the bike lanes. In bike lanes, they are only safer if they comply with the rules. DO IMPLEMENT TRAFFIC LAWS TO CONTROL CYCLIST BEHAVIOUR. I see bikes going through red lights/stop signs, wrong way on on-way streets, diverting into traffic lanes and across them, refusing to slow for pedestrians. I see aggressive behaviour against drivers turning right, including creeping into one's blind spot and kicking the car to stop the turn. I see kamikaze lane shifting through traffic. Bike lanes help limit some of this. But there seem to be NO CONSEQUENCES and the cyclists can be actively dangerous. They don't even show self-protectiveness with helmets, lights and reflective clothing....all of which should be mandated by provincial law. I have to do this as a driver, use seat belts and signals and lights, and pass a licence test to boot. Why not cyclists?\nAlso, the term 'cyclist' has grown well past the peddle bicycle. It now includes scooters, power boards, electric bicycles and even small motorcycles. This needs control. Half the trouble comes from the power bikes, travelling at up to 45km, in the bike lanes. Again, we need to re-institute BICYCLE LICENCES and redefine the motorcycle to include the powered bikes and scooters.  Think of it as a financial opportunity....somebody has to fund those bike lanes.\nTry being a pedestrian senior sometime. Scary to be walking out there, guys.\n"

        "comment": "PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ANY TORONTO BIKE LANES.\nSimply, we are going backwards, not forward. The idea that Doug Ford can dictate what our city should be doing is very alarming. Especially when city council unanimously supported keeping bike lanes in place.\nWe live on a section of Yonge Street that had bike lanes installed two years ago and we have only seen increased use, not less. I would prefer the money be used to help house and care for the homeless that sleep on the sidewalk outside our building.\nCars are dangerous. Bikes and pedestrian traffic must be separated and Doug Ford's car-centric focus is incredibly frustrating. It clearly disregards the impact cars have on the environment and health of civilians in general. We should be pushing for a walkable, rideable and accessible city (and province) for all.\nFinally I am deeply concerned where this government is going in all decisions affecting Toronto and the GTA (e.g. Ontario Place, Science Center, Greenbelt, a tunnel etc.). But the news of the bike lane removal sent me over the edge.\nI am not alone in my opinions. Doug Ford does not have the best interest of Torontonians at heart. It's clearly a different group and we're suffering for it.\nReally angry...\n"

Ever since Yonge St had lane reductions to allow for the creation of bike lanes and installation of Cafe TO outdoor dining, the section of Yonge Street between Bloor St and St Clair has been gridlocked for hours every day. Not only is Yonge Street congested to the point that it's dangerous and loud with angry drivers honking car horns, the quiet residential side streets like Crescent Road and Roxborough Street regularly become backed up with standing traffic extending two or more blocks on either side of Yonge as commuters try to make their way between Mount Pleasant Road and Avenue Road to circumnavigate the gridlocked section of Yonge. Please bring an end to this daily chaos on Yonge Street by having the traffic engineers figure out how to restore additional lanes of traffic during rush hour.\n"

        "comment": "I am seriously concerned that this bill will negatively impact my family and my community in the following ways:\n1) The bill adds red tape and bureaucracy by forcing municipalities to seek approval from the Minister for local projects. This will slow down the rollout of plans to improve traveller choice in cities & towns across the province.\n2) The bill will decrease my choices; I consider bike lanes essential transportation infrastructure that help me get around. Bike lanes are as essential as sidewalks in keeping our cities & towns moving.\n3) The bill seeks to maximize the number of cars on the road while undermining basic safety for other road users. Bike lanes provide a basic standard of safety for vulnerable road users.\n4) The bill makes it harder for me when I'm driving my car. With a designated space for bikes I can feel comfortable knowing they are separated from automobile traffic.\n5) The bill conflicts with plans to roll out transit improvements. Bike lanes make it easier for people to get to transit stations, reducing the need for parking (e.g. GO Transit carpool lots) and increasing the space for other uses such as transit-oriented housing developments.\n6) Specifically in my city in York Region - the bill undermines the City's Active Transportation Master Plan, developed through years of public consultation. Traffic calming projects that are intended to improve safety for everyone - including car drivers - will likely be shut down by this bill's requirements to seek ministerial approval. This bill will keep the City from making the streets safer.\nIn summary, I believe this bill is deeply flawed and should not pass. Thank you for your time and attention.\n"

We should be looking at ways to encourage more people to move away from cars - both for environmental and gridlock reasons - rather than taking these options away. Encouraging things like carpooling could help reduce congestion, as most cars have only a single occupant and yet impact a vast amount of people. The cost to remove these bike lanes also seems incredibly irresponsible, given the pressing need for things like affordable housing and food security in the city.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is a terrible idea.  I understand that it may feel like they're slowing down traffic, but as someone who uses the lanes daily, I can say that it's the opposite.  There are many people on bikes and they're moving quickly and safely.\nI am both a car driver and a cyclist.  I live in the City proper.  The only way to move the many people here now is to use foot, bike or transit and, if the situation requires it, a car, but that should be the last resort, not the first option.  It's not up to you, me and the mayor - it's just simple math when you have that many people in that small of a space.\nSo many of the cars have one person in them - that's insanity and denial of the present and the future of the city.  Studies have shown that people on bike and foot spend more than drivers link from Forbes is attached.\nThere is a time and a place for cars, but the reality of the situation is that a shift in thinking is required - those who can walk, ride or take transit need to be considering and using those options more.  Taking out bike lanes is a short term 'solution' that will fill in quickly and have us right back to where we were in terms of gridlock and no bike lanes to help with the issue.  Research has shown that adding lanes/widening roadways leads to increased traffic (link attached at bottom).\nThe public isn't stupid - everyone knows that the threat on this is to deflect from the larger problem -- traffic has never been worse on the 401 and Gardiner and the DVP -- fix those before meddling in the City's affairs.  Get the Crosstown going -- it's been a long time coming and we're still waiting.\nIn short, look at the facts and use your collective head - taking out bike lanes won't help the problem and will only serve to set us back.\n"
