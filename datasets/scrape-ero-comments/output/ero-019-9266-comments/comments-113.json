I pay as many taxes as everyone else and should be allowed a safe and efficient way of travelling.  The bloor bike lanes have been installed less then a year ago, behaviour change takes time.  Drivers have many different ways of getting downtown.. and bloor is not supposed to be a freeway to get downtown.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Parkdale/High Park area, I have two children under the age of 10, we do not own a car, and I rely on biking to get myself and my children around the city. Bike lanes (for us the Bloor bike lane in particular) is the only thing that makes it safe enough and therefore possible to get my kids around the city. I use the Bloor bike lanes (with my kids) at least 2-3 times per week to get to after school activities, doctors appointments, play dates etc etc etc. There is no other option. There is no other east-west bike network that can get me where I need to go. Because of rail tracks and neighborhood structure there is no network of quieter side streets (trust me I\u2019ve been biking in this city for many years and I will always take side streets if and when I can). And yes, I use these lanes year round.\nRemoving bike lanes would likely force my family to buy a car or use car shares more often - thus adding yet another car to the city\u2019s traffic (we also don\u2019t have a driveway, so this would be yet another car needlessly taking up limited parking in the city). I know countless other families like ours that live happily car-free and rely on the existence of safe, protected bike lanes to get ourselves and our kids around the city. Please don\u2019t take away our ability to get around this city.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who biked everywhere when I lived in Japan for many years, I've been scared to do the same in Canada without a protected bike lane as the traffic is crazy and feels very unsafe. For example, even though my grocery store is less than 2km from my home, I can't bike there so I have to walk and carry the full weight of the groceries which has led to strained neck muscles a few times now. I feel this bill was developed in haste without proper consultation of all involved and is a major over-stepping of the province in municipal affairs. I have faith the city DID do proper consultations and studies before deciding where to put bike lanes, but the province is being led by old-fashioned ideas and knee jerk reactions rather than being data-informed. I am extremely opposed to this bill!\n"

        "comment": "This is incredibly stupid and cynical. These bike lanes are high-quality pieces of infrastructure that play a pivotal role in reducing the chance of cyclists and pedestrians along these corridors from being maimed or killed. Discouraging an extremely efficient mode of transportation from a congestion point of view for the purposes of improving congestion makes zero sense.\nI understand that this is completely ideological so reading won't make any difference, but they've literally studied the effects of bike lanes across the world, which are that they encourage people to get out of their cars and cycle, which LOWERS travel times after a year or two. The University bike lanes (and bike lanes in general) improve emergency response times, which Ford is lying about.\nThis is par for the course in this province, where we have people who refuse to read anything about the topic at hand holding back the city of Toronto (and every other city). People like Ford have no ambition and no pride in where they live and have no attachment to the people they live around. To actively remove expensive and high quality infrastructure that was recently built for no reason other than literal lies is absurd, especially when you realize that people will die as a result.\nUntil this braindead bill is dead I'll be protesting this by taking the entire lane on my bicycle every time. I will no longer be using any bike lanes in the city. I'll be riding down the middle of Bloor, College, Dundas, Queen, Yonge, and any other street whether they have bike lanes or not. If you don't like congestion now, you definitely won't like it when I act like a car. I'll probably be assaulted by some entitled driver for this, and that will be your fault too.\n"

        "comment": "Governments around the world, in all of the modern cities have followed the findings of bike lane studies. Research shows that dedicated bicycle lanes are not behind perceived traffic congestion. Research shows that protected bike lanes reduce loss of life. If you put in more dedicated bike lanes, people tend to feel safer and demand for use increases. In New York City, the city's transportation department shared that in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes, a 35 per cent decrease. One of the reasons they cited for the change was the installation of a left-turn lane, which not only kept cyclists moving but also stopped cars from holding up traffic. This is how you reduce congestion. Stop spreading lies and misinformation. Stop meddling in municipal politics. Stop wasting tax payer dollars on dog whistle issues and follow the research.\n"

It defies logic, professional opinion and screams that this government will do whatever they like for personal convenience at the expense of people's tax dollars and their lives.\nThe answer to gridlock is getting people into safe bike lanes, not out of them.

        "comment": "The Ontario government's proposal has two flaws. First, it goes against Doug Ford's claim to be eliminating red tape. It's absolutely hypocritical for Ford to put up layers of red tapes for innocuous bike lanes while eliminating environmental studies for projects like the Ontario Line and Ontario Place.\nSecond, the need to prove no increased car travel time is flawed. More cars are on the roads, so car travel time keeps on increasing unless alternative forms of transportation (bike lanes, subways/LRTs) are introduced. And there is countless data that shows that increasing car lanes only puts more cars on the roads AND increasing bike lanes puts more bike traffic on the road.\nThis law is the most ridiculous, backwards micromanagement a 21st century government can introduce, and the cherry on top of this insanity is that the Minister of Transportation's from a suburb where the car rules and  there isn't the need to put more bikes on the road as there is in Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa.\n"

        "comment": "The removals of bike lanes is a financially irresponsible decision, but more importantly, it is a literally fatal one for the cyclists in the city. In 2024, 24 year old woman was killed in Yorkville after she had to exit a bike lane because a construction company was illegally blocking it. Her life was not expendable, nor was it the cost of doing business.\nPhysically separated bike lanes keep both motorists and cyclists safe as they no longer have to worry about accidents with each other, and because of that, more residents feel safe cycling. There are mountains of evidence and case studies from around the world that show that adding bike lanes reduces congestion, and data from the Bike Share Toronto program corroborates that - between 2015 and 2022 Bike Share Toronto increased ridership 6.7 times, and part of that is due to safer streets for cyclists.\nBy tabling or voting for this bill, you are telling your constituents that as long as they are on a bike, you don't care if they live or die.\n"
