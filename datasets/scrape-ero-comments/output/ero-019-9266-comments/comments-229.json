        "comment": "Bicycle lanes reduce congestion.  I would drive more in Toronto if I didn't have a bike.  On streets without a bike lane, cyclists are entitled to an entire lane of the road, and we have to to be able to use the road safely.\nThere are many other causes of gridlock in Toronto including but not limited to parked cars, delivery vehicles and taxis blocking traffic when they stop, drivers running red lights or blocking intersections...  the real issue is too many cars in Toronto.  The highways entering Toronto are over capacity, why do these commuters and visitors to Toronto expect to come off a gridlock highway to find empty lanes in the downtown core?\nWe understand they are an easy target but this proposal will cause great harm to cities who must be able to fulfill thier roles as the urban planners in Ontario.\nRemoving bike lanes will increase congestion and increases risknofnjnjury or death to cyclists.\nWalk back this political stunt and allow municipalities to do thier work, and have the Province focus on metrolinklx and enabling livable walkable cities.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto, Ontario resident. I am a car owner and have first-hand experience of the gridlock and infuriating traffic in the Greater Toronto Area. I have also experienced the increase in motor vehicle travel time with the addition of bike lanes.\nI am also a cyclist and frequent user of bike lanes, including bike lanes that have led to the loss of motor vehicle lanes.\nI oppose, in the strongest sense possible, Bill 212 and its intent to remove bike lanes and impede the creation of new ones. Yes, the creation of bike lanes has led to some areas of increased motor vehicle congestion; however, the problem isn't the bike lane. Bike lanes are essential for keeping cyclists safe. If bike lanes aren't present, people are not able to safely cycle. The real issue at hand for reducing gridlock is investment in public transit. The Ontario Government (both past and present) has failed Ontarians by not adequately investing in public transit and not holding existing Provincial transit projects accountable. The lack of reliable public transit both within large cities but also connecting communities, has led to the over-reliance on cars. The answer is not to encourage more cars on the road. This is short sighted and skirting the bigger issues and responsibilities of the government.\nIssues that impact the entire province are the responsibility of the Provincial government. The proposed framework for bike lanes is unnecessarily meddling in municipal politics and is a gross misuse of time, money and resources.\nWe know that investing in public transit and bike lanes has enormous economic benefit, improves greenhouse gas emissions and leads to healthier communities. Driving a car is a privilege, not a right; we do not need to make it easier to drive one. Tearing up bike lanes would impede progress towards making vulnerable road users (i.e. cyclists) safer. The problem is not the bike lanes. The problem is the lack of investment in public transit. I implore our government to work towards finding solutions here instead of wasting municipal money and tearing up or restricting bike lanes (bike lanes which encourage active transit and healthier communities!).\nBike Lane impacts:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nThe Economic Impact of Transit Investment in Canada:\nhttps://cutaactu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/final_issue_paper_50_cut\u2026\nProtected Bike Lane Networks Save Money and Protect Planet:\nhttps://www.fiafoundation.org/news/protected-bike-lane-networks-save-mo\u2026\nInvest in walking and cycling for sustainable, safe cites:\nhttps://www.wri.org/insights/invest-walking-cycling-sustainable-safe-ci\u2026\n"

        "comment": "The \"Framework for bike lanes\" is misguided in both process and effect.\nOn process, local municipalities are best positions to make decisions about local and regional roads.  Local councils are elected and accountable to their constituencies.\nOn effect, congestion is only solved with effective options to personal automobiles.   Bike lanes and improved transit service (including dedicated transit lanes) provide options to many people to move in our cities, freeing road space for those who must use vehicles.  These options also allow the many people who do not or cannot drive to also access jobs, shopping, and community connections.  In addition, travelling by bicycle or transit is more environmentally friendly.\n"

        "comment": "Interfering in what municipalities feel are important for their inhabitants is gross provincial over reach. Each community has its own demographics and needs and imposing a yet to be determine provincial solution on a community by requiring they obtain ministry of transportation approval impedes the ability of communities to address the needs of their citizens.\nFurther, this is a costly waste of money - resources spent on reviews and approvals and ripping out fully functioning infrastructure. We need money spent elsewhere.\nLastly, this is just backward. While the entire world recognizes the fact that bike lanes help with congestion, this government instead makes up stories about how the impede them. Evidence does not show this in the rest of the developed world. Canada is going backwards. What a mess!\n"

        "comment": "It is an incredibly bad idea to rip apart bike lanes that have been put in place with money and time invested. Ripping them apart means cyclists will use standard lanes, which will cause more traffic and be dangerous. In general, taking people out of bikes and into cars, does not reduce traffic, it creates much more traffic, by adding more cars on the road.\nLastly, the decision to add/remove bike lanes is NOT upto the province - it is upto the municipalities! Conservative government should be about minimizing the role and reach of government, not budding in to every issue and making it their own. Give mayors and municipalities their own voice. I say this all as a someone who voted PC in a prior election.\n"

        "comment": "The only way to reduce congestion for motor vehicles is through providing viable alternatives to driving. Through the use of very little space and tax dollars, protected bike lanes provide a safe and extremely efficient alternative to driving. A robust and well connected bike lane network encourages people to travel by bike instead of motor vehicle which reduces the number of vehicles on the road and this in turn reduces traffic congestion. The bike lane barrier also significantly reduces the risk of injury or death to the cyclist if a motor vehicle hits them. The removal of bike lanes will force cyclists into the motor vehicle lanes; this is bad for everyone. To protect themselves cyclists are taught to take the entire motor vehicle lane. This will increase congestion due to the speed limitation of bikes. This also dramatically increases the risk that the cyclist will be injured or killed by a motor vehicle since the risk of contact/collision is much higher. The protection a bike lane provides benefits the driver of a motor vehicle as much as the cyclist, without the protection if a driver hits and kills a cyclist they are most likely getting criminally charged and serving a prison sentence. This would of course result in significant psychological trauma for the driver as well as a destruction of their professional lives due to now having a criminal record. Drivers of motor vehicles should petition for more bike lanes as the lanes ensure that they get to tuck their kids in to bed every night instead of watching them grow up from the inside of a cell. An additional benefit of robust cycling infrastructure comes in the form of a reduction in strain on our healthcare system since cycling provides a significant amount of exercise. More cyclists = a healthier population = less strain on healthcare.\nDecisions about the design of a city should be left to the elected officials of that city as they have been selected based on shared beliefs about how their city should operate.\n"

Encouraging people into cars will worsen noise and air pollution, further increase traffic, harm small businesses (which benefit from bike lanes [3, 4]) and increase road deaths [2].

        "comment": "I am extremely concerned about the provincial government's overreach into municipal problems by controlling the approval of new bike lanes, and removing existing lanes in certain areas. As both a frequent car driver and biker, my commute and safety are greatly improved when the city roads I am on have clearly marked and protected bike lanes.\nNumerous studies by leading urban planning experts show in metro areas, bike lanes benefit congestion, generate economic activity, and reduce the risk of injuries. For example, the 1st linked document contains several reviews of bike lane projects in cities across the world. Of particular note is the first case study, which is a 2014 review of bike lanes installed in New York that found that for a certain stretch of Manhattan roads, bike lanes decreased motorist trip times by 35%.\nA 2017 study on the Bloor street bike lanes found that installation actually improved economic activity for businesses.\nGiven the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting bike lanes, as well as drawing on the personal experience of myself and all other commuters I personally know, I strongly urge the province to reconsider its position on bike lanes. Outside of bike lanes, there are several other ways to improve traffic congestion, such as public transit. It is concerning that the province is spending time actively working against evidence and data, instead of focusing on current provincial transit initiatives that are over budget and beyond their deadlines (Eglinton LRT).\n"

Without bicycle lanes and complete streets in the city of Toronto I feel unsafe commuting by bicycle.\nI do not support the province legislating where there may be bicycle lanes. Bicycles lanes built in Toronto have created a safe and efficient way for thousands to travel through the city without owning a car and contributing towards the car traffic in the city. City officials have said that emergency response times have not been impacted by bicycle lanes.\nI do not think owning a car should result in an individual being given more road space than other road users such as pedestrians, bicyclist and transit users. Roads need to be able to provide to the needs of all users including cyclists, pedestrians and transit users.\nPlease invest in transit funding instead which would help reduce gridlock given that individual occupancy cars are very inefficient for moving large numbers of people.\n"

My children all bike regularly, and my oldest son bikes to and from school every day.\nI own a car, and traffic congestion is a problem in Toronto, but the root causes of that congestion is population growth and construction, not bike lanes. On balance, bike lanes are more likely to reduce traffic congestion than increase it, as research has consistently shown.\nAs a teenager in Toronto in the 1990s, I used to bike about 50km a week to get to high school, and I was nearly hit by a car several times. As I bring up my children in Toronto today, I feel comfortable with them biking to school and other activities because of the bike lanes in our neighbourhood, including the protected bike lane on Bloor St. West. To remove bike lanes, or slow the introduction of new bike lanes, by passing Bill 212 would put my children at significantly greater risk of being killed in an accident. What greater responsibility does the Government of Ontario have than to keep its residents, most of all its children, safe?\n"

        "comment": "Adding more red tape for construction of bike infrastructure is not going to solve traffic problems. Bike lanes increased safety for everyone and speed up traffic by reducing the number of cars on the road. The thing that would make cars move faster is improving alternate forms of transportation, including funding the TTC and public transit construction. The impact of a single lane of a road is minuscule in comparison to the impact of the Eglinton LRT. Focus on things that matter.\n"
