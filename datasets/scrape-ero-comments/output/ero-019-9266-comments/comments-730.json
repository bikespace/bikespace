Cars are the problem with gridlock and traffic, not cyclists and not bike lanes. Removing the bike lanes puts cyclists lives at risk. You're playing with people's lives if you remove the bike lanes. Cycling is better for the environment than driving vehicles. It is also healthy for people. Vehicles increase pollution and increase sedentary behavior. We don't need more vehicles on the road. We need more cyclists and we need more safety for everyone on the road.\n"

Instead of putting time, money and workers into removing bike lanes, put the effort and money  into completing the long delayed Eglinton crosstown. Also complete the Sheppard subway. This line stops so abruptly that it is ineffective AND it avoids Scarborough.\n"

        "comment": "I've been cycling to work for the past 14 years. Over that time, I have felt more and more safe as the cycling network has been expanded and more separated lanes have been installed.\nI cycle because I think it is the most rational way to get to work. It avoids car congestion as well as cramped rush hour subway rides. I am in control of my schedule, it gives me more freedom. I am a senior executive at my company, I am well respected, a subject matter expert in my field. Cycling is not a children's toy, it is a legitimate commuting method, one that is a necessary part of a growing city. If every cyclist actually used their car, the traffic would be so much worse.\nI continue to cycle despite the terrifying near misses with cars and the belligerent, dangerous, behaviour of some drivers on the road towards me and other cyclists. There are also many very courteous drivers who treat me with respect and care on the road. I also belong on our roads. I pay taxes for the roads. I deserve to have a direct, safe way to get to work and to my other activities.\nI strongly, deeply oppose Bill 212. It will make me and other vulnerable road users less safe while doing nothing to ease car congestion in the city. Bike lanes are not the problem, they are the solution to easing traffic. The more appealing you make cycling, the more accessible, less scary, the more people will consider it as a legitimate alternative to transportation and get out of their cars (often as single occupancy) to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 puts drivers and cars first - ahead of pedestrians and cyclists. This is a mistake. Bike lanes encourage cycling. We need more people biking and walking or taking transit to get around the city.\nTaking away the bike lanes makes roads more dangerous for cyclists, many of whom are couriers trying to deliver all the things we want and need. Cyclists and couriers shouldn't be endangering their lives every time they take to the streets. We need more designated protected bike lanes to create a quieter, less-polluted and safer city. The great cities of the world - like PARIS AND LONDON  have less automobile traffic not more! Toronto can be a great city too!\n"

It\u2019s been shown reducing bike lanes will not improve traffic gridlock. Think of all the people who will now drive to work if they can\u2019t bike. If they were biking, chances are public transportation wasn\u2019t convenient anyway. Second, removing bike lanes will cause more cyclists to die or become severely injured in road traffic accidents. Regardless of fault, a car vs cyclist collision  can be fatal to the cyclist. It is unconscionable that we are actually considering using tax payer money to do something that won\u2019t work and will lead to more deaths and injuries.\n"

It ignores the priorities identified by communities outside the GTA and in accordance with their local planning and consultations.  It appears to be driven by a political consideration rather than logic and evidence considerations.  Fundamentally, it is not in the public interest but rather is insensitive to community interest and process.  This legislation enables undoing what has been approved and built at great public expense.  It is not progressive but is regressive.  To me, this reflects a bullying approach to government, very disappointing.\n"

You really want cars to go back to having to share the same lane as cyclists? Isn\u2019t that more annoying?\nIn the same way cars want to get from A to B in the most efficient route possible, so do cyclists!\nPaying more money to rip out existing bike lanes is not going to speed up traffic. If you are serious about reducing congestion- INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSIT. INVEST IN HOV LANES. INVEST IN BUSES AND TRAINS AND BIKE LANES.\nThis bill also attempts to bypass environmental assessments for highway 413. This is not ok. Highway 413 would destroy Ontario\u2019s farmland. We do not need more highways.\nThis bill will not save anyone time or reduce gridlock. It will only cause more congestion.\n"

Very hard to miss seeing a large bright yellow bike w/large basket but they did!\n"

        "comment": "Government policy must be based on evidence.\nThere is plenty of evidence of gridlock in Toronto where I live. Taking away bike lines will not reduce gridlock.\nThere is evidence that bike lanes in cities and towns reduce the risk of accidents, injury and death. Removing bike lanes, particularly on busy streets, will put lives at risk.\nThere is evidence that making cities and towns more walkable, and encouraging cycling and use of public transit, can increase the health and well being of people in towns as well as cities. Removing bike lanes and not encouraging and financing accessible public transportation infrastructure will not contribute to the health of our communities.\nAs for the health of businesses, I do not know whether there is evidence that bike lanes have had an adverse affect on business, but from my own experience I am much more likely to shop locally if I can walk, ride, or take public transit to those businesses. I do have a car, but I rarely use it for shopping in businesses that are close to home, because of gridlock. As for shopping locally using my bike, I do not do so unless I can access a safe bike lane.\nI strongly oppose the new provincial bill that would allow for removal of bike lanes!\n"

As more capacity is created (e.g., new vehicles lane), more people will choose to drive which will bring congestion right back to where it was. This is a well-researched field.\nIt would be nice for the Government to do some research and identify best practices from other cities - please find large cities anywhere in the world that are doing well economically and do not have significant congestion. If those do exist, it would only be due to exceptional transit and bike infrastructure - not more vehicle lanes.\n"

Many people have come to rely on these bike lanes, and removing them is likely to be inconvenient and dangerous for many people who use this infrastructure.\nStudies from around the world have tried adding highways and lanes to improve traffic, and it does not work. Look to New York for an easy example. NYC is still feeling the ramifications of historic highway development, which now creates huge congestion.\nI appreciate Toronto traffic is a concern. It should be addressed, however, not through this flawed and overreaching move by the provincial government. This will be a waste of money and not improve the situation longterm. Do not create a problem that will have to be undone in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I'm opposed to Bill 212 and its framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nCycling is my method of transportation in Toronto. I literally wept with joy when the bike lanes were finally finished on Bloor near Dundas West because it was too dangerous to take a lane and ride in front of cars under two sets of railroad tracks that involves a dip and an incline. Vehicles drive close behind bikes as they coast down, and are impatient when bikes ride up the incline at a slower speed. I will be forced back into this situation if bikes lanes are removed and/or if future bikes lanes are prevented.\nI've watched cycling grow in my city and in other cities across Ontario (Hamilton, Burlington, Brantford, Niagara, Windsor, Barrie) as bike lanes are installed and bikeshare programs take off. Bike lanes are full and getting fuller. The ones I use are full of delivery cyclists, the lanes clearly supporting the local economy.\nOntario cities are growing. Removing bike lanes won't solve the gridlock new people and new vehicles will bring. As cities grow in density, the people who live there need to be supported with a variety of safe and ample transportation options \u2013 including cycling, which doesn't pollute and create CO2 emissions like vehicles do. Many are choosing cycling as a daily transit option, including during the colder months \u2013 they're not cycling for recreation. Without sustainable options, more people will be compelled to drive. Bill 212 prevents Canadian cities from taking the action they need to take to stop climate change.\nI believe municipalities in Ontario should have the power to make decisions about bike lanes without input or approval from the province. The people who live in cities know what's best for their them \u2013 especially how they want their city to grow, how they want to promote healthy lifestyles and provide more transport options for everyone, including kids, families and seniors. Not everyone commuting within and to and from cities can afford a vehicle. Many people work or provide caregiving in early or late hours when there's no transit option available. They need bike lanes to get home and go to work. Removing bike lines and preventing construction of new bike lines discourages cycling by making it unsafe.\nLastly, I'm worried about Bill 212 given the driver culture I've observed in my city and others across Ontario. Drivers do not drive safely around cyclists despite the fact that their vehicles (which are growing larger and larger) can kill cyclists. If cyclists are forced to take the lane due to the lack of protected lanes, we will do so. Like drivers, we also need to get from A to B. However, drivers will blame cyclists for slowing them down, taking \"their\" space, and cyclists will pay the price.\nAmple research exists to prove that more lanes doesn't solve gridlock. Bike lanes ultimately have a smaller city footprint than car lanes and parking. And every cyclist represents a car that's not taking up road space. Please vote against this bill to build a realistic, sustainable future for cities and to save cyclist lives.\n"

        "comment": "The real reason for the gridlock it is the fact that too many people are relying on cars to commute. Removing bike lanes or adding more car lanes are not going to solve gridlock. There are too many cars in the GTA for this problem to be solved by widening roads.\nEven adding more car lanes are not going to solve traffic. Actually often it makes things worse. There is even a terminology to describe this called Braess Paradox.\nThere are also studies and simulations that show improving bike lanes can reduce car traffic.\n"

The data is in - bike lanes do not make traffic worse. Bike lanes help reduce congestion. Remove bike lanes and you will have tens of thousands more cars on the roads every day.\nAnd more dead cyclists. Cyclists are not the enemy. Cyclists help keep our province cleaner and healthier. Bike lanes make us safer. We don\u2019t worry about getting doored or hit by cars. As a driver, I prefer separated bike lanes because I feel more comfortable sharing the road this way.\nRemoving completed bike lanes is financially irresponsible. Please do not remove existing bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge and force cars and cyclists to share the lane.\nAnd finally, these are municipal issues. Please focus on broader Ontario wide issues that you have jurisdiction over, like investing in regional and mass transit.\nThis policy proposal is shortsighted, politically motivated, not in the interest of Toronto, and contrary to the evidence.\nThank you.\n"

It allows people to stay healthy.\n-While a lane of traffic may be removed, it improves the roadways as each commuter  cyclist would be using another option like driving or taking space on transit.\nThe improvement of bike lanes has been a positive step forward for the city of Toronto, putting it in line with other more livable cities. Many are leaving Toronto in search of more livable and cyclist friendly cities. Do not take a step backwards in progress and reduce bike lanes. Don\u2019t make the bike lanes the scapegoat for traffic problems in the city.
