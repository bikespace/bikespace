        "comment": "I am against this proposed amendment, and the bill it amends.\nI strongly feel that this addendum is an unnecessary addition to a bill that only stands to increase beaurocracy at the cost of taxpayer dollars. Removal of existing (and new) infrastructure does nothing but charge the taxpayer twice, while increasing the total time that construction is present on Toronto's streets, increasing gridlock (which this bill claims to prevent).\nMultiple studies (one by the European Union's CIVITAS program attached) have demonstrated how congestion benefits from allowing alternative forms of transportation, such as cycling. The attached study includes case studies from New York City and London, UK, which have similar environmental and social frameworks as Toronto.\nThe expansion of Toronto's bike lanes (including those on Yonge and University which are identified for removal by this addendum) have afforded me a safe opportunity to commute year-round, without negatively impacting traffic. If this amendment passes, I will have to return to biking on streets directly with vehicle traffic, slowing vehicles behind me and giving me a demonstrably more dangerous commute.\nIn summary, I believe that this bill goes against the majority of published science that demonstrates how facilitation of alternative means of transportation is beneficial to reducing congestion, and that the amendment to this bill is both an overreach of provincial power, and ineffective use of tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal appears to be contrary to this government\u2019s stated desire to use \u2018common sense\u2019 and data driven decision making. The government should begin by asking municipalities (in this case Toronto) to provide the their most recent data on bike lane usage and impact on commute times for both cyclists, transit users, and car drivers. The premier cites 2011 data to justify what appears to be an ideologically driven decision. Much has changed since 2011 with regards to bike use.\nI personally commute to and from work as well as to frequent meetings in the City, all by bike whenever I can. I choose routes with bike lanes for the safety and speed they provide. As a result of the pandemic driven acceleration of bike lane installation in Toronto, it is now possible for me to conduct most of my work as an Architect without the use of a car or Ubers. It has been a game changer for me.\nOur decision to locate our new office on Danforth Ave is based on the ease of access for staff and clients. The combination of subway, dedicated bike lanes and easy driving (yes, on Danforth Ave cars move easily) with on street parking tipped the balance in favour of this decision.\nI urge the government to take a step back and get the facts before rushing to judgement on this important issue for health, well being, safety, and convenience of ALL users of our public streets.\n"

        "comment": "As a regular car driver, commuter, and downtown resident I strongly support retaining all the current bike paths on Bloor, University, and Yonge. Bike paths have made life on these streets so much nicer.  Improved pedestrian experience, safer store access, and a better street look and feel.  Streets inside a city should not be used as highways. Walk, bike, transit come first, private vehicles are a second priority.  Climate change demands a better way. Look at Montreal, Paris, even New York City, as models that will help improve planning.\n"

        "comment": "Look at any world class city, London, Paris, New York and you\u2019ll see the majority of vehicles driving in the core are service vehicles with trades people, delivery vehicles and taxis. Those who live in the city don\u2019t drive and those who live outside don\u2019t dare to drive in. While I was initially opposed to the bike lanes that stretch across the Humber on Bloor, my view after walking this stretch daily between 8-9 in rush hour has changed.  Now I shake my head at the endless stretch of cars with one person in them. No car pooling, no subway use.  But honestly some days there\u2019s lots of traffic during this time and other days almost none.  It\u2019s hardly predictable.  The bike lanes aren\u2019t busy which is a shame because they provide a safe way for many of these commuters to travel to and from work or school. The lanes definitely aren\u2019t perfect but I want to see a thoroughly flushed out plan by the premier and the Ontario government before there\u2019s a suggestion of removing them.  I also want to see what the cost of removing them is and who bears the cost of their removal?  If we remove them, will TTC use drop and more drivers flood the roads and congestion be equally as bad?\nWhat incentives has the government given for those to ride a bicycle to work.  Maybe like Europe we could be progressive and give employees the ability to lease a bike with pre tax dollars?  Maybe it\u2019s an E-bike and the employer can get an incentive to install charging stations for these employees to use as well.  We can\u2019t use the excuse of Canadian winters either as they just aren\u2019t as cold or snowy anymore.  On those days, take the subway. If we want to reduce congestion, let\u2019s focus our efforts on public transit and getting the Eglinton line open and upgrade the Bloor line with the more modern Yonge line style trains.\n"

        "comment": "If the government truly wants to \"solve\" gridlock, multiple forms of transportation should be prioritized and not penalized:\n- In reviewing BIA data, neighbourhoods and communities that have bike lanes have improved economic activity vs. those without. Removing the lanes will not only cost taxpayer money, but will remove economic impact by ensuring people to simply pass through neighbourhoods rather than explore.\n- Bike lanes encourage citizens to be active year-round. Whether via e-bike or pedal-powered, encouraging daily cardio activity and removing polluting cars from the road encourages a healthier population vs. sedentary.\n- Bike lanes reduce traffic and keep everyone, including motorists, safer. Separating out cyclists\u2014who will still exist, even if lanes are removed\u2014encourages safer trips for all.\nTraffic is absolutely a problem in Toronto. But these lanes are recent and need time for people to adapt and see them as viable options. By removing them, you're forcing more people back into vehicles which will increase congestion and road construction when usage increases, which results in more traffic.\nWe have the potential to have a great city, but short-sighted decisions like these which offer no long-term benefits are designed to make the city fail. Please reconsider.\nSigned, a cyclist, motorist and transit user (we do exist!)\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m deeply concerned about the proposed changes in Bill 212 that would remove bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University in Toronto. These bike lanes have transformed the city for so many people, making biking a viable, safe alternative to driving. Friends and family who never considered biking now feel comfortable enough to choose it, which has not only helped ease congestion but also created a stronger sense of community.\nRemoving these lanes feels like a major step backward. I understand the frustration around traffic, but dismantling bike lanes won\u2019t solve it\u2014in fact, it will likely make things worse by pushing cyclists back onto congested roads. Toronto is trying to position itself as a forward-thinking, sustainable city, and taking away safe biking options just doesn\u2019t align with those goals. We have an opportunity here to build a city that\u2019s cleaner, healthier, and more inclusive, and keeping these bike lanes is an essential part of that vision.\n"

The setting aside of our rights under the environmental bill of rights and the even the dismissal of noise concerns with regard to highway construction.\nThe section on bike lane and bike lane remove is especially egregious.  This act, if passed will only make traffic worse (refer to basically every study ever written on the subject), will result in more injuries and deaths not only to cyclists, but also to drivers and pedestrians, makes a mockery of planning approvals which allowed multi-unit buildings to be build without parking, will cost Ontarians money in road repair, automobile ownership costs, will shorten peoples lives due to increased urban air pollution, etc.\nThis is quite frankly, one of the most disappointing, short-sighted and foolish things I have ever seen my government do. This will only make Ontario and especially the City of Toronto worse.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident who regularly bikes and also drives in the west end and downtown, on Bloor street in particular.\nRemoving bike lanes would not help anyone. Prior to them being put in place on Bloor traffic crawled anyways due to cars parking in the curb lanes, and as a cyclist it was a terrifying route to take. Now, cars and bikes can safely use Bloor street with much less risk. Yes, it\u2019s still slow but it has not slowed down and as a driver I would MUCH rather have bikes safely in their own separated lane than having to crowd into the same lane with cars.\nThis proposal is wrong headed and disrespectful to the careful work and analysis that went into the implementation of these bike lanes. Take a look at other large cities in the world and realize that more cars and tailoring infrastructure to driving is not the answer. Public transit, and a robust cycling network, is. Look at how well Montreal is doing with their cycling infrastructure as an example.\n"

The scientific data is clear, bike lanes do not have the impact on traffic times as the premiere is claiming, which proves to me that he is choosing to use this as a wedge issue in his continued divisive style politics. This time however; he\u2019s doing so at the risk of Ontarian's lives. Shameful. We as Ontarian's want our government to focus on real issues that matter to us. Health care, education, housing, public transportation, and the environment. This is a regressive bill, that also has questionable elements that will impact this governments desire to build the 413 Highway, by easing environmental assessments. I ask that this bill be revoked and that Doug Ford and his party get back to tackling far more important matters, than wasting time and money on turning back the clock on municipal affairs that he should be leaving too municipal leaders.\n"
