        "comment": "As a car driver, I actually much prefer separate bicycle lanes, for the same reason I prefer pedestrians have sidewalks they can walk on. Sharing a road with bikes means either bobbing in-and-out of a lane to safely pass them, or being stuck behind them going paces cars of today struggle to idly keep.\nAlso, I feel like gridlocks are caused by people missing their exit lanes and swerving at the last minute, mostly causing crashes\u2014fewer car lanes should mean less chance for confusion.\nAnd hey, safer bike lanes might even mean more people on bicycles, and a reduce in cars on the road, thus reduced gridlocks?\n"

        "comment": "I'm extremely grateful for this legislation to come into force. As a life long resident of Toronto I am sick unto death of the corruption of vehicular travel lanes for the sake of cyclists, the majority of whom care not to abide or respect the rules of the road and and thus have been emboldened to continue in the worst kind of behaviour, that which endangers themselves and others both within and without bike lanes present.\nMy only regret is the the legislation does not provide for public education measures being a prerequisite for the introduction of ANY bike lane or bike rental supply program by a municipality. As it stands, there is no ability to vet users to gauge their level of competence to be on public roads as cyclists. I've witnessed too often novice cyclists literally mount a bicycle and wobble away being both a danger to themselves and others with their evident lack of skill.\nI believe that has been by design and clearly stands as proof that the safety of cyclists is no concern to municipalities that crow the virtues of cycling but do absolutely nothing to ensure that is at the core of their programs or even raised in public awareness. More effort and regulation in this area is necessary if ever cycling can be made safer and pleasurable. I myself grew up a cyclist without the benefit of bike lanes and now at the age of 63, I have to wonder why this has been allowed to fester so long before this long overdue legislative move.\nLastly, may I humbly suggest that the province remain vigilant and wary of countermoves by recalcitrant municipalities meant to frustrate the intent of the legislation by perhaps imposing performance measures that ensure no tampering is being done to stall progress to better moving vehicle traffic. The sooner a complete changeover, the better.\n"

I believe the best way to resolving gridlock is to leave the bike lanes where they are, and also leave for the municipal governments to make the decision about them.\nThe provincial government could very well invest more $$ on public transportation, TTC is badly in need of improvement, that will solve our traffic woes. The province has many other areas that need improvement and should take a hands off approach, that is why we elect municipal governments.\nIn recent years we\u2019ve had many clear signs that we need to protect the environment, and this proposal will definitely not be making improvements in that area. Also, the province should be focusing on making decisions about provincial issues and leave the cities to decide on municipal issues.\n"

        "comment": "I am a long-time resident of Toronto and a car driver, a cyclist, a pedestrian and a user of public transit. As a cyclist, I was hit by a car and sustained serious injuries while biking in an UNprotected bike lane. I continue to cycle regularly despite this, so I am particularly concerned about the proposed removal of any protected bike lanes, especially those on major arteries such as Bloor, University and Yonge streets. Research from many jurisdictions, including Toronto, shows that protected bicycle lanes reduce the risk of motor vehicle trauma for pedestrians and cyclists. Bicycle lanes benefit all road users; it is much preferable to prevent motor vehicle trauma than to try to treat it.\nI strongly oppose the recent proposed Ontario legislation, Bill 212, that limits the ability of municipalities and cities to plan transportation networks that benefit ALL users, and to make their roads safer for their citizens. Years of research and planning by the City of Toronto has gone into the construction of bike lanes \u2013 with the end goal of creating coherent and comprehensive networks that encourage and enable more widespread and safer cycling in the city. I personally know of many more people who have started or resumed cycling since the Bloor bike lanes have been installed. The bike share program is exponentially more popular since riders\u2019 safe route options have increased.\nLike many, I too am concerned about traffic congestion, but traffic congestion was a problem well before protected bike lanes came into being, and will continue to be a problem unless all levels of government take a multi-pronged approach to address it. We need MORE tourists and residents cycling, not fewer \u2013 so that there are fewer cars on the roads. We need to encourage car pooling and institute congestion charges \u2013 but  most importantly of all, we need the provincial government to provide significant and ongoing financial support for the operation of public transportation systems in the major municipalities \u2013 not just capital projects. Improving public transportation in Toronto in particular \u2013 making it more reliable, frequent, comprehensive and cheaper \u2013 is what would REALLY make a difference to traffic congestion. This is what all urban planning evidence and experience in many jurisdictions has shown.\nBill 212 is not evidence-based and will not achieve even its stated goals, certainly not in the medium or long terms. It is political whimsy and pandering. As a taxpayer I am appalled at the proposed use of my tax dollars to rip out protected bike lanes which have made streets safer for all. Our tax dollars should be applied towards improving the TTC instead, and drafting legislation which binds the provincial government to properly funding public transit, including the TTC. Now THAT would be a legacy Premier Ford could be proud of.\n"

        "comment": "The existence of bike lanes a key feature of road safety for all users. Separating vehicles and uses that travel at different speeds is common sense. The argument that bike lanes cause congestion is absurd. Congestion is caused by road construction. The city of Toronto's population has increased by 40% in twenty years, and a significant number of this population use cars to get around.  road capacity has not increased by 40%, so it is no wonder we have congestion. The solution is to get people out of cars, onto transit and bikes. That is how you solve congestion.\n"

First and foremost, this will put my 7-year-old daughter, my partner, and me in more danger when we are biking to work, school, errands, and activities. We do not have a car--this is one of the ways we save money in this city where the cost of living is so high. My daughter rides in the seat on the back of my bike, and we use the Bloor Street bike lane near our house regularly. My partner rides his bike to work on the Bloor and University lanes. We deserve to be able to move around the city safely, and the data shows that these lanes have been contributing to lower rates of cyclist injuries. We know there are not good alternative cycling routes to replace these lanes on secondary roads; otherwise, the city would have put the cycling infrastructure on those roads instead.\nI also think removing these lanes is a waste of money. The claim is that this is being done to reduce gridlock, but the data shows that gridlock in Toronto is caused primarily by other things--including, notably, construction. Finally, the impediments contained in this proposal to reducing car lanes in order to build bike lines are an overreach into municipal decision-making. Municipalities know their communities best and should be left to make these kinds of decisions.\nFor these reasons, I oppose this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. This is a prime example of government overreach and irresponsible spending. However, instead of giving a Grade 5 Social Studies lesson on the responsibilities of each level of government, I would like to instead highlight a few reasons\u2013both general and Toronto specific\u2013why existing bike lanes should be protected and new bike lanes encouraged.\nFirstly, bike lanes contribute to the safety of cyclists. To help make this point, I am going to reference a 2017 video from TVO's Political Blind Date of Doug Ford going for a bike ride with Jagmeet Singh. In the video, Ford can be quoted as saying, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s not bike lanes, at least I was. Someone dings you from behind, and we have to do everything we can to make there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many. When it comes to bicycle riders, we have to make sure that they\u2019re safe. I felt so much safer when it was separated.\u201d There have been 6 cyclist deaths in Toronto so far in 2024. If the Government of Ontario wants a say in the bike lanes on municipal roads, and bike lanes are removed from Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, or anywhere else in the City of Toronto, I think it is only fair that the premier of Ontario is present whenever a Ghost Bike memorial is placed to memorialize the preventable death of a cyclist.\nSecondly, many Torontonians are experiencing a cost-of-living crisis, and cycling provides an economical way to travel. For example, the annual membership for Bike Share Toronto starts at only $105, which is less expensive than a monthly TTC pass with the Fair Pass Transit Discount Program starting at $123.25. By comparison, the cost of owning a car in Toronto can be at least 10 times the cost of taking the TTC or 100 times the cost of using Bike Share.\nThirdly, are we not in the middle of an environmental crisis? Reducing motorized transportation and increasing active transportation, such as cycling, reduces the air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Therefore, let\u2019s stop catering to cars\u2013a majority of which are only occupied by one person\u2013and encourage active modes of transportation. It is worth noting that individual actions may have a small impact when considering that a significant amount of global anthropogenic carbon emissions are produced by large corporations. However, while these individual actions\u2013choosing to bike instead of driving\u2013make a difference in an individual\u2019s impact on the environment, individual actions are also key to creating systematic change.\nLastly, active modes of transportation, such as cycling, contribute to increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscle strength, stronger bones, decreased body fat, lower stress levels, and reduced anxiety and depression. If anything, bike lanes and, by extension, encouraging cycling, can be viewed as an investment in the health of Ontarians. Reduced air pollution, one of the environmental benefits of cycling, can also be considered a health benefit.\nIn summary, for the above stated safety, economic, environmental, and health reasons, the Government of Ontario should seriously reconsider Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane. Cars are never stuck in traffic; they are the traffic.\n"

        "comment": "The City\u2019s vision statement establishes that St. Catharines will be a safe, innovative, sustainable, and caring city today and for future generations. Following review of Bill 212, the intention of reducing gridlock to transport people and goods in a more efficient manner is clear, however the approach proposed by the Bill does not align with the City\u2019s vision of a safe and sustainable community. For the City to be able to grow its population, and to meet its sustainability goals, the City must become a model of doing more with less with regards to transportation \u2013 which means using more efficient forms of mobility like walking, cycling and wheeling to expand access across the community. To this end, the City has suggested solutions outlined below to help the Province adopt a low-maintenance plan addressing these goals:\n1. Focus on Provincial guidelines to support local level decisions.\nThe Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) has produced a series of traffic engineering and traffic control reference manuals for use by municipalities in Ontario. The series includes Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM) Book 18 \u2013 Cycling Facilities, which provides practical guidance on the planning, design and operation of cycling facilities in Ontario. It would be helpful if the Province could maintain these existing manuals as a tool to provide guidance to local municipalities on how the Province wants to see bicycle lanes designed and implemented across Ontario. Implementing guidelines while maintaining local municipalities as the authority to create appropriate transportation strategies for their communities will reduce red tape and ensure these decisions can be made in a more efficient, timely manner, and that extensive work already completed or underway does not get undermined. Through maintaining these manuals and guidelines, the Province can look to policies contained in the PPS (2024), #CycleON: Ontario\u2019s Cycling Strategy Action Plan 2.0, and local municipal Official Plans.\nThese policy frameworks emphasize a need for building cities that are transit supportive and facilitate the creation of complete communities. The PPS (2024) provides a definition for transit-supportive development. This requires development that makes transit viable, optimizes investments in transit infrastructure (including bicycle lanes), and improves the quality of the experience of using transit (i.e. a lane dedicated to cycling). It often refers to compact, mixed-use development that has a high level of\nemployment and residential densities, in proximity to transit stations, corridors and associated elements within the transportation system (including bicycle lanes).\n2. Combine bicycle lanes with carpool vehicles such as taxis and buses.\nShould the Province decide to proceed with a framework requiring re-instatement of a vehicular lane removed to facilitate a bicycle lane, the City encourages consideration that the reinstated vehicular lane be dedicated for use by transit and cyclists only. This method will keep cyclists out of roadways used by individual drivers and goods transporters while maintaining a lane for vehicles that encourages group transportation and reduces the number of cars on the road. In addition, keeping cyclists in their own lane has the benefit of minimizing roadway conflicts between vehicles and cyclists. This will help drivers anticipate the location of cyclists, making it easier to spot and avoid them, which reduces the disruptions often seen when cyclists, buses, taxis, and other vehicles share the same road.\nConclusion\nThe Province\u2019s leadership in ensuring guidelines for multi-functional, active transportation lanes are kept up to date, would be instrumental in supporting municipalities as they develop communities that are transit-supportive. Such measures align with broader goals of reducing congestion, promoting safety, and fostering sustainable urban growth.\nThese comments are intended to highlight the importance of maintaining and enhancing bike lanes as essential components of modern transportation systems. A commitment to well-planned, strategically located bike lanes will yield long-term benefits for traffic management, public safety, and community connectivity. Further, the City, not unlike many other municipalities, undertakes significant work to develop policies and strategies at the local level that respond to the needs of the community. Decisions regarding the City\u2019s transportation network, including active transportation, should remain a municipal responsibility, guided by best practices, manuals, and data shared by the Province and subject matter experts.\n"

We want taxpayers to pay $48 million to remove them? Everyone I tell that I ride my bike in Toronto, in the city that I live in commends me for being so brave, because they are terrified of being hit by a car. Drivers are distracted and are frustrated with the gridlock and would be more than willing to blame anyone else than their transportation choices. And who could blame them? The TTC is mocked and say it stands for 'take the car', the city hasn't invested enough in public transit and it's unreliable. But to the point--\nReality check - cars create gridlock. Cars who insist on standing in the intersection bc they they thought they could sneak through the light at the last moment create gridlock. Cars that hit cyclists and close down lanes of traffic create gridlock. Cars who illegal stop on the side of the road cause gridlock. Cars who get pulled over for traffic infractions cause gridlock. Trucks making deliveries and park in the bike lane making everyone divert cause gridlock. Construction like the eglinton and queen lines and streetcar track replacements cause gridlock!\nThis is a ridiculous bill that serves to distract Ontarians of Doug Ford's corruption and is an election tactic. This bill, like many of his, is to tear down progress. People will die from from this bill.\n"
