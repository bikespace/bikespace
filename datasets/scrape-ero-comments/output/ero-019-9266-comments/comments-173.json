        "comment": "As our provincial government acknowledges, connectivity across the province is vital, yet has long been hindered by inadequate development. While expanding traffic lane networks is necessary, it should be viewed as part of a comprehensive transit strategy, not a stand-alone solution.\nThe introduction of bike lanes by repurposing traffic lanes, has been concentrated in urban centers where residents typically travel shorter distances and favor alternatives like cycling and public transit over driving. However, much of the congestion in these areas is caused by commuters from outside the city or those simply passing through.\nWhen more traffic lanes are added, more drivers are attracted, just as the creation of bike lanes invites more cyclists. This phenomenon, known as induced demand, is exemplified by the success of Bike Share Toronto, which continues to set new ridership records each year. Expanding traffic lanes or refusing their repurposing in urban centers would only amplify the congestion in those areas.\nI urge our provincial leaders to focus on addressing provincial concerns, rather than imposing top-down mandates on how municipalities should manage their communities.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the proposal that municipalities be required to seek provincial approval to add bike lanes as it is an overstep of power. Municipalities are and should be responsible for decisions regarding traffic within their own streets.\nI disagree with an exemption to the Environmental Assessment Act. Projects with as large a scope and as much impact on the environment as new highways should be under more obligation to show that they will have limited harm to the lands, resources, and future generations than typical projects, not less. This applies to any and all other exemptions to protection acts or  regulations as well. Projects of this scale should be well planned and consistent with all regulations, not seek to avoid them.\n"

        "comment": "Save lives, not time. Removing bike lanes will just add to traffic, not remove. As a cyclist and driver, I bike so that I take up one less space on the road, reduce CO2 emissions, and easily purchase a pastry from a local store as I bike. Bike lanes provide safety to pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. Instead of being annoyed with a cyclist, we should all learn to slow down  as this would prevent fatal accidents. There have been 6 cyclist deaths in Toronto since January. Bike lanes also give children who are not old enough to drive the freedom to explore their individuality, travel to an after school job, and meet their friends. We must have various methods of transit in this Provence because we are and will continue to grow in population and our infrastructure simply cannot provide car travel for everyone, and nor should it. We must give people the option, safely.\n- Architectural Designer and Urbanist living in Toronto\n"

        "comment": "Data has shown time and time again that focussing on cars is not the solution Toronto public transportation system is a complete failure thanks to the Ford government and past government that didn\u2019t put public transportation at the forefront of their priorities. Data shows that traffic is caused by focussing on individual transportation yet the Ford government foolishly thinks that the removal of bike lanes will help the downtown traffic situation, which is absolutely wrong and divert the conversation. Instead, the conversation should be about how can we manage to move more people in less time? How can we make sure that people can bike or walk or transit safely from point a to point B. The Ford government is inept at reading the science and the data that made some of the biggest cities in the world, economic forces. The Ford government keeps forgetting that a metropolis isn\u2019t built for the suburbs, but a city should be built for the people that lives in the city.\n"

Nor should they waste millions of dollars ripping up existing infrastructure.\nI had to drive for months along Bloor- and the problem is never the cyclists. It\u2019s the damn drivers who think they can stop anywhere they want for pick ups and drop offs.\nI never ride a bike in the city of Toronto. I am a paramedic and am always driving the city- we need more bike lanes. Not less.\n"

I've driven Bloor st. and University a lot both before and after the bike lanes were put in and aside from a few lost parking spots, I don't notice any major difference in the travel time and I feel much safer when the cyclists are in their own lane.  What we need is an education campaign so both drivers and cyclists fully understand when  they each have the right of way. Do not go backwards, it wasn't better and it certainly wasn't safer for anyone.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is idiotic. They do not take up much space and do not contribute to congestion. This policy is making Ontario a laughing stock. Plus, the money spent on removing existing infrastructure could be better spent elsewhere or even on other road/infrastructure projects. Leave the bike lanes alone, just because cyclists are currently a minority of commuters, the infrastructure should still be there as that minority continues to grow. This is moronic, counter-productive, expensive and backwards. It's embarrassing being an Ontarian some times due to policies and proposals like these.\n"

Therefore, adding the need to receive an approval to add a bike lane would only serve to increase gridlock in the long term, reducing the quality of life of residents.\nI am already considering leaving this city due to the frustrating amount of time wasted in traffic. If biking was more accessible, I would consider staying as it would present me with a faster and healthier alternative.\n"

They not only promote a more sustainable way to get around but also encourage people to ditch their cars, helping to reduce traffic and lower emissions. The key is that bikes are a more efficient means of transportation than cars, and many people feel unsafe biking with cars, so we really need more bike lanes!\n"

We are in a climate crisis and our province needs to help its people reduce its carbon emissions and this means giving people transportation options including biking and public transit. We need to get cars off the road and encourage people to walk, bike, take public transit.\nI also encourage the government to look at evidence instead of anecdotes about traffic congestion on roads with bike lanes. Everything that I\u2019ve heard points to bike lanes having no negative effect on congestion.\nWe are in a climate crisis, the province needs to act like it. For the sake of future generations.

        "comment": "I am NOT in favour of this proposal. Why is this government obsessed with prioritizing drivers over all other modes of transportation??? It makes no sense! Municipalities know their communities best when it comes to space allocation on their roadways, including arterial roads. It would be a slap in the face to local communities if you came in and ripped up existing bike lanes in Toronto, or any other municipality. The amount of careful planning, hundreds of hours of consultation with local communities that went into each project.... All for the province to just come in and say \"we know better, a bike lane is not appropriate on this street\". That is absolutely ridiculous!! This proposal will only force more people to choose to drive or take an Uber which of course will only make traffic WORSE!! I am a driver and a vehicle owner. I am also a cyclist. This proposal is one of the worst ideas to come out of this government. Also I am NOT in favour of your plan to build more highways. In this age of climate change, a new highway is the last thing we need in Ontario. We need to protect the environment and wildlife as a top priority, well above the needs of drivers to save a few minutes on their commute time.\nFocus on provincial responsibilities like making sure Ontarians have access to family doctors.\n"
