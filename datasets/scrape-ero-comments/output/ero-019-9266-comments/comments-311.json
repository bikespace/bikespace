        "comment": "\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

People are not just cycling for pleasure, they are trying to get to work or get their kids to school just like the drivers are. Removing bike lanes from major arterial routes massively inconveniences hardworking people by making their commute take twice as long on detours and windy side routes.\n"

Removing existing lanes is a ridiculous waste of funds and will not fix the traffic issues -- it will just make our commute unsafe, and add another car to the traffic since I'm not going to risk their lives. We need MORE bike lanes in this city, not less!\n"

        "comment": "Safe bike lanes are an essential part of any city. The existing bike lanes have reduced cyclist fatality and made biking for myself and my family a safe and reliable option of transportation. We do not own a car and we chose to live in a part of the city with ample bike lanes so as to make our commute to school and work enjoyable, safe and environmentally friendly. We bike all year round, as long as the lanes are clear of ice. Saving 2-3 mins of transit for a driver at the cost of all of the above is unacceptable. We cannot put this ahead of safety. We must continue to do more to promote environmentally friendly, safe transit and continue to advocate for the safety of vulnerable commuters.\n"

Furthermore, ample data, which the province chooses to ridicule and ignore, prove that the disruption to drive times caused by adding bike lanes is minimal, while other advantages (reduced noise and air pollution, safer cyclists, healthier commutes, safe spaces for kids and those without cars) are numerous and obvious. Removing bike lanes is a terrible step backward for our city.\n"

With very little bike traffic using these lanes.\nI don't know who had decided this was a good idea but happy that the ontario government is stepping in to keep the city accountable not just bike lobbyists.\nNext, please look at high park and the lack of accessibility caused by limiting car access and removing parking spots\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019ve lived by Bloor and Ossington before and after the addition of Bike lanes. This bill is very concerning to me. The car lane that was removed was never a through traffic lane. It was always blocked by parked cars. The bike lane that was added made travel to local businesses and nearby friends much faster and safer. The parts without the bike lanes at the time were scary and dangerous. I was lucky to have never have been hit but my brother has been doored and a co-worker has been in the hospital from being hit by a truck. When other modern cities are adding alternative modes of transport this just seems backward thinking. Toronto does not need more cars. We need better transit and construction planning. Focus on the real issues please.\n"

        "comment": "There is no basis to remove bike lanes. Separating a 25-30 km/h bikes/escooters from 40km/h traffic isn\u2019t just safer, it\u2019s common sense.\nThe biggest traffic issue on University has nothing to do with bikes, but a traffic programming issue that causes backup on cars turning on Elm.\nOn Yonge and Bloor, its delivery drivers, Uber/taxi, and construction that causes most of the delays.\nRemoving four cars with four bikes is like carpooling four people in one car. It is a matter of geometry, and cars are the least geometrically efficient use of space in an urban centre.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing the infrastructure for bikes would be a big mistake in my opinion. Motor vehicles take too much space on the road, require mass amounts of space for parking and are incredibly polluting when driven in the city where there is more stopping than moving happening, Human powered and public transport should be the only means of transportation that we should be encouraging in dense areas. What research has the Government done to support these decisions being proposed?\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am posting this in overwhelming support of keeping the existing bikelanes along Bloor, university, and college. As someone who lives on Bloor Street I have directly seen the improvement that the bike lane installation has caused in my intersection of Bloor/Islington. There should also be an expansion of bikelanes within Toronto. Any other solution is an extremely bad decision from a government known to make such decisions. Bike lanes increase rider safety, without separate lanes cars kill pedestrians and bikers at a much higher rate. They increase the number of people going to business along the roads with bike lanes, they move more people than just roads.\nIf you actually wanted to make more lanes you wouldn't allow street parking on those roads. Bloor has street parking that takes up an entire lane. This seems like a vendetta project from the premier against the city who doesn't want him as their mayor.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be a counterproductive step that could ultimately reduce traffic flow and negatively impact the city\u2019s livability and accessibility. Bike lanes serve as a dedicated, safe space for cyclists, allowing them to avoid the main flow of vehicle traffic. Without these lanes, cyclists are forced to share roads with cars, buses, and trucks, slowing down vehicular traffic and increasing the likelihood of accidents.\nResearch shows that cities with extensive bike lane networks tend to see reduced overall congestion because bike lanes encourage people to commute by bike rather than by car, especially for shorter trips. Every cyclist on the road represents one less car contributing to traffic jams and emissions. Furthermore, well-designed bike lanes often improve traffic predictability, making travel safer and more efficient for everyone. Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be a step backward in fostering an efficient, multimodal transportation system that supports the city\u2019s growing population and urban density.\n"

We need to invest in alternatives to car traffic like cycling and public transit. Cars are the worst mode of transportation for the environment so why are we even considering trying to add more of them?\n"
