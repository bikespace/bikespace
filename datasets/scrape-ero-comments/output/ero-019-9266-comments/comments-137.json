Please do not remove the bike lanes just because truck drivers from the 905 are afraid of the big bad city.\nRemoving the bike lanes will slow down traffic - the cyclists aren't going anywhere, now well just be forced to take up the entire lane of traffic.\nWant to improve traffic? Encourage more people to take transit, carpool, and yes - ride bikes!\n"

        "comment": "this is stupid. absolutely asinine. the ONLY way to reduce congestion on roads is to give drivers good alternatives, such as public transit or biking. it's been proven time and time and time and time again that adding more lanes to roads only worsens traffic, it never improves traffic. removing bike lanes only worsens traffic for everyone. 2 examples of how: 1) it makes it more dangerous for bikers as now they are coming in close contact with cars, and 2) you will now have cars stuck behind bikers as they now integrate with traffic. more lanes doesn't fix a damn thing.\nalso Ontario does NOT NEED another highway. especially one that is going to ruin our environment! and knock it off with trying to remove environmental assessments for construction just to get this stupid highway built. no one wants this highway. again make alternatives to driving easier and cost effective over driving and you'll reduce the number of cars on the highway and thus, get this, reduce traffic!\nif your actual goal was to reduce traffic then you would absolutely know these things, but it's not. and therefore you have to try and bully your way with time wasting bills like this. stop wasting everyone's time and money and actually focus on things we need and actually want like our public healthcare (not private), education, affordable housing (not stupid condos), food prices, and education.\n\"Just one more lane bro, I swear just one more lane!\"\n"

        "comment": "I think this is a fantastic bill to prevent councillors with a cycling hobby from removing infrastructure that is  well used year round and replacing it with infrastructure that is sparsely used for at most 8 months of the year.  I live in Waterloo Ontario and have seen the city add an extra lane to King St in each direction then almost immediately remove the extra lanes in favour of bike lanes. These bike lanes are everything the cycling lobbyists ask for: separated, raised, and protected by cars parked on the street. Despite that, the digital bicycle counter shows that the lanes receive an average of only 150 cyclists per day. If one were to count the cars using this stretch, you\u2019d likely see more than 150 in 30 minutes. Drivers avoid this area now as well; traffic comes to a complete halt when a vehicle tries to turn left across traffic or right across a busy pedestrian crossing due to having only 1 lane in each direction.  If the second lane were restored and traffic could flow normally, you\u2019d most likely see 150 cars every 10 minutes.\n"

Adding more cars into the equation does not decrease gridlock, it increases it. There is more than enough data to show that adding more lanes of traffic never reduces traffic congestion in the long term.  The only real solution is to promote and enhance alternatives to car.  Public transit that functions properly and bicycle lanes and other modes of active transit will reduce cars.  That is a more viable path to ease of movement than prioritizing the automobile.\nBuilding cities for cars and traffic results in lots of cars and lots of traffic.\nBuilding cities for people and places results in a vibrant and and more livable cities.\n"

We have one car and cannot afford two \u2014 we solve this by each cycling in to work most days, which also serves as our \u201cgym\u201d time since we have barely any free time and could not otherwise get in enough exercise.\nI\u2019m one of many people in Ottawa that can say this based on our last transportation survey \u2014 where cycling was by far the fastest-growing mode of transportation in 2022 https://engage.ottawa.ca/11511/widgets/45934/documents/132565\nConservatives like the PC government claim to care about affordability challenges for young working people, but when we make things work by cutting down on the most expensive asset and liability people have (automobiles) Doug Ford and his conservative base that skews older do everything in their power to stop us. It\u2019s vile hypocrisy and I will be calling it out. I\u2019ve never campaigned for a political party but this has inspired me to do so in the next provincial election.\nCare about traffic congestion? Cut down on street parking for busy streets, as even one person parking there can eliminate a full lane of traffic. Invest in public transit. Make the bike lane networks more connected, as this is the needed tipping point for induced demand. Let the cities work with their data to do things that make sense. Personally, I have never seen O\u2019Connor traffic at a standstill before or after the bike lane addition. It\u2019s always moving. I\u2019m willing to bet that I\u2019ve been there a lot more than Doug Ford, and I\u2019m even more willing to bet that my city is working with a lot more relevant data on this than this legislation is based off of.\nLet municipalities make the decisions on roads that they fund.\n"

You don't see bike traffic as cyclists rarely impede each other and therefore get to their destination quicker (shorter destinations of course).\n2. Dedicated bike lanes are required to reduce traffic as it reduces the number of cars on the road. The \"dedicated\" part is important for cyclists to feel safe.

The only sustainable solution to reduce traffic is MORE bike lanes and transit lines that reach more and further areas. Not to mention, this is also better for the environment.\nBikers are treated as villains by cars, but how many times has a biker ever killed someone in a car? Never. How many times has someone in a car killed a biker? Many.\nI've had many friends with cars who drive because they are TOO SCARED TO BIKE in the city. After convincing, those friends now bike in Toronto (reducing traffic) but ONLY where there are BIKE LANES.\nBike lanes save lives and reduce traffic.\nIf you want more car lanes, remove the parking on major streets and add more underground parking.\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\n"
