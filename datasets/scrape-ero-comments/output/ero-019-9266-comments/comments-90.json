        "comment": "What is the true purpose of this bill? The beginning of the proposal discusses:\n- gridlock in urban cores\n- congestion on controlled access highways\n- the construction of new controlled access highways\n- rural internet access\nNone of these points are related to the proposal details about bike lanes, so why are they included? This information is irrelevant and confusing to citizens trying to read and understand the proposed bill and should be removed!\nBicycles do not cause gridlock. Dedicated bicycle lanes that cars and trucks should not be driving in are not the cause of gridlock. I have never seen a study, report or news article that shows gridlock caused by a bicycle lane or cyclists using a bicycle lane, and the proposal does not cite any research or study to support the initiative to reduce bike lanes.\nBy contrast, numerous studies have shown that adding more lanes for cars increases traffic congestion with the observation of induced demand. If the intent is to keep more space for motorized vehicles, the execution of this proposal is incredibly flawed for another reason: bicycles are legally entitled to use roadways (aside from controlled-access highways). However, doing so increases risk of fatal accidents, typically for the cyclist. Increased accidents between cyclists and motor vehicles put more financial burdens on the province with healthcare and police forces, and accidents also cause traffic delays.\nRequiring municipalities to submit applications for bike lanes will only increase workloads for administration and delay construction projects even further as cities and the province communicate and go over paperwork to decide if a bike lane is appropriate. What would happen in the event that the Minister decides a bike lane should be removed? Whose budget is being used to remove the bike lane and reinstate vehicle access? Deconstructing bike lanes would add even more congestion and gridlock because road construction causes delays.\nOntario needs to diversify its transportation options. We need more accessible public transit within a city and between major cities along major corridors, like Windsor-Ottawa. We need walkable neighbourhoods so people don't need to rely on a car to get one or two kilometres from home. We need bike paths and bike lanes to allow people to participate in active transportation, which improves their health and reduces emissions from motorized vehicles. We need more variation and fewer car-dependent systems in order to benefit more Ontarians.\nDo not penalize cyclists trying to benefit their physical health and the environment by insinuating that they are the cause of vehicle traffic.\n"

The lanes have improved accessibility for people like myself and for people who care about the environment or simply cannot afford to run a car.\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely not, utterly ridiculous. This bill goes against everything that needs to happen in Toronto to make the city more livable - a reduction in parking allocation, addition of pedestrian-centric transportation modes, and a reduction in the CO2 emissions for cleaner air. There's no need for cars to be the dominate mode of transportation when they take 3x as long to get to a destination 10 blocks away. The fact that this was even put forward is disheartening, as it puts on display the utter disconnect at Queen's Park from the regular populace.\n"

I have personally driven through Bloor W and Yonge where there are bike lanes and they are wonderful additions.  Not only have they beautified our ugly streetscapes, they eliminate conflict with vehicles and if you remove bike lanes the cyclists will have to share road space with cars creating way more havoc.  The way forward is to continue to create MORE bike lanes on all major thoroughfares.  By creating more options for alternative travel options like bike lanes and transit we actually make it easier for private vehicular traffic.   What\u2019s next?

        "comment": "Cities are far better placed than the province to determine local issues. Centralizing this power in the province will only lead to more red tape and delays in cities being able to react to their citizens. Bike lanes save lives and allow more people to get to their destinations quicker. Car dependency has demonstrably failed Ontarians. With time stuck in traffic increasing, why are we pushing the same solutions that already failed? Canada is one of the most car centric countries in the world and we pay for it by sitting in traffic. One more lane was the mantra of the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s, 00\u2019s, 10\u2019s and now we have the worst traffic in the world, so at what point do we admit it was a failure?\nAccording to a cycle Toronto study, 70% of Torontonians cycle at least occasionally. With the healthcare crisis worsening, isn\u2019t more people being healthy and in shape a positive? Removing bike lanes will worsen the healthcare crisis. In many of the downtown areas, more than 30% of workers commute by bike, removing/restricting bike lanes puts these people in harm\u2019s way, creates more conflict between drivers and cyclists and as a result will create more traffic. It also has the potential to force this group of people to drive, meaning you will increase traffic even more in the most concentrated areas of Toronto. With most of the downtown cycling to commute, having even 2% of the GTA bike means more than one hundred thousand people now having to drive or simply take a lane on their bikes. This is simply bad policy.\n"

However, research shows that building new highways doesn't reduce congestion in the long term.\nExempting Highway 413 from full environmental assessments is a major concern. This highway would cross prime farmland, wetlands, and wildlife corridors in Ontario\u2019s Greenbelt, creating long-term damage. Limiting transparency by withholding environmental impact information further undermines trust in this process. The province should not force this project through by keeping the public in the dark.\nSchedule 4: Highway Traffic Act unnecessarily restricts municipalities (namely Toronto) from building new bike lanes, favouring cars over sustainable transportation alternatives. It\u2019s based on the misguided notion that bike lanes cause congestion, despite evidence showing the opposite. By making it harder to install new lanes, the bill limits efforts to reduce emissions and promote safer, greener cities. Local governments should have the freedom to improve transportation infrastructure without bureaucratic hurdles and provincial interference.\n"

These like lanes are hardly used especially in the long winter months.\nIn addition to these changes, I also want more laws bikers need to abide by. Such as insurance to be on the road, no lane cutting, and subject to all rules that drivers must follow while on the road.\nBikes on the road is unsafe because bikers make it unsafe for themselves. They behave as if they have the right of way because there are no repercussions to their bad behaviour. In what world is it acceptable for a biker to blow past a vehicle in the same lane that is turning right in front of them and then blame the driver if they get injured.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic congestion is a huge problem in every major city across Ontario. Particularly in Toronto, with the 401 holding the record of busiest highway in North America, moving 450,000 people a day (beating Orange County, California at just 300,000 people/day). The only way to reduce this huge amount of traffic is not to build more lanes, but to instead take people who would rather not drive off the road.\nMany people are stuck in cars because it is the only fast and safe way to get around the city. Providing bike lanes to those who would rather bike than drive takes them off the road and puts them in a safe and dedicated lane, rather than clogging up the roads with their own vehicle, or even worse, having a bike in the car lane slowing everyone down. Most people don't bike right now because they don't feel safe, as cars are going much faster and are a lot heavier, meaning that in a split second you can be killed as a cyclist on the road. Moving people into dedicated, separated, and protected lanes allows cars to drive at higher speeds without needing to worry about killing bicyclists.\nSome may say that because a lane is lost, the traffic will get worse. However, often times, that is only true if you use it in unproductive ways, such as street parking. Street parking removes space from any form of transport, so the number of people who can travel the corridor is limited. If you instead swap a car lane for a bike lane, those that must drive (i.e. are from very far, elderly, physically disabled) will keep driving, but those that were too nervous to bike in the car lane and don't need to drive (i.e. shorter trips, e-bikes/delivery services, those who want to) are now are no longer driving, but biking. Biking is a much more efficient form of transportation, in that for a given road width of 3.5 metres, 19,000 people can move through it on bikes, while only 2,000 can move through it in cars, a 9.5x increase in transportation throughput.\nThis effect only gets stronger the more bike lanes there are. You can't plop a bike lane on a random street and expect immediate adoption of bikes, just like you can't pave a road in the middle of the tundra and wonder where all the drivers are. Bike lanes need to be connected, and the most integral component of this are main arterials that go across the city, such as Bloor Street. These connect to smaller bike lanes across the city, creating a network. For the vast majority of cyclists, even a single point where a cyclist is dumped onto the road along with cars will result in that person instead taking their car. Bike lanes that are not connected properly or adequately will therefore result in severe underuse. Removing these arterial lanes will make neuter the bike network and adoption of bikes as a form of transport, thereby significantly increasing traffic as the only viable alternative is to drive.\nIf you care about reducing traffic, getting people off the roads and into bicycles in their own lanes is the most effective way. This lets those who want to or need to drive actually get to where they are going in a reasonable time, rather than being hindered by a slow cyclist on the road, or much more likely, slowed down by a bunch of drivers who much rather be biking in the first place.\n"
