        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  I do not support this bill, and I think it would result in more traffic in our cities, increases in fatal accidents for cyclists, pedestrians and all the other modes of transportation that use bike lanes (e.g. scooters), including people in wheelchairs.  Improving cycling infrastructure helps prepare cities for the future, and is a smart choice for reducing air pollution in our cities, getting people to be more active and healthier, and reducing noise in the downtown areas.  Many european cities have embraced cycling infrastructure (e.g. Amsterdam, Copenhagen) and improved public transit systems, along with a system of bike lanes will contribute to helping people move around downtown quicker.  With all the new e-bike and e-scooters on the market, creating the separate lanes makes cities safer.  Climate change is extending the period of time people can use bikes and scooters (warmer temperatures in November, and earlier springs), so enhancing opportunities for people to commute safely using these bike lands results in less car traffic, which in turn contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars.  Removing the bike lanes would be a step back for Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of road infrastructure and I do NOT support the government\u2019s plan to remove them.  As a motorist in Toronto near Bloor West, I feel safer driving on roads where bikes are in protected lanes. I do not see that the installation of bike lanes have slowed traffic on Bloor since the lane was previously used for street parking in many sections and traffic was already reduced to a single lane.  There are no comparable side routes for cyclists routes that will cover the same distances.  This means cyclists will now be less safe on our roads.  Alternatively, cyclists will have to take public transit - which is already over crowded - or drive thus exasperating the gridlock problem.  Cities need safe and convenient cycling infrastructure as a healthy, environmentally friendly, future forward transportation option.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes have ruined the joy of going out for seniors and disabled people. It is impossible to park and if you find a parking lot you have to usually have to walk a long distance - difficult for elderly and disabled. It\u2019s impossible to be dropped off close to where you\u2019re going as bike lanes make it impossible for a car to pull over.  I am 81 and have a problem walking. My days are almost always spent at home now. Why has no one mentioned that it is so difficult for seniors and disabled to enjoy life going to places? It is so selfish of the mayor to think that because she likes biking it\u2019s best for everyone. I can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s stupidity or selfishness. She and the Council have ruined my life in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "All the cars parked on the street block the flow of traffic far more than bike lanes. On streets without bike lanes cyclists just bike in that space next to parked cars which is essentially the same as a bike lane but less safe. There are never really two lanes to drive in since the outside lane is basically full of parked cars anyway. Pulling out existing bike lanes is a waste of money and just more road construction to deal with. As someone who has been both a driver and cyclist in Toronto, I think separated bike lanes make roads safer for everyone. I personally like knowing where to expect cyclists to be when I\u2019m driving, there are fewer surprises when you know they are in a designated bike lane. The only reason I starting driving again was because I commute to Scarborough and it would take 2-3 times as long to get there on TTC. Don\u2019t waste resources on ripping up bike lanes, invest it in expanding public transit so we can have fewer cars on the road. More efficient and expansive public transit is the only long term solution.\n"

True and full environmental assessments are a crucial part of our care, and the process proposed in Schedule 3 transparently dishonours our obligations to our children for reasons of bald political expediency.\n"

Emergency vehicles cannot travel in good time due to traffic congestion.  There is greater air and noise pollution due to traffic constantly jammed. More care try to cut through our street to try to avoid traffic line up\u2019s. I walk along Yonge Street and pay attention to the usage of bike lanes . There areVERY few ( like maybe 2 cyclists)  during rush hours. Mostly food delivery motorized bikes use them. You should at least be charging them a usage fee since it\u2019s their group that are wrecklrssly on the road. Don\u2019t forget the poor use and enforcement of rules of the road by cyclists- thru stoplights, no slowing at intersections, no lights or signalling. I always fear that I will hurt or kill one of them\nI SUPPORT REMOVAL OFBIKE LANES\n"

        "comment": "I am an avid cyclist who survived an accident 16 years ago while riding on a main road without designated bike lanes. Removing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue would erase intentional infrastructure that has made Toronto streets safer for cyclists.\nCentralizing the approval process and requiring provincial oversight for bike lanes diminishes municipalities\u2019 ability to respond to their unique needs, thus undermining local decision-making. Local governments are best positioned to evaluate their urban infrastructure and have consistently supported cycling networks as part of a greener future.\nThe proposed exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act is alarming and ignores the pressing need to address climate change and the role that active transportation plays in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ontario should be leading in building climate-resilient, people-focused cities, not dismantling essential infrastructure that aligns with these goals.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes are badly imagined and implemented, they cause more gridlock, increased travel times, more idling and air pollution, more cars on side streets trying to find a faster route, and very unsafe for emergency vehicles. Not to mention, not enough people use these bike lanes to justify them taking away 2 lanes of car traffic, in winter or in summer. This is not why I pay taxes. Get em outta here!\nP.S. you want to spend money on infrastructure, maybe start by improving public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly support the removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These corridors are critical for high volumes of vehicular traffic, including transit vehicles, emergency services, and goods transportation. Returning these bike lanes to vehicular lanes will alleviate congestion, improve traffic flow, and enhance accessibility for all road users.\nIn addition, I propose extending the scope of the bill to include the removal of bike lanes on Richmond Street and Adelaide Street. These routes serve as vital east-west arteries in Toronto\u2019s downtown core, carrying significant vehicular and commercial traffic. The reduction of vehicle lanes on these streets has created bottlenecks, especially during peak hours, impacting commute times and the efficiency of goods movement.\nWhile bike lanes are important, they must be strategically placed to balance the needs of all road users. Prioritizing corridors with lower traffic volumes or alternative routes for cyclists would ensure that Toronto\u2019s road network operates effectively, reducing gridlock and supporting economic activity.\n"

        "comment": "Excessive and poorly planned bike lanes, that remove a vehicular lane on busy roads; have created excessive congestion and slow traffic. Travelling on Avenue Road has become frustrating and slow. The lanes are used by 1% of commuters, and during nice weather. I live in midtown and avoid downtown, Yonge street and it seems more and more areas of the city. Eglinton is becoming increasingly impassable.\nToronto has become difficult to happily live in. I feel frustrated and angry and \u201cuse\u201d the city less and less. I am supportive of changes that oversee mindless attempts at social engineering. The bike lanes on Avenue were unnecessary, wasteful and in my view do not reflect the wishes of the large majority\n"

        "comment": "Despite the name of the recent Bill 212 \u2013 \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d, there is disappointingly little in it that will actually contribute to relieving congestion. At the same time, it is introducing needless red tape, the sort of thing this government had previously expressed a very welcome commitment to reducing.\nThe portions of this bill related to cycling introduce brand new red tape where previously there was none. The transportation plans that the government has published provided a compelling vision for a multimodal approach to transportation across the province, including cycling. This bill will now make it more difficult and costly for municipalities to implement the plans, especially as there\u2019s no clear guidance or direction on the sorts of projects that will be deemed acceptable. The province could easily have taken an alternative approach of developing and implementing design standards that would help achieve your goals. Rather than just targeting Toronto, this would have helped any municipality in the province to build their communities in smart, effective ways.\nI\u2019m sure by now you\u2019ve already been inundated with correspondence extolling the virtues of cycling and the importance of dedicated, protected lanes from a safety perspective, so I won\u2019t go into any of that here. Instead, I want to highlight how the focus on preserving \u201cmarked lanes available for travel by motor vehicle traffic\u201d and focusing on things that might \u201cunduly diminish the movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d misses the mark in terms of actually addressing the causes of urban congestion.\nA fact that is not widely recognized, even within North American transportation planning circles, is that it\u2019s not the number of lanes that limits the capacity of urban road networks. It\u2019s actually the number and design of intersections that\u2019s grinding traffic to a stand still in our cities. There\u2019s an excellent YouTube video that explains this in more detail if you\u2019re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqOxBZJ6c1g\nIf the province is going to insert itself into the minutia of urban traffic design, there is a huge opportunity here to further build on the transportation plans for Ontario that were previously released. The introduction of Transit Oriented Communities and the long overdue funding for higher order transit in the province was a great first step towards more livable cities. These initiatives will be successful because they will get cars off the road. These could be complemented with other initiatives that will help move more people along our urban rights of way, instead of just drivers:\n- Better identification of what constitutes primary or secondary routes would allow for the designs of both to be better optimized. Added to this, a recognition that urban and rural road networks operate very differently would help move away from everything just being considered a \u201chighway\u201d.\n- Changes to the building code could require that developments properly accommodate pick-ups, drop-offs and deliveries to reflect the shift towards rideshare and e-commerce we\u2019ve seen in recent years. This would help free up valuable road space.\n- Higher standards for parking operators that support dynamic space booking or require them to indicate lot capacities or at the very least when a lot is full would reduce the huge amount of traffic caused when people just circulate looking for somewhere to park.\n- Broader use of Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies would also help manage the nature of traffic in the region, which would allow for better use of any existing or new infrastructure.\nBeyond the problems we see every day with congestion, the current philosophy towards road design in cities is resulting in urban roads that are significantly overbuilt in a way that traffic can't take advantage of anyway. The wasteful use of asphalt and pavement comes with massive environmental impacts and is resulting in significant costs for municipalities as they build and then try to maintain their infrastructure. This in turn leaves them starved for funds to operate or expand their road networks.\nIf the province could provide better guidance to municipalities to make sure that roads are right-sized for the traffic flowing through them, relative to what the intersections can actually accommodate, this would reduce costs and increase safety while also helping to fight congestion. It will be important, however, that this guidance is not developed in isolation by the province as many of the urban traffic experts are in our municipalities across the province. This is the sort of bold action I would like to see from the provincial government, rather than more bad legislation and red tape wasting the legislature\u2019s time and resources.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely against taking away bike lanes. First of all, bike lanes should be a municipal issue, not something decided by the provincial government. Each municipality knows their roads best and bike lanes best and they should be the ones deciding whether a bike lane should be built or not. The provincial government is just trying to add more red tape for people to pass through. Second, the prioritization of cars over more sustainable forms of transportation is terrible. As a young person in this province, it is absolutely abhorrent that the government is prioritizing cars rather than lifting up the more sustainable forms of transportation like bikes. It is proven with cities like Amsterdam that if you put the money into better infrastructure for people biking, that more people will bike places. Currently, my main reason not to bike, is the lack of safe bike lanes for me to do so. I absolutely oppose this bill.\n"

With the beautiful centre medium planters, emergency vehicles can\u2019t get through. When there\u2019s a problem on the subway and busses must take over, it\u2019s a hopeless endeavor. Meanwhile we live in a climate that is not conducive to cycling most of the year. Many people like me can\u2019t cycle. Why can\u2019t we improve the TTC? The bloor line is the best people mover in all weather. No one from out here commutes to work downtown via Bloor, bike lane or not. They take side streets and the Martin Goodman trail.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Minister Sarkaria,\nShare the Road Cycling Coalition (The Coalition) is a charitable organization who works in partnership with municipal, provincial, and federal governments, the business community, road safety organizations and other non-profits. Together with its partners, Share the Road strives to enhance access for bicyclists on roads and trails, improve safety for all bicyclists, and educate citizens on the value and importance of safe bicycling for healthy lifestyles and healthy communities.\nThe Coalition wishes to express deep concerns related to the recently tabled Bill 212, \u201cReducing Gridlock Saving You Time Act\u201d.\nThe scope of the legislation extends province-wide and the risks include the politicization and polarization of bike lanes which is something that we at the Share the Road Cycling Coalition (The Coalition) have worked very hard to prevent since our inception in 2007. Bill 212 risks undermining close to two decades of hard-won progress that The Coalition has worked with several partners to achieve.\nOf particular note, Bill 212 restricts where new bike lanes can be built with the Premier stating that existing bike lanes will be removed from some streets before studies are completed. As well, existing bike lanes (where the removal of a lane of traffic took place) could also be under review, with the possibility of bike lanes being removed to return lanes to motor vehicle traffic.\nFurther, data cited on cycling mode share in Toronto (1.2%) is incorrect. In fact, recent studies have shown that Toronto has an average mode share of 7-9%, particularly in the core of the city in proximity of the three bike lane corridors highlighted by the province (Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue).\nIn addition to this data, last year The Coalition polled Ontarians about their cycling use show that 68 percent of Ontarians (9.8 million people) ride their bike at least monthly.  Of those, 22 per cent of Ontarians (3.2 million) say they ride a bike frequently (daily or almost daily) and an additional 46 per cent report riding occasionally - weekly or monthly.\nOntarians are both cyclists and drivers: 87 per cent of Ontario\u2019s 3.2 million frequent cyclists say they also drive frequently, while 85 per cent of Ontario\u2019s 9.8 million occasional cyclists say this is the case. Our polling data also show that there is demand for cycling in Ontario: A majority (51 per cent) want to cycle more often with 70 percent of regular cyclists and 58 percent of occasional cyclists, indicating this preference.\nThere is strong support for action from the provincial government on cycling: 66 per cent of Ontarians believe that their government should allocate funds towards cycling infrastructure in order to make cycling a safer and more convenient mode of transportation. As well, 65 per cent of respondents felt that such investments would benefit cyclists and motorists.\nThis new omnibus highway Bill will fast-track the construction of Highway 413 by exempting provincial environmental assessments. Environmental assessments are critical to understanding the likely effects on the environment, and helping to avoid, reduce or offset negative effects. Reducing environmental risks protects the health of Ontarians, improves decision making processes, and ensures that construction projects are in the public interest.\nProvincial support for bike lanes is important now more than ever to save lives, enhance livability, and reduce congestion.\nThank you for this opportunity to speak up on Bill 212.\nYours in safe cycling,\nThe Share the Road Cycling Coalition\n"
