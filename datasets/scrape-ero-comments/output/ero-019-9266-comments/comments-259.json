        "comment": "Please do not go forward with this proposal. I am both a motorist and a cyclist and this makes no sense. I live just off a busy street(Montreal Rd) that recently had a lane removed to install bike lanes and it has not made any difference to traffic. Which is backed up by a large number of studies across the world. I now bike for about 80% of my commuting needs all year round (which means one less car clogging up roads). It does, however, give me a safe space to cycle in without worrying about being killed by one of the many impatient, aggressive, or distracted driver's out there. People will die without safe cycling lanes, that is a fact. There is room for all of us out there - cars, busses, pedestrians, and yes, cyclists. We all must share the road. I am also a paramedic of 16 years, so for those that are saying it slows emergency vehicles down let me assure you - it does not. I have never once found them to be an issue. As the chiefs of several emergency services have said publicly as well. I have picked up the bodies of dead young people hit by cars though.\n"

        "comment": "When will Mr Ford realize that he is on the wrong side of history?\nBike lanes in urban settings are positive additions for everyone. Merchants. Commuters. Breathers of Air, all are beneficiaries of Bike Lanes.  Municipalities are infinitely better judges of their own commuting infrastructure needs than a top down, one size fits all approach.  I have seen the numbers of cyclists on Toronto's streets explode over the course of my career, in large part because bike lanes have made it safer for people to get around without burning gas. Is it possible for Mister Ford to govern this province without engaging in divisive, retrograde posturing?\nThe 413 and  401 GTA mega tunnel are both idiotic proposals. Urban planners are all predicting, based on every example that history has provided thus far, the new roads will be crammed with vehicles shortly after completion.  More congestion, more pollutants, more frustrated voters.\nOur premier's proposals on transit will move us backwards in terms of urban development, generate even bigger environmental problems for the future, and push provincial debt to even less manageable levels.\nCan Mr. Ford not reflect on his terribly overbudget and overdue Provincial responsibility for the Eglinton LRT line?   How does his ongoing mismanagement of that project qualify him to be a credible voice on any other transit issue?\nJust for perspective on the current premier's modus operandi:   His  upcoming two hundred dollar bribes for billionaires and the destitute alike may be many things, but one of them we know for certain, because, math, is that his \"free cash\" scheme will result in $140 million dollar annual interest bill, in perpetuity.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford has been waging war against climate action since he took office. He has worked to weaken conservation authorities, dismantle the Greenbelt, forcing the closure of the Ontario Science Centre despite donation offers from wealthy Ontarians, and now he has found his latest adversary, bike lanes. This government wants to restrict the ability of municipalities to install bike lanes, as well as the power to remove already existing infrastructure. This is incredibly backwards, narrow minded and fiscally irresponsible. In studies throughout the world, bike lanes have been shown to ease congestion, reduce emissions and are beneficial to local businesses. Furthermore, they provide safety for cyclists, reducing injuries and fatalities. Much of Canada and the hockey world was shook when we learned the tragic news of Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau\u2019s needless and untimely passing. Although different circumstances, it highlighted the dangers road cyclists face daily. All it takes is one impatient or aggressive driver. It\u2019s something that has been on my mind frequently. Before I had my first child, I would occasionally bike to friends' houses, or for small errands, as well as for leisure and exercise. Now it is something I am nervous to do. I am hopeful that Niagara will continue to work towards making cycling a safe and viable option for residents, despite the wishes of the Ontario PCs. Similarly, I hope that the Premier will reconsider the removal of established bike lanes in the city of Toronto. The Premier suggests moving bike lanes to secondary streets, but in a large city like Toronto, what would that even mean? Cyclists and drivers alike are typically traveling to businesses and residences on busy streets. Commuters are cycling to their workplaces that are located on major streets. How else are cyclists expected to get to these businesses and workplaces, only traveling on \u201csecondary streets\u201d? How are cyclists expected to get from one \u201csecondary street\u201d to another? Once again, this will come at a cost to the taxpayers. How much will removing and or relocating these bike lanes cost? How much was spent to install them in the first place, now being wasted? This solution makes little sense when given the smallest bit of thought. If reducing congestion truly is the goal of Doug Ford and the PCs, focus should be placed on getting more cars off the road, not adding lanes and highways. Research has shown that increased supply just increases demand in the long run. Solutions to reduce congestion should include improving public transit, and alternative options, but clearly this government has no intent on actually solving problems. And let\u2019s take a look at the name of the bill, \u201cThe Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d. If Doug Ford is so concerned about saving Ontarians time, let\u2019s maybe look at saving time for those waiting in emergency rooms, or waiting months to receive necessary, urgent care. Surely time spent saving lives is more important than slightly reducing the daily commute.\n"

To suggest that the city of Toronto should need provincial approval for bike lanes WITHIN the city is absurd and completely ignores the impact on the 2.7 million people that live in the city and have voted for municipal representation to decide these things. In addition, bike lanes are an inherent good for the city. More business access by options other than cars increases business. As well, commuting by car is faster when there are reliable alternatives to driving so that not everyone has to drive.

        "comment": "I am writing from Kanata, Ontario.\nNot only will Bill 212 make our roads more unsafe for people who cycle, walk or drive it is also yet another overstep on the authority of municipalities. Removing bike lanes puts cyclists in more danger, leading to more accidents, injuries and deaths while causing further delays on our roads. We need more bike lanes, not fewer.  On some existing roads (like Campeau between Kanata Ave and March Road), bike lanes end suddenly with no safe place for bikes to continue.\nThe legislation would be in direct opposition to Ottawa\u2019s own plans to add dozens of cycling routes across the city by 2046 and increase the number by 50% and put a wrench into ongoing city projects.\nSomeone in Toronto does not and will not know what is best here in Ottawa, especially when it comes to specific bike infrastructure.\nThe legislation will also put unnecessary financial strain on taxpayers for the potential cost of removing existing bike lanes and will add more not less bureaucracy and red tape to approval of new and in many cases, already-approved active transportation projects.\nOntarians do not want another culture war and more division - they want for themselves and their families to be safe on the road.\nOntarians know that easing traffic congestion is about giving people more transportation options, not fewer. We want to achieve net zero for a greener, healthier future and want our communities to be connected so that not every trip to school, to the store, or to work has to be taken by car.\nAs reported in a recent CBC article, the data is clear, building more car lanes and widening roads does not ease gridlock and building more bike lanes does not make it worse but in fact does the opposite.\nFrom O\u2019Connor to Laurier and beyond, we love our communities\u2019 bike lanes, and we don't want the province saying where they can or can't be built because bike lanes are good for the environment, good for business, for personal and public health and they save lives.\nPlease listen to residents. Premier Ford, you've had 6 years of a majority government to reduce gridlock yet have failed to deliver any of the transit projects that were promised. Gridlock is a serious issue, one that can cost up to $11 billion in lost revenue \u2013 but this government is using bike lanes as a scapegoat for its dismal track record on transit.\n"

        "comment": "This bill should absolutely NOT be passed. Not only do bike lanes make streets safer for everyone, but removing/barring them will not stop the majority of cyclists from using major streets thus resulting in higher risk of accidents. More lanes do not mean less congestion. Induced demand brought on by adding car lanes only brings more cars into cities leading to higher traffic numbers. Cities should be planned for/by their people, not cars. In addition, Schedule 3, the area of this bill providing an exemption from the EAA is absolutely sinister and unacceptable. It is clearly in the later section of this bill which has mainly been publicized focusing on bike lanes to be snuck by the public without notice. EAA regulations were put into place for a reason - to prevent unnecessary harm and alteration to the environment in which construction takes place. Highway 413 should not even be built. Aside from the billions in tax dollars it would cost Ontarians, it will also cause irreparable harm the greenbelt. 413 will also NOT reduce commute times. Rather, public transit should be heavily expanded. As well, highway 407, an already underused highway due to its privatization, which runs in roughly the same route as the planned 413,  should be permanently opened to the public and not tolled.\n"

        "comment": "I firmly believe that the proposed requirement for municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes is absurd for the following reasons:\nFavouring vehicle lanes over other modes of transportation leaves some people with little or no transportation at all - kids, young teenagers, newcomers to Canada (who don't have licenses yet), people who can't afford cars/gas, and anyone who has medical issues which makes them unable to drive are NOT able to drive, however in many cases they are able to bike.  It is closed-minded and ableist to only cater to middle-aged people with enough income to be able to drive.\nVehicle lanes should NOT be the priority - Active modes (cycling, skateboards, scooters, walking, etc) should be the priority as it keeps people healthy and reduces the risk of fatal or major injury collisions.\nBike lanes improve safety for those who need/choose to bike  - without bike lanes, cyclists are at higher risk in the general traffic lanes.\nBike lanes improve safety for pedestrians - Although my grandparents (nearing their 90s) are unable to bike, they do like to walk to stay healthy.  Bike lanes provide a safe buffer between vehicle lanes and the sidewalk, which improves safety and comfort for anyone walking (children, seniors, and everyone else).\nBike lanes improve safety for motorists - Many areas (especially smaller towns) have excessive amounts of road space..  It's a proven fact that as lanes/roads get wider, traffic speeds increase.  Where there is excessive space on the road (ie: where mistakes were made in past designs), the road space should be reduced to calm driving behaviours. This improves safety for all users, including motorists.  While some roads may be busy during peak hours, many roads are excessively wide for the midday, evening and overnight conditions.\nThere is (and will continue to be) an increase in other active modes, which can be accommodated in bike lanes - Scooters, skateboards, etc, are used in bike lanes.  By limiting the number of bike lanes, the province would also be indirectly forcing these users to either be on the road or on sidewalks (most likely they would choose sidewalks, which increases the risks to pedestrians).\nThe policy would overstep boundaries - It is absolutely unnecessary to make it harder for municipalities to meet their goals (such as the goals set out in Ottawa's Road Safety Action Plan).  Many of the larger municipalities already have frameworks for decision making, including multi-modal Level of Service guidelines.  There are already frameworks in place for making informed, well-thought out decisions at the municipal level, so why would the province feel a need to overrule these existing policies?\nThe decision makers would have little to no knowledge on the local context - The policy seems to be written specifically for the GTA, not for other regions of the province.  I don't see why someone in Toronto should be making decisions about what is best for the transportation systems in Thunder Bay, North Bay, Sudbury, Carleton Place, etc.  There are many factors to consider when making these high-level decisions, and it seems like an awful idea to have some bureaucrat in the GTA decide what is best for other municipalities that they may have never even stepped foot in.\nThe policy would be costly - Taxpayers are already paying for engineering studies, etc at the municipal level.  These employees already exist.  Why should we also be paying for someone at the provincial level (living in the GTA) to review the same engineering studies that municipal engineers are already reviewing?\nThe policy would impact the economy - It seems that the current premier is obsessed with boosting the economy, but adding barriers to construction would slow or halt many municipal construction projects.  In Ottawa's 2024 Budget (just one year), several million dollars were allocated directly to Cycling Facilities.   If the province were to disallow safety improvements such as these, that would be millions of dollars of lost opportunity for the engineering/design and construction industries.  It's a step backwards to put barriers to constructing safety improvements.\nMoving bike lanes to side streets is not the answer - There are several reasons for this (many destinations are on the main streets, often main streets are the more direct/less complicated path, often main street are longer than side streets, often these side streets do not have traffic signals when they cross main roads, etc).\nSome cyclists will just move the general traffic lanes if there aren't bike lanes - I can't see why the premier/minister would think that it's a bad idea to have safe facilities for cyclists, rather than have them in the general traffic lane.  If I were cycling and my choices were the general traffic lanes of the main street or a circuitous route along a side street, I would choose the general traffic lane.\nOther cyclists will choose to drive instead of biking/skateboarding/scootering - Bike lanes are added to streets to help offer an alternative to driving.  In some cases, if a cyclist chooses to bike to their destination, that's one less car on the road.  Reducing the number of bike lanes (or making them inconveniently located on side streets), would increase the number of cars, which would increase congestion.  I understand that the purpose of this regulation is to decrease congestion, but it would actually have the opposite effect\nThe policy would be regressive and would put Ontario on the map for being a car-dependant bureaucracy rather than being progressive and forward-thinking - Many jurisdictions are working on their vision zero policies and aiming to make transportation more equitable, accessible and safer.  This policy would be entirely backwards.  We should be making things better, not worse.\nI could probably name several other issues with the proposed policy, but to keep this message concise, I will stop at that.  To summarize, the policy would be written to positively impact no one, but would negatively impact all road users due to decreased safety, and potential increased congestion.  The policy would be inequitable since it impacts children, young teenagers, newcomers, people with disabilities, etc more negatively than it would impact financially-stable car owners.  The proposed policy is regressive and creates barriers which would impact the construction industry.  I can't see a single beneficial component of this policy and I strongly believe that it is being proposed with only the GTA in mind.\nI urge you to please consider the numerous points I've outlined above and to cancel this bill, for the wellbeing on Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "\ufeffThis proposed bill is a huge overreach from the provincial government, which should not be dictating to municipalities how they can or cannot allocate municipal road space to the various forms of traffic. The appropriate number of bike and car lanes should be determined on a case-by-case basis, by local governments that have a better knowledge of the traffic situation on the ground and of future planning for the various forms of transport. Introducing this bill would introduce a truly ridiculous amount of unnecessary red tape and prevent cities from being able to effectively plan and influence transportation in their cities. The province cannot and should not be able to control the specific number of lanes of car traffic on each road of each city in Ontario, and it is conceited to think that the province would be able to make better decisions on this front than individuals living in and governing a particular city.\nBeyond that, the proposed framework ignores all of the body knowledge about traffic congestion and induced demand, and will in no way improve the existing traffic congestion issues and travel times, and will in many cases make them worse. Encouraging car-dependency by hindering the construction of bike lanes and in some cases demolishing existing bike lanes will only route existing bike lane users back onto the road, either on their bicycles (which is less safe for everyone), or in cars, in either case worsening traffic congestion and increasing travel time. Similarly, pushing the construction of another highway will only reinforce the car dependency for a huge number of Ontarians, on top of destroying large swaths of the greenbelt, farmland and rural communities.\nWilfully ignoring the science and pushing the premier's car-brained agenda solves nothing, and will worsen traffic, road safety for the most vulnerable users, and our environmental impact in one fell swoop, on top of costing Ontarians and the government more than the alternatives (per user, and accounting for future repairs due to wear and tear, see work by Strong Towns for costs). Please do not pass this bill, or anything resembling it.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing regarding the proposed framework requiring provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment The EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\nUrban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\nAir quality at street level where people walk and bike\nNoise levels that affect mental and physical health\nSafe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\nAccess to sustainable transportation options\nStreet-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\nOverall quality of life in our communities\nBike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\nCreating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\nReducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\nDecreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\nEnabling active transportation that improves public health\nBuilding more livable, human-scaled urban environments\nSupporting sustainable urban development patterns\nProviding equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\nContradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals Your SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\nContradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\nCreates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\nPrioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\nUndermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\nContradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\nPlaces an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\nEnvironmental Assessment Concerns While the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n\"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n\"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\nAir quality impacts\nStormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\nOil and gasoline leaks\nTire particles and microplastics\nBrake dust and heavy metals\nRoad salt and de-icing chemicals\nSediment and debris\nThe cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\nThe relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\nClimate Change Obligations Your SEV specifically commits to:\n\"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n\"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n\"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\" The proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nEvidence-Based Decision Making The proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\nIgnores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\nCreates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\nOnly bike lanes must be justified with data\nNo similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\nMunicipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\nThe default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\nOverlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\nReduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\nSignificantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\nCardiovascular disease\nSleep disturbance\nCognitive impairment in children\nMental health impacts\nReduced property values\nImproved public health outcomes through active transportation\nEnhanced road safety for all users\nEconomic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\nIncreased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\nHigher property values on calmer, more livable streets\nReduced road maintenance costs\nGreater neighborhood desirability\nMore equitable transportation access\nMunicipal Planning Integration Your SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\nUndermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\nCreates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\nMay discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\nCould delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\nRevise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\nEnvironmental benefits (both natural and urban)\nPublic health impacts\nSafety improvements\nEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\nAccessibility enhancements\nClimate change mitigation potential\nIntegration with existing transportation networks\nEnsure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\nReflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\nConsider both immediate and long-term impacts\nAccount for municipal transportation master plans\nInclude environmental and health metrics\nSupport the achievement of provincial climate targets\nRecognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\nModify the data collection requirements to:\nInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\nConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\nAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\nMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\nEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\nAdditionally, the Province should trust that municipalities can make decisions on local issues that benefit their constituents.\n"

        "comment": "Comments on - Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nI am an 83 year old bicycle rider living in Toronto. I use a bicycle for shopping errands and for recreation, riding with a group of seniors once a week for a distance of 20 to 30 km. We use both park trails and protected bike lanes and some roads without protected bike lanes.\nMy wife and I oppose Bill 212 for the following reasons;\n1. Removing bike lanes in Ontario\u2019s cities and towns will do nothing to improve traffic congestion or traffic gridlock. The reason is that people who are now using their bicycles for 5 km to 10 km shopping trips or other errands or the \u2018last km\u2019 to and from a subway station safely inside a protected bicycle lane, will now resort to driving a car out of fear of injury or death which will just increase the gridlock. Every person riding a bike is a person who isn't in a car, or a taxi or Uber, contributing to congestion. And almost all cars we have observed whether on the 400 highways or on Toronto streets, have only one occupant, the driver. This is completely inefficient. There needs to be more mandated HOV lanes and education to encourage road to carpool when driving to and from work. This action by itself would relieve congestion without any government spending on expensive new roads like the proposed highway 413. Is the Provincial government interested in moving more people or more single occupancy cars? Filling our roads and highways with cars will not move more people. And there are no bike lanes on 400 highways, the worst congested roads in the province.\n2. Bike lanes are not a problem because there are so few of them in Toronto or any other city or town in Ontario. There is no evidence for saying that these few bike lanes are causing congestion. Bike lanes are a non-problem. In fact cyclists risk their lives by riding beside cars in order to use less fossil fuel energy, take up less space than single occupancy cars and live healthier than car drivers, using less health care resources. We cyclists love riding because it is such a healthy and enjoyable way to do our errands and have recreation at the same time. And for this we are treated as second or third class citizens whose lives are not worth protecting from fast moving tons of steel. My wife and I  have travelled to the Netherlands, and noticed especially in Amsterdam the enormous number of people, men, women, children on bicycles, going to and from work plus the use of cargo bikes to carry goods and children successfully. And the bicycle parking infrastructure at bus/train stations is just unimaginable here in Ontario. We understand that this is the case in other European cities such as Copenhagen.\n3. Also in response to critics who say that bike lanes have reduced emergency vehicle response times - according to Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop, emergency response times have *improved* since the Bloor bike lanes were installed. Bike lanes are good for everybody.\n4. Bike lanes are good for business, they save cities money, they help people live happier, healthier, more connected lives. In fact in The Annex, a neighbourhood in Toronto, the Bloor Annex BIA (the BIA represents business and property owners on Bloor Street from Madison Avenue to Bathurst Street) says that since the creation of bike lanes on Bloor St. in 2016, bicycle riders have contributed to lower car congestion and improved business in the stores along Bloor Street. \u201cThe BIA said that removing the lanes on Bloor would be disastrous to the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cThe BIA argues there are 8,000 cyclists using Bloor bike lanes per day. The bike lanes have been part of a renewal project for the area for the past nine years.\u201d (Toronto Today, October 23, 2024).\n5. But this threat to not allow creation of new bike lanes and remove present ones is not actually about bike lanes and congestion. It is about the current Provincial government trying to create a wedge issue, to seem to take the side of car drivers over bicycle users. It is about trying to receive more votes in the upcoming election, some time in 2025, a year ahead of the scheduled provincial election in order to achieve another majority result under our \u2018first pass the post\u2019 elections where  the majority of citizens do not get what they voted for, with a majority government often being attained with the support of only 18% of eligible voters. I think to create a wedge issue on the backs of vulnerable cyclists who only desire protection from fast moving tons of steel is despicable. We cyclists are truly lower class citizens whose lives are not cared for by this government. We cyclists, if we don\u2019t own a car, are also treated with disrespect when it comes to Ontario government  finances. Car drivers, not cyclists receive a great deal from the province. Car drivers have been made exempt from paying their registration fees for many months now. In addition gasoline taxes have been lowered for drivers and I just heard that that will continue into 2025, no doubt through any election call.\n6. There is a larger set of issues with the private auto. I remember Quaker engineer, writer and speaker Ursula Franklin, now deceased who spoke at a Massey Lecture likely more than a decade ago. She talked about how people, animals, birds, insects, plants and trees are occupied by mobile industrial machines (cars and trucks) imposing themselves into our every day lives. She said that nearly the entire Earth (and now ocean bottoms) is in danger of being turned into a \u2018production site\u2019. That is what continues to happen with the province\u2019s road building projects such as the unnecessary highway 413 - which is just north of little used highway 407 and which will remove the habitats (homes) of countless animals, birds and insects. We are currently in the midst of the largest mass species extinction of living beings in millions of years. We need to protect every one we have left. Living in a city such as Toronto, it is impossible to escape the influence of the private automobile. It is allowed to be everywhere, parked on our streets or noisily moving through them. Our lives should not be like this. That is why walking and riding a small human powered wheeled device is so important to our health and welfare. The private auto is also a major contributor to air pollution and the release of greenhouse gases (25%+ of all releases) into our atmosphere which is already dooming us to the dangerous weather which is killing more of us all over the world. Just imagine a city with cars banned from many downtown streets. We have experienced this in Europe. It was wonderful to walk in the middle of streets with many people and a few bicycles. Why can\u2019t we have that experience in Toronto, or in any city in Ontario? Why can\u2019t we have what most of us want - healthy, non-polluting human powered transportation.\n"

        "comment": "The Ministry of Transportation has its responsibility to manage and maintain the provincial road network.  There is no place for provincial legislature to dictate how municipal roads are managed. This falls under the jurisdiction of the municipalities and their tax paying residents. Transportation authorities have a duty to a holistic approach to transportation which includes all modes and not limited to just vehicular traffic.  The City of Toronto has taken this approach with their arterial roads and applied Complete Streets and Vision Zero initiatives which focus on the movement and safety of all users including the most vulnerable, while mitigating aggressive driver behaviour.  The removal of bike lanes in favour of some additional capacity for vehicles is not a long-term sustainable solution to addressing traffic congestion.  More ways of getting around means less congestion and less risk of fatal collisions.  Without dedicated cycling infrastructure on arterials, cyclist will be forced to occupy general purpose lanes, which they are entitled to under the Highway Traffic Act, subjecting them to safety hazards of aggressive drivers.  Furthermore, this will also lead to cyclists operating on sidewalk which poses safety risks to pedestrians.  If the minister proposes removal of existing lanes, there should be public consultation for residents to provide input in a forum such as a Public Information Centre.  Is this the case?\nThis legislature is unlawful and not supported by Ontario's metropolitan cities and their residents.  It prioritizes the movement of vehicles over movement and safety of people.  If the province wants complete oversight on municipal roads, they should examine uploading them to the provincial road network at their cost.\n"

        "comment": "The underlying notion of this legislation is that bike lanes shouldn't take away lanes for cars and assumes that bike lanes somehow contribute to traffic congestion. This is not true or factual. This assumption may be extended to infer that streetcars slow traffic. In fact, a street car or bus full of people are not slowing down car traffic, but individuals in cars are slowing down street cars and buses full of people. It might be annoying to sit in traffic and see a little used bike lane as cyclists fly by, but that annoyance can be rectified by getting out of your car.\nA second consequence of this legislation is that somehow the provincial government feels the need to interfere with the infrastructure and urban planning of a municipality, which they are ill-equipped to do. The premier and his caucus should be reminded to work for the people of the province of Ontario and not the city of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "It is a waste of time and money for the provincial government to gate-keep how municipalities wish to engage with bicycle infrastructure. Municipalities should continue to have the freedom to plan bicycle infrastructure for their communities, the province of Ontario has no justification for adding bureaucracy to these projects at the municipal level. Bill 212 is an embarrassing misuse of power, not to mention a waste of resources, by the province. Stop wasting time and resources micromanaging municipalities, get your own house in order.\n"
