        "comment": "This law would ensure my biking commute remains unsafe.\nI bike to work, which removes another car from my city's traffic. There are some bike lanes that I can use, but it still feels like I'm taking a risk every day. I know many people who would bike if they felt it was more safe. A great way to support traffic reduction, and to support drivers, is to get all the people who don't want to be driving off the roads by offering other options. Then those who love driving can enjoy less traffic and those who want to bike or take transit can also get to work safely.\nThis law proposed law ensures that my traffic-reducing commute remains risky. We need more bike lanes to get more people out of their cars. With the fast rise in electric bikes, commuting to work (without the sweat) is such a great option now. Let's not go backwards.\nThe Government of Ontario should put all Ontarians first, not drivers first.\nThank you.\nTim\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I'd like to register my disapproval for adding provincial oversight to municipal bike lanes.\nMy objections:\n- No more red tape: adding more government involvement increases bureaucratic bloat. Small government is key to efficiency!\n- Traffic: I am a driver and having cyclists using car lanes slows traffic to a crawl. One cyclist in a lane is like closing a lane for construction as traffic backs up for miles, waiting to pass them. I also personally find it very stressful and distracting to share my lane with cyclists. What if they fall or suddenly changes direction?\n- Less options: Today's cyclist will return to commuting by either car or public transit, increasing volume on either route. When I drive, the roads are crowded. When I take the GO, the train is crowded. I'd rather stay home. Everyone needs more options for transit, not less.\nMy neighbourhood has a lot of young families with parents who work downtown. We also have busy, hilly streets. Our cycle lane was installed during the pandemic and has been working well for us. I am sure other neighbourhoods do not need one. Leave it up to locals to determine their needs!\n"

        "comment": "Hello -- I would like to share my strong objections to the entirety of Schedule 4 of this Bill. The new legislative powers being allocated to the Minister of Transportation are disproportionate and do not reflect evidence of existing issues with the municipal creation and maintenance of Bike Lanes.\nWhile the Highway Traffic At contains more than 200 references to the Minister and ministry's role in maintaining the \"safety\" of road users, this proposal establishes an opposite priority. By requiring Minister approval of new bike lanes, the province will effectively prohibit decisions and infrastructure investments that should be developed and deployed based on  the expertise of municipal planning staff. The only criteria these amendments prioritize is impact on motor vehicle travel times; this dismisses the value of cyclist comfort, safety, and even mortality.\nThis is irresponsible and unethical governance. This proposal is even more offensive as it runs counter to the preponderance of evidence that demonstrate safe cycling infrastructure can improve traffic flow, remove vehicle congestion from roadways, increase local economic development, improve individual and community health outcomes. While I know MTO staff are well aware of this evidence, I would recommend political staffers in the Minister's and Premier's office acquaint themselves the facts referenced here: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nIf municipal traffic flow presents issues that are so significant as to require intervention from the provincial government, then there are many alternative policy or legislative proposals that could provide drivers relief without sacrificing the safety of cyclists: eliminating on-street parking to free up travel lanes, providing greater enforcement of drivers blocking intersections and parking in no-stopping zones, restricting commercial deliveries on major arteries to exclude rush hours, imposing congestion fees during peak road use times, providing greater subsidized service for public transit, limiting lane closures associated with construction projects, etc.\nIf the government proceeds with Bill 212 as drafted, not only will this new legislation fail to deliver any meaningful improvements to drivers dealing longer than pre-pandemic travel times, it will also be actively creating a more dangerous and deadly province. Please reflect on your responsibilities to all citizens of Ontario and reconsider this cravenly political, ineffective and harmful plan. Thank You\n"

The province has significantly more important issues to deal with, like Metrolinx utterly failing the LRT projects, not to mention housing and healthcare. Every bike on the street is one fewer car; every car added INCREASES the gridlock. Province has exactly zero business regulating city streets, not to mention the environmental and health impacts bringing more cars in the city will have.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has been car-free for seven years and gets around by bike or transit, I am very disappointed with the Ford government's proposal to require provincial approval for bike lanes which remove traffic lanes, as well as require reviews of existing bike lanes. In large cities like Toronto, there is very little room to add new roads or widen existing ones. In order to move around more people, the only option is to reallocate space away from cars to encourage walking, cycling, and transit. Not to mention, this bill represents a serious overreach of jurisdiction given it's municipalities that are best positioned to make decisions on bike lanes.\nWhile withdrawing the bill is the best option, any use of data to determine whether bike lanes are effective needs to focus on safety first, as well as whether they increase cycling volumes. Impacts to commute times should be the last thing that gets considered given there could be other activities such as construction that could have a much greater impact. Even if commute times do get increased with bike lanes, municipalities can tweak the streets to minimize the impact on drivers as has happened with Bloor Street in Toronto. For the few times a year I rent a vehicle, I find streets with protected bike lanes are less stressful to drive on given cyclists have their own space.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal for Bill 212 demonstrates a continuing and increasing practice of government overreach by the current Ontario provincial administration into the affairs of these so-called \"prescribed municipalities\". As a resident, motorist, and cyclist in the GTA, I find that the proposal to limit the addition of, and more shockingly, the potential removal of bike lanes is, at best, short-sighted and inconsiderate of a very significant portion of the constituency. At it's worst, it shows preferential treatment and favoritism of those with power and personal ties within the Ontario government, and an extremely concerning move given other controversial major government-led projects in progress or recently announced (ie. the questionable arrangement between Ontario Place and Thermea Spa, as well as the sudden closure of the Ontario Science Centre). Bike lanes and other infrastructural support of multi-modal transportation has been demonstrated to ease congestion through densification of passenger throughput (ie. 1 vehicle with a single passenger on average takes the same amount of room as 4 riders on bicycles / scooters), as well as give people alternatives to driving that would otherwise  be too unsafe to be considered. As an additional note, removal of bike lanes will not remove the cyclists; that is to say, all that will be achieved by removing bike lanes is placing cyclists that depend on that route to get around in increased danger while also slowing down an active lane of vehicle traffic while cyclists take the lane (as is their legal right). Many of the municipalities that would presumably be part of the \"prescribed\" list have active cooperation between public works and the cycling community. By taking over the decision-making autonomy of these municipalities in how it facilitates moving residents through and around is to step on all other municipal autonomy that we still hold, and that is not acceptable on any level.\n"

However not at the expense of taking away bike lanes which HELP move people around the city. Please focus on increasing PUBLIC TRANSPORT. Look to other major cities (London, NYC, Paris, Chicago):  these cities embrace bike lanes and public transit (and have adopted congestion pricing for cars and adaptive signal control among other measures). Also this bill smacks as provincial government overreach into municipal affairs and undemocratic.\n"

        "comment": "I urge the Environmental Registry of Ontario to take strong action in support of expanding bike lane networks across Ontario by stopping the \"Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\" of Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This framework will pause and damage the province's efforts to implement a low-cost, highly effective mobility solution that has been particularly effective in Toronto, Ontario's largest urban center. Toronto, Ontario, and Canada are all at a critical juncture, and investing in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. In this comment, I provide evidence-based arguments against the argument that bike lanes increase congestion, and that their implementation should be reviewed in major arteries.\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Research on mobility and sustainability has thoroughly demonstrated that the only solution to congestion is providing viable alternatives to driving. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nThis legislation acts contrary to the evidence and knowledge on sustainable and safe urban mobility (see links to academic research on the topic as supporting links). Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Ontario residents. Avoiding the construction of bicycle lanes on major roads will only reduce the efficiency of the cycling network by increasing the distance needed for cyclists to travel to their destinations. Moreover, this legislation will perpetuate road designs that lead to increased air pollution, GHG emissions, and reduced safety for ALL road users. Complete street redesigns, which have been implemented in several major roads in Toronto, are a proven way to concurrently address environmental pressures, safety, and congestion for all road users. This program should not be hampered by provincial legislation that pauses redesigns and progress in the most valuable corridors of Ontario cities, and Toronto in particular.\n"

        "comment": "The problem with this proposal is that it fails to realize congestion is as a result of most people ditching other means of transport to go for cars: and if safety of cyclists is not assured through dedicated lanes, more people will ditch cycling to get cars and congestion will get worse : furthermore cities should consider all road users and not just cars in absence of dedicated lanes sidewalks will be used by more cyclists endangering pedestrians and more cyclists will also likely get injured if they chose to stay on the lanes with vehicles; instead of having a class war between cyclists and car users and pedestrians, cities should focus on infrastructure for everyone\n"

        "comment": "Yeah hi, so every study ever has concluded that adding an extra lane of traffic never really relieves congestion. More cars makes cities less functional. This is coming from a guy who primary mode of transportation is a car. Bike lanes do not take that much a space (believe it or not) and makes cities way more liveable and keeps everybody healthier. Anyway this is the 2nd dumbest idea our provincial gov has had next to paying half a billion dollars to get out of a beer store contract 1 year earlier. Not against opening up beer but what a waste of money. Anyway, bike lanes and pedestrian streets make for way more liveable cities, just ask Montreal! Oh and improving public transit also helps. Pretty sad that Rennes, France has the same amount of subway lines than TORONTO. Cheers!\n"

        "comment": "Studies across North America have shown that the addition of cycling lanes, particularly when a car lane is removed, can lead to mixed outcomes regarding overall congestion. In cities like New York, Montreal, and Vancouver, data suggests that initially, the removal of car lanes may contribute to localized congestion. However, over time, traffic volumes tend to stabilize as drivers adapt by changing routes, opting for public transit, or shifting to cycling. A notable finding is that protected cycling lanes can increase the number of cyclists, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. In some cases, overall traffic congestion improves as more people use alternative modes of transport. For example, studies in cities like Vancouver and Portland have shown a long-term reduction in vehicle volumes and better flow on main roads, as fewer drivers compete for the available space, and more people shift to cycling.\nTherefore, if anyone has noted riding congestion, this has likely dissipated by now and caused by increased numbers o people without proper access to public transit rather than bicycles. If anything, on-street parking which reduces roads to one lane anyway have a worse effect, as cyclists then have to weave into that one lane of traffic (dodging the lane where cars are parked) and slow down all of the cars in the driving lane, rather than being separated into another bike lane where they are not impeding traffic.\nMain Street and O'Connor street in Ottawa are prefect examples of this: the traffic is bad on Main, but was always bad due to the on-street parking effectively making Main Street a one-lane street. Now residents are able to bike safely, and do not impede local traffic.  Plus the design still allows for on-street parking. This has helped the overall flow of the neighbourhood. Repeating this model on Bank Street in Old Ottawa South and the Glebe, both neighbourhoods with high rates of commuter cycling, would also help with the traffic flow there (which is slow due to all of the parked cars anyway).\n"
