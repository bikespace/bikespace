        "comment": "Bike lanes are extremely important and removing them will actually cause more car congestion than reduce it. I use the bike lanes to travel 6km to work which takes me about 25min. This is a better alternative than transit because our transit system is so slow it takes me about 45 mins to travel the same 6km.\nIf bike lanes were removed, I wouldn\u2019t choose to take transit - I would drive. Driving takes just as long as biking and during rush hour it takes even longer.\nUntil you improve our transit service and infrastructure to cater to 9 million Torontonians instead of 4 million, biking and bike lanes are the next best thing to reduce congestion.\n"

        "comment": "To reduce gridlock, the only option is to provide viable public transportation - cities and province should get together to design a plan to never (never!!!) stop building public transportation options in all cities and between the cities/towns. Working on isolated projects for one subway line or one train line is nonsense - the crews should continue working all the time adding more stations/stops according to the needs and growth of the communities. Metrolinx is a completely irresponsible organization - it should be dismantled, and its administrators should be investigated for mismanagement of time, funds, projects. Province should invest funds in proper education of drivers and cyclists to ensure safer roads. All roads that have public transportation options such as subway, buses or streetcars should be designed to make using a car on them as difficult and as unpleasant as possible to encourage the use of public transportations, walking, or cycling. All trucks should be forced (or paid to) to use Hwy 407. Any funds allocated for Hwy 413 should be distributed for building all forms of public transportation.\n"

Separated bike lanes means we can get to school, go shopping, and out to eat stress free.  No worrying about parking or being stuck in traffic, but most of all I feel safer knowing we are protected from cars.  Removing bike lanes will only make people more dependent on cars and will therefore increase congestion.  Safe and viable Alternatives to cars are what a modern city needs.  Toronto is about 50 years behind on public transit, for a city of its size.  Tearing out bike lanes is a step backwards and complete idiocy!\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives 4 hours away from Toronto, I am perplexed by this bill that will seemingly be used to justify ripping up bike lanes in Toronto. Why should provincial tax dollars be used in this manner? Especially considering the price tag will be in the millions.\nAs a law abiding resident, I question the legitimacy of a provincial government overturning the will of a council and citizens of a city. This amounts to government over reach in my opinion.\nAs someone who often commutes on a bike, I am frustrated by the lack of cycling infrastructure in my own city. This will only serve as yet another barrier in municipal governments implementing proper infrastructure to keep cyclists safe.\nFinally, based on all evidence I have come across and the glaring lack of evidence put forward by this government, bicycle lanes actually helps traffic congestion by taking cars off the road. More people who feel safe cycling, will choose a bike over a car. Those cyclist who still decide to bike, will be forced to take up a lane. This will cause more congestion.\nWorse than this, it will increase the risk of injury to cyclists. More cyclist will get injured by cars. More cyclist will die as a result of this.\nThese increased injuries and deaths will be at the hands of this government. Is that worth the price of perceived improved traffic flow?\n"

While we kept the younger ones on the sidewalk as they grew older they used the rode with us. Now adults they all use their bikes most days to travel around the city for both work and pleasure. They are teaching their children to bike. While they, and we, either own or have ready access to cars we all prefer to reduce our carbon footprint and often save time by riding our bikes. When the weather is inclement we frequently use TTC. The bike lanes have increased our safety on the roads and shown a great increase in bike usage since our first years of biking. They are an important feature in this city. In travelling we have always been aware of how other countries have better bicycling arrangements.\n"

Leave city planning to municipalities who are more connected to communities and informed on what they need. Below, I have shared linked from a variety of professional organizations who have denounced the bill and the negative impacts it will have.\nUltimately, it illustrates that the province is out of touch with the realities of municipalities and making uninformed decisions based on their insider relationships with a small number of donors. This is deeply unpopular in the communities that it will affect. The province should prioritize finishing the transit projects that it has been unable to complete before meddling in municipal affairs as disrupting people's lives further.\n"

        "comment": "I am an arts & culture worker, former urban planner, cyclist, driver, and pedestrian residing in Toronto. I am vehemently opposed to Bill 212 and its unfounded claims.\nSound research has proven that adding roads for vehicular traffic increases traffic. On the other hand, multiple modes of transit (cars, buses, streetcars, bike lanes, pedestrian sidewalks, etc.) reduce vehicular traffic as people have more options to choose from.\nBike lanes are safer for cyclists. It is such an absurd proposal to remove key bike lanes heavily used by cyclists, forcing us to share the roads with large vehicles. We need more bike lanes, not less.\nThe province need not control something as municipal-specific as bike lanes. Municipalities are the bodies who can make this call. Canada already has a bad reputation for red tape and delayed infrastructure development, particularly when it comes to transit. This proposal continues to make a mockery of a wealthy nation that should have streamlined processes.\nThis proposal will also be another huge waste of money from Ford's government.\nFord, stay out of municipalities' hair. Stay out of Toronto. You have done so much already to destroy what we love in Ontario. Stop.\n"

My neighbourhood is the southwest of downtown is not easy to reach by transit, and riding my bike to my office downtown cuts my commute times  significantly, sometimes in half. The bloor bike lane has made my daily commute much safer. The City of Toronto has made great strides in improving bike infrastructure over the last 10 years, and as a result, I've had many friends start riding their bikes to work and on weekends. The Province must not interfere in local decision-making about bike lanes. Our locally-elected municipal officials should be making those decisions - and if their constituents aren't happy about it, then it will come up in future municipal elections.\n"

        "comment": "I write to comment against the implementation of bill 212, especially sections revolving around the provinces mean to overstep on municipal decisions on street design.\nThere are many issues with the bill so I will split it up into sections. They will be as follows:\n- Reduced economic outcome\n - Increased gridlock\n - Increased KSI leading to increase in medical expenses\n - Reduced mobility\n - Wedge issue populism\n== Reduced economic outcome ==\nStudies have concluded that the economic activity increases in areas where bike lanes are installed. one such study is the \"ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY of Bike Lanes in Toronto\u2019s Bloor Annex and Korea Town Neighbourhoods\" (referenced below in links). Similar studies across Toronto, and the entire globe has found the same conclusions. Bike lanes are good for business. By removing bike lanes the province is hurting local businesses and through that tax income. No sane fiscal conservative would start killing small businesses. Local BIAs has also come out against removing bike lanes as they see the economic value that\n== Increased gridlock ==\nThough the province has yet to announce what they would like current streets with bike lanes to look like, we are most likely looking into just adding one more lane for parked cars. Not only will this not speed up the traffic for drivers, but since drivers will now have to share a lane with those who still cycle and has destinations on streets currently with bike lanes, all cars will now be slowed to the speed of the slowest bike. This street design is what was seen on Bloor street before the installation of bike lanes. Additionally, according to studies from Vancouver (and TUM and others), the capacity of a bike lane is higher than that of a driving lane, so in reality, removing a bike lane is removing large amounts of capacity from the road.\n== Increased KSI leading to increase in medical expenses ==\nRemoving safe street design will lead to more KSIs (Killed / Seriously Injured) as speeds increase and transportation modes mix more. While Canada ranks better on KSI compared to the United States, Canada ranks much worse than most other western countries, especially those with good complete street infrastructure. Besides the fact that more people will die (which on its own should be enough), medical expenses for the province will rise as a result of removing bike infrastructure (or will not lower due to the province blocking its installation). This is money that could go towards the public transit infrastructure projects that the province seems to have a hard time managing within budget.\n== Reduced mobility ==\nMany people cycling in this province does so as their mean of transportation to jobs, school, university, medical appointments, errands, friend/family visits and so on. Some does this out of convenience as it is in many places the fastest way to get around (due to the lack of good public transit), but for many it is economic reasons or accessibility reasons. Removing bike infrastructure and halting its installation removes the ability for a lot of both low income residents and for people with disabilities who are today enjoying the freedom of getting around using the bike infrastructure.\n== Wedge issue populism ==\nThe government seems to be painting bike lanes as a \"radical left\" piece of infrastructure, but bike infrastructure is neither right or left leaning. As an example, the big push for bike infrastructure in London, England came from Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, a fairly right leaning politician. The mayor saw and opportunity for increased economic activity along side a way to move more people more efficiently in a large city. Trying to paint removal of bike lanes as a populist saviour policy is a draconian way of driving people in the province further apart, when we should instead be working on solutions.\n== Conclusion ==\nWhile the government has painted the bill as the way to reduce gridlock, nothing in the bill will do anything but harm:\n - People, realistically to the sound of many more traffic deaths across the city\n - Local businesses that might have to close down due to reduced economic activity\n - Discourse as the people in the province are wedged further apart.\nThe blood of all above will be on the hands of the PCs who with this bill is showing either an incredible amount of lack of knowledge, or a deliberate approach to harming the province. No fiscal conservative in their right mind would push a bill like this. It remains to be seen if those exist in the province.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government's proposal to remove sections of the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto is a deeply misguided step that goes against the needs of the city, its residents, and the environment. It is an archaic solution to modern problems, one that fails to recognize the significant environmental and social damage caused by cars in urban spaces.\nFirstly, returning these lanes to motor vehicles will directly contribute to the worsening of traffic congestion and environmental harm. The presence of more cars on these streets only exacerbates the already severe gridlock in downtown Toronto, which leads to longer commute times, higher fuel consumption, and increased air pollution. Cars are one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and expanding infrastructure for them is contrary to the urgent need to combat climate change. The shift to more bike lanes in the city is an essential part of reducing our reliance on cars and building a sustainable, healthy urban environment.\nIn stark contrast, many European cities, such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, have flourished by prioritizing public transport, cycling, and pedestrian infrastructure. These cities are leading the way in creating livable, sustainable urban spaces by moving away from car-centric planning. In fact, the evidence from Europe is clear: removing cars from city centers reduces traffic congestion and makes the urban environment more attractive, accessible, and less polluted. In some cases, European cities have experienced reduced traffic gridlock precisely because they removed the thing causing it: the car.\nAdditionally, bike lanes are vital for encouraging safe cycling and making our streets more pedestrian-friendly. The proposal to eliminate these bike lanes sends the wrong message, suggesting that the city should prioritize the needs of a few drivers over the safety and well-being of the broader population, including cyclists, pedestrians, and residents who rely on alternative forms of transportation.\nThe idea that this proposal will somehow ease traffic or provide economic benefits is unfounded. It is exactly the opposite of what Toronto needs: a city that fosters clean, green, and accessible transportation options. The future of urban living lies in reducing car dependency, improving public transit systems, and ensuring safer, more sustainable mobility choices for everyone. This proposal represents a step backward in that journey.\nInstead of removing bike lanes and expanding space for cars, Toronto should be looking at ways to improve and expand its public transport options, enhance cycling infrastructure, and make downtown more accessible for pedestrians. This approach would ease congestion, reduce environmental impacts, and help create a more vibrant, livable city. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal is an outdated and harmful vision that fails to meet the demands of a modern, forward-thinking urban center. Toronto deserves better.\n"

        "comment": "This bill shouldn't be passed because it's completely missing the mark of why traffic becomes congested in the first place and laying blame on bike lanes. Bike lanes have helped reduce traffic in the downtown core by reducing the number of cars on the road to begin with, and cities should not need to get permission from provincial government in order to improve the quality and function of their individual jurisdiction. Requiring approval from provincial government is a gross overstep on the part of the provincial government. Furthermore, highway 413 is unnecessary, as we already have highways that are underutilized but cost too much for the average Ontarian to access (highway 407). There are other solutions to the gridlock problem that could be explored that would not lead to the destruction of our environment, and I urge the provincial government to search these out.\n"
