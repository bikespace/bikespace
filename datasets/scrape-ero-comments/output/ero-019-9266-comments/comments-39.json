        "comment": "This proposal is nearsighted. Why does it prioritize cars as the preferred method of transport? Where are the considerations for public transit in conjunction with bicycles or any other creative alternatives? Why is parking not considered? In big cities there is no chance of adding more roads or capacity so the alternatives must be considered that get people out of cars and into other methods.\n"

        "comment": "This seems like an ill-planned, knee-jerk policy that has no basis in reality or long-term planning. The Ontario government is demanding data prior to approving new bike lanes, but there is no corresponding requirement for data showing the business case or cost-benefit analysis for removing existing bike lanes. There is a growing body of evidence showing that bike lanes benefit neighbourhoods, increase business, and *reduce* traffic volume and congestion. Why are we tearing up existing infrastructure? It is incomprehensible why the government would spend money on this project, other than to buy car driver votes, especially when our healthcare and housing systems are strapped for funds. If this bill is passed rest assured that I will not be voting for the provincial conservatives.\n"

        "comment": "More lanes for cars doesn't improve traffic. Bike lanes are far more efficient in transporting people than cars, which are often single occupancy. Blaming bike lanes for the prioritization that cars gets is not going to improve our infrastructure. Rather, we need to promote efficient alternatives, including fast and efficient public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian paths.\nI live in downtown Ottawa (Centretown). As someone who has a visual disability, I cannot drive a car, but I can still ride a bike under certain circumstances. Having safe bike lanes is one additional way that I can get around, but with limited infrastructure to support it, I do not feel safe to do so. The public transit is infrequent and unreliable, so I am often left taking an Uber. I don't want to do this as it just adds to our ongoing traffic issues. But there is empirical evidence to support multiple modes of transit--and not just cars.\nI have attached a Vox article that discusses widening roads, which is a related issue. I also included a press release with a link to the final report from Portland State University on the positive economic impact of bike lanes. There are far more benefits to having bike lanes than saving space for cars. Adding limits to sustainability is not the direction the government should be going, and I oppose the proposed initiative.\n"

I\u2019ve seen a huge increase in cyclists using bike lanes over the past couple of years - people of all ages and plenty of families. They are better for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers too (I can say that as a car owner). Limiting where bike lanes can go will keep our streets from getting safer and reduce our safe transportation options. Anyone who had tried biking knows it\u2019s the fastest way to get around, and with the right clothing can be done pretty much all year. If we are serious about reducing gridlock we should be encouraging more safe options for people, not less. Jamming our roads with more and more single cars with just one person in them is not the answer. Please support solutions that will take us forward like other great cities, not backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I am responding to Bill 212, which would require provincial government approval for bike lanes that reduce the number of lanes that car drivers have available.  Bike lanes are essential, we need much more of them, not less.  When there is an easily accessible bike lane, more people bike. As well, the infrastructure associated with bike lanes reduces car/bike conflicts.  The congestion that is present in our cities is not due to a bike lanes, it is due to poor infrastructure that doesn't give people multiple safe options for travel.  I find it reprehensible that the Ontario Government who is voted in to respond to provincial issues not municipal is treading into territory that is not their responsibility or expertise.  When choosing who to vote for for provincial government we choose based upon the candidates responsibilities.  I would not vote the same for provincial and municipal governments because the responsibilities are different.  I suspect most of the Ford government hasn't gotten on a bike since they were kids.  I would never vote for Ford for the purposes of making legislation on anything to do with bikes.  Repeal this ridiculous Bill, and if gridlock is such an issue, invest more in public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I wish to comment on two aspects of this proposal.\n1) SCHEDULE 3, HIGHWAY 413 ACT, 2024: Exempting Highway 413 \u2014 a road that nobody but the Premier's sponsors wants \u2014 from environmental review is immensely short-sighted. In doing so, the Province invites creative, expensive and time-consuming protests from First Nations and concerned citizens. Everything about Highway 413 is counter to our commitments to reduce carbon-based emissions.\n2) SCHEDULE 4, HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT: It is utterly ridiculous (but entirely on-brand) that the Premier is directing his Minister of Transportation to limit bike lane construction because one bike lane in the west end of Toronto has infringed upon the Premier's viewshed as he is driven in his oversized vehicle on the occasional days that he chooses to work. Active transportation is a critical part of keeping a city moving efficiently. It is personal motor vehicles that cause slowdowns, not bike lanes.\nI am a frequent user of the lanes on Danforth Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East. On my bicycle on the Danforth Avenue lane and as a slightly overweight 55 year old, I can keep pace with motor traffic. We \u2014 cyclists and motorists \u2014 are often stopped by parked delivery trucks or idling construction vehicles. It's not me on my bike who is holding anyone up. I pay as much tax to cycle on the bike lane as the motor vehicles do to travel in their lane: and yet they cause much more road damage, pollution and many more injuries to other road users. To require more Provincial oversight of bike lines in the same legislation that expects less oversight of a multi-billion dollar futile concrete highway is not a good use of anyone's time and money, and makes the Province a laughing-stock internationally.\nPlease reconsider these inept pieces of legislation.\n"

        "comment": "I am 100% against this Act and I sincerely hope that the Government changes its mind on it.\nFirst off, the entire premise of the Act is incorrect. This Act will NOT reduce gridlock and/or save anyone time - there are countless studies proving that eliminating/avoiding bike lanes does not reduce traffic.\nSecond, this is both an overreach of the Government and a waste of money and time. Bike lanes should be a municipal concern, not a provincial one. And since Premier Ford is now promising that the province will pay to cover the cost of lane removal, this is a collosal waste of taxpayers' money. Why should the PROVINCIAL governement use taxpayers' money (from all over the province) to pay for MUNICIPAL things? Do taxpayers in Wingham want to pay for bike lane removals in Guelph? I promise you they do not.\nFinally, there is already a clear and easy way to \"reduce gridlock and save [us] time\". Build MORE transit options. More roads and highways = more cars. Roads and highways plus transit (GO trains, public transit) and bike lanes = more options for commuters = fewer cars. Please reconsider this terrible Act.\n"

        "comment": "I believe it's in our best interest for municipalities to make decisions about their own transportation needs. They have their ears to the ground and are much more effective at consulting with their local constituents on their local matters.\nHere in Ottawa, cycling has increased in popularity immensely, and I personally cycle to local destinations thanks to the infrastructure already in place. This means I'm not in my car for every trip I have to take, and therefore I'm not causing traffic.\nI think the province should absolutely reconsider the amount of red tape proposed here. The people of Ontario deserve the option of a safe, carbon-free way to get to their destination, but it's clear from this legislation that the province is currently more concerned with getting Ontarian to drive, instead.\n"

In some cases, reducing the number of lanes on a roadway (e.g. moving from four lanes to three, but with a dedicated turning lane) can actually improve traffic flow.\nIn some cases, redesign of a street is necessary to address safety issues that arise from high traffic speeds and volumes. In Toronto alone in 2023, six cyclists and 12 pedestrians have been killed. It is unconscionable and unacceptable that required changes to road infrastructure or improve resident safety could be overruled by the province.\nDecisions about municipal roadways should be made at the local level by municipal politicians, acting on the professional advice of transportation staff.\n"

        "comment": "I see several issues with this bill. First, studies have shown that providing more lanes for cars actually increases congestion, because it leads to more people driving. Therefore, removing car traffic lanes will not increase congestion, but the opposite: it will encourage more people to find alternative modes of transportation, thus decreasing congestion for those who still choose to drive. Second, adding bike lanes is an excellent way to reduce traffic congestion. With more bike lanes, more people ride a bike instead of drive a car, which reduces congestion for the remaining cars. Also, bikes are much smaller than cars, so many more can fit in the space that would be occupied by a car, meaning more people can use the same road space. Third, roads with bike lanes are much safer than roads without. Cyclists are very vulnerable to injuries and even death if they are hit by a car. I am dismayed that we are not taking this issue more seriously. Fourth, we are in a time of clear climate crisis, and we need to do everything we can to reduce our carbon emissions. Compared to other more drastic solutions, adding bike lanes and reducing car lanes is a relatively easy and painless way to reduce our collective carbon emissions, since it will mean that more people cycle and fewer drive. Fifth, this bill ignores the current trend towards increased cycling, especially as e-bikes become more available. We need more bike lanes to account for this trend, not less. Sixth, this bill is a clear example of provincial overreach into municipal affairs. Municipalities are better equipped to decide where to put bike lanes. Lastly, and I say this in jest, have you not heard of the expression \"stay in your lane?\" Ironically, it applies to this bill.\n"

While building new highways like Highway 413 is important for easing traffic, incorporating bike lanes into our road infrastructure is a forward-thinking solution that can complement these efforts.\nBike lanes promote environmentally friendly transportation, reduce the number of cars on the road, and enhance safety for cyclists. This, in turn, can help alleviate gridlock, making Ontario\u2019s streets more efficient for all road users. Encouraging cycling is also in line with the government\u2019s goals to improve quality of life, reduce accidents, and support environmental sustainability.\n"
