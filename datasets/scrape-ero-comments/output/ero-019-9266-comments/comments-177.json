        "comment": "Many studies around the world repeatedly show that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion. Removing the bike lanes will have the opposite effect you are hoping for. You should look into induced demand, it works for all modes of transportation. To reduce traffic you need to induce modes which are more space efficient such as cycling, walking, and public transit by building infrastructure to support those modes. This is so idiotic it really makes it seem like this isn't at all about reducing traffic but about something else, perhaps to make the automotive industry happy, or the oil and gas industry.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of the transportation system. People use bikes for many reasons like accessibility, affordability, or preference. They offer a mode of transportation for those that cannot/do not want to drive or do not own a car. Cyclists will exist with or without bike lanes. No bike infrastructure means bikers will share the lane with motor vehicles, increasing congestion and result in more fatalities. Is this the outcome the government wants?\nBike lanes reduce cycling fatalities and make the roads safer for everyone. There is no evidence that suggests multi-modal transportation systems that support bikers increase traffic congestion. More bikers reduce the number of cars on the road. Bike lanes make cities better and Municipalities should decide where to put bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolute mess of a proposal based on Ford's grievance-based populism. Claims that bike lanes are responsible for gridlock are not backed up by any kind of evidence.\nIf passed, this law would worsen traffic congestion, emissions, and public health by forcing people off of their bicycles and into cars and trucks.\nRemoving and blocking safe active transportation infrastructure disproportionately affects women, children, and the elderly, who are much less likely to ride when protected and connected infrastructure does not exist. It will impose additional costs on municipalities, as building and maintaining car lanes is much more expensive than building and maintaining bike lanes. It will also generate increased healthcare costs from both the direct consequences (increased injuries and deaths from crashes caused by lack of safe infrastructure) and indirect consequences (tire particle pollution and tailpipe emissions causing poor respiratory health). The province has no intention of paying for any of the increased costs of this absolutely asinine plan. If Ford is still bitter about not getting to run Toronto, maybe he should quit and run for mayor instead of throwing a tantrum by tabling this utterly unredeemable legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This is absurd.\nEven for the stated goal, i.e., to \"get drivers where they need to go faster\", the construction of well-designed cycling (and public transit) infrastructure is likely to improve the situation. If more people have viable options besides driving, this will alleviate traffic for those who still choose to drive.\nHowever, getting drivers where they need to go faster ought not to be the primary goal. The convenience of drivers is important to consider, but needs to be balanced against other important considerations. We wouldn't pave the entire surface of the city just to reduce everyone's commute time, because that would destroy everything that's worth appreciating about the city.\nFor a more reasonable goal like \"getting people where they need to go efficiently, while preserving and improving the health of our cities\", bicycle lanes offer clear advantages over traffic lanes. The province should not stand in the way of municipalities that recognize this fact.\n"

        "comment": "Everything about this bill is completely divorced from any honest intention to improve the lives of Ontarians or solve real problems.\nThis highway to nowhere is destroying our environment solely to enrich wealthy landowners close to the premier and should never be built. If I have the opportunity or power to delay it in any way, I will not hesitate. We do not need a highway, we need a modern rail network capable of moving many more people at over twice the speed of any highway, or nonsensical tunnel, you could build.\nBike lanes being removed or roadblocked is not only a gross overreach into the jurisdiction of fairly elected municipalities, it is also directly counterproductive to easing traffic. Traffic congestion is, by definition, an over abundance of cars in an area. The solution is therefore simple - reduce the number of cars. You do this by providing alternatives to driving: safe and convenient biking. Rail. Walking. Everyone taking one of these modes is not a car clogging your street. Furthermore, do you think all cyclists just disappear if there isn't a dedicated lane for them? No, absent a bike lane, the road is a bike lane and you'll have to drive at the speed of a cyclist because cyclists have no safe way to get out of the way.\nThis nonsense is yet another reason I will be encouraging anyone who will listen to vote for Marit Stiles of the NDP next election. Anyone reading this (that means you), please vote NDP for the sake of our province.\n"

        "comment": "This is a thinly veiled attempt to sweep aside important environmental checks on the development of Highway 413. The area it is proposed to be built through contains fragile ecosystems with rare species that have been destroyed and lost in most of the rest of the Province. This highway is not needed, and this bill will do irreparable harm to the Greenbelt area. Spend the billions on improvement public transit, which will not need additional infrastructure built and will benefit far more people than a new highway will.\nThe removing of bike lanes in this Bill is a red herring, but even this on its own is a momentously stupid waste of money. Bike lanes, and the use of bikes, can also reduce gridlock in the GTA, and should be encouraged further with better infrastructure, and proper winter maintenance of bike lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes will not reduce gridlock in Toronto, nor will building a highway that doesn't go anywhere close to the city (especially when there is a perfectly good and underutilized highway - 407 - nearby).\nAll this is, is another huge waste of taxpayer money. I was under the impression that the Progressive Conservative party were fiscally conservative, but this Bill (along with many others such as the cancellation of the Beer Store contract) shows that they do not care for being fiscally responsible at all.\n"

We need to encourage more people to get OUT of their cars into modes that take up less space per person (like bikes and transit and walking) to maximize our ability to move people.\nIt is along the same lines of banning SUVs or trucks for those people who couldnt possibly need all that space.\nThis will result in people dying.\nYou should divest authority to municipalities.

        "comment": "This is the dumbest idea I've heard from a government with a lot of bad ideas. Bike lanes provide a safer way to move lots of people OUT of cars and therefore make traffic lighter. They make LESS traffic. There are studies that show this. They've been cited on TVO, CBC, and in the Star.\nWe need lots MORE bike lanes on main roads. If you want less traffic downtown, outlaw street parking and enforce ticketing for the self-entitled people who stop with their four-ways on to run in for a quick errand. And THEN add more bike lanes. More people choose to take a bike when the route is safe, and sadly drivers are not as cautious as they should be, especially since the pandemic.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a daily driver and occasional cyclist. I am deeply concerned about the plan to rip up bike lanes, seemingly based on easily debunked opinions that pander to a specific voting base. Aside from the obvious concerns around safety (which will be severely compromised if bike lanes are removed) I am infuriated at the idea of adding more construction to Bloor to remove critical infrastructure for a culture war flashpoint. Nothing about that will help anyone's commute.\nData does not support bike lane removal as a way to alleviate traffic. If the lanes are expanded, they will quickly be filled and traffic will look much the same, except we'll all have to work harder to stay safe. Anecdotally, I've actually found traffic to be more manageable on Bloor since the bike lanes, as fewer cars are merging and passing. My family members feel similarly, to the point we were all quite shocked and confused at justifications for ripping up the lanes.\nIt is confounding that drivers are being falsely pandered to at the same time that there are so many outstanding and mismanaged transit projects. Good public transit will reduce traffic more effectively than adding lanes ever could. Why aren't we more focused on finishing the LRT or other projects as a means of traffic reduction?\nIt must be said that many drivers simply don't like cyclists and are happy to back this proposal out of spite. This decision uncomfortably reflects the disdain so many have for non-cars on city streets. We ought to be doing all we can to promote cycling, which is a solution that will take cars off the road! Every cyclist is one car off the road. Not to forget the ample environmental and physical health benefits that come with cycling. As a mental health professional, I deeply appreciate the ways cycling supports accessibility and general wellness for marginalized groups. There are so many benefits to preserving space to cycle safely.\nI strongly feel we must prioritize alternatives to driving for the collective wellbeing of this city. I urge you to focus on data driven solutions to managing traffic and density, and to think about the real people who will be endangered by bike lane removal. They matter and their lives are worth protecting.\n"

        "comment": "I wanted to add my voice against Premier Ford's recent decision to ban the installation of new bike lanes.  As a relatively recent arrival to Toronto (I moved here a little over a year ago from Ottawa), I was initially drawn to the city due to its walkable streets and commitment/openness to build safe infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists and those who use cars. I actually never biked before I moved here (due to Ottawa having largely non-existent bike infrastructure) but was encouraged to do so by my partner and the protected bike lanes on Bloor and Harbord streets.\nPremier Ford meddling in Toronto municipal decisions is not only unproductive and divisive, it's also dangerous. 6 people have been killed biking this year and that is 6 too many. I strongly believe that true urban centres should be designed with safety in mind and not just be car sewers for people to drive through (at often reckless speeds).\nRemoving bike lanes does nothing to reduce congestion. More cars on the road are and will continue to be the primary cause of gridlock in Toronto. Creating alternatives to driving, such as public transit is the only way to effectively move cars off the road and decrease congestion for road users.\n"
