        "comment": "Summary: This bill is designed in bad faith by the Government, who is not only overstepping their boundaries with bike lanes but is also disrespecting our environment and our future by using it to forcefully build Highway 413.\nI\u2019m submitting my comments with no support for Bill 212.  This bill has been created in bad faith by the Government to enact actions that are dangerous to citizens, ideologically driven, and directly contrary with any factual information around how to solve the mobility and traffic challenges those in Ontario are facing.\nThe goals of this bill are stated to help get Ontarians out of gridlock and moving, except the legislation will do the exact opposite.  To get ourselves out of gridlock and congestion we need to provide safe, reliable alternatives to driving.  This means building more bike lanes, providing more transit options, adding in transit priority, and giving people alternative routes that don\u2019t involve every trip ending up with individuals and families having to drive.\nOn top of this, the act of micromanaging the already existing bike lanes, which folks in their communities helped support and build, is going to decrease the safety of our citizens and roadways, increase health care impacts through an increase in injuries and deaths from interactions with motorists, and overshadow what tools municipalities have to grow and build their cities.\nAlso tucked into this legislation is a reduction in the environmental rules and oversights that help keep our beautiful province beautiful and healthy.  The goals to help expedite the Highway 413 pet project of the current Government (at the time of writing) are patronizing and destructive.\nQuality alternatives, like increased transit options, would go further at reducing the impact of congestion and traffic for those around the GTA without the need for Highway 413, but as is now the normal for this Government, this legislation is based on opinion and not fact.\nAs with roadways, bikeways also have induced demand, see attached link on \u201cLatest Evidence on Induced Travel Demand: An Evidence Review\u201d for more information about induced demand.\nBicycle ridership in Toronto has been looking to hit record levels in 2024. According to a September 2024 CBC article on Bike Share Toronto, \u201cBike Share Toronto set to beat 2023 ridership record by October\u201d, \u201cSo far this year, riders in Toronto have taken 4.7 million Bike Share trips, already overtaking total ridership in 2022 and fast approaching the 5.7 million mark set in 2023, according to Bike Share Toronto director Justin Hanna.\u201d\nThis means that more bike lanes and traffic management will help folks feel safe and secure enough to get out of their cars and use bicycles to get around the city.  Doing so reduces the number of automobile trips and with this the number of automobiles on the road.  This is exactly what the province is hoping for, less congestion, which can only be achieved sustainably through long term investments in our alternative infrastructure.\nOn top of the actions that the Bill describes, much of this Bill is designed to impact the City of Toronto but is overreaching to encompass the entire Province.\nI believe we can achieve many of the intended goals set out in this Bill, but not in the way the Bill is designed.  My challenge to MPPs, get on your bike and bike to work, around your neighbourhood, or with your kids, and quickly you\u2019ll see how it feels to be the unprotected vulnerable road user, but you\u2019ll also see how nice it is to get out and ride.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives and reduce traffic congestion, and are a key part of any modern city. It\u2019s vitally important to allow bike lane construction, and keep existing lanes, to ensure people can get around effectively. Especially in cities where the infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, a car-first mentality will only lead to increased congestion. We have to collectively admit that this law is not about saving people time but rather pandering to the lowest common denominator of intelligence without concern for evidence-based thought. As a final note, biking in Toronto is unsafe outside of bike lanes. This bill will cost Canadian lives.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this Bill 212.   As a driver and cyclist, I always opt to cycle if there is a bike lane as it is faster and more efficient.  Removing bike lanes will force myself and many others to drive which increases congestion everywhere.  This Bill is provincial overreach which overrides our own City's planned long-term roadmap for our Cycling Network plan.  We should be supporting initiatives to get cars off the road by creating safer routes for all types of traffic, which would lead to decreased congestion on our roads.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike tracks on Bloor, University and Yonge makes no sense:\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds to remove recently installed cycle tracks installed at taxpayer expense\n\u2022\tThe cycle tracks were installed after considerable design work and consultation. Provincial involvement in this after the fact is just intrusion into matters better addressed (and already addressed)  by the City of Toronto\n\u2022\tAs a driver, I prefer not to have cyclists mixed in with automobiles\n\u2022\tAs a parent, I worry about my daughter having to share the sidewalks (even if it is illegal) with cyclists who consider the sidewalk safer than the road\n\u2022\tThere is no evidence that removing the cycle tracks will significantly reduce congestion. Induced demand makes clear both that the removing the cycle tracks will not reduce congestion and that leaving them will encourage more cycling, which has multiple benefits for increasing road capacity, and for riders and society at large. Recent trends show increased use of cycling in Toronto, and this can only be expected to continue to increase, particularly with so many buildings being built with little or no vehicle parking. This will mean more cyclists mixing with vehicles in the absence of cycle tracks\n\u2022\tEven if it were appropriate to redirect cycle tracks to nearby non-arterial streets, there are not appropriate alternative streets in these locations\n\u2022\tThese cycle tracks parallel Toronto subway lines. For commuters making trips beyond convenient distances for cycling should be encouraged to use public transit, rather than making the roads less safe for cyclists, pedestrians and ultimately car drivers. Here the province could provide operating cost support to reduce fares and improve the reliability, frequency, and comfort of the TTC system.\n"

        "comment": "Hello there,\nAs I'm sure many other people have commented (whether here or in countless other spheres of debate), this \"anti-cycling\" policy will do nothing to improve the mobility of Ontarians.\nEven before the bike lanes, there was gridlock. And if the bike lanes are removed, there will still be gridlock. The concept is known as induced demand, which has been observed since the 30s. Building larger and more roads/highways \"does not alleviate transportation congestion, it only aggravates it\".\nIf the Ontario government was serious about improving mobility for Ontarians (including car drivers), it would mean giving people more options instead of making cars the only option. This includes bicycles, as well as diverse public transit options, and walking.\nMany cities around the world have taken the lead to dismantle their car infrastructure in favour of more options. The result? Way less traffic, way happier and productive humans.\nWhy can't Toronto do the same?\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes have been proven to ease congestion in cities and to help get people moving. They are not subject to traffic jams as experienced in cars. The suggestion to use secondary roads does not help bike riders to getting where they want to go efficiently on destinations on main streets. It is not an efficient use of taxpayers money to have these lanes removed and short sighted.\n"

        "comment": "It's overreaching that this bill will lead to the removal of bike lanes in Toronto. Why is Doug Ford taking so much interest in the urban planning of Toronto? He is the premier of the entire province. Maximizing the number of cars on the road will not ease congestion. It will lead to more single-occupancy drivers, and will not solve gridlock. I use bike lanes throughout the city and also bike on roads with no dedicated bike lanes. The ones on Bloor Street, University Street, and Yonge Street are essential infrastructure in this city. I also have a car and frequently drive. I would much rather drive on the roads with bikers in their own dedicated lanes. There are studies that have been done by the UK, New York City, the European Commission, WSP and RAND Europe, and even Toronto itself (see the Bloor Street Bike Lane Pilot Project link). Separating bikes from other traffic is simply safer - reducing collisions with cars, and will disincentivize people from driving as there are more options for travel. It is better for the environment and healthier for people in the city.\nPlease, do not remove the existing infrastructure for bicyclists in this city. It would be heartbreaking to damage and move backwards in the progress for a more accessible city. More cars are not the answer. Even in housing being built currently, there are far fewer parking spots being built than biking parking spots. Doug Ford's Housing Plan establishes that less parking spots should be built in new housing. It doesn't make sense why that would be the case while also claiming that removing bike lanes to put more cars on the road would be better for the city. Please, do not do this.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. The false dichotomy of cycling commuters versus car commuters needs to stop. Toronto is a world-class city where many, many people choose to cycle all year. They go to the movies, pick up groceries, drop off their kids at school, and just cycle for leisure. Tourists cycle as a way of viewing our wonderful city, taking advantage of our excellent bike share program. I cycle about 95% of the places I go to, and would certainly patron many less if I was forced to drive everywhere due to unsafe biking infrastructure. Biking gives you the whole city at your fingertips in a way cars never could. We need many more bike lanes, for myriad uses. Not less. Thanks!\n"

        "comment": "There is no evidence that bike lanes cause congestion. In fact, studies show that bike lanes make the roads safer for all users...pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.\nHowever, what bothers me even more about this legislation is that it takes away decision power from municipalities. Municipal councils and staff know their roads and their constituents. If they veer too far in one direction, their constituents can vote them out of office. I see no need for this provicial legislation other than political posturing and trying to create a rift between cyclists and motorists.\nPlease reconsider this legislation and allow municipalities to make their own deicisions about bikes lanes.\n"

If they are removed, they will force me back into my car which will only add to the congestion and cost of living. Taking a detour isn't possible either. Side streets don't go direct East and west like on Bloor.\nThe bike lanes are designed for safety. We need to learn to share the roads between cyclists and cars. I drive too and when I'm on the roads, I'm happy the bike lanes are there so I don't hit anyone.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not solve the congestion issue. With an ever growing population and a limited amount of road widths, we have figure out how to fit more people on the road not more cars.\nYou could limit the size of cars to sub compacts or smaller ( unless you are recognized delivery or a licensed trade) this is unlikely to happen quickly enough as fleet turnover is not instantaneous. You could encourage people to use smaller different modes of travel ( for those who can) this has been having a huge change along with safe bike lanes for people to use. You also have couple this with an even large investment in transit to increase the number of people you can easily use transit and so free up space on our finite roads for those that must use private vehicles.\nAll research shows that extra lanes have a very short term improvement after which it is as bad if not worse. This is a short sighted, short term proposal costing large amounts of money with no gain. Please invest such money and more into new transit and more bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I wanted to add to my previous comment that in Etobicoke & Bloor West I regularly count 50 cars for every bike I see on Bloor. 50:1 is not proportional at all, these bike lanes need to go.\nIn winter, and when it's dark it's not uncommon to see zero bikes on Bloor. So why have a dedicated lane?\nEveryone in Etobicoke takes the Martin Goodman Trail to cycle downtown. We already have Avenue and Harbord.\nPlease remove the bikes lanes on Bloor and also remove them off Dupont as well. Just 15 years ago I was driving on Dupont at 40-50km/h during rush hour. As soon as the bike lanes came in on Dupont I was driving at 20-30km/h.\nMy 2024 commute is realistically double my 2010 commute time.\nAs someone who cycles as well, I never used artery roads. Bikes don't need main roads, side roads are fine. Roads like Poplar Plains were my favourite to cycle on because they were completely separate from main roads. We need more bike lanes on side roads.\nPlease remove the bike lanes off Bloor, Dupont and University.\n"

        "comment": "The only way to reduce gridlock in cities like Toronto is to provide residents with safe, reliable, alternatives to driving. Bike lanes are incredibly important pieces of infrastructure for the city of Toronto, and other cities and municipalities in Ontario. For those unable to afford motor vehicles and those within biking distance of their work or school, they serve an incredibly important purpose and see use every single day. Removing the Bloor, Yonge, and University bike lanes would be detrimental to those who rely on these for their commute, and would lead to more people using their cars due to the addition of another lane of traffic. This induced demand has been seen to increase traffic, rather than decrease it according to many studies. I have linked a literature review which details induced demand.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the power this legislation takes away from municipal governments and puts in the hands of the provincial government. I do not believe the issue of bike lanes is to the jurisdiction of the Ontario government in any way. This infrastructure is primarily for the municipality\u2019s inhabitants, and thus it is up to them to decide the fate of these bike lanes. Please reconsider this legislation.\nThank you,\nJonathan, a concerned user of Toronto Bike Ride Share and Bike Lanes\n"

        "comment": "All of the existing bike lanes are built as a result of extensive studies and have been in use by many cyclist. They make cycling in the city a lot safer, and also significantly reduce the amount of vehicular traffic along those streets. Removing them is going to make cycling more dangerous, creates more gridlock, and to be very honest, a complete waste of government fund. I strongly recommend the provincial government to reconsider the plan to remove any bike lanes, bikes lanes that the people of Toronto had been requesting for decades.\nThank you very much for your time.\n"
