        "comment": "Thanks for the opportunity to comment on Bill 212.\nFirst, I want to clarify that cyclists in this province are often commuters, in need of travelling quickly and efficiently to their destinations: to travel to work on time, to drop their kids off at school, to pick up groceries for their families, and to participate in the economic and social life of the province. I am deeply concerned that Bill 212 has an implicit assumption that only motor vehicle drivers need to reach their destinations, and that cyclists must be out for recreation. We need to prioritize safe and efficient travel opportunities for those using active transportation options--pedestrians and cyclists.\nSecond, I want to note that separate and protected bicycle lanes with adequate signage and specific signals make all traffic move more quickly, efficiently, and safely. When vehicles--motorized and self-powered--each have their own clear rules and spaces, and these are divided, too, from pedestrian traffic, everyone benefits.\nAnd third, I want to emphasize that municipalities should have the ability to implement infrastructure and design for active transport without the added burden of applying to the province. Even more pressingly, the city of Toronto should not be required to remove any bike lane infrastructure or regulations; such a move would undermine safe cities, threaten both cyclist and driver safety and well-being, harm families, and contravene commitments at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels to environmental protection and climate action.\nI'll end with a personal note: as a professional in Toronto who commutes to work by bicycle, I find myself scared on a daily basis. I travel some routes that do not yet have adequate bicycle lanes, and in those areas, now expect that cars will turn into my lane without looking and that drivers will open doors without checking. My simple commute--a 5km distance--should not require constant vigilance to stay uninjured and safe. In the stretches where there are protected bike lanes (e.g., part of College Street), I have a glimpse of the kind of urban future that we could build, where traffic moves smoothly and safely, a mix of transportation options contributes to a vibrant and lively city, and careful infrastructure and design ensures that all of us can make it home from work each day without harm.\nPlease protect Ontarians by protecting and expanding bike lanes. They benefit all of us.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not take away any bicycle infrastructure! It is important for people of all ages, economic backgrounds and improves quality of life. Studies show that car-dependent cities, such as those of Ontario, are less safe. Safe bicycle infrastructure provides a more efficient mode of transportation that scales for growth better than personal cars. Think ahead! I live in Ottawa downtown core and do not support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I really hope you reconsider this bill. Bicycling isn't just a hobby. Its a means of transportation. Sure, there are personal reasons to bike, such as for health reasons or to save money. But bicycling can also improve communities as a whole. It allows younger people or people who can't afford a car a way to get around. Streets with bike lanes can move more people per hour than the same street with only car lanes. Its important to create a network of bike lanes to encourage more people to ride. But the number one reason to keep bike lanes is for safety. Mixing cars and bikes is dangerous, and many bicyclists have been killed over the years due to collisions with motor vehicles. I left a supporting link to a Youtube video that explores this topic in more depth. I do not support Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is misguided and not supported by data. Removing bike lanes will not ease congestion. There is no data to support this position. There are countless studies and research papers that outline that more lanes means more cars on the road (referred to as induced demand) which will lead to even more congestion. That is why world-class cities all over the world have and continue to move towards adding bike lanes and investing in public transit. We are at least a decade behind and the removal of bike lanes will set us back another decade on top of that. We're going backwards. This measure will not ease congestion, but what it will do is strip all the safety that comes with these bike lanes, not just for people on bikes, but also for pedestrians, force even more people to choose their car as their mode of transportation, and further fuel the climate crisis we find ourselves in. Congestion will not and can not be addressed if you don't provide convenient and safe alternatives for people to choose a mode of transportation other than their car. It's impossible, especially for a city with Toronto's expanding population. Toronto has had traffic forever and will continue to have traffic forever unless we address the root cause of the traffic: we aren't investing nearly enough towards safe and convenient alternatives such as a connected network of bike lanes and quick, convenient and affordable public transit. The removal of these bike lanes will only set us back further and will undoubtedly come at the cost of human life. Climate change will continue to escalate, people will continue to be killed on our unsafe streets, and congestion will remain as bad as ever. This is not the answer.\n"

        "comment": "Monumental waste of tax dollars.\nCycling infrastructure saves lives and investments here have contributed to more bike ridership than ever.  This becomes a self fulfilling investment by providing a safe alternative that takes cars off the road and reduces burden on the TTC.\nThe only time bike lanes that should not be considered is if they take away entire lanes from cars. None of the proposed removals will add back car lanes, all they will do is free up some more parking spaces. Traffic will still be bad and this will be a complete waste of time and money.\nOur Premier needs to stop playing Mayor and making petty decisions to spite his former colleagues. Do some real work Doug.\n- Homeowner, bike rider, car driver, concerned taxpayer\n"

If there are no bike lanes, I will start using my car -> this will add another car to congestion downtown\n- Every bike on the road is one less car. Many people ONLY bike because fo bike lanes.\n- Most drivers will agree: Compare having 100 bikes vs. 100 extra personal cars/ubers/taxis in traffic in front of them.\n- Incentivize biking, torontonians LOVE it (bike share grew 24% in 2023, to 5.7 million riders), do it safely and you'll remove cars. If you remove bike lanes, you're adding cars.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is an enormous mismanagement of priorities from the province lead by the Ford government. The cities in Ontario are suffering from a huge deficit of transportation availability, rather than focusing on increasing public transit and giving people of large cities more options of transportation this bill cripples many who do not have access to a car. This bill grossly favours people who have access to cars. Bike lanes provide a safe infrastructure for alternative transportation for people who don't drive or don't want to drive. Every bicycle on the street is a car not on the road, there are only benefits of increasing bicycle infrastructure, it is better for the environment, it is an active method of transportation that is better for the citizens of Ontario.\nIn Toronto just this year there have been 6 cyclists death and 12 pedestrian deaths, increasing car density will only increase the casualties. The province should be more focused on delivering mass transit to reach large urban centers like Toronto. Time after time it has been scientifically proven that adding more lanes in cars doesn't decrease traffic, if that were the case then 401 would be the most efficient highway in the world. This bill is very ill informed and it has no benefits to any road users, it definitely won't reduce gridlock nor will it save anyone time. It will do the opposite of that and the cost will be bore by the vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians with their lives. The roads aren't exclusive to just cars. It should be thought of it as being useful for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I don't see why the provincial government needs to add more bureaucracy and waste it's time micromanaging perfectly competent municipal governments, I'd much rather my provincial government focus it's time on its own domain. This is a waste of government resources doubling up provincial and municipal duties, only adding more bureaucracy and red tape. Not only that but bike lanes are better for drivers, unless you plan to limit the freedom of Ontarians even more and make cycling illegal then people will still be biking on these streets (I should know I walk by the intersection of Bloor and St George every single day, twice a day and see cyclists every time) but my merging them this will make things harder for everyone involved. Drivers won't have to worry about trying to avoid cyclists and cyclists won't have to worry about dying. Unless the government is taking a radical anti car driver pro bike accident position then I'm not seeing any benefits to this, and even if there are, the provincial government should leave it to the cities to manage their own transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I find this proposal extremely heavy-handed and short-sighted. The \"just one more lane\" philosophy has been disastrous for urban centres for decades, and ripping out bike lanes and making more people take more cars on the road will *increase* gridlock, not decrease it. I live in South Etobicoke, and I frequently take the Bloor bike lane (along with its connecting streets) to access my job in downtown. It's healthier, cheaper, and is one less car on the road. Bikes aren't just used for commuting to work, but also to grab groceries, access transit stations faster than biking or waiting for a bus, or for children to get to and from school.\nThis sort of backwards thinking is why Toronto is still decades behind for having a robust light rail/subway system. Transit and bikes are far more efficient than one person per car. Clearly ripping out existing bike infrastructure to \"add one more lane\" is a counter-intuitive measure. Just look at how the 401 is backed up, and that has 18 lanes!\nWithout the existing infrastructure we have for cyclists, I would personally feel much more endangered while trying to live my life. Bike lanes and routes help alleviate that. And, if we had an even more extensive system of bike lanes and multi-use paths, maybe others would feel safe enough to try riding too. There are multiple studies showing how people are more likely to bike when the infrastructure is there, and I think we should focus on facts.\nI beg the premier to look up what induced demand is and how it works, and to also not put his woes of driving to downtown on the rest of the populace. If he's so worried about his own commute, maybe he should learn how to take transit, or, better yet, build a bike lane to North Etobicoke and actually try it himself.\n"

        "comment": "we absolutely should not be building hwy 413. the ecological impacts far outweigh the benefits, and just because you've ignored or cancelled the need for an ecological impact report doesn't mean it's a good idea.\nBike lanes are hugely important and in fact we should have more of them and they should have a real separation from the road. A curb or something. The most dangerous part of biking is the irresponsible and dangerous drivers. People getting around the city who aren't in cars deserve to be safe too. We can lessen congestion by making transit VIABLE. We need bus and Streetcar priority. It shouldn't take more time to get somewhere by TTC than it does by car. We can relieve gridlock by making transit the more appealing (aka faster) option across the city.\n"

What purpose does the government even serve if it is not to provide a basic level of safety for both cyclists and drivers?\nPremier Doug Ford's rhetoric and misinformation on bike lanes is sad, as Toronto especially needs more lanes to complete its networks and achieve a critical mass for cyclists to use the infrastructure. Commuter %s are low because the government will not invest in infrastructure. It is the chicken and the egg.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s very frustrating how car centric this approach is, especially given the research on induced demand. Lane additions often have the end result of the same commute times, although it is often overlooked that this means the total throughput of cars has increased for the same commute time which is a benefit. But is this the most efficient use of tax dollars to improve commutes when taken holistically? Additionally, the extra cars ok the road are impacting the local air quality through particulate matter, ozone, and NOx emissions (see link). New bike lanes will also have induced demand where more people will bike if the lane exists. Some of these people are likely driving right now so bike lanes could have a reduction in traffic, though probably not enough to completely offset a reduction in lanes. Public transit, carpool incentives, and tolls could all be used to reduce the number of cars which would improve commutes for all remaining drivers. Not everyone can afford a car and these other methods are more efficient at moving people compared to cars that typically carry a single passenger. With passenger vehicles, many of the benefits are only for the driver but the externalities (increased traffic, noise, pollution) are felt by the entire community. I\u2019ve lived west of the city for years and all the lane widening on the 401 just seems to move the congestion point around with commute times barely changing. This is not to say that more lanes or highway expansion should never be considered, just that it should not be the default. Would making the 401 a toll road from 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm be more effective in reducing commute times, raising money to pay for infrastructure upgrades, ensuring that the only people on the roads at peak times are people who need to be? It would be great to have a government brave enough to propose and study this. Tolls in Stockholm initially faced huge backlash but once implemented and the impacts were seen the support for the tolls increased and it was years before congestion levels returned to the pre-toll level. The costs of tolls would be somewhat offset by reduced fuel consumption while stuck in traffic and potentially reduced commute times. A pushback to this proposal would be the impact on secondary roads which may see increased traffic and the impact on lower income commuters. A demographic study of income levels of commuters may show this would be less of an impact and could be offset with some sort of rebate program. This is merely a proposed alternative that should be studied instead of just always jumping to \u201cwhat would improve commute times for cars only?\u201d\nFinally, this approach to provincial oversight of bike lanes may have some justification in Toronto, but seems to be adding red tape to small and medium municipalities. Is this really necessary outside of the GTA?\n"
