        "comment": "Bike lanes in this part of the city support the viability of healthy and efficient individualism which is a boon to economic grit. The supposed time saved here is informed by stinking thinking. Self-reliance opposes the conformity to vehicle ownership and negative health impacts which costs taxpayers.  Bike lanes prioritize the short trip traveller who is most likely to make multiple shopping stops and will increase property value in the district highrise properties. A bicycle is legally to take a full lane anyway and the removal of bike lanes will render these avenues unusable in rush hours.\n"

We know that the data clearly shows that bike lanes improve health outcomes are beneficial to the environment and result in financial gains for businesses along these routes.\nWhat this government is doing is pointlessly cruel, will cost Ontarians money but ultimately and far more worrisome it is likely that deaths will result if this legislation is enacted. The very fact that the government has added a clause trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility for these deaths shows a callousness I use to think was reserved to psychopaths and serial killers like Paul Bernardo.\nI am asking that this government focus on its Provincial Responsibilities and respect Ontario's citizens democratically elected municipalities to make decisions that best serve their community.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes were very poorly arranged and set up. Almost like they did no research into it and were rushed into a budget without a budget.\nThe bike lanes have forced vehicle traffic into the side streets and away from supporting local businesses. There is almost no parking available on Bloor St now.\nI do believe that done properly using common sense they could have worked. This would push some of the bike lanes into the parallel streets and keep intersections safer to pedestrians crossing at traffic lights. I also believe cyclists need to be educated on rules of the road.  E bikes need to be eliminated from Toronto streets as they do not have licence plates or insurance and could cause substantial damage to pedestrians or personal property with the high speeds they can reach.\n"

Cyclists don't disappear by eliminating the infrastructure they use, they'll just end up mixed in with cars where they previously had a slightly safer option. This bill will make travel more difficult for car users and cyclists. The provincial government needs to keep their nose out of municipal responsibilities and focus on province wide concerns.

        "comment": "I am extremely disappointed by this proposal. My city, Waterloo, has done a terrific job of supporting modes of transportation other than the car. This proposal feels like a slap in the face and a step backwards.\nIt's 2024, we should know better than to think that adding more lanes will solve congestion. Ontario and the GTA are the most densely populated parts of Canada. Any road infrastructure we build will quickly be as congested as it was before its construction.\nCycling on the other hand, allows us to get around and take up far less space than we do in personal cars. Apart from reduced congestion, there are numerous other benefits to society when people choose to bike rather than drive including less pollution, less noise, less danger to pedestrians, and a healthier overall population.\nThe province's decision to reach into municipal matters feels like a colossal overreach. Municipalities should have the right to build the cities the way they want and not have the province interfere in what we know is best for our cities.\n"

I spent two decades in this city where my only options for travel were driving or TTC, no bike lanes existed and biking was a dangerous endeavour. Seeing families and individuals use these lanes now, safely, makes me really think of all of the time I\u2019ve wasted in traffic. With everything there may be a learning curve for drivers, but this is by far the best answer for reducing gridlock and traffic in the future. Toronto would be making a huge mistake by removing these bike lanes, more are needed, not less.\n"

But more importantly, this government is bent on building more car infrastructure, knowing full well how long and how costly it will get for the tax-payers and the impact these projects will have on our living environment for generations. It is also overreaching with land expropriation and lack of compensation for land owners.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there, I\u2019m disappointed that Bill 212 has been rushed through with such vague, dangerous language. This sloppiness allows for far too much overreach from the Province in every Schedule item. I\u2019m strongly opposed to Bill 212.\nI made an entire video breaking down my thoughts, and that can be found online. That video is making the rounds online and for good reason: the schedules that go over Highway 413 (the majority of the 22 pages of the Bill 413) have not been in the news and instead, the bike lanes have been all that have been talked about. It's important that they're talked about because removing them is wrong on so many levels, however, highway development was snuck in under the noses of the public.\nDoug Ford specifically stated in the past that he would not be touching the Greenbelt but here he is, bypassing environmental assessments and implementing land grabs.\nAs for everything to do with the Provincial overreach of matters to do with bike lanes and removing the ability to sue the Province for issues that the Province creates (endangering road users who are outside of vehicles), that\u2019s not service the citizens of Ontario. It\u2019s taking rights away.\nBill 212 won\u2019t reduce gridlock because more lanes simply don\u2019t reduce traffic, they just cause MORE people to drive, which then creates more congestion. The fact that the Minister of Transportation doesn\u2019t grasp this makes him unfit for the position.\nOntarians NEED more options to get around, other than being forced to drive personal automobiles, which are only getting more and more expensive.\nThe Province of Ontario needs to be using the money that they\u2019ve earmarked for Highway Expansions for Healthcare and Education because the money is clearly there.\nAs for housing affordability, the Missing Middle needs to be the majority of units that we are building \u2013 not Single Family Dwellings.\nSo in the end, Bill 212 will neither reduce gridlock nor save anyone time.\n"

To the extent there has been an increase in traffic, this is almost always a result of cars illegally parking in bike lanes and blocking traffic.  A designated bike lane makes driving along Bloor Street much calmer and less stressful.\nOn another level, I feel these decisions should be made by municipalities, since Toronto residents are the ones most impacted .\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly support the move to have bike lanes removed, and new bike lanes reviewed and approved by the provincial government.\nFurther, currently implemented bike lanes, particularly on major streets, should be reviewed for removal.\nAs a resident of Swansea, I have personally witnessed the current bike lanes on Bloor Street West have been a major issue:\n-Blocked emergency vehicles !  With only one lane, there is simply nowhere for vehicles to move when emergency vehicles are approaching.  This has caused the emergency vehicles to await the eventual traffic to clear\u2026 delaying arrival by an unacceptable time factor.  I\u2019m sure this will eventually lead to fatalities, as time is the major factor in life saving situations!\n- Gridlock !  Travel time has tripled on this path during daytime and evening commutes.\n- Poor implementation.  With the poor design of intervening bike lanes, raised platforms in some and car parking, have lead to driver and bikes both crossing into each others paths.\n- Blocking delivery vehicles.  With only single lanes, and now further limited parking on Bloor St. W., delivery vehicles will often simply park in the bike lane!  Forcing bike traffic to divert into traffic, which is further endangering to bike riders with narrow single lane traffic!\n"

        "comment": "I am have been a resident in the islington and bloor area for nearly 10 years. I am strongly supportive of removing the bike lanes in bloor west. The reduction in flow of traffic arising from the installation is patently obvious. This reduction presumably is supposed to be offset by public benefits.  I don\u2019t see how that can be given the obvious deleterious effects.  Reduction in traffic flow generally results greater carbon emissions from vehicles.  Emergency vehicles and school buses cannot get to their destinations on time. With the hassle of getting to a destination on Bloor, small, family owned businesses are likely suffering - and I expect they are still recovering from the pandemic.\nI\u2019m not against cyclists or bike lanes, but there must be a better location for them or very strong evidence that the benefit outweighs what I outlined above.  I strongly doubt it does.  Even over the long term, Etobicoke and adjacent Mississauga area is becoming increasingly dense.  Just look at how many condos are coming up in the Bloor area.   What alternative transportation is in the city\u2019s plans for the expected increase in east-west traffic? Is all that traffic just going to jump on the TTC?  They\u2019re not.  And even if it did, imagine the disaster of shuttle buses trying to move along bloor when the TTC inevitably fails.\nAs a family whose kids now walk to a co pool to avoid the bus getting there late, I am also concerned by the cars taking detours to avoid traffic on Bloor going at breakneck speeds through residential areas.  Someone is going to get hurt or killed one day.\nI believe in making good policy decisions that balance competing interests, including interest in a greener, healthier environment.  Unfortunately, the policy that resulted in installing the bike lanes was ill conceived. The added cost of removal adds insult to injury. But when you make a mistake, you have to own it and fix it - hopefully some ingenuity can be applied to mitigate the cost.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of the Annex and a frequent user of the roads in question (Avenue, Yonge, Bloor) by BOTH car and bike, I would like to object to the proposed framework on the following grounds:\n1) There is clear evidence that bike lanes promote safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and I note that cyclists have died on these routes in the past (the stretch between bloor and dupont on Avenue road is well known as the most dangerous in the city)\n2) There is no clear evidence that the creation of bike lanes slow traffic given a) cyclists have to intermingle with traffic in the absence of bike lanes, slowing car traffic; b) car traffic over time migrates to the 'path of least resistance' thus fewer lanes does not mean more traffic (if this were true, then more lanes would mean less traffic, but the 401 should put that argument to rest); c) in the absence of bike lanes, you often have cars stopping, parking legally / illegally, negating any possible benefit of the extra lane; d) bike lanes are often associated with other improvements (e.g. a dedicated right turn lane at bloor and bedford) which improve traffic flow\n3) The presence of cycling lanes encourage the use of bikes, which a) improves people health and well being, thereby ultimately reducing our publicly funded health care costs and b) reduces our carbon emissions which is critical to a sustainable future\n4) There are better ways to reduce traffic than wasting tax payer money to remove lanes that were just put in.  For example, the government could focus on 1) Getting the LRT on Eglington actually in service (what an embarrassment), 2) accelerating the metrolinx Queen extension, 3) implementing a congestion charge like many world leading cities (e.g. London), which has the dual effect of raising money and reducing traffic\n5) Toronto is behind (not ahead) world leading cities in the deployment of bike lanes, including London, New York (Manhattan) and Paris, cities with far, far more traffic than Toronto.\nI feel strongly about this matter and will be voting against this government in the next election should this bill pass (who could vote for a government that fights a rear-guard action against progress and change for the better, meddling in local affairs for which we have a municipal government doing the will of the people).\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply disappointed with the content of Bill 212 for the following reasons:\n- Over stepping municipal jurisdiction: Local municipalities should have the right to dictate how they should organize roads under their jurisdiction. Forcing them to get approval from the Province for any bike lane installation is gross over reach and horribly inefficient.\n- Failing to improve traffic: Loss of bike lanes, building of more highways, and lowering cost of licensure encourages more people to drive which makes traffic worse. We need to invest in infrastructure that reduces car traffic to make driving better.\n- Wasting tax payer money: Provincial engineers should not be wasting their time reviewing bike lane proposals all over Ontario when large scale transit projects are massively behind schedule and over budget. Government should not be wasting money ripping out infrastructure that was already installed and working.\n- Insufficient process: Environmental assessments are important to ensuring that infrastructure projects are designed responsibly and do not cause more harm than good. Water ways, green space, natural habitats, and air quality are more important than sprawl development.\n- Cruelty: Bike lanes keep cyclist safe. Removing bike lanes ensures that more cyclist have to put themselves in danger to go about their daily lives. Temporary traffic delays (a couple years as lifestyles change) do not warrant more road deaths. Home owners deserve fair treatment when negotiating with their government. Allowing expropriation to take place with no option of extension is unconscionable.\n"

        "comment": "Living in the Dovercourt Village area of Toronto, I have come to enjoy grabbing a bike share bicycle and heading to the store to pick up a thing or two. I have a car, but it's much more of a headache to try and find parking. I don't have a bicycle of my own, but have been thinking of selling my car because of my proximity to the subway, bus lines, and the bike lane on Bloor, and instead getting a bike -- renting a car if I need. I grew up in the suburbs, and only cycled for leisure, but now that I have separated cycling lanes that get me straight to the stores on Bloor, I use them because I feel safe using them. With the proposed legislation to remove bicycle lanes on Bloor, it makes me reconsider selling my car. Another person holding you up because I'm turning but you're going through. One more car making it through that light before it turns red for you. Or one less car because I'm on a bike, which takes up a lot less room than a car. I have family on the East End of Toronto, just off Danforth, and have taken a bike to visit them -- it's the same time to bike, subway, or drive, and on a bike I don't have to pay anything. It's a couple turns before I'm on Bloor/Danforth, and then one more before I arrive. If bike lanes are put on side streets, this turns into a convoluted mess of a trip that no one will take because it's not straightforward, and longer, pushing cyclists onto Bloor St anyway.\nI walk more than I bike, and the bike lanes help provide a safe buffer between the drivers and the sidewalk; the unfortunate reality is that people on sidewalks are hit all the time. I've been able to convince a couple friends to come biking with me, and being on bike allows us to quickly hop off and go get some ice cream, or stop in at a store. If bike lanes aren't on avenues with stores, this just won't happen. If I'm in a car with a friend driving to a destination, we don't stop along the way. Businesses will be negatively impacted by having bike lanes removed.\nThis legislation is complete overreach, clearly designed to distract from real issues, and bolster the base in the face of an early election. Not only will removing cycling infrastructure not solve the issue of congestion, it will endanger so many people -- drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.\nI am completely against this legislation and I urge you to pander to your base with something else, and drop this awful legislation from Bill 212.\n"
