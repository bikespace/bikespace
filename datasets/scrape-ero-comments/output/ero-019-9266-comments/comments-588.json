        "comment": "If you want to remove traffic in the city, you need less cars, not less bicycles. Forcing more red tape on the paving of new bike lanes is a huge mistake that is bound to create more traffic and more unsafe conditions for bicyclers.\nI only began bicycling a few months ago as a desire to avoid the use of cars and public transit, both of which are polluters. In order to be safe, as a novice bicycler, I rely heavily on the major bike lanes and especially the ones on Bloor and University. I believe all streets, wherever possible, should have bike lanes. In my experience, many drivers ignore the divisions and violate the separation of lanes. What we need is for drivers to be tested on their education on how to drive in relation to bike lanes, to make bicycling safer in the city.\nI therefore strongly urge against adding hurdles to municipalities creating more bike lanes. I especially urge against the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic.\nif you want to end traffic issues in Toronto, create car, free zones in the city center, and encourage more Torontonians to bicycle, e-bike, or e-scoot.\n"

        "comment": "There's no actual evidence to say more traffic lanes can help with traffic, in fact, there's extensive evidence to the contrary\u2014 one of such evidences being that more support and space for bicycles can significanly improve car traffic by both making bikes (which are a space, fuel, and financial saving alternative) available to the wider public as a safer transportation option and also by giving pedestrians an even wider berth from cars. Bike lanes are also used by many mobility device users, specifically motorized wheelchair users, as a safer lane to move around where they do not get impeded by uneven sidewalks, construction, narrow passages, or other pedestrians, making the sidewalks often safer for non-motorized pedestians as well. Skateboarders, roller bladers, and scooter riders often also enjoy bike lanes for the same aforementioned reasons.\nBike lanes make cities safer and better for evreryone and it is extremely saddening that I have to comment on this to hopefully stop them from being ripped from us. I yearn for the day I am voting to add more bike lanes, fund more rental bikes and other non-fuel vehicles, make the bike lanes wider and add physical protective measures to ensure bike lane users cannot be harmed by motor vehicles.\nPlease do not take these incredibly beneficial additions to the province away from us.\n"

        "comment": "As a healthcare worker in a downtown Toronto Hospital: many of our downtown healthcare workers ( nurses, admin staff, mental health workers, environmental workers etc) live and work downtown. Many of us are not high earners. Driving to work would mean high costs for parking, gas, insurance and maintenance. Many of us cycle to work to provide the city with healthcare. We want to come and go safely. We want to stay healthy and active. Sitting in a car, driving to go to work, paying expensive parking fees and running the risks of being rear ended by people texting while driving is not my idea of \u201csmart living\u201d.\nTaking away bike lanes is dangerous, wasteful, and a short sighted solution to solving a traffic problem.\nNot only are there more cars coming into the city each day, cars have also tripled in size. No wonder people like taking their bikes and leaving the gridlock behind. Please don\u2019t punish cyclists for the increased car/truck traffic.\nThere are other ways to reduce traffic:\n- put a customer paid tax on (Amazon) delivery so people think twice about having cars come to their doorstep every time they\u2019re in need of something\n- create incentives that encourage people to cycle more (eg bikelanes)\n- encourage car pooling\n- increase reliable public transportation downtown, so more people will use it.\n- increase taxes according to income in ways that actually makes a difference.\nPlease don\u2019t make decisions based on the loud voices of a few. Families rely on these bike lanes. No more white bikes attached to street poles to indicate another death.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 contains several poor decisions about improving traffic with little-to-no evidence to support them.\nI am currently a car owner who drives in the city of the Toronto and GTA. As a former bicycle commuter who traveled on Bloor St. in an east-to-west direction both before and after the existing bike lane was constructed, I can say the Bloor St. bike lanes have had very positive effects for both cyclist and pedestrian safety and have had not increased my overall drive times by car in this area.\nGridlock on Bloor St. was a nightmare even without bike lanes, because the city of Toronto has severely inadequate public transit given its population. This has nothing to do with bike lanes. Removing bike lanes on this road or any other is costly and a poor decision. This money should instead be invested in more efficient methods of transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road in city centres.\nThere are too many cars on the road. That is what creates traffic and gridlock. This is not a controversial opinion, it is fact.\nLook at Los Angeles' severe traffic problems\u2014they have huge roads with many lanes and it has not resolved anything; it has only made traffic worse, and walking around in that city stressful and dangerous as the risk of being hit by a vehicle is very high. Toronto is following the same path with decisions such as those proposed in this Bill (see first supporting link).\nIf more people feel safe using alternative transportation methods, such as bicycles, but also newer technologies such as e-bikes, e-scooters, etc., which are becoming increasingly popular and also require a \"bike lane\", less people will drive cars, and thus congestion will decrease. If these individuals do not feel safe using these transportation methods, they will continue to drive (see second supporting link).\nNot only is this bill not based in evidence, but the government of Ontario is overstepping; traffic decisions should be left to municipalities, which each have their own unique challenges when it comes to traffic management.\nI will not be voting for the Ford administration in future elections as a result of this decision (nor any individuals involved in this Bill).\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern about the proposed removal of the Bloor Street bike lanes. These lanes have proven their value by significantly increasing cycling volumes\u2014up nearly 49% since their installation\u2014while reducing conflicts between cyclists and vehicles by 44%. Removing them would not only erase these safety gains but also increase the risk to children who now rely on these protected lanes for safe and active transportation.\nFrom a cost-benefit perspective, the bike lanes are a high-value investment. They have optimized the movement of people along Bloor Street by accommodating thousands of cyclists daily while reducing motor vehicle congestion modestly. Their removal would impose unnecessary costs for dismantling, disrupt the area during construction, and waste the resources already invested, all while undermining the city\u2019s efforts to promote sustainable and efficient urban mobility.\nMaintaining the bike lanes is a practical decision that aligns with the province\u2019s goals for safer roads, healthier communities, and reduced emissions. I urge you to consider the long-term benefits of keeping this infrastructure in place rather than incurring the financial and social costs of its removal. Thank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nERA Architects\n"

        "comment": "The three major bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge and University Avenues have been game-changers for me as a professional commuter in Toronto in the last few years. I have been commuting to a downtown-core office since 2017, primarily as a cyclist. It's my primary method of getting to work because it is (a) free; and (b) faster than any other option, including driving or TTCing. When I'm cycling, I'm in full control of my schedule to get to work, and not governed by construction delays, transit delays, or any other external impacts.\nBefore these bike lanes were formalized as separated, protected spaces, it was much scarier and less comfortable to get to work. Driving culture in downtown Toronto has been incredibly intense for years (and was intense and full of drivers who would be pushed to do illegal / scary things because they felt desperate in gridlock even before those bike lanes went in... this is NOT a context caused by the bike lanes), and the commute to work was not safe - but I did it anyway because of the reasons mentioned above.\nThe bike lanes have completely changed my experience. They make me feel safe, secure, and able to commute in a way that's much less stressful and on guard. I have been so proud to live in a city that's building progressive multi-modal infrastructure, which is in line with best practices in urban planning (I am an urban planner, with a Master of Planning degree). Beyond politics, there are many things your government is doing that are in line with best practices in planning (e.g. acceleration of the provision of housing, major moves to address municipal red tape), but this one is explicitly regressive and counter to best practices. Cyclists are also your constituents, and the fact that we don't necessarily have access to vehicles to drive to work, or that we just know it's always been impractical to drive into Toronto's downtown core during rush hour, should not exempt us from substantial infrastructure for a safe commute.\nFinally, the massive waste of taxpayer money involved in ripping out infrastructure that has JUST been built is mind-boggling, and it's amazing to me that this is even under consideration. Please, please don't do this.\nThank you very much for your time and attention.\n"

        "comment": "hello. regarding the proposal to remove existing bike lanes, and prevent future bike lane in the province of Ontario.  I am in favour of bike lanes. They make transportation much safer for cyclists and pedestrians, and prevent automobile accidents.\nI live in Cambridge, ON and have biked within in my city and to other cities.\nThere are times when you must have your car at the shop for repairs, and biking is a reliable way to get your car when you don't have a car.\nI personally find bike lanes to be a drastic safety improvement, and very helpful, especially along busy roads like Homer Watson in Kitchener, ON.\nDrivers are especially aggressive in Ontario cities, and do do not have concern for pedestrians and cyclists.  Even speed controlled school zones and parking lots are dangerous places, for pedestrians and also the other drivers obeying the rules. I have seen pedestrians run down in cross walks in my city.  Cyclists and people on motorized scooters opt to use the sidewalk since vehicle drivers are dangerous and negligent.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes reduce congestion as more people travel by bike. The safer people feel biking, the more likely they are to use it as transportation. Biking is inexpensive, easy on road infrastructure, and healthier for the body. A healthier population reduces heath care costs. And biking in a city increases business to local businesses.\nIf you persevere with building bike infrastructure, and give it a chance, we will ultimately come out ahead in commute times, better quality air, and health.\nI loved cycling around the cities in the Netherlands. What a joy! Copenhagen and Stockholm too. These great cities show how it can be done to the benefit of all.\n"

It is being advertised as a way to reduce congestion by removing bike lanes and preventing new ones from being constructed (which is absurd), but the majority of the bill has nothing to do with that. The bill is really about building more highways (which will increase congestion, as has been proven time and time again) while avoiding environmental laws and allowing for land expropriation at low prices with no recourse for the land owners. This seems once again to be a handout to developers and is an awful waste of taxpayer money while offering no advantages to said taxpayers. I am firmly against this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nI am a home owner (and a bicycle enthusiast) in Guelph.  I felt great trepidation and frustration when I read details about this \"bill\".\nAt this moment, I am writing from Portugal where my wife and I are spending a few months.  We are living in the Algarve, in a town of approximately 25,000 people.  We have no car, we only have our bikes and public transit (trains, buses, Uber taxis).  Biking here (and in other parts of Europe) is a real pleasure using bike paths, trails and bike lanes.  Of course, it is also necessary to bike on roads from time to time, however the drivers here are very respectful and careful  around bikes and pedestrians.\nI am saddened that Ontario seems to be driving in the opposite direction and threatening the ability for the population to safely and adequately use bicycles as a means of transportation. There should be additions to this bill that outline how the province will replace and or add bike lanes.  I think it is obvious that bicycles and busy roads/streets are not a good mix, but let's find some alternatives that still provide bikers a safe and adequate network.\nThank you,\n"

        "comment": "I hope the Ontario Government eliminates the bike lanes on major streets and avenues in Toronto.  This has been a nightmare for business and driving around the city.  I no longer spend money in Toronto, where I live, but leave the city to get things done, go to restaurants and parks.  The bike lanes in my opinion make things more dangerous on the streets. Frustrated drivers do not drive better. As a pedestrian in Toronto, I am also afraid to cross the street.  Never seen such traffic before, all because there are not enough lanes for cars to go through and everyone is pushing through to get through the intersection or turn right or left.  Just horrendous. Bike lanes are fine, but on adjacent streets where there is no major traffic. The vast majority of bikers do not obey traffic rules, that is the simple truth. I hope the Ontario Government gets rid of these bike lanes for good. We have a lot of problems in the city due to traffic above ground, and underground. These bikers bring on their dirty bikes into the subway during rush hour. They dirty our clothes and take up space for riders. I saw a woman unable to move her baby carriage because a bike was blocking it, she missed her stop. Further to this the return back to the office initiative by companies is increasing the problem. There is too much traffic, with many working from home, now if they return to the office full time, you will get even more traffic in the subways and on the streets.  For many people with health issues or age, riding the bike on the streets of Toronto is not an option, they need to be in their cars due to disability or health challenges. Or take the subway and not worry about bikes getting them stuck unable to leave, or dirty them. Please get rid of the bike lanes, and get the city moving again! Police officers should also be encouraged to ticket the bike riders since most of them break the rules of the road.\n"
