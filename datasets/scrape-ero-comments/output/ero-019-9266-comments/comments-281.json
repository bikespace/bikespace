        "comment": "Traffic congestion has economic impacts. It is making our housing crisis worse. It causes people to lose time and money commuting long distances over long hours.\nBuilding a new highway will not solve our traffic congestion issues, due to induced demand. Building a new highway while cutting the need for environmental review is even more irresponsible.\nWhat is required to solve traffic congestion, is to build non-car infrastructure. The bike lanes on Bloor and University are good examples of such safe infrastructure that encourages bike usages. Do not tear up the bike lanes. Do not build the new highway. Our tax dollars needs to be directed at infrastructure projects that actually take cars off the road, by incentivizing other modes of transportation.\n"

When Provincial policy encroaches on Municipal authority we are headed in the wrong direction.  I am sorry Queens park is not closer to Etobicoke, but this is just shameful.\n"

The Ontario government is not in charge of Toronto's bike lanes - that is a municipal issue. Bike lanes have been proven to reduce conflict between motor vehicles and getting rid of bike lanes will just force cyclists into mixed traffic, creating more delays and making roads less safe for everyone.\nOntario's new tag line is Open for Business. There is plenty of evidence that supports the fact that bike lanes are good for small business.\nGET YOUR HANDS OFF OUR BIKE LANES.\n"

The province does not have the technical staff to make a decision about optimizing moving city residents around in their own City. The province should be prioritizing moving people safely and efficiently, or back off and let the City do its job. This bill is a waste of time and money, something that the current government seemingly prides itself on.\n"

The remit of the provincial goevrenmet is too broad in its scope to be knowledgeable about all city needs across the entire province while municipal governments are uniquely well positioned to speak to this.  This is a blatant overreach by a government that woud rather regulate bike lanes than do its job on healthcare, education and consumer and environmental protection and other things the province is actually responsible for. Do the job you were elected to do, not the job of Toronto City Council.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is removing accessibility to people who can't afford cars and who cannot afford to take public transit that is almost never reliable and impacts their work. Of all the major cities I have visited, Toronto is so far behind in safety (bike lanes save lives), environmental impact and accessibility. Everything Ford has done to this city has been for his own benefit and impacts Torontonians in a negative way. Bike lanes save lives, money and promote tourism.\n"

The environmental implications of this bill are an increase in vehicular traffic on the streets in question, which will result in a net increase in GHG emissions, thereby accelerating global warming, albeit to a miniscule extent. The increase in vehicular traffic will also result in an increase in the release of carcinogenic byproducts of incomplete combustion. Clearly a net negative for the environment and the populace.\n"

        "comment": "It's already been proven in Europe that bike lanes do not contribute to vehicle congestion. I find it appalling that the Conservative government refuses to listen to experts or acknowledge actual data on this subject. Sadly it seems this government has a record of this during their time in office. To quote your transportation Minister, common sense dictates you should listen to experts and data. Removal of bike lanes will result in increase of deaths. This is a probable result with the government removing various aspects of driver's tests. If you think your actions of removing bike lanes will increase your election chances, you're sadly mistaken. As well, removing bike lanes will not solve congestion issues as you will find out. All that being said, I myself am a driver, not a cyclist.\n"

        "comment": "The Province of Ontario should not be regulating bike lanes. The decision to build them should belong to the cities and their elected representatives who are better in a position to make the right choices for their direct constituents, not Gvt of Ontario officials.\nStudies have shown how bike lanes actually reduce traffic, see https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319. The idea of removing brand new bike lanes not only makes absolutely zero sense but also would be a costly affair and will make the traffic even more terrible than it is, especially during these operations. This will lead to having more cars, traffic and accidents on the roads. Not mentioning the huge waste of tax payers money. Has the Gvt of Ontario considered that this money could actually be spent to support public transportation initiatives instead? Has the Gvt of Ontario considered that many people are too poor to own a car and have absolutely no choices, but the use of a bicycle to commute to the city to work? The roads belong to everybody, not just to the people who can afford to own cars. I pay my taxes, and a big chunk of this money goes into building roads. As a bike commuter,myself I need these roads to be safe. Sharing roads between their various users should be a priority.\nIn a world where we know that climate change is principally driven by the use of fossil fuels, increasing the number of cars on the road is not the solution. Having more bike lanes encourage more bikers to leave their cars alone, and help reduce fuel consumption. Building bike lanes should be given top priority, not discouraged. The Gvt's decision to remove bike lanes in Toronto in particular, would be a grave mistake and I hope this bill never passes. In addition, more cyclists will die as the result of this bill. Please stop.\n"

Closing bike lanes for important bike routes in Toronto such as Bloor street is unconscionable and blind to the most basic of transportation rights, which include choosing active transportation. This act will make me very angry and convert me from a passive mode to an active mode of protest against this government.\n"

        "comment": "I don\u2019t need to repeat the facts that you are undoubtedly aware of. In every case, bike lanes have resulted in minimal impact on automobile traffic, increased use of environmentally beneficial forms of transport, economic benefits for local businesses, and better safety for all road users (not just people on bikes). Of the six people on bikes killed so far this year, none were killed where a bike lane was available.\nInstead, here are some questions for you to think about:\n1) when (not if) automobile congestion continues to worsen and travel times increase, will you admit your mistake and re-install the bike lanes you removed?\n2) when (not if) businesses along bike lanes that have been removed see an economic downturn, will you offer financial supports to offset this loss?\n3) when (not if) people are killed where you prevented bike lanes from being installed or you had them removed, will you sit with their families in their grief? Will you join the inevitable memorial rides?\n"
